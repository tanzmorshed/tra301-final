","I watched this by accident. I was looking for another movie, a comedy about a man who thinks he's a character in a novel (which turns out to be STRANGER THAN FICTION). Comedy, Jim Carrey, I thought this had to be it. I was wrong, and boy, am I glad I goofed.<br/><br/>Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, a fairly ordinary-seeming man, an animal control officer whose wife Aggie (played by Virginia Madsen) happens to buy him what seems to be the only copy of a self-published novel, THE NUMBER 23. But as Walter reads the book, the story of a homicide detective named Fingerling, he finds the character reminding him of himself. As he reads of the character Fingerling's descent into obsession and madness, he becomes increasingly disturbed himself, and goes hunting for the pseudononymous author, determined to find out what it all means. The answer uncovers a dark secret involving a murder committed over a decade ago, and alters the lives of Walter and his family permanently.<br/><br/>I won't say more, it would give away too much, but I found this wonderfully acted, beautifully written, and altogether involving. Carrey excellently plays both Walter Sparrow and Dec. Fingerling (in scenes from the novel shown as Carrey reads it), Madsen shines as loving housewife Aggie and novel character Fabrizia, and the supporting players turn in excellent performances, particularly Lynn Collins as the novel character Suicide Blond. The photography is frequently dark and threatening, which fits the plot, the sets are marvelous, and the climax is perfect.<br/><br/>I hope Carrey does more serious roles. This movie proves he's not just a funny rubber face."

","9/11 2001, 9+11+2+1= 23, JFK was killed on November 22, 1963 2+2=4 and 1+9+6+3=19 and 19+4= 23, Caesar was stabbed 23 times, and so on so forth.<br/><br/>Whether you think it's a coincidence or not it's still pretty cool and Joel Schumacher's the Number 23 wouldn't have been half as interesting without his knowledge.<br/><br/>The film follows Walter (Jim Carey) as his life starts to be consumed paranoia as he claims the number 23 is haunting him. He comes to this conclusion whilst reading a book, the Number 23 which he draws parallels with the main character's upbringing and his own childhood. The only problem being, said main character a detective Fingerling kills his lovely girlfriend. As everything in the book already mirrors Walters past, why shouldn't it mirror his future also? Worried that he'll kill his wife, Walter attempts to track down the author before it's too late.<br/><br/>Though it's easy to throw insults at Schumacher (Batman and Robin anyone?) he is good at thrillers being at the helm of Falling Down and Phone Booth. Here he delivers again. True, the ending may be a little drawn out and may not be to everyone's taste, however Carey's performance is once again proof that the rubber faced actor can indeed, wellact. It's just a shame that with every serious performance by Carey, critics scrutinise his performance because it isn't comedy. Have they seen the Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine.people? Carey can act. And Schumacher can direct, the only problem here is the plot isn't that strong, with the twist maybe feeling a little anticlimactic. Still it's an enjoyable film and may have you looking for the number 23 yourself when you leave the cinema."
"falkar","6","260","379","24 February 2007"," Watchable, not Wonderful
","There has been a great deal of critical scorn directed at 'The Number 23', which almost made me rethink my decision to see it, despite finding the concept very enticing, being impressed by the promotional materials, and generally liking Joel Schumacher as a director (yes, Batman and Robin was awful, but he's directing some very good films like The Client, Phone Booth and The Lost Boys) And after seeing the finished product, I find myself asking why the knives are out for the film. Now, I'm not saying this is a brilliant film, because it isn't. It's rather easy to guess the plot twists, the script does tend to patronise the viewer and the final segment of the film casually abandons the central premise in favour of a more generic 'mystery' storyline. But I found quite a few things to like about the movie, such as strong performances from Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen, very stylish direction and (for most of the movie)a genuine undercurrent of tension as the events unfold. It's not going to be remembered as a highlight on the careers of anyone involved, but if you enjoyed conspiracy theory novels such as The Da Vinci Code or shows like the X-Files, you are more likely to see past the critics and enjoy this film. <br/><br/>Final Score 6 (which is 2x3)/10"
"Fever","8","94","131","6 September 2007"," freaky and cool
","The trouble with many actors that do only a particular type of film, is that once they go outside of their box, it's just too weird. This is true to Jim Carrey. We've become so accustomed to his comedy flicks that this throws us off guard. I kept waiting for him to crack jokes, but they never came. This is a true drama/thriller that keeps you guessing until the end.<br/><br/>Carrey plays a man who starts reading a book that more and more sound like it was written just for him. Then strange occurrences of the number 23 keep popping up and the story gets weirder and weirder. But trust me, stick with it--the twist is a jaw dropper.<br/><br/>I have to say it was a bit odd to see Carrey in the sex scenes-- I kept waiting for him to jump up and say ""ssssssmokin!!!"" I thought overall it was a great movie."
"samseescinema","6","119","175","21 February 2007"," It's a fine two-act movie. But that third act
","The Number 23 reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>Psychological thrillers are a tough gig. You need an ending. The build-up, the suspense, the rising action, all that squirmy paranoia, it's easy enough to build. It's the ending that's the tricky part. Films like Memento do it right; films like Fight Club, too. Their twist, the unraveled knot of anxiety that splays out in explanation and relief, comes with another bulge of knots; it leaves you breathless and troubled, disturbed if you're lucky. But without the ending, without the final flick in the nose and punch in the gut, a psycho-thriller is just a bunch of untied shoelaces. <br/><br/>This is the affliction born to The Number 23. It's a fine two-act movie. But that third actwith the climax all flaccid and the end a noiseless wheeze, it leaves us with that let-down feeling of something promising turned instantly to a sham. I won't give the ending away, but suffice it to say that it's summed up by the word ""typical."" Commonplace is the ending. And commonplace is somewhere The Number 23 has no business being.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is a good one; a fine looking few rolls of celluloid, in fact. Jim Carrey plays the lead, still rounding off the sharper edges of his comedy and reminding us happily of Tom Hanks' move from comedy to drama. He's a hopelessly likable actor paired gracefully with Virginia Madsen, who plays Carrey's wife and mother to his teenage son. The family lives comfortably under Agatha's (Madsen) cake shop and Walter's (Carrey) job as an animal control officer. The paranoia enters like a whisper, as feckless and unassuming as director Joel Schumacher can stand. <br/><br/>The famously melodramatic director is often thought of as the second-string choice for any theatrical film-making, just behind the dramatic grandmaster Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge!). Schumacher revels in colors and camera tricks, over-saturating and under-saturating his images until they're hardly recognizable. The effect here is controlled, but not empty of pizazz. <br/><br/>The book Agatha finds (or does it find her?) when waiting for Walter outside a used bookshop is ""The Number 23"" by Topsy Kretts. Walter opens the novel on his day off, gorging himself on the minutiae of its hardboiled detective hero and fantasizing himself in the lead role. Schumacher indulges Walter further, fancying ""The Number 23's"" Detective Fingerling as a slippery-haired Mr. Carrey in a cheap suit and a dry growl. Much of the story is actually told within the novel itself, with Fingerling getting lost in the numerology surrounding the number 23 and slipping towards the inevitability of murder. Back in reality, Walter is finding uncanny resemblances between Fingerling and himself. It's as if, he once mentions, the author knows him better than he does. Agatha writes it off as an effect of good literature, but reconsiders when she finds scribbled numerology on Walter's arm one morning with the underlined words ""Kill Her."" He's begun to see the number everywhere. It's in his name, his social security number, his birth date, and even the day he and Agatha first met. His paranoia, once a whisper, is now a screech, and he worries for the safety of his own family. <br/><br/>Stop there. Just stop the film, put down your popcorn and walk away. Because that's as good as The Number 23 will get. The bouncy humor, the family drama, the rise in paranoia, the fascination in 23, it all works up until here. But it's as if Screenwriter Fernley Phillips lost the thread. It was unraveling with speed and machismo, promising to tower upwards in a great final disturbance. But instead it turned inward and ricocheted blindly backwards. Instead of opening up the throttle and letting the number have real meaning and significance, Phillips turns the plot inward and shells up the climax with a muffled grunt. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"
"phoenix_slayer2001","10","179","278","3 March 2007"," A Great Surprise!
","After reading many of the reviews on here I had doubts about this movie. As I watched and the end was clearly in sight I was worried because many reviews on here said the ending was the worst part. However, in my surprised amazement it worked quite well. I liked how the movie doesn't seem to have a single plot as the movie rolls on, but I thought this is what made it great, keeping you guessing all the time.<br/><br/>Another great thing was the characters had very well defined personae. Each approaching the story with different views and not always doing the predictable thing.<br/><br/>What makes this movie even greater is the fact that it had such poor reviews because when you go to see a movie with high expectations and it doesn't live up to them it will always render a poor personal rating of the movie, but when the movie is given bad reviews or is overlooked and turns out well it seems much better.<br/><br/>Though the movie was quite good, it will probably have little affect on Jim Carrey's career simply because it is not his typical role and it is unlikely he will land another role like this one in a movie that is just as good."
"theLPgoonie","9","121","188","23 February 2007"," Carrey shines through, The Number 23 is a winner
","Isn't it funny that most of the people how had a problem with this movie and rated it badly can't explain why? And it's not just this movie, it's every bad review, everywhere. I just can't understand that. The only thing I see is people saying the ending was terrible, but not even explaining why they thought so. Weird...<br/><br/>So before you go and get all disappointed over the bad reviews, and ignore all of the 'OMG B3$T M0V!E EVAR!'s, here is the level-headed review you were looking for.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this, it was an all around good movie. It accomplished exactly what it set out to do, be an entertaining thriller. You will read all of these people talk about how it was so predictable and terrible, and yeah, if you are an avid movie goer, you will probably pick apart most of it like I did. But for the average movie goer? You'll love it.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey proves once again that he can pull off a serious role, just like he has before(Eternal Sunshine, Truman Show), and he really is the focus of the film. His performance makes this film possible, without it, blah. Virginia Madsen also does a great job as Carrey's wife, loving, protective, the whole sha-bang. There is also great chemistry throughout the film between Carrey, Madsen, and their 'son', Logan Lerman. This film successfully uses the entire family through the movie to a degree few movies can imitate.<br/><br/>And also, despite what others might say, you can feel a connection to Carrey's character, who becomes obsessed with the number 23. I doubt a number has ruined most of our lives, but there have been times everyone has been through were some weird coincidence seems to keep occurring, so Carrey's flight rings true.<br/><br/>When the film turns into a good murder mystery, you really get your dollars worth. Because this movie was meant to entertain. It was meant to be a popcorn flick. Not the 'Movie of the Year', and as such, it excels. Even the end of the film, when the great question is revealed, it is nice to see it all played out in front of you, and you can really start to see Carrey's inner struggle.<br/><br/>Some of the lines are way cheesy, and the acting by some of the supporting roles are passable at best. And there are times when Joel Schumacher reminds you of what kind of director he really is (Batman & Robin, D.C. Cab), but amazing cinematography and Carrey's performance, as well as the intriguing story/concept, pushes you past all of that.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: It is worth seeing on the silver screen, and unless you are way overly critical about things having to be the exact way you want them, you shouldn't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Because we all know that on the ride home, no matter what, you'll be adding up your phone number, or analyzing your birthday, to see if you are cursed as well.<br/><br/>I was born on the 23rd! Oh Noes!"
"Luigi Di Pilla","6","19","25","12 August 2007"," Average thriller with some open questions
","I knew when I bought THE NUMBER 23 on DVD that I haven't to expect too much after reading the critics on this link. I watched it with high attention till the end and I have to say that it worked on a fair level as an average thriller. There are some points in this film that weren't logic for me. Anyway, if you have really nothing to do this one offers many mysteries and puzzles to solve but not great suspense. There were perhaps some unnecessary bloody scenes. I was very positive surprised seeing Jim Carrey giving a great and respectable performance in a thriller. I cannot share some opinions that he was misplaced here because he has no doubt a great talent and I can imagine him in other roles of this genre. And director Joel Schuhmacher made finally a better movie than his last ones. Final number: 6/10."
"Overactor","8","139","237","23 February 2007"," A well written thought provoking story
","I went into this movie with the notion that I would be seeing another version of the Magestic. I was completely blown away. The visuals are stunning and once you get past Joel's use of the blurred past, you are captivated by his use of colors and imagery. The acting is also good, Carrey has his witty one liners which will please fans. I was captivated and fooled which means to me that there was good acting and writing.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8/10 due to the questions left by the twists. When you see it you will realize what I am talking about but other than that I do recommend this movie to anyone who loves psychological thrillers with twist endings.<br/><br/>P.s. don't see this because you like Jim Carrey...see it because you like the material."
"nuffin","10","194","348","25 February 2007"," This is an excellent movie.
","I watched this on release night and I have to say that it was awesome. The acting is great, the camera shots are great, and the story is great. I also loved the film noir style shots.<br/><br/>I feel that a majority of people posting negative comments about this movie (mostly before it was even out) are simply haters.<br/><br/>If you feel disappointed because this has Jim Carrey in it and it's not a comedy please do not be. Jim Carrey is an excellent actor and displays the dramatical emotion side of him very well in this movie, see also ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". But, of course, there is humor in the less dramatic parts of the movie.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend seeing this movie."
"theshadow908","7","40","64","26 February 2007"," Not bad, but it could have been better.
","The Number 23 tells the story of a man who starts to read a book called The Number 23, about a detective who begins to go crazy connecting the number 23 to everything, eventually ending with the detective committing murder. This scares the man because he finds a large amount of points in the book that mirror his own life. He himself begins to go crazy with the number, and as he reads on, he finds that there is more mystery involved with the book's origins than he could ever imagine. This is a well made, entertaining film, but it fell flat towards the end.<br/><br/>First off, this movie is made very well. The visual style of it is very dark and Gothic which was kind of cool. The scenes depicting what was happening in the book were awesome. They had a kind of surrealistic tone to them which was cool. It looked kind of like film noir which made it look really good. The movie was a pretty good mystery once the main character begins looking for a killer that's on the loose. Unfortunately, the movie just isn't that creepy. Some of the things said about 23 are a little chilling, but it just seems pushed and overused in some parts. This movie, like most of its kind, has a twist ending. Though I won't say what the big twist is, I suppose I can say without giving anything away for sure that it's a highly overused and clichéd twist ending that I was unable to find surprising due to the fact that I've seen it done so many times. In my opinion, the movie was pretty good right up until the last, oh let's say, 23 minutes.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's performance was surprisingly good. I usually don't like it when he plays a serious role, but because there was a few humorous points, this role seemed to suit him. His performance as the detective in the novel was actually really cool. Everybody else's performances were just okay.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a cool, well made movie that kind of fell apart in the end. There was definitely room for improvement.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"manendra-lodhi","8","18","26","30 July 2012"," Nice performance by Jim Carrey.
","It was a full time pass movie. You will not feel sleepy at any time. Just one simple idea of the film related to the number 23 was absurd. In whole of the movie Jim Carrey was shown obsessed with the number 23. And that he was relating everything in his life to that number but some comparisons were really absurd because you can apply a number of permutations and combinations to get to your number. And that was the weakest point in the film. Keeping that aside if you would look into the story than it is nice. Talking about the acting, Jim Carrey as Walter has certainly done his job properly but another thing that looked unnecessary was the involvement of his son – Robin , which was I think to make up the movie a little bit longer. He really had not much to do. The movie is watchable because of a nice performance by Jim Carrey however average was the script.<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""A recommended watch."""
"blackholepcs","10","278","515","23 February 2007"," Very excellent film, despite the reviews
","This movie was very well done. The acting was tight (though there are a few scenes that fall somewhat flat, as with any movie), the script was well written, and it is pretty spooky. This movie has great atmosphere, and Jim Carrey DOES show that he can be a GOOD serious/dramatic/non-slapstick actor.<br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of Virginia Madsen, but she plays her part pretty well, and is overall a credit to the film. Logan Lerman, who was excellent in Butterfly Effect, does a very good job in The Number 23, and is well on his way to becoming a big ticket actor.<br/><br/>I for one don't trust newspaper/television/magazine reviews of movies, because they tend to laud and tout and advertise and worship crap films with little or no story, horrible acting/directing/editing, and movies that are just plain boring as hell, even if the acting is good. They also despise/hate/put-down/trash movies that break molds on what they think an actor/director/producer SHOULD do. I think they only reason this movie is getting bad reviews is that the so-called reviewers are getting a case of diaper rash over Jim Carrey doing a non-Pet-Detecive-Almighty-Dumber-Liar movie.<br/><br/>If you like movies that have a plot, a storyline, good effects, great acting, excellent atmosphere, superb editing, great directing, great sound, and that is not full of itself or boring to the point of making Bridges of Madison County look like Die Hard, then go see this movie. Otherwise go stare at wet paint until it dries."
"rajdoctor","6","58","99","10 June 2007"," The Number 23
","I like Jim Carrey, not because he is a comedian, but because he emerged as a serious actor in attempting to select good roles that will give him the variety of dimensions to display his talent.<br/><br/>The story of the movie is about a happy married man Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) and his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) and son Robin (Logan Lerman). One day as a gift his wife presents him with a novel The Number 23. On reading it Walter realizes the similarities the novel has with his life. The novel turns out to be a thriller with a murder mystery. Walter gets engaged into the paranoia of number 23 and tries to find a running parallel in real life to identify the characters and solve the murder mystery. Like a detective Walter traces the murderer and unknown writer of the novel. One clue leads to another, and another  until the end, the real murderer is exposed. I won't tell you the secret. Just a clue that the novel is written by someone named Topsy Eret.<br/><br/>The narrative of the movie is a bit puzzling, and I think the Director Joel Schumacher must have intentionally worked on it that way. Why I say this is because after the movie got over, I had the urge to see the movie again to understand the early half properly, and get more clarity in why the story is told in this manner and how the events are unfolded. But will I go and see the movie again, not really.<br/><br/>The movie is good, but not brilliant. It eclipse on the fringe areas of brilliance but falls shorts due to its direction. In the past Joel Schumacher has struggled to make commercially successful movie even with a good storyline on his hand. Here too he flounders. The saving grace of this thriller is one and only  Jim Carrey, who carries the whole burden of this movie on his shoulder, and makes us believe in the magical number 23.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie, I remembered my Dad who has paranoia of number 5. The amazing past time my Dad and Mom together had was when they found ways to add, subtract, multiply and divide any number to arrive at an answer that was 5. It is a unique ability and obviously paranoia. But it is amusing.<br/><br/>The same paranoia has been presented here with a mysterious thriller storyline. To some extend the director achieves success to telling us this novel story of number 23.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey looks haggard with age, but has played the character brilliantly. Virginia Madsen and Logan Lerman have acted decently but nothing worth historic to mention here.<br/><br/>Go and see it if you are a Jim Carrey fan or if you have a fascination for NUMBERS, both ways you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>(Stars 6 out of 10)"

","In a word, god-awful... too many plot holes.. um, yeah... Who takes their kid to dig up a dead body in the middle of the night? and what's up with his wife stealing the skeleton.. who does that? why, exactly did the shrink stab himself in the neck? and that whole dog thing.. i mean, really! Having Sparrow narrate from the beginning also just completely destroyed the suspense for me.. i mean, if he's narrating the story, clearly he's lived to tell it, so there's no chance of him getting offed.. where's the suspense there? <br/><br/>Of course, you expect plot holes in a film like this. But, there are so many I lost track of the story completely because of them. What kind of name is Fingerling? Or Toppsy? Why did the wife dig up the body? (Who does that?) or go into that crazy spooky asylum alone? and where'd all those candles come from? Why does the writer have his PO BOX in the freaking book??? I mean come on... And the book just happens to find its way to the bookstore next door to the wife's bakery?? Way too convenient... Oh and Happy Birthday Honey, here's a book about a serial killer.. What a THOUGHTFUL gift! The book is like 20 pages long, half of which are blank, and it takes him freaking FOREVER to read it. If he's truly obsessed with this book, wouldn't he have read it all in one shot?<br/><br/>A bit convenient for him to bump into his future wife (carrying a cake!) about 23 seconds after being released from a mental hospital.. how old was he playing? 36?? <br/><br/>Was I the only one at the end rooting for the bus to actually run the guy down? Not good when you're rooting for the protagonist to bite it in the end.<br/><br/>It seems like this was written by committee.. I imagine that the first draft probably had nothing to do with the number 23... It seems as if they needed a gimmicky hook to bait the audience into thinking there was some supernatural thing going on, when in the end it really didn't seem to have anything to do with anything. I mean, I wasn't expecting the Godfather or anything, but everything about this film was a total let-down. Without all the numerology stuff, this movie could actually have been OK, instead of some hackneyed Se7en knockoff.<br/><br/>Not scary, unintentionally hilarious and otherwise a total snoozer."
"ajaws4ever","10","347","694","30 January 2007"," WOW! OMG! This is an awesome movie!
","I just saw a sneak peek of this movie at the mall yesterday and I couldn't believe it. I thought this would be an awesome movie since the first time I saw the trailer, but I was wrong. The Number 23 was not an awesome movie...IT WAS UTTERLY FANTASTIC! And it was scary, too. The plot line is very well thought out and unsettling, and the characters are very complex in their own ways.<br/><br/>The Number 23 is about an animal control officer named Walter Sparrow, that receives a birthday gift from his wife, Agatha Sparrow. The birthday gift is a book that's called, 'The Number 23'. But the first word he reads from the book changes his once placid existence into a whirlpool of psychological torture and mayhem that could possibly lead him to his own death and the deaths of his loved ones. 'The Number 23' book Walter receives is a chilling murder mystery that seems to mirror Walter's life in dark and uncontrollable ways. The life of the book's main character, a brooding detective named Fingerling (also played by Jim Carrey), is filled with moments that copy Walter's own history. And as the world of the book starts to come alive, Walter becomes infected by the most frightening part of it: Fingerling's dark obsession with the number 23. This obsession permeates the book, and soon the book begins to control Walter in dark ways. He soon starts to see the number everywhere in his own life and becomes haunted by the fact that he is damned to commit the same horrific crime as Fingerling--murder. Now Walter is on a dangerous quest to understand the mysteries of the book. If he can unlock the dark power of the number 23, he may just be able to change his future.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is awesome. The use of colors: reds, browns, and blacks really set the hazy and unsettling tone of the movie. Also, the Fingerling sequences were really hazy and dark and they make you seem as though you're floating in the depths of hell.<br/><br/>Joel Schumacher, the director, finally did something original, and this is a movie that is way better than his badly directed, 'Batman and Robin'. He finally made an improvement. And this is his 23rd project...just wanted to say.<br/><br/>Virginia Madsen (Agatha Sparrow, Fabrizia) got better than her parts in Firewall and Candyman. Her acting in Firewall was better than in Candyman, and her acting in The Number 23 was better than both movies.<br/><br/>Everyone else was quite good, too.<br/><br/>Oh, and, the opening credits were unbelievably unforgettable! The music is so unsettling and creative. The opening credits for 'The Number 23' is the brother of the opening credits of 'Se7en'. Absolutely awesome!<br/><br/>All in all, a really creepy and unsettling (and funny, for the first half of the movie) that gives you the chills after you walk out of the theater.<br/><br/>Official MPAA rating: R: Violence, Disturbing Images, Sexuality, and Language <br/><br/>My MPAA rating: R: Violence, Disturbing Images, Sexuality, and Some Strong Language <br/><br/>My Canadian rating: 14A: Violence, Mature Theme, Sexually Suggestive Scenes"
"The_Defiant1","1","61","110","3 March 2007"," Lame
","This movie has no respect for the viewer's time. It takes a 15 minute story and stretches it into 95 minutes. In order to achieve this, they have to use a very slow narration and have everyone run around with some implausible frantic angst. By the time this movie showed anything interesting in the plot, I just didn't care. The problem is not in the acting, but instead the pacing. The story is just weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role is just out of place. His style of humor is not generic, so he comes across as a watered down version of himself. The number 23 causes great grief and frustration to the people in the story, but the justification for this is never logical. At most it's just mildly interesting. Jim Carrey has far more ability in a serious role than this movie reveals. Don't waste your money seeing this in the theater. Rent this movie if you've had problems sleeping. If you are still wide awake after 10 minutes, then you liked it more than I did. I was not fond of the lighting and artistic aspects of the film making either. A lot of passive visual eye candy was thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects and it did little to enhance the already weak story."

There is a dog named Ned that causes some problems and I think it's all his fault...so does Jim Carey. God only knows why Virginia Madsen took this role...this is a career sinker. I think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 year olds. And that adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for 8 and 10 years olds which also adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for really dumb 23 year olds. Or maybe really dumb 32 year olds because that's 23 in reverse. Or maybe 46 year olds would enjoy it because half of that is 23.

A mysteriously psychic book that ""Is just like my life"" and supposedly like everyone else's (with murders, suicides, strange sex...Oh yeah, we all have those lives, don't we?) leads our ""hero"" into a convoluted trail of trying to free himself of obsession...no, finding a murderer...no solving a mystery...no getting a very large paycheck for a very lousy job.<br/><br/>It is painfully obvious that the writer thought he was writing something wonderfully deep, and painfully obvious that Carrey thought he was finding something to express his hidden serious side and make his dramatic acting ""bones"", but the result is just...well, painful.<br/><br/>I actually sat through the entire thing (though I must admit I TIVO'd it and could only take small doses at a time to avoid nausea, not from the violence but from the lousy ""plot"", such as it was) because I thought it would have a wonderful plot twist to somehow bring it all together like ""12 Monkeys"", one of my favorite films. That film is what this film dreams of being, a writing masterpiece where many pieces of a puzzle are mysteriously brought together and you gasp and say ""Ah Ha!"" at the same time. But the only resemblance between this and 12 Monkeys is that they both have numbers in the title and this is more like something monkeys...well, never mind. There is no such hope. This film which actually has humor in the beginning and makes you think it's going to be a comedy can never make up its mind what kind of movie it is. And you will wonder why you ever thought it was one.<br/><br/>Avoid it. In fact, scold anyone you know who admits seeing it. The single clever piece in the entire film is the last second, after the live action when you get a quote from Scripture that may have given the author the idea for the thing.

","Despite the critical negativity surrounding its initial release, I was quite excited when I heard that The Number 23 was coming out on DVD soon; I was strangely drawn to the promises of trashy, pseudo-intellectual entertainment made by the trailer and its absurd yet curiously intriguing plot. Such promises are unfortunately unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) receives a book for his birthday. As he reads, he notices some parallels between the life of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling, and his own. Not an uncommon experience, many readers would argue. However, little details and numerical coincidences pop up more and more, and soon Walter's simple life is consumed by the novel.<br/><br/>Soon, the lives of Walter and Fingerling blend together, allowing for some acting flourishes from Carrey as his typically oddball character descends into one of his typically neurotic characters at a questionably fast pace. His performance is well contrasted by Virginia Madsen, who takes on the role of his wife, and for the most part, the audience, as she criticises Walter's small revelations. Having read the book, she admits ""I didn't get it"". The idea is that by the end, we'll come around. But we don't.<br/><br/>For some reason, at around the halfway point, it lunges forward as if the middle act has been left on the cutting room floor, perhaps in a bid to keep the running time at an ADD-friendly 90 minutes. Carrey is suddenly a lunatic, despite being a little over halfway through the novel at best, and 23 turns into a Scooby-Doo-ish murder mystery as the family jump in the van and track down an escaped murderer. It just falls apart and leaves you wondering what might have been.<br/><br/>The expository ending ties up the loose ends re-establishes some coherency on the disorder, but nevertheless, the film ends with its biggest question left unanswered: if your surname was Sparrow, why would you name your son Robin?"

","The Number 23 is directed by Joel Schumacher and written by Fernley Phillips. It stars Jim Carrey, Virginia Madsen, Logan Lerman, Danny Huston, Lynn Collins and Rhona Mitra. Music is by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Matthew Libatique.<br/><br/>Walter Sparrow (Carrey) becomes obsessed with a novel that he comes to believe is written about him. As his obsession increases and the number 23 comes into play, the similarities arise and danger lurks at every corner. <br/><br/>Topsy Kretts at A Novel Fate.<br/><br/>A tough film to recommend with confidence, as the most divisive critical notices would suggest, The Number 23 is for some a genuinely intriguing movie with style to burn. The complex narrative structure, visual styles, gumshoe type narration and nods to classic era noir movies, certainly makes this more of interest to noir fans than your average horror/thriller seeker. The premise of the 23 enigma is quite a hook, especially for the conspiracy theorists out there, while the blending of paranoia and distortion of reality really puts a bleakness over the plotting to keep it edgy. Unfortunately much of it doesn't hold up under scrutiny, big leaps of faith are needed and the finale fizzles out in a whimper. But mostly it's thought provoking for the right reasons.<br/><br/>Suicide Blonde.<br/><br/>Visually it's a most arresting piece. The present world inhabited by Walter and his family is filled with bold reds and greens, while his flashback world, where he is detective Fingerling, is full of oblique decor, high contrast lighting and skewed angles. Carrey came in for some criticism, but he sits the role(s) well, especially as Walter's mind starts to fracture. Everyone else is up to scratch with par performances, while Williams provides a score that mixes eerie foreboding with the rumbles of psychological unease. There's much strange about the whole production, a sort of trippy/feverish dream where the editing jolts you out of the comfort zone and begs you to be involved in solving the mystery of The Number 23.<br/><br/>Not for everyone, obviously, and it asks a lot of forgiveness for its faults. Yet there is a better film here than I was led to believe it was. Perhaps for you as well? 7/10"

","Hrmm... where to start.<br/><br/>Matthew Libatuque is about as good of a cinematographer as there is working, and for the visually inclined out there, this one is a feast.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey.... hrmm... Jim Carrey. I like it when comic actors play dark, as long as it's done well. He does this one well, but he's still the wrong actor for the role. There's a difference between being dark and playing dark, and unfortunately, he was just playing. This one was SCREAMING for Colin Farrell, but instead we get Jim Carrey proving that he really can act.<br/><br/>But as for the movie, I can simply say it's a mixed bag, and the fault there goes to Joel Schumacher. He gets credit for being a mainstream director who likes the dark material, but once again (*ahem* 8mm) he either doesn't understand the material, or isn't willing to stick up for it's integrity in the face of his big studio bosses. Either way, David Fincher could have done wonders with this, or Christopher Nolan, or any of the other directors who have a talent with solid, dark material.<br/><br/>The ending is the ultimate fault of the movie. Obviously, some suspension of disbelief is required for something like this, but the ending so strains credulity that it ruins some otherwise noteworthy work in the rest of the film. There are so many excellent directions this could have gone, but Schumacher opted for clever, and that relegates this one to little more than a renter."
"frankwhat","5","20","41","3 March 2007"," ""The Number 23""  Interesting Concept but Lackluster Result
","I had heard terrible things about this movie before watching it so luckily I went into the viewing with low expectations. While it wasn't as bad as some people were making it out to be, it was nothing special either. What boggled my mind is that there was actually potential to make a quality film here but it wasn't utilized. This was stupid since there's so many historical experiences and anecdotes that deal with the number 23 theory. The historic ones make sense but the formulas conjured up for the movie were absolutely ridiculous. They completely overlooked any real laws of mathematics and apparently the theorist could apply any rule he wanted to over and over again to obtain the results he was looking for.<br/><br/>However there was some good to this disappointing feature. I liked how a main concept was that an obsessive person could formulate anything because they'll keep going until they see what they want to see. This essentially shows that most conspiracy theories have probably came to being through acts of compulsion and really aren't based off of concrete facts. The twist ending was also fairly original but due to the heavy saturation of twist endings audiences have been bombarded with these past five years, it didn't really have much of an effect on me. As for acting, Jim Carrey was very impressive and he really carried the weight of the film on his shoulders. Even though he's often overlooked by the industry each year, he can really take on an incredible dramatic role and is probably the best actor out of all the comics to this day. He also teaches his son sound moral judgments throughout and exemplifies what a good father should be. All the other performers were suitable but no one else really stood out.<br/><br/>Joel Schumacher has turned out to be such a heinous filmmaker that it'll be forever beyond me why studios keep hiring him to direct. ""The Number 23"" was supposed to be suspenseful, and it was really anything but. The murder mystery aspect didn't hold my attention and I really could've cared less what was happening in those regards. The plot was confusing and the beginning contained so much unnecessary filler that it seemed to go on for way longer than its runtime. I absolutely hated the Fingerling scenes and thought they were pure drivel. They exemplified absurdity in its purest form and it was if they came out of some cheesy made-for-TV erotica flick on a late night premium channel.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no way I could recommend to anyone that this is a movie they should catch in the theater and hesitate to do so for even a rental. Unless you're still one of the unduly shrinking Carrey fan base or you enjoy any kind of paranoia theme there is no matter how dull it is along the way, then you'll do better off checking something else out and not wasting your time with this muck. This was a perfect example of an ending that puts together a twist just for the sake of having a twist, and it really showed. Connections were made that were obviously purely coincidental and no justice was done to an intriguing question that has plagued man over time. If only the film was only 23 minutes long, that's one enigma I could've lived withand it would've been a better movie for it too."

","The Number 23 is a psychological thriller film written by Fernley Phillips and directed by Joel Schumacher. The film features Jim Carrey, Virginia Madsen, Danny Huston, and Logan Lerman. The plot involves an obsession with the 23 enigma, an esoteric belief that all incidents and events are directly connected to the number 23, some permutation of the number 23, or a number related to 23. It is Carrey's first leading role in a suspense thriller.<br/><br/>Walter Sparrow is a middle-aged dogcatcher whose wife Agatha has bestowed him with an obscure mystery novel detailing the investigation launched by a tough-talking gumshoe named Fingerling whose every move seems to be overshadowed by the enigmatic eponymous number. After noting a series of alarming parallels shared between the fictional detective and himself, Walter is quickly drawn in to the story as the hard-boiled private investigator murders raven-wigged moll Fabrizia and pins the crime on her unsuspecting lover. Back in the real world, fiction seems to merge with reality as Walter and Agatha's close friend Isaac begins to ingratiate himself ever deeper into the couple's relationship and Walter begins experiencing a gruesome series of visions in which he violently murders an unfaithful Agatha. His mind fast descending into a dark and violent whirlwind of madness, Walter enlists the aid of Agatha and the pair's adolescent son Robin in seeking out the author of the mysterious tome and uncovering the sinister truth behind the so-called ""23 enigma.""<br/><br/>Jim Carrey as a schizophrenic murderer isn't convincing in this melodramatic film.Also,the story is half-baked. What makes it funny though is that Carrey's portrayal of a mentally disturbed person is what makes it comedic. Long, contemplative stares, and over-dramatized acting makes him a clichéd and uninteresting character rather than one odd enough to engage viewers.In addition to that,it is clumsy and mostly confusing."

While waiting for him, Agatha buys a detective book with a novel about the mystery around the number 23 in a bookstore as a gift to Walther.

There are stunning sequences, like for example when the boy meets the widow dead on her bed, or the meeting of Fingerling with Suicide Blonde. Jim Carrey is perfect and Virginia Madsen is still a very beautiful and sexy woman and has a great performance.

","""Fate"" leads Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.<br/><br/>The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br/><br/>Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled ""The Number 23"" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.<br/><br/>The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. Rating 3/10"

Why does the lighting and camera work look like an ""over stylized to make up for lack of content"" TV show? Those dream/detective sequences are a joke - how can you take these scenes seriously? They are the biggest flaw of all. You know, Jim is supposed to be playing a dramatic role - but i'm not so sure! This movie is about paranoia so then why is every little detail all wrapped up into a neat little basket at the end? There is such a loss of ability to be interested/involved with these characters because they are portrayed so generically.<br/><br/>When i heard about the concept and subject matter of this film i was very interested to see it.

","Yet another example of a poor film boasting a good trailer. The Number 23 fails on almost every level. Joel Schumacher (widely regarded as a hack with a few fluke hits) just doesn't have the talent to take an already asinine story and make it into an entertaining film.<br/><br/>None of this really is the fault of Jim Carrey. But if he wants to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor then he really ought to choose scripts better than this. I can't articulately describe to you just how stupid The Number 23 is. Normally I would say see it for yourself and find out. But, even at 98 minutes, this film felt like it would never end.<br/><br/>Carrey is a dog-catcher who is given a raggedy book on his birthday called The Number 23. A book which claims that this evil number rules the world and all the logic and circumstances within it. The main character of the book goes insane because 23 is everywhere. As you do. But Carrey recognizes his life in this book and is drawn into its stupidness...I mean its mystery.<br/><br/>This thin, confusing, misjudged and flatly handled premise gives way to further plot developments, all narrated with heavy exposition by Carrey. And it's so, so boring. And once the plot twist finally comes it contradicts what has come before it and totally doesn't add up. You'll never see a film so desperate to be clever yet end up being so moronic.<br/><br/>The one thing I liked about #23 is that there is a nice, lonely atmosphere in the small town setting with weird perpetual sunset in all scenes. But it's still not enough to dig the rest of it out of the grave it's already made for itself and I'm afraid that 1/10 is a perfectly justifiable rating.<br/><br/>Carrey, I am disappointed. As much as I do like seeing you expand your range, this really was a poor choice."

","Lowly dogcatcher Walter Sparrow has his life changed when he comes into contact with a self-published novel by a mysterious author. Reading it, Walter finds eerie parallels between his life and the writer (Topsy Kretts  no, really) but more than that he finds that the fictional observations may well be true. The character in the novel claims to have stumbled across the evil power of the number 23  finding it woven into all aspects of life. Walter starts out just interested in the story but as he looks into this claim he finds it to be true and quickly becomes obsessed with getting to the bottom of it all.<br/><br/>I like a good conspiracy-type film I do. My cynicism and bitterness sets me up to easily accept something much bigger than me ultimately working against me in ways that I cannot ever defeat. Sadly The number 23 is not a ""good"" film by any means and, although it all looks slick and professional, it is really very weak when you take away all the protection of budget and packaging and look at it in the cold light of day. In fact, it doesn't even take the cold light of day to expose 23 for what it is because it is hard to take it seriously when you are watching it. The problems are all the way from the very idea through the script because it never convinces and indeed scenes where the number is discussed (""32  or 23 reversed"") are just ridiculous and I was never able to get passed this and get into the mystery any more than this.<br/><br/>It is a shame because deep down there is a nice idea here and I like the gradual twist but the delivery doesn't make the most of it. Perhaps lost in the silliness of it, the film cannot make the number thing work, even when it sort of becomes a side issue (in some small way). It all looks good and I thought the visual design of the film was quite impressive  as was the device of having Walter putting himself within the novel as he read it; not only does it make things easier for the viewer but it also points to the root of the obsession. Carrey is actually OK here despite my worry that he would be really badly miscast. He works and even while the audience is snickering, one can believe that at least he believes if even if nobody else does. Madsen was better than I expected although generally she was best ""within"" the novel bits. Huston hangs round the edges failing to do much though.<br/><br/>Overall then this is a professional enough film that is slickly put together and has potential in every way if only some other device other than that bl00dy stupid number had been selected as the focus. As it is, the idea of destructive obsession is lost as many viewers will be too busy shouting ""nonsense"" at the screen while the script tries and fails to grip the audience with a thriller based on such tosh."
"sullibrandon","1","16","33","10 April 2007"," A boringly gimmicky ""thriller""
","The Number 23 is a pretty terrible wreck of a movie, one that fails to accomplish anything it sets out to do. It doesn't even fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category - most of the time I was disgusted by what I saw on screen. I wasn't laughing. I was too depressed to laugh. Laboring through this movie was more of a chore than a ride; I felt like I was mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, which is actually the exact place this movie belongs. A trash can.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, a dogcatcher who is unwittingly drawn into the world of a mysterious novel called ""The Number 23,"" written by the unbelievingly stupid pseudonym ""Topsy Kretts."" As Sparrow delves increasingly further into the novel, he finds the number 23 everywhere, and an increasingly disturbing similarity to the psychotic main character of the novel.<br/><br/>The film's most obvious flaw is the pathetically gimmicky subject matter. The Number 23 is indeed about The Number 23, but who the heck cares? A relatively exorbitant amount of screen time is devoted to characters spewing out arbitrary math problems that ""magically"" and ""mysteriously"" add up to 23. The main characters live at 1814. 18+1+4=23. When Sparrow's wife, Agatha, played by Virginia Madsen, says that it's stupid, the numbers are ""cleverly"" screwed around with until they add up to 23 again. 1+8+14=23. What about 1+8+1+4=14? How is that important? Or 181+4? Giving you a headache yet? It certainly gave me one. I spent an hour and a half watching people do fuzzy math.<br/><br/>The number gimmick and boring game aside, the movie suffers from a heavy-handed, plot-hole filled, unimaginative story as well. If handled properly, the whole ""number 23"" thing, though ludicrous in real life, could have worked within the fantasy world of the movie, yet the entire production takes itself too seriously and is too ignorant of its own flaws and failures that the movie collapses in on itself, a black hole reeking of attempted noir, thriller, and horror overtones. None of these work, for the film is neither stylish, thrilling, nor scary. Everything is just boring as we jump from one scene of Walter Sparrow spouting out random and arbitrary math to another of Fingerling, the main character in the book Sparrow reads, listing off endless numbers. It's all pointless. Plot holes are many and obvious too, and the fabricated, ludicrous, and telegraphed ending doesn't even attempt to cover them up. Rather, it just creates a whole bunch of new ones, which make the already extremely tangled up plot even more difficult to unravel. I didn't even try.<br/><br/>We all know Jim Carrey knows how to act dramatically. He's been in The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and more recently in the relatively disappointing Fun With Dick and Jane. The guy can act, and even though he may be a better comedian than a dramatic thespian, the talent and potential is definitely there. And as ruinous a vehicle as The Number 23 is, Jim Carrey could have made the film even a bit more than the rotting carcass it is. He gives a surprisingly unstable and chaotic performance as he shifts from persona to persona, and he doesn't do it in a good way. You may think, ""Well, he should be unstable - he's playing two different psychotic people"", but he does it in a pathetically inept and awkward manner. He never seems quite sure which character is which, and he makes the believability of Walter Sparrow as a character almost disappear. Supporting cast members, even the notable Virginia Madsen, doing nothing whatsoever to help the movie. Both Madsen and Carrey are even further crippled the by the canned, predictable, self-important, and laughably awkward dialogue. <br/><br/>So what does a gimmicky premise+a depressingly inconsistent performance from Carrey+a threadbare story full of holes equal? The Number 23. And by the time the movie is over, I'd thought of 97 better ways I could have spent my time. Hmm, wait, maybe that number thing doesn't work after all."

","Apparently, a massive head wound is the cure for homicidal tendencies, turning a murderous sociopath into a lovable and oafish dog catcher. Also (this ones for the ladies), it seems that the front gate of a psychiatric hospital is an overlooked hot spot for meeting potential mates. Those are just two of the approximately 23 absurdities we're supposed to accept for this movie to have any meaning. I love movies and I believed, as I'm assuming many Americans do (forgive me if I'm wrong), that Hollywood turned out the best product. I've come to learn how sadly naive and brainwashed I was and 2) how much more sophisticated European/Asian Cinema is in comparison to its American counterpart.<br/><br/>I watched this allegedly disturbing psychological ""thriller"" the night following a viewing of a Japanese movie called Suicide Club. As the camera faded on Walter Sparrow's happy little family enjoying some quality time around a prison visiting room table (not to mention the patronizing voice-over extolling the virtue of ""doing the right thing""), I suddenly had an epiphany. I had just finished watching a movie that left me feeling as though I'd just had a glass of water when I really wanted a beer. My thirst was sated, but it was strictly utilitarian. The premise was mildly interesting, but the story itself, with its innumerable ""coincidences"" (How do we explain her finding the book? We'll just say something like,""...Or did the book find her?."" They'll buy that), gaping plot holes (why did wifey take the skeleton?), predictability, and obligatory happy ending, turned out to be just another Hollywood hack job. Additionally, the casting of Jim Carrey was justwrong. At any moment, I felt he was capable of breaking into some shtick from one of his stupid comedies or In Living Color. Jim Carrey as a tattooed hard-boiled police detective who enjoys bondage and rough sex? Didn't buy it for a second.<br/><br/>You want disturbing? Deeply disturbing? Watch Suicide Club. The story surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 school girls. The film opens with a group of giggling high schoolers mulling about on a subway train platform. We then watch in horror as they line up, hold hands, and happily throw themselves in front of a fast moving commuter train. Needless to say, much chaos ensues. That's as far as I'm going to go with the story line because I encourage the reader to see the film. In fact, I'm not sure if I could outline the plot even if I wanted to. What begins as a straightforward mystery quickly descends into a madhouse of grotesque imagery. Did I understand the movie? Nonot initiallylike many of the foreign films my girlfriend has introduced me to. So naturally, I thought it was ""bad."" But this one lingered in my mind. I went to bed thinking on the film and awoke the next morning and looked it up on IMDb. I read some of the viewer comments and was astonished at 1) the insights others had derived from the film and 2) the fact that I had so thoroughly missed the whole point of the movie. I realized that I was so used to being spoon fed the ""message"" from Hollywood, that when confronted with a film that actually required the viewer to participateto actually think for themselves, I was totally unequipped. It's as if I had been conditioned to ""check my brain at the door"" of the theater.<br/><br/>Am I saying that Suicide Club is the greatest movie ever made? Of course not. It has its flaws, many of which were reported adroitly by the IMDb reviewers. Am I saying that all American movies are bad and all foreign movies are good? Againof course not. My point is that there's a whole world of film-making outside of Hollywooda body of work that engages the viewer; forces them to think and questionmovies that don't telegraph plot twists, follow a strict linear sequence, and above all, don't insult the intelligence of the person watching. I look forward to expanding my mind while exploring this new world of film that doesn't ""do the thinking for me."""

","According to some people whose had talked about what expectations they had for number 23 before seeing it, I had the same impression, bad bad, but after watching it, I think it was quite well, a good plot, a nice Jim's drama-performance and a very good ending. Making a parenthesis in my second point of view, I'm impressed about Jim, him really made a very good job, since the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, where he was quite well too, Jim's showed us a different part of his professional acting , although, of course, with his typical portion of humor. For making this story short, I really enjoyed the film, I was all the time waiting what happen in the next shot until the movie ended. I recommend this movie if you want to have a good time."

""I'm a murderer.. I murdered someone!!"" exclaimed Sparrow...<br/><br/>That pretty much summed up how deep the movie was. The story was sub-standard to begin with so you can't blame the actors at all; they had nothing to work with.<br/><br/>I do suppose if you are a 16 year old high school kid, you might find this flick somewhat ""spooky"".<br/><br/>This movie isn't even worth renting... for free.

","You know sometimes when you see a movie, and you see the beautiful movie inside swimming to get out and probably drowning? I see this a lot with children: beautiful rich souls, with depth and insight who unwittingly are building barriers between their lives and themselves.<br/><br/>This is really a good project, in the sense that it has a good soul, one worth spending time with. Its more than just the idea of the thing, or the rough outline. Its the way it seems to have been born, outside of the factory. That it has a poor expression shouldn't be counted against it. Really, would you rather have a stylish, amusing film with no soul, or the other way around? Films are little loves; the depth of commitment matters.<br/><br/>The story here starts with a man and a book. The book is engaging. Over the course of the story in the movie, the story in the book creeps out of the book and overlaps with the man's life. Now this is a narrative device I call ""folding,"" as it merges the world of the reader with that of the viewer and sweeps us into what we see.<br/><br/>The idea behind this is that the work of art  the book or movie  can change the viewer or reader. Not just color or educate, but fundamentally alter the fabric of being and thence the fabric of the world. It can change fate, perturb the laws of the universe, transmute.<br/><br/>What makes this an unsatisfying movie is that it appears about 2/3s of the way through that this is not the case. The story seems to imply  and uncareful viewers will believe  that there is an ordinary explanation, that the way things are isn't because a transmutation has occurred, but that a set of causes in the past is discovered. They were there all along, before encountering the book; the book has no agency in the world. At the end, that uncareful viewer will be unhappy. Perhaps even, this is what the director and actors believed the story to be.<br/><br/>But pay attention to the way it is written, and by that I mean both the story and the film.<br/><br/>Its entirely possible to see this movie as the story of the book changing this man's reality. And not in the simple way that he believes he is in the book, but in the magical way that his being  and entire past  is changed by it. There's a sort of superpowerful story that can do this.<br/><br/>Yes, it will have some universal structure, some family of hinges, that it leverages because it has to expose the bones of the world in order to reshape them. Here, its a number hinge. I suppose that's a good choice, given what the viewing public thinks about the structure of the world: I saw this together with ""The Last Mimsy"" which used visual faceted vision in the same way. And ""Pi,"" ""Proof"" and that mathematical excrescence ""Beautiful Mind."" All of these like numeric structure or pattern as illuminative of a worldly structure that we can grab.<br/><br/>Tellingly, they always accompany this with massive writing, often on walls. Its the writing that makes the handles, you see.<br/><br/>Here, its done with no sensitivity to delivered narrative, that connection to us. Blame the filmmaker. Its not as effective as ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" or ""Singing Detective,"" but as a structure, its pretty darn intelligent.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","Oh God, what a terrible film! I rented this because I was interested in seeing what funnyman Jim Carrey could do in a straight horror movie, but I shouldn't have bothered. A completely senseless mess, totally illogical and dull as dishwater.<br/><br/>Carrey is an animal control worker who gets hold of a book where its unknown author rants on about the symbolism of the number ""23"" and how it pertains to his life, and as Carrey reads, he begins to recognize himself in the character and starts to freak out and believe the book is about him. It's mind numbing in the repetitive way it goes on and on about all the alleged symbolism for the number ""23"", which is seemingly anywhere you go if you want to look at it that way, even when the idea is stretched to absurd extremes... Carrey's address, for instance, is 1418 -- so 14+1+8 = 23, right!? Except that 1+4+1+8 = 14 too, and 141+8 = 149 also!! Jeez...

It's definitely a stew of a film. (That might not be too bad if you like a good stew.) A mix of mathematics, paranoid conspiracy, supernatural, murder mystery and private dick/femme fatale fantasies. I thought it had passing echoes of films like ""Angel Heart"" (which I think is a little masterpiece) and ""Conspiracy Theory"" (which I don't).<br/><br/>I do like Jim Carrey, but I don't know if he was the right actor for the lead in this film. My lady really hates Jim Carrey's gurning, rubber faced, loon roles (her words).

"indigoazure","9","3","4","1 January 2008"," Pleastantly Surprised
","Well the basic question here, as it is with all movies, is did this movie tell a good solid story that was also entertaining. YES <br/><br/>I expected this movie to be garbage like most of the movies made in the past 10 years or so but it was entertaining and did indeed tell an interesting story.<br/><br/>I also like that they stayed away from the desaturated movie treatments and kind of went a bit high contrast (my own film-making signature).<br/><br/>I usually don't like movies with a Christian or religious focus (as being a good human being has nothing to do with religion), but this one wasn't really noticeable too much (well except for the lameness at the end before the credits).<br/><br/>I thought the scenes where they were telling the story from the book were fantastic as were the characters.<br/><br/>I didn't like that they mixed the pleasure of sex and intimacy with violent assault. This is a growing trend in movies today as well that I think is as caustic to our society as the 5 minute relationships in movies in the 80's. Where characters were suddenly in love after only having just met someone. I remember how young people back then expected relationships and love to work that way (of course it's their parents fault for not telling them otherwise). But now adults are getting love instructions from movies. These scenes could have been even more charged had they done them right and without the violence.<br/><br/>I've always thought Jim Carrey would do good in a serious film. He has a serious look to his face sometimes. He did a good job in this film as I would have expected.<br/><br/>I've always loved Virginia Madsen. She did a great job as well. She's not in enough movies I think. And she's hot. :) Overall I think the entire cast did a great job and I think the movie had wonderful, deep, rich cinematography. I loved at the end how the writing was appearing real time on things.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the dog was cute. :)"

But this film definitely got me on his good side for once. The primary goal of this movie is focusing on 23. Trust me by the time you finish this movie, you're probably gonna be watching out for it yourself. Thats what I did, and there's no other movie like The Number 23. <br/><br/>This is definitely not Jim Carrey at his best (he's done WAY better acting), but that doesn't shy away from the fact that this movie is still worth watching. <br/><br/>It's twisted, repulsive at times, and if anyone has seen it in theaters chances are someone asked other people what their cell phones and home phones equal up to.<br/><br/>Watch this movie and see what Joel Schumacher can really do."

It's very intriguing, fast-paced and has fantastic direction and camera work and is visually brilliant.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, there are quite a few flaws, mainly the twists. Obviously, at risk of spoiling the movie, I won't mention them, but the fact is, there's something disappointing on how the events unfold. Indeed there are a few surprises in store and it is no doubt thought-provoking, but the ending seems cluttered. Not so much 'predictable' as I've read in another review, but badly executed.<br/><br/>All in all though, it's a really great movie with plenty of original ideas and interesting concepts to make it memorable. 8 out of 10."

","The Number 23 begins beautifully. The acting is excellent, the situation compelling, the cinematography gorgeous. But none of this saves the film from outstaying its welcome. There is an exact minute the movie becomes nothing more than excruciatingly dense exposition, like watching a lecture on film, and I am tempted to bring a stopwatch into it to discover if that minute relates in any way to the number 23, so that I can rest assured it was a self-conscious joke. I wish I could say it ran only 23 minutes longer than it should have, but I have a sneaking suspicion it ran on more like forty.<br/><br/>The Number 23 suffers from a lot of good ideas that never exactly come together, and a mystery with a reveal so obtuse and verbose you flash back to Fred, Daphne, and Velma and lament fondly that they got it over with so, so much quicker."
"Samiam3","7","4","6","30 August 2009"," Kinda neat, kinda dumb, very sinister but not bad
","I can't say that either Jim Carrey or Joel Schumacher have done anything impressive lately, but they do an okay job here. The number 23 is strangely entertaining. With its moody tone, its claustrophobic and haunting photography, its convoluted storytelling, and a lot of walls defaced with black ink, the movie frequently resembles John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness. This one is not quite as creative, and even though it occasionally gets clumsy, the film is fairly intriguing and might be worth checking out if you like scary thrillers.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is Walter Sparrow, a mild mannered dog catcher who has a nice family and a dull life. On Chrismas week, his wife buys him a strange memoir entitled 'The number 23'. Sparrow is a little sceptic at first, but once he starts to read he quickly gains interest, and is surprised to discover that the story has remarkable resemblance to his own life. One aspect in particular has gotten his attention. Sparrow starts to notice the number 23 itself appear everywhere, in dates, names, times... It gets him quite excited. Soon however, this hysteria will take him down a dark road as he seeks to find out the truth about what is really going on. What does the number mean? who wrote the novel? and what does it have to do with him?<br/><br/>The funny thing about the movie, is that the whole 23 concept ends up being kind of eluding and irrelevant. It feels like little more than a plot element to throw the viewer off track so we cannot figure out the movie before it is ready to give us the climactic twist. Depending on how focused you are on the picture, it may or may not work. The ending is strangely predicable in a way, although not too blatantly.<br/><br/>I can't say much for the acting (esspecially Carrey) but the cinematography and music are quite eccentric. There are times when the Number 23 feels like a cross between a Jazzy scored film-noir and a comic book.<br/><br/>I guess in the end, the movie could use a little work, but of course nothing is perfect. Try it and see what it does for you. It's not 2 bad3 ."

No You can't. <br/><br/>And so good actor and poor director finally met and made ""Number 23""...<br/><br/>The Ugly (23)<br/><br/>I know that it's stupid to begin with but... Fingerling's subplot (almost half of this movie) looks exactly like intro to another chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, quality of detective story itself, quality of the characters, even colors, mood and music, editing, and sound mix too! Perhaps it works for the game, but surely it doesn't in the cinema.<br/><br/>Mise en scene is so bad that it becomes funny. It's not even annoying. Carrey reads walking down the stairs in park? Why? Is it natural? No, but it looks good. Why Suicide Blond covered walls in her apartment with white paper? If she just wanted to kill herself? There is no logic in that, but still it looks good.

Disappointment. <br/><br/>Interiors has no sign of people living in them, except the significant objects (shoes, photos etc.) Hard luck.<br/><br/>Dialogs ain't that bad. But what about V.O.? Well that's another story. ""There's no such thing as destiny. There are only different choices"". Captain obvious to the rescue! ""Number was coming after Fingerling. And now it was coming after me"". Cliché. And so on.<br/><br/>It's obvious that average housewife would break into public building in the middle of the night. Successfully and undisturbed.<br/><br/>The subplot of the dog dragging main character to the graveyard. This is so old trick and so comfortable for writer, and that it should have been banned. I mean it!<br/><br/>Flashbacks and editing similar to ""what happened in last episode of X-files"" isn't the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie. Is it?<br/><br/>I wish I could say that this story deserves a better fate, but it doesn't. It makes no sense. Told in chronological order is weak and unbelievable. All the time we have undeveloped characters trapped is chain of situations which are nothing but badly written fiction. This could be fun, but - since whole movie is dead serious - it isn't. To many coincidences is just bad for every story. And the ""mystery""? It's predictable and easy to guess. <br/><br/>Losing touch with reality is great theme for good movie, but I never saw any of that in Hollywood's productions. If You're interested in the subject just watch ""Repulsion"" by Polanski or something by David Cronenberg, ""Spider"" or ""A History Of Violence"" both of that movies deals with similar problems that ""Number 23"" wanted to show.

","Congratulations to Joel Schumacher, Jim Carrey, Virginia Madsen and the rest of the accomplished cast and crew of ""23"" on your early nominations... for the Razzie Awards. Here are the 11.5 reasons not spend $7.50 on this dud: 1) Anyone who has taken a math class at a fourth grade level or higher knows that 2/3 rounds up to .667. So what does the devil have to say about that? 2) The movie is funnier than it is suspenseful, thrilling, or psychological. 3) In fact, it is at its funniest when it tries (and fails) to be suspenseful, thrilling, and psychological. 4) 23 is no more special than any other number. We can add, divide, multiply, subtract, square or do whatever to our names, addresses, and phone numbers and find a way to reach any number. All we need is a calculator and the absence of a life. 5) Speaking of a calculator, the film's protagonist didn't need one to do some strikingly quick and complex calculations. But of course all dog catchers need strong backgrounds in calculus. 6) This dog catcher can't seem to catch a single dog throughout the whole damn movie. 7) What is so spooky about the fact that the human body receives 23 chromosomes from each parent? 8) Dogs can't read. Not even gravestones. 9) Dogs do age though. 10) When one expects to find ""The Number 23"" around every corner it kind of kills the suspense. 11) Building on this, all of the mentioning of a single number became tiring in the previews alone. Thus, a full length feature film about a single number seemed a bit excessive. 11.5) Building even further on this, the film lacked the crucial scene in which Jim Carry repeatedly (possibly 23 times) whacks Barbaro's corpse with a 6 iron.<br/><br/>I could have easily picked out 23 reasons not to watch the movie, but instead I'll do any reader of this column the favor that Schumacher should have done his audiences... if you can't figure out what that favor was you'll probably love ""The Number 23."""

"dee.reid","8","11","24","23 February 2007"," It's that freakin' 23!
","Talk about life imitating art, or art imitating life:<br/><br/>Today, I was on my way home from viewing the new thriller ""The Number 23"" starring Jim Carrey when I was startled to see that the car in front of me, a BMW 530 Xi, had a license plate ending with the number 4982. Pay particular attention to the 4982, because I did the math (4+9+8+2) and what did I get? 23. Scary, huh? Chalk it up to coincidence, is what I want to say, but still, scary. (Anyone reading this who has a similar experience, feel free to PM me here at IMDb. I'd love to hear similar plights.) Still, talk about art imitating life (or vice versa), which is precisely what happens to Carrey's character is this new film from director Joel Schumacher.<br/><br/>Schumacher's film, for the most part, is smarter than the average Hollywood thriller in a lot of places, but just when things start to get really interesting in the climax, it all falls apart, which isn't to say that up until then ""The Number 23"" has been a fun and engaging ride. 23, by itself, is a tricky little number with a lot of a bad omens attached to it. For all you conspiracy buffs and numerology experts, I'll leave that to you to decipher. I can just go on the always-reliable Wikipedia for my needs.<br/><br/>Carrey, the comic-turned-Hollywood leading man, isn't all over the place like he usually is in most of his movies. For the most part, he's quite subdued, saving much of his comic grace for early in the picture before the plot unravels, and begins a downward spiral that eventually leads to a mind-bending chase with himself.<br/><br/>But I'm getting ahead of myself here. What's all the hoopla about, again? As stated earlier, the number 23 is very tricky. The film starts with Carrey as loving family man Walter Sparrow and his narration informs us that today is his birthday (February 3). He's a dog catcher by trade, and he receives the call to handle the pit-bull that's been terrorizing a Chinese restaurant. The perpetrating mutt, named Ned, gets the upper hand on Walter, bites him on the arm, and runs off. The incident allows him to be late picking up his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) for his own birthday party, who managed to kill time by wandering into a used-book store where she selects a curious little title called ""The Number 23,"" by a now-obscure author named Topsy Kretts.<br/><br/>She buys the book for Walter, who at first isn't impressed by the narrative but as he begins reading deeper and deeper into the book, he finds that the main character, a detective named Fingerling, bears a rather disturbing resemblance to himself. And there is always that annoying little trickster 23, which Walter begins seeing everywhere in his life. His son Robin (Logan Lerman) is also lured into the madness that starts to consume Walter's life, as events spiral out of control and Walter's investigation into the book's narrative and the search for its author yields the gruesome 13-year-old murder of a young woman named Laura Tollins (Rhona Mitra), whose body has never been found, and for which a man may have been wrongfully imprisoned.<br/><br/>Like what was stated earlier, for the most part ""The Number 23"" appears to be smarter than the average thriller, and its script by Fernley Phillips makes every conceivable attempt to examine the bizarre and ominous nature of the infamous 23, including names, dates, and even the color of the Sparrows' living room wall. But just as things start to really get a grapple-hold on the viewer, it fades into typical Hollywood contrivances and sets us up with multiple suspects and multiple climaxes that ruin what could have been a really unique thriller. And the film's ending narrative happily explains (thus negating the confusion the movie worked so hard to achieve) the mystery surrounding the Tollins murder and Walter's involvement in it.<br/><br/>Carrey is a delight in a change of roles, though the light humor he provides early in the picture is really the only thing resembling his younger days; call it ""Ace Ventura""-lite. The movie has other good performances, and the once-tight pace of director Schumacher is ruined by the explanatory ending.<br/><br/>""The Number 23"" is probably an example of Hollywood originality ruined by Hollywood itself. Perhaps if the movie had been made independently, we could have had something truly special.<br/><br/>Oh, and that license plate number I told you about? The car made a right turn into a K-Mart parking lot and I never saw it again after that. But I was still looking for 23, just to make sure it was a coincidence. You know what? I think I was right.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I just saw the movie ""23"". Dumbest psychological thriller in existence. I love Jim Carrey and I see a lot of potential for him in serious roles, but you picked a total dung hole of a movie, Jim. The very last 5 minutes were the only thing I predicted wrong. I won't tell you just in case you desperately want to see it, but it still wasn't anything special even though I predicted it wrong.<br/><br/>If you think that the movie is gonna be some kind of rip-off of Fight Club mixed with a little Memento and Pi/Da Vinci Code, then you thought right. It's not even a good clone of those movies. It's a totally pathetic attempt. Even if they did name off all kinds of real-life events that involve the number 23 with some creative math.<br/><br/>Joel Schumacher made Falling Down and Flatliners. Everything else he's ever been involved with has been total crap. Like Goerge Lucas/George Romero, the good movies are the flukes. Had I known that Joel Schumacher directed this ""film"" on the way in, I would've never bought a ticket. I noticed his name in the opening credits and considered leaving right then. I predicted that the movie was gonna be just another psychological thriller with a pretty predictable plot, but it blew me away how unsurprised I was the entire movie. The only good thing about it was a couple hot women (Suicide Blonde) and Jim Carrey's decent performance in such cruddy circumstances. This is the first Jim Carrey movie (besides Batman Forever) that I didn't like. I hope it doesn't hurt his career and Joel Schumacher ends up getting blamed. He's worse than M. Night Shaymalan or however you spell/pronounce his name. M. Night had Unbreakable and Joel Schumacher had Falling Down. Fluke directors. I have no idea how they get funding. Why are they so well-known? Yeah, the first twenty minutes when it's Jim Carrey being the charming guy that he is was the only thing I walked away with when it was all over. I know you want serious roles, Jim, but you've gotta be more selective than that. This could damage your career if you don't publicly blame Joel Schumacher's incredible non-brilliance for this one. What a mistake. A waste of time and money for the creators and viewers of this movie.<br/><br/>And I am beside myself with the great reviews so many people have given this movie here. It's the junkiest movie EVER. Totally uninspired. Maybe the book was good and Joel Schumacher just wrecked it with his anti-talent. Who knows? The point is, don't believe the good reviews you hear about this movie. Unless you're a 7 year-old child and this is THE FIRST story you'll ever hear in your life, you will be totally unimpressed. The good reviews obviously came from friends/family of the people involved in the making of the movie. They knew it'd get a bad review, so they tried putting up good reviews to make Jim Carrey and Joel Schumacher feel better about this failure.<br/><br/>Even Hitchcock never had a failure like this. And at least he had 10 movies that were actually GOOD."

","As I have wasted 1hr 38mins watching this film, I won't waste much more of my time by writing about it. By all means, if you wish to get it out on DVD do so but don't expect too much. I am as you may have guessed, very disappointed. I found the whole experience quite dull. The film lacked excitement. The film lacked mystery - I actually correctly guessed who wrote the book and how the film would end! I won't say as I wouldn't wish to spoil another persons enjoyment. Clearly there are many people out there who have enjoyed this film - I'm just not one of them. It took me nearly 4 days to finish watching it! I'd watch some of it and find myself switching off and putting a different movie on. See for yourself"
"Dead_Mann","4","4","7","25 July 2007"," Awful Film...
","First off, do not watch this film under any circumstances. Let me elaborate... Okay, well I just watched this. And I absolutely hated it.It sounded good when I heard about it, or at least fun to watch at a theater with friends or. But it wasn't even fun to watch, just annoying. Even the great cast: JimCarrey, Virginia Madsen, and John Noble, were terrible, or not right for the role. I really don't think this was the right role for Jim Carrey. I thought he was terrible. Plus it's far to serious. How could anyone take this seriously? The story and plot are at most times, really dumb, with stupid and silly twists, that are all over the place and messy. Messy film-making. The only really positive thing about this movie is the visual, it did have quite amazing visuals. But that's the problem with most movies these days(mainly horror films). There's far too much stylish movies, with no substance. And this movie is a shallow, empty, emotionless pit. There's no substance to it at all. Especially Carrey's performance, it was totally empty. It's weird that someone like Joel Schumacher could make such a bad film like this, when he's made pretty good films such as Falling Down, Phone Booth, and A Time To Kill. But then again he did make Batman & Robin(1997). I mean come on, batman with nipples, are you f ucking kidding me? He made batman less of a superhero and more of a faggot. Do not watch this film."

An eccentric comic genius... Which is exactly what Carrey is.The writing was horrendous and so was Carrey's performance. The premise was very smart but badly executed. This movie is definitely a miss and very rarely do I regret spending 11 bucks on a movie. I must admit that I slept well for 15 minutes out of the movie and it was the best power nap I ever had. Virginia Madsen's character was laughable and many giggles were heard throughout the movie at moments where the audience was supposed to be moved or shocked."

","Firstly, I like Jim Carrey.

WRONG. very wrong.<br/><br/>The most interesting part was the opening credits and it went steadily downhill after that. Apart from some interesting scenes it just doesn't grip you at all. You wait for the entire movie for it to really get started and all the interesting stuff that was inferred to in the beginning just never happened. <br/><br/>Any allusion to the Number 23 in the film is false. It really is about one persons relationship with that number rather than any historical significance so in one fell swoop the film has rather fraudulently negated all the interesting historical stuff which came up in the opening credits. So we get a taster of what the film could have been about and then the rug is pulled away and we are left right up to the very end about one mans personal journey.<br/><br/>So from the perspective of storyline and acting then its a very shabby effort. In terms of the number 23 then shockingly poor and a big zero. <br/><br/>If it is an intellectual challenge, or significant historical, social, cultural insight or more, forget it.

","THE NUMBER 23 (2007) ** Jim Carrey, Virginia Madsen, Logan Lerman, Danny Huston, Lynn Collins, Rhona Mitra, Michelle Arthur, Mark Pellegrino. Carrey acts up a storm in this middling thriller about an Everyman whose life begins to downward spiral when his wife (Madsen) purchases a second-hand book as a birthday present which begins to take a life of its own with the mysterious power of the titular pre-occupation/obsession that brings him to the brink of insanity. Filmmaker Joel Schumacher continues his ham-fisted approaches with no subtlety what-so-ever, making things bleaker and darker than necessary in this pallid ""Twilight Zone"" meets ""Memento"" by way of ""The Shining"" with little to be scared about except to see a comic actor lose his footing in a poorly conceived attempt to stretch his dramatic muscles."
"reles2","3","8","19","25 February 2007"," The Number 23 really isn't about the number 23
","I saw this film on the 24th, which might probably disappoint the director, who's probably wishing that all of the people who see this movie walk out obsessed with the number 23. When I saw the trailer, I had a feeling this was one of those movies that could turn out to be really good or really bad. The main plot reminded me of the premise of the movie PI. However, you might find out at the end of the movie, that it would probably be more interesting to go to the library and read some books by Daniel C Dennet (Which I had done that day), or go to the internet and search for ""cool and interesting facts"" on philosophy, fate and free will; rather than watch this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is basically about a man, Walter Sparrow, who works as a dog catcher. On his birthday, his wife decides to give him a book by the name of ""The number 23"". In the book, a man becomes obsessed with the number and gradually through reading it, so does Walter.<br/><br/>The premise seems too obvious and not convincing. I think the problem is that you can't really get yourself inside the character and therefore, really buy it. To me, the story in the book fails to give a true fact, a true formula... something that will lead YOU (not the main character in the movie. YOU) to say ""Oh my God... wait a minute! Can this be?? Yes, you're right! The number 23 really has something that is Universal!"". Since it fails to do that with the audience (Unless you're unconsciously willing to believe anything you're told with very little facts), we cannot really buy it, therefore when we see Walter going obsessed with the number 23, it's like we're looking at a poor guy who's either insane or bored, or both. And indeed, he behaves that way. Of course, number 23 really works for him because it's in his birthday, his social security number, his driver's license, etc. So it seems to have something got to do with him.<br/><br/>There is a disparity, however. For a moment, the movie feels like it cannot decide between telling the story of a man who's trying to find the truth about the number 23; and telling the story of a man who becomes obsessed with a book that tells a story of a man very similar to him and thus he wants to find the author because now it turns out the author is a killer and oh my God, the killer might still be out there and we have to catch him soon before he kills more people and...... are you getting the idea by now?. The movie seems to lack a focal point. I liked PI better because the whole story was basically about a man obsessed with the number PI. Everything else comes out as a result of that. In the number 23, it seems like the director wants to do a lot of things at once. I guess if it was exclusively about the number 23, about how mathematicians have been looking for an answer throughout history, about how satanic sects have employed the number and used its power in secret, about how all these myths have remained in the shadows and now here comes this man, this ordinary everyday man and reveals the mystery, opening a new Pandora's Box, but then there's the disparity on whether he's just insane and he's taken to a medical center.... I guess that would have been more interesting. I admit I'm basically telling you how I wish the movie was made, which is a very personal thing; but the details don't matter. What I'm saying is that this movie fails to deliver its premise: This movie isn't about the number 23. This movie is about a man who wants to find a murderer. And it's not the best movie at doing that, as well."
"anklebreakingdq12","3","7","16","26 February 2007"," A very big disappointment
","The Number 23 is an original idea around the phenomena events and lives circled around the number 23. Although this movie is very intriguing at points, the plot is bland, especially the ending, and throughout the movie, you couldn't feel any connection with the characters. There wasn't any depth in the characters. Furthermore, this has to be the worst performance by Jim Carrey, and I am upset I have to say that, but his performance was boring, monotone, and just awful. Carrey overacted in some parts of the film, it was pathetic. I thought I was watching Charles Nelson Pierce in ""Joan Rivers and Friends Salute Heidi Abromawitz"". The other actors were OK , but I really don't blame the movie being bad on them; I blame it on Joel Schumacher. I was so convinced that he was over ruining the Batman Quadrilogy with ""Phone Booth"" and ""8MM"", but man, what a disappointing movie. The movie was all over the place: the sequences, characters, and story. The whole movie is about the fascination of the number 23 and how it affects peoples's lives, but then one line of dialogue in the middle of the movie contradicts the entire movie. It was just so horribly done, and it almost makes me sick because this movie could have been really good. This movie is a prime example of a great idea gone wrong due to bad directing."

Please guys, just watch this movie. Trust me, you won't regret it !!"
"jeffpk","7","3","5","7 February 2010"," An interesting, if maybe flawed film
","I gave this move a 7. 7 = 2^2+3<br/><br/>Which of course is the whole point of arithmomania, the obsessive compulsion with numbers. Numbers only have meaning because we assign it to them, and so rudimentary is their meaning that it is easy to build any complex result you need to from them. There is a great history in just such interpretation as it relates to spiritual matters. For some reason, numbers and their relationships touch something deep in our own pattern recognition systems. In some people, that mechanism spins out of control resulting in faulty reasoning, obsession and/or outright delusion.<br/><br/>In that regard this movie and the movie ""a beautiful mind"" both touch on similar subjects, though from a very different perspective. As far as we know, the main character in this movie descends into obsession and paranoid, but never out-right hallucination.<br/><br/>Which, in some ways, is too bad, because hallucination could explain what are otherwise some questionable coincidences in this film. The denouement of this movie is when the main character tells us ""there is no fate, just the choices we make."" And one could see this as his return to sanity. But without either fate or delusion, the movie hinges on a bit too many random circumstances to make decent sense.<br/><br/>From what we see of the construction of ""the book"" there is only, and can only be, one copy. It contains hand written notes and pictures that were cut out of newspapers and pasted in. Yet this one, lone copy finds its way into the hands of the one person it could effect by seeming random chance. That alone is odd. But what such an amateurish looking work was doing in a used bookstore to begin with also makes little sense... It would be about as likely as them buying your freshman history notebook.<br/><br/>Ned the dog is also a prime mover of the plot. But this again is far too much coincidence. Why should the dog keep showing up at key moments . In the end, even though our protagonist tells us there is no fate, the hand of god is pretty much essential in making this story happen as it does. And that, in the end, is a rather confusing flaw. <br/><br/>I would have given this movie more stars if it had been clearer in its conclusion. It is still a fascinating piece of film making, but the muddled ending detracts from what otherwise could have been a very strong work."
"baba44713","3","3","5","22 December 2008"," They could have just as well named it ""number 29"", or ""cheese""...
","One would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number. And sure, it's an interesting subject - can a person become so obsessed by something marginal as a simple number that he completely loses touch with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid? <br/><br/>Well, perhaps someone will make a movie about that sometime. This one unfortunately doesn't have anything to do with the above, never mind what the trailers (or even the movie itself) would like you to believe. I would like to say that this number is just a MacGuffin, but it isn't even that. It's pointless. A gimmick. A hook for unsuspecting audience.<br/><br/>Well what IS the movie about? A dog-catcher (Carrey) who becomes obsessed with a cheesy noir crime book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life. There. Sure, the character in the book - detective Fingerling (sigh) - is (for some reason) obsessed with number 23, and Carrey himself becomes obsessed and starts seeing the number everywhere.. but it's just padding, and totally irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can cut out all the 23 references and have the main character(s) obsess about cheese or something and you'll have the exactly same story. It is painfully obvious that all the ""23"" stuff was written in waay after the story was already finished, rejected and sent for ""rewrites"".<br/><br/>Which would be OK.. I guess.. if the movie wasn't dull, dull, dull. Half of the movie is narrated, for chrissakes. You aren't watching the movie, you are listening to Jim Carrey narrating the movie. About a quarter-in Carrey starts reading the book, and from then until the horribly clichÃ© ending we are forced to watch ""real-life"" scenes from dog-catcher's life (where nothing happens) interspersed with narrated artsy film noir-ish ""book"" scenes which will either leave you snickering or just plain depressed. It's like a poor man's ""Sin City"" with all the violence cut out, narrated by Carrey and shown in slow-motion. Ugh.<br/><br/>This is a simple case of a C-movie script somehow being filmed with an A-movie cast.. probably because of the ""number 23"" hook which I guess sounded intriguing enough on paper to warrant the premium Hollywood treatment. However, since - as I said already - the movie is about number 23 as much as it is about cheese production in Switzerland, one cannot feel anything but cheated.<br/><br/>I give ""Fingerling - the movie"" 3 out of 10, because I guess it didn't insult my intelligence as much as ""Forsaken"" did or made me downright suicidal like ""Battlefield Earth"" did and the bottom of the scale must be reserved for abominations like those. But fear not, this is still a pretty lousy flick."

","I don't quite understand why the reviews of this film are bad? And why only 6.2 (at the time of writing) out of 10? This is a film that doesn't take the standard route of explanation. It has a slowly built twist which most reviewers obviously aren't expecting and therefore consider boring. Well go watch the Dark Knight again if you want that sort of excitement, because you won't find it here.<br/><br/>This film is great in it's own sense. Its an exploration of a character portrayed excellently by Mr Carey who has psychological problems which he never deals with, only suppresses. It's an excellent movie about obsession, paranoia and redemption. It's about a disturbed man exploring and confronting his past. And these themes it does better than any movie I have seen in years.<br/><br/>I think most people think the number 23 in this movie should have resulted in more conspiracy and ""spookyness"". In fact it is simply used as a tool to illustrate paranoid delusion and obsession. It could have been anything - aliens, the colour blue, a piece of clothing etc etc, but the writers decided to use a number.<br/><br/>If you can get over Jim Carey being in a dramatic role and want to see a well crafted, intelligent film, check this one out. Despite what other reviewers say it will keep you guessing and the ending is both important, fulfilling and true to the themes the movie presents."

","Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) has the perfect life, until his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) gets him a book that talks about the number 23. Walter becomes obsessed with the number, and feels that it's out to get him, and as he reads the book it seems more and more like his life.<br/><br/>He begins to unravel the mystery of the number 23, and as he does so he begins to realize that there's more to his life than what he remembers.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey can do comedy, there's no doubt. He can also perform well in dramas (such as ""The Majestic"" and ""Man on the Moon""). When it comes to psychological thrillers, however, he should stick with his day job. His acting seemed wooden, and basically the whole premise of the movie is utterly ridiculous. ""Oh no, the number 23 is after me!"" I've never really heard a story where a number actually killed a man.<br/><br/>The movie itself is totally confusing, and seems to be filled with plot holes and inconsistencies. It's a surprise it was directed by renowned director Joel Schumacher (""Phone Booth,"" ""The Client""). It seems like it was directed by a first-timer who had too much time on his hands."

The only scary thing is that people will actually pay to see this crap. It starts off like it might actually go somewhere and be interesting but the plot completely fails in its attempts to be interesting, creepy, whatever. Nothing really makes that much sense in it, and as the movie says itself, if you're looking for the number you can find it anywhere. The main turns in the plot are completely stupid.

","Just when we thought Jim Carrey was either taking an extended sabbatical or floundering, he reinvents himself again. He can't command his old US$20M paycheck by playing his usual characters, so taking a pay cut, he's freed himself to pursue other acting exploits.<br/><br/>As if to offer a smooth transition for the audience, The Number 23 starts out funny. It establishes a likable Walter Sparrow (Carrey), a loving husband/father/dogcatcher. He later becomes obsessed with a book relayed by a detective, Fingerling, who is uncannily too similar to him. Somehow, murder seems to be in the mix. Virginia Madsen plays his supportive baker wife Agatha.<br/><br/>Director Joel Schumacher fearlessly takes the plunge along with Carrey's reinvention with The Number 23. His intentions are very clear; his aim is to entertain, and that's what this film feels like, a trippy ride. While Schumacher develops his characters well, somehow the audience is not able to either suspend disbelief or relate emotionally with the characters.<br/><br/>Carrey displays his leading man side with the buff body, the sexy tattoos and the slicked back hair, but sadly, he still isn't able to translate into someone lust-worthy; you keep expecting him to distort his face into some gag. He just couldn't match Madsen, who plays the dowdy wife well, but just as delightfully goes back to her vixen roots by transforming into Fabrizia, the Italian temptress in Fingerling's story. The choice of ""Tear You Apart"" by She Wants Revenge played in the background during their seduction scene was very much inspired and added to the excitement.<br/><br/>The effort is starkly laid out but the sincerity is lacking; for some reason, you feel manipulated but you don't mind, because you don't care. The Number 23 feels longer than its 95 minutes, but watch it anyway for its interesting premise and entertainment value."

This kind of movie is accessible to the brained and cultivated (serving them revolutionary blurry scenes that transfer the confusion of the main character to the public).

The ending seems to me somewhat like Dostoievski's 'crime and punishment', the theme of the murderer that manages to redeem him self through love and self justice. Of course, in order to see all those things you must be quite educated. Just as well, one less educated can appreciate this movie for the action and the mystery and the unpredictability of the subject. Of course there will always be a hybrid specie known as the pseudo-intellectual, this odd being is always a critic, due to his ungifted spirit.

","I thought this was a very poor film in every aspect. The director that turned the original Batman series into a vacuous fashion show has once again made a film that is all hype and no substance. The premise sounds interesting: a number that has some spooky significance. But this is badly executed from the start when the opening title sequence shows the number 23 occurring throughout history in important names and dates, contradicting the plot in which the number is a curse upon a single person. The effect is that by the time Carrey's character starts reeling off how the number has occurred through his life we have already seen how easy it is to contrive the number from almost anything, and any surprise or intrigue is lost. Carrey is capable of serious acting as proved in the excellent Truman Show and the underrated The Majestic, but here he detracts from the mood by making the character-building quips seem much funnier than they should be. This is not a terrible film, but it does not live up to any of the expectations it sets for itself. It is neither a credible horror, nor a vehicle for Jim Carrey's talents."

He now faces the deep consequences that are in store for him as things become darker.<br/><br/>I felt this film wasn't that entertaining, to be honest. It lacked a good script, the pacing felt badly slow, and, like The Majestic, was a weak dramatic film. Jim Carrey did a good job, but I felt like he had hardly anything to work with.

","I am having trouble with the release date of this movie (2007 really?). Perhaps I could be confusing it with ""Memento"",that of which, was released in 2000. I recall viewing it for the first time, no later than 2003. It may be possible I am becoming senile in my old age. <br/><br/>Salutations to Jim Carrey for masterfully, executing the lead role, of a mystery, suspense genre. Virginia Madsen is absolutely enticing and seductive, as ""Agatha"" the loyal, supportive wife, to the seemingly paranoid, delusional ""Walter Sparrow"". Danny Huston is not a lead character, but enforces my feelings that this particular movie, is a ""creepy"" mystery suspense. In my opinion, this film seemed to be lacking some sort crucial element, that makes a film great, but I definitely recommend it to, any mature movie lover. I am proud to have ""The Number 23"", as part of my movie collection."

","OK i bought this on DVD as it was cheap and from the blurb sounded good. when i watched it i was thrilled throughout and Jim Carey's performance as a serious actor was excellent, proving his dexterity. the plot twists are great and the use of lighting and flashbacks is great. It then encourages you in a way after the film to check this phenomena out and its pretty scary :). i highly recommend you at least view this film and draw your own conclusions. i give it 8 stars and i've never given a 10. <br/><br/>Jim Carey is usually considered a flippant and jokey character with performances in the Ace Ventura films that were hilarious being one highlight of his illustrious career. this film should now be noted as one of his great performances."

","Okay, maybe is a very strong thing to face in a life all things happened to Walter Sparrow, but the way Jim Carrey played this role, to me result a funny breath after all. The theme of the novel is very good and has much dramatic quality. When Carrey played the role of a father an his son, always associating all things happened with the number 23 is like a satire about how hard is life and how many human beings want to associate many facts with a symbol that give more understanding to each other in what do we have to do with our own existence. I really like Jim Carrey as an actor, but he surprising me playing a serious role. He always will be funny to me, no matter if he wants to play a suffer guy. Seeing his work is refreshing."

","Although there really isn't anything new about The Number 23, it is one of those suspense films that keeps you guessing until the very end, and it is a re-imagining of most suspense plots. The story is somewhat convoluted and it make take more than one viewing to catch many of the subtle clues that are offered throughout, but that is what makes it differ from most thrillers. In the end, all will come to understand the meaning behind The Number 23. If you are watching this film on DVD, make sure you pause it before leaving the room. The plot is quite intricate and requires your full attention. Jim Carrey is quite simply at his level best in this role.It would seem that he can deliver more than just comedic roles. Carrey plays a man who becomes obsessed with a book titled "" The Number 23"", whose story seams to closely parallel his own life, and the more he delves into it's pages, the more seriously obsessed he becomes with its characters, and their actions, as they relate to the number 23, and furthermore, how this number affects people's lives in an almost demonic way. The book clearly relates how the number 23 figures into dates and events that have shaped our world in destructive ways, ranging from assassinations, disasters and wars. The number 23 seems to figuratively get under the very skin of anybody who recognizes its destructive link to catastrophe. Carrey's performance as a mentally disturbed man is superb, and his escalating obsession to find and meet the author of the book is truly frightening. The viewer will find themselves in a claustrophobic state when Carrey finally discovers the truth behind who wrote the book and why. The script is cleverly written, and often uses people and one extremely creepy dog, to foreshadow the events to come. WARNING -this film does not have the happiest of endings, but it does have one that satisfied this viewer with its small tint of hope. One piece of advice-try not to think about the number 23 after viewing this film, for you might just discover how this number affects your own life. SPOOKY!!"

","Whatever your view of the film's content itself (acting, plot and so forth), you have to give the creative team some respect for how realistic the feeling of obsession, paranoia and something sinister going on behind the scenes of our normal world.<br/><br/>You don't have to believe in the Illuminati or such; people do obsess over what we (ahem!) normal people barely notice, or dismiss, if and when we do notice.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is always a surprise when he does dramatic roles, in my opinion. There were times I actually forgot he was who everyone remembers him for: A wacky comedian."

","Well what to say after so many informations that we're given in only 98 minutes? I'll start with the fact that this is Joel Schumacher's 23rd project he directed (if we don't count two videos for INXS). Is that coincidence or not? Anyway, I want to tell you that I enjoyed in this movie very much. Maybe it's because I like movies like ""Secret Window"", ""1408"" and similar stuff. I just like movies were you have to think for a change. Schumacher's ""The Number 23"" leaves us with many questions through entire movie, except of course at the ending were everything is explained to us in simplicity that I happened to like. I liked the ending and I think that the whole movie wasn't boring like some comments said. It was unique and very good experience that is based on acting abilities of two actors: Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen. Carrey and Madsen aren't disappointing and this is perfect movie to watch weather one actor can or cannot act. They both passed this exam in my eyes, just like director Schumacher did. Really good thriller. Nothing scary, not a masterpiece but a good movie for all of you who are not afraid to use that gray thing in your head and extract hour and half of your time."

","I truly believe some of these comments are purely just to insult the movie. Were you not watching the movie? There are no plot holes, the only thing which they slipped up on was the facts at the beginning but your average audience wouldn't know that. What will Carrey have to do to gain a bit of respect? The man is a comical genius, yes, but surely he has proved himself by this point that he is actually a talented, very versatile actor? I didn't care for the Truman Show but he simply gave a flawless performance and this can not be denied! Neither can it be denied that he did a good job in Eternal Sunshine For Spotless Mind or whatever it was called. Carrey is good in this. Critics and certain stiffs seem to be fixated on the idea that he simply is not allowed to do things outside of comedy but he is actually very good at it. <br/><br/>This movie is actually much more intellectually stimulating than appears. The fact of the matter is that it is not a horror movie as the posters make it seem, it is a Physicological thriller and I would even stress to say it is a drama. It has several levels ( by the way people saying its a stupid plot, get your facts straight, the theory of the number 23 has been worked on before- it could be argued that people could have been drawn to insanity from it. <br/><br/>To sum up- this is definitely worth a watch. Its smart, the acting is good, and some of the direction is actually quite beautiful as is the cinematography. The script is possibly the weakest link of the movie but is held up with good deliverance by the actors. <br/><br/>Watch it people!"

I watched it last night and I was not at all thrilled by it! The boys age thing really bugged me...Walter has been out of hospital 13 years, bumps into his future wife on the steps and then 13 years later they have a son who looks to be about 15 or 16 ? And its not just that....when Laura's body is found by her professor/lover the police arrest him but fail to search the apartment and find Walter hiding in the closet with blood all over him and he manages to sneak out passed police cars and ambulances unnoticed????Years later, when Walter confronts the professor in jail, the professor doesn't recognize him??

You should just sit back and eat popcorn. This is one of those movies.<br/><br/>Then comes the other part of the population, the majority, and in this case, the target audience. (I'll use Saw as an example to not spoil anything) In the end of Saw, they've got sort of a ""recap"", to explain every detail to everybody who didn't fully comprehend what just happened. Now this is needed for some people in the so called ""target audience"", and is therefore necessary. Too bad that these endings ruin the movie for oh so many people.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely worth seeing, and I enjoyed it.

","If you have seen Johnny Depp's Secret Window, De Niro in Hide & Seek, Memento or The Machinist, then you have seen The Number 23. I enjoyed the acting, but found the script a bit too self-important. The film was atmospheric enough, but the ending just did not pay-off. My first thought was, ""Again?"" The whole exposition that is then relayed is also less-than- convincing. Why would anyone go on a date with, let alone marry, someone they see leaving an insane asylum? Also, I couldn't quite figure out the reason why the wife and doctor went to such lengths to cover up for the protagonist. Anyone who hasn't seen the above films will find this an enjoyable DVD to rent. In terms of current trends in film-making, however, it comes across as tired and formulaic.

","I remember when this film came out in 2007 but for some reason I didn't see it at the time, then i stumbled across it many years later in a cheap dvd store so grabbed it, I like Jim Carrey as a comic actor but as this was billed as a horror i was intrigued to see how he'd fare in this.<br/><br/>Carrey stars as Walter Sparrow, a rather goofy, likeable animal control officer, and when he is bitten by a dog called Ned (which Sparrow comically refers to as nasty evil dog) it caused him to be late while meeting his wife in a bookstore, she then advises him to read a fairly old, scrappy looking book called ""The Number 23"", by Topsy Krets, so he does and is soon enthralled by the book, noting similarities between his own life, including the name/nickname of the books main character, ""Fingerling"".<br/><br/>The more Walter reads of the story he comes across a character called ""the suicide blonde"", who explains that the number 23 is cursed and appears everywhere around her, as he reads this, Walter too becomes obsessed with the number, as well as the main character, who he is convinced is somehow about him, his wife dismisses the idea but his son seems to agree with him and Walter is determined to find out more as well as track down the elusive Topsy Kretts, who it seems has no other body of work except for the novel Walter is reading, and a clerk at a bookstore, finds no information on Kretts.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, it appears there is more to the whole story than meets the eye, as dark turns and twists occur, and we get an insight into Walters past, and just why he thinks the novel is somehow based on his life.<br/><br/>The film for me definitely lost a bit of steam as it went on, the constant flashes of Walter, as fingerling interacting with characters in the book became somewhat distracting after a while, and the more you learned about 23 it kind of took away the mystery, however the film was enjoyable in parts, and I did enjoy Carreys performance, even though I kept thinking he'd go full on rubberface mode (he didn't), it bought some humour into a somewhat bleak story.<br/><br/>Overall this film wasn't that good, but it was decent and I did thoroughly enjoy the first half hour or so, and I don't regret watching it I wouldn't go too far out of my way to endorse either.<br/><br/>6/10 Very mild recommendation."

","PROS: The part of the movie that was most well crafted was the story line. After all the mystery and the plot development you finally got clear answers. What I liked about this movie was the fact that you learned with the character and not for the character. As a watcher this quality is really good because you end up staying with the pace of the movie and not falling behind or predicting ahead. Since this happened you really ended up following along and started to feel the paranoia that arose as the film progressed. One of the most impactful parts of the movie was the paranoia, and the main actor, JIM CARREY, did a great job at delivering this quality. It wasn't just him that did a great job it was the majority of the cast as well. <br/><br/>CONS: The biggest con for me was the falling action, which comes right after the climax. The problem was that the movie took too long to resolve, and it began to get boring. Once you solved the mystery you don't need another 30 minutes to relax. This was the sort of movie that should have ended differently to keep it memorable. The final factor of the movie that I disliked was the fact that it took a while for tension to develop, and it took even longer for it to simmer down.<br/><br/>www.chorror.com"

Now everything he encounters seems to relate somehow to the number 23 to the point where he feels controlled. Directed by Joel Schumacher who previously directed Carrey in Batman Forever where he played the Riddler. Here he must also solve a riddle of sorts. This is a very different role for Carrey whose birthday gift turns into an obsession to solve a murder to the point where he feels that he is becoming a danger to his own family. Madsen does well as his wife whom attempts to help him solve his dilemma only to have secrets surface. She will put herself in harm's way for the sake of her husband and his declining mental state. Logan Lerman plays their son whom also assists in solving the case and becomes an inspiration for life. Rhona Mitra plays a college student who was murdered after having sexual relations with her professor. Danny Huston is also cast as Isaac French and Dr. Miles Phoenix but the role is standard.

He had certain ticks and nuances about him that looked like he thought he was in another one of his goofy stupid comedies. Another one was that though the story was fascinating, it didn't seem believable for our world. The consequences and his feelings in the end did not seem realistic.

During watching team sports I always watch-out for who's wearing a jersey with this number. So the number 23 is everything to me and watched this movie 7 years ago (today, 2014) with high expectations which stood up to my belief. Here I am after a re-watch.<br/><br/>You know mystery movie are not meant to watch again and again, because you won't get that real twist when you re-watch. That is a big drawback in this particular genre. All we need is to give a good concentration while we watch for the first time and must not miss a single dialogues. But in my case I saw it a long ago, now I didn't remember much of the movie scene except the storyline. So I had a little advantage over that to view it again and I am glad this movie impressed me in the second time as well.<br/><br/>You won't see much of Jim Carrey in a serious role. This is one of those where he's out of his league, the comedies. I thought it was a dark comedy, at least it kick started sounding like that way. But after progressing with good story development it turned so ridiculously deep into a main character who was obsessed with the number 23. It began with a simple misunderstanding over a something, but later digs intellectually with more broader expansion towards a parallel story that was written in a red book.<br/><br/>It is a great movie, which stays true to its genre and makes audience to begin their guessing game soon the red book enters into the frames. It also had a wonderful twist with the meaningful dialogues at the end. It is a must see movie from the perspective of the Jim Carrey's filmography. One of the movies of him to remember his appearance in a divergent character than usual.

Pretty much every important date in history...can be teased to fit the pattern. What can't be hammered out of this fixation, apparently, is a coherent movie. Julius Caesar was stabbed 23 times. Charles Manson was born Nov. 12 (11 + 12 = 23). The Mayans believed the world would end on Dec. 23, 2012 (20 + 1 + 2 = 23). My brother stole my pogo stick when I was 23 and broke it into 23 pieces.

I was impressed with the way film mixed reality , fantasy and elements of the philosophical side together which makes people think away . The movie also moved at a quick pace with the curse being stretched out further and further along as we go. However having said that I have read some of the other reviews from people and critics who have dismissed this movie as boring, and not what they are used to seeing from Carrey and that might be true in some minor aspects as this movie is not for everyone as it requires a clear and focused mind kind of like watching a Hitcock thriller and for some it might require more than one viewing but I would say to people check it out for your-self and draw your own conclusion from it and you might find some similarities between your-self and Mr.Sparrow! <br/><br/>THE NUMBER 23 - 8.1 OUT 10<br/><br/>THE TRUTH SHALL FIND YOU !"

","The tale of obsession begins with a bored man-next-door getting his hands on a book gifted by his wife on his birthday. As the pages are turned one by one, he finds that the book begins to mystify his very being. It quotes events similar to the ones that he remembers to have had happened in his own life. With the book leading him through the mysterious maze of events, he deliberately enters an obsession. His battle in and out of that obsession is ""The Number 23"".<br/><br/>Its a surprise gift by Joel Schumacher. The director who is famous for glorifying Batman in Batman Forever and also responsible for the closure of the franchise with his infamous Batman and Robin. He has provided an intellectual treatment to the script which is expected of David Fincher, Tony Scott and the likes. Nevertheless, the touch is fresh. Immense amount of interesting research has gone into make this movie. Several interesting subjects like the Number Theory, Obsessive Psychological Behaviour and many have been discussed in a crowd-engaging style. Schumacher is at his smoothest with screenplay and direction.<br/><br/>The addition of matured scenes, though befitting the violent emotional web, are more than adequate. Probably they were left like that to draw in a large audience. The induction of the obsession from one person to another is portrayed like possession which could draw varied opinions from the audience. The fact that a mind that remembers a disturbed long past, will also remember the obsession and the recent past, is completely neglected, which causes a camouflaged flaw in the screenplay.<br/><br/>Cinematography and Art Direction has brightened the script vividly. This could easily be the most challenging role in Virginia Madsen's career. She has performed like a natural. Long way to go, Madsen. The real jewel of the movie is the performance by the man who has commanded our laughter for nearly 2 decades. Jim Carrey has intemperately rendered an exceptionally perplexed role with such fluidity that he has made us bow to all the emperors commanding the artistic prowess of the genre in which he was born on-screen. Comedy. An actor who masters comedy, masters it all. Isn't it so true?<br/><br/>The Number 23. Obsession at its best."
"Jay_Exiomo","4","14","44","21 February 2007"," Concept wasted
","What seemed to be initially an intriguingly good premise, as its trailers and posters show off, is never realized by the film itself which is incoherent and predictable. Jim Carrey works to the best of his acting range to make his character work, and director Joel Schumacher creates a brooding yet ultimately lackluster envelope of suspense.<br/><br/>Walter Sparrow (Carrey) is a dogcatcher who stumbles upon ""The Number 23,"" an obscure novel written by an individual who became obsessed with the mentioned number. As he begins to read it, he realizes that the novel shares much connection with his past and that the number 23 seems to be less a random number than, uh, a governing universal entity. Like his birthday is on February 3 (2/3!), he and his wife met when they were 23, Kurt Cobain was born and died in years where each digit summed up would add to 23. You know, stuff hoax emails are made of.<br/><br/>The film possesses some semblance of creativity, and with so much diabolical randomness going on in the movie, it's easy for one to think the story is far from simple. But the truth is, it isn't complicated at all - it's just to arbitrarily blathering. Partly because the film can't decide whether to take its subject with a heavy hand, or with a tongue planted on its cheek. Partly because it plods a lot without much going on. Mostly because it may be the Fernley Phillips' script, which proceeds to a final act that comes as a letdown after all the intensity that the first two acts had put forth.<br/><br/>Overall, the film does have a few worthy amount of cheap suspense but the flaws far outweigh them. Viewing it seems to just add up to an ultimate disappointment."

","I loved this film, i saw it twice because i loved it that much!! As soon as it comes out on DVD i am buying it because i think it is such a fabulous film. In my opinion this is the best film in years if you are interested in paranoia, psychology or anything similar to them. I think anyone who likes anything like CSI or Criminal Minds will love this. If you can't stand CSI and think that Criminal Minds is boring then you will probably hate it. This does seem to be a film you either love or hate, but in my whole life there are are only 2 films i have paid to go and see in the cinema more than once, Pirates of The Caribbean and The Number 23. This is very much worthy of every bit of praise it gets, I happen to really like Joel Schumacher's work as i saw Batman and Robin (the one starring Uma Thurman and Alicia Silverstone) and i didn't know it was his work until i looked on this website and i was ecstatic that they were directed by the same person. I am going to be on the look out for any other work by Joel Schumacher now just because of this film."

Why would people invest money into a movie with no plot, no writing, and no point. What would motivate an intelligent actor to pick up the script and say let me do this? Did they really pay him that much money? Finally, who are these people commenting about what a great movie this was?? How much were they paid to mislead the public able a really bad movie?

The movie would have been decent if the movie had ended with Jim Carrey remembering what he had done. But then we have to suffer through watching him replay the book again and end up in prison.

","I went into this movie expecting so much more than I got. The trailers made good use of the best parts of the film, making it look like a well plotted, suspenseful thriller. Neither of these elements were present in The Number 23. While the actors (especially Jim Carrey) were good, the screenplay left them nothing to work with. <br/><br/>I was really hoping that this movie would finally redeem Joel Schumacher (whose only good film I consider to be 8mm), but it did not. There were many glaring inconsistencies, omissions and plot holes. It saddens me that Jim Carrey has done some films that were just terrible, though he was good (How The Grinch Stole Christmas, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, Liar Liar) and this is just another one to add to the list.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie had lots and lots of potential and it threw it all away on a poorly written screenplay. I think Schumacher should have had Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en, Fight Club rewrites, 8mm) come in and do a major script overhaul. Maybe that could have made for a better picture. In the mean time, if you want to see a good psychological thriller, do yourself a favor and rent The Game, Mulholland Drive, From Hell, or 8mm."

","I base this upon the Unrated version, though I understand that there's essentially just more sex and plot in it, and apart from that, it's the same as the Theatrical. In addition to being the wet dream of all numerologists, this flick has an interesting enough idea. I got into it, I'll grant you that. But the gaping holes in logic and plot, I can not ignore, especially since most of them are ruin the story when they don't hold up. And with the ridiculous, nonsensical, out-of-the-blue ending, all hope is absolutely lost. I frankly doubt I'd watch this again. Schumacher delivers what we're used to from him, not counting Batman & Robin; the movie ""works"", looks good enough, and is generally sufficiently convincing, without necessarily being something you're going to rave about(the one exception to this rule being Phone Booth, that one, he nailed). The acting is great, for all concerned. While Jim doesn't give his best performance, he's rather good. This has reasonable suspense and atmosphere. The look and tone is nicely achieved. Dialog is fine. The effects are well-done. This has some strong language, disturbing content and a little nudity. On the DVD are both cuts of the film, a ton of featurettes of varying quality, deleted/alternate scenes, a trailers, a Trivia track and a reasonable subtitled director's audio commentary. I recommend this to big fans of those involved in making it, and those who dig the concept. 6/10."

I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey ever since Ace Ventura Pet Detective came out. Ever since any project he was attached to I was be there for sure. Recently he's been doing a few dramatic roles and it's not that I'm not into comedic actors doing that, but the ones he was doing didn't quite interest me. But this one did. This movie has quite the plot to it. It keeps you intrigued until the very last frame, and somehow you know that number will keep showing up so you pay close attention (during my viewing today I had to pause to count whenever I saw a sign). The best part though is Carrey's performance. The man I grew up laughing at during movies like Dumb & Dumber and Cable Guy does very well as portraying this character who ends up being tortured by the number that shows itself every. Not once did any of his past roles come to mind. No talking out of his butt, not crazy laughs, no rubber faces. Most likely his best performance yet.<br/><br/>And be careful when you do watch this. Because you'll be looking everywhere for that number as well! But is it really that evil or is it all coincidence? We may never know"

","Even when I first saw the trailers to this movie I got the notion that someone had seen Aronofsky's ""Pi"" and had thought: ""That plot could make for a good mystery movie for a popcorn audience."" So, the ""The Number 23"" was produced.<br/><br/>From the beginning the whole plot and the conspiracy theory around the number 23 seem too far fetched for the audience to actually be intrigued by it. As much as we would like to we never share Carrey's paranoia about that number.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is entertaining enough as long as it's running. Schumacher even manages to direct decently this time around. Sure, some of the detective scenes are a bit laughable and Jim Carrey - as great as he was in some of his more serious roles - is completely miscast here. The way he moves and looks sometimes is unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>That wasn't so much of a problem, though. The final solution and everything that followed, however, was. First we are turned off by the revelation of the mystery behind the book ""The Number 23"" and then a lot of painful blabbering follows that continue to make a joke of everything that happened before.<br/><br/>Like ""The I Inside"" Schumacher's movie starts out promising, but goes nowhere. I don't regret having seen it, though. It was a fun time. If you're just aware of the fact that the solution is not going to be anything mind-blowing, you should be able to enjoy yourself with ""The Number 23""."

But I did hear from some of the girls I worked with that it wasn't that good or it could be a little predictable. For me at least, my opinion, it was a little over the top, because normally the audience would sympathize with Jim Carrey and his character, because it seems like no one would believe him, but I couldn't find myself believing him; that he was seeing the number 23 and how it all linked together.<br/><br/>Walter is a man who has just had his birthday, February 3, February being the second month mixed with three. His wife Agatha recommends a book called ""The Number 23"" to him, Walter immediately starts to read it and finds himself relating to the character Fingerling a little too much. He finds out there is a curse around the number 23, and everything in his life is adding up to that number. When he finds out that the book ends in a murder, he fears for his wife's life as well as others and his own.<br/><br/>Over all, I would say that this is a movie that you'd have to see for yourself, I just wasn't impressed. I couldn't sympathize with the characters and most of the movie was just a little over the top. Not to mention in some ways you can figure out the ending pretty quickly, but I am not going to give it away obviously.

Although not a Memento quality mind-bend, the Number 23 well pick you up, toss you around, and set you down gently on your head. This film has several very well done noir-style almost flashback shots (when you see, you will understand). Number 23 kept me asking and questioning (and trying to see 23 in every shot) up till the last line, and then just when I though I had it figured, it threw one last curve. As a life-long Jim Carrey fan, I have to admit I love seeing him play serious. He grabs you on the first shot and doesn't let you go until the credits stop. A big mistake is to think he is going to make you laugh every time you see him. Get past that, and you will see the amazing acting talent that Jim has. It is worth the money to see Number 23."
"FettingDale","7","3","6","24 February 2007"," Two great movies wrapped into one chaotic film.
","I will give the director Joel Schumacher an applause for several things.First, the cinematography for the most part was beautiful. If this film were a canvas then he would be a Leonardo. Second, the acting was great as well. In fact I think it's been a while where I saw a movie where there were no BAD actors(Usually they throw one in as a secondary character, for cost I presume). Third, ""The Number 23"" was ""TWO"" great stories; and that was the problem with the film.<br/><br/>The movie takes two great concepts and blends them together. As a result you are presented with an extra long movie that makes sense only when you break it apart and excuses its' faults as unexplained phenomena. Why is this such an issue? Truth be told there was already a fan base for this movie based on the concept of the number alone. In my opinion many left with no closure to that spooky coincidence which bothered me more-so than friends I saw it with. Mainly because I had a personal experience concerning the same phenomena as Jim Carry's character. In all honesty, I noticed that the audience treated the movie like it was two separate entities. So much so that they would laugh because it would contradict itself over and over again.<br/><br/>The director should have chopped this script and storyline into two and made double the money by directing 2 really good and interesting films (that should have nothing to do with each other). ""The Number 23"" could have been one that dealt with the phenomena of the number and how it affects people as a whole, and the other movie,(possibly called ""The Writer""?) could have been the other film concerning what Jim Carrey's character went through on the surface and could have been awesome without bringing up the number at all. <br/><br/>My apologies for being so vague in certain areas as I do not want to give away the ending to these whom have not watched it, but I will say this: the director did fail when it came to the end for the simple fact that he took away the mystery by explaining way to much. And once the audience understood why things were the way they were, he kept going on anyway. Not only did this bore half the audience, but it took the mystery and eerie feeling away for the other half. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a C+/B- for the sheer fact that it was a very good effort that only lacked in non-chaotic script writing. The good news is that with any hope, Virginia Madsen will continue to get move roles that she deserves. For too many years she spent time in the lime-light doing B movies when in reality, she is one of the best actresses that Hollywood has. And, she has a silver screen beauty that todays actresses can't touch."
"ps42","5","4","10","25 February 2007"," Pi for dummies.
","First off, am still in disbelief at the critical reception that The Number 23 has gotten. I did manage to enjoy it. It was clearly not the most intelligent of thrillers, but at its worst, it was a well executed, but horrendously written film.<br/><br/>23 kept me guessing through most of the film. I thought it was well photographed, and loved how the filmmakers alternated to a kind of film-noir style for the story within the book. On the other hand, some of the real world scenes looked stale and empty. It also had a serious believability issue. You need to really be able to suspend disbelief and avoid asking questions during this movie. The only really solid aspect of the 23's plot is the stunning detail they went into with the 23 enigma. The 23 enigma is a phenomenon that has been studied by mathemeticians, and the number has some positively strange literary passages, historical events and properties attached to it, but it is not enough to build a film on. Once you get past the number, you realize just how bland the characters and plot really are.<br/><br/>The cast did a good job with the film, with most of them playing dual roles, one in the real world and one in the world depicted by the book. I love it when people like Jim Carrey decide to take serious roles. He is a solid actor, and needs to balance out the dumb comedy.<br/><br/>Overall, it seemed like 23 was trying very hard to be Pi, and in most places it failed miserably. The filmmakers tried to lure you away from the static characters and lame plot by focusing on the 23 enigma, wheras Pi did the opposite. It put the numbers in the background and exposed its protagonist's slow descent into madness and chaos brilliantly. 23 mascarades as a good film with depth and a plot, but upon closer examination, has very little beneath its shiny and appealing surface."

This movie has no decent story to begin with. The script is an incoherent mess, a would-be psychological mystery that can only be entertaining for 14-year-olds and with the kind of formulaic twists that makes me fall asleep. Without spoiling anything: the book that sets everything in motion, is written by 'Topsy Kretts'. How clever is that? It takes the characters about half a movie to discover that that is not a real name! How stupid do the people who made this thing, think we are? Add the complete lack of style of Joel Schumacher and you get a movie that is bad in every way it can be. Mr. Schumacher plays with shadow and light, with colors and obscure locations, but he still is the king of kitsch and not the David Fincher he thinks he is.

","Saw it as a free preview. Thank God I didn't pay for this one. It looked intriguing and promising, and Jim Carrey always plays dark & crazy well(Cable Guy, The Riddler, Lemony Snickets, etc.), but this movie just stunk. An hour into it, I still didn't feel hooked into the story or feel any connection with the main character. The film seemed to have no real direction and as it progressed, it became more non-credible and unbelievable to the point of absurdity... so much so that some of this preview audience in Columbus, Ohio (roughly 600 people) was audibly laughing throughout the movie, mostly at points where I don't think the director, cast, or producers wanted laughter. The cinematography is excellent and the dark parts and places do lend a level of creepy to the film, but that alone can't save an otherwise bad movie. See it if you love Carrey's or Schumacer's work, but don't set your expectations too high for this one...might be better for the bargain theaters or the rental store."

","I wouldn't say it was the worst movie I have ever seen....but it definitely ranks up there. Jim Carrey's performance was comedic instead of dramatic and his co-stars were sub-par at best. If this movie would have ended after the first 45 minutes I would have ranked it around 7 but because of the useless twists over the last 45 minutes I had to rank it lower. They try to throw a curve ball at the audience that no one could have possibly foreseen. However, the surprise ending only makes the movie dumb and useless. No joke...after the movie ended I yelled in the crowded theater ""Lame!"" Everyone agreed. Do not waste money on this trash."

","The Number 23 is a well-paced, cunning thriller that has you on the edge of your seat almost the entire time. With great performances by Jim Carrey and Virgonia Madsen, the story of Walter Sparrow, a local animal control officer, turns dark when he is bitten by a dog, making him late to pick up his wife, Agatha, in front of a used book store. Tired of waiting, she decides to go inside. She finds a book titled ""The Number 23: A Novel of Obsession,"" written by a mysterious man that goes by the name of Topsy Kretts. After skimming through the book, she decides to buy it for Walter as a birthday gift. Walter, hoping it is a fun read, finds the sinister twists it has to offer, while implanting the number 23 in his head. He starts obsessing over the number, trying his relationship with Agatha, and pushing on his mental stability. This movie is geniusly created, showing close to no signs of 23 in the beginning, and toward the end, every small corner you may turn to, there is a new 23 just waiting to happen. From colors to the alphabet to dialogue, 23 is shown in every place it can."

About 20-30 minutes into the film I was still thinking the same thing but hey Jim was being mildly amusing and Virginia Madsen was looking smoking hot...

","I only have one problem with The Number 23. How could someone obsess sooooo much over a number that it would cause them to commit suicide? Jim Carrey's character doesn't, but he goes pretty crazy. Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, a weird guy who is a dog catcher. One day while trying to catch a dog, his wife Agitha(The always welcoming Virginia Madsen)picks up a strange book called The Number 23. Walter ends up reading it and realizes something. It seems like the book is based off of his life. In the book, the main character Fingerling starts to obsess over the number 23. Because it's everywhere. Walter soon starts to see that the number 23 is everywhere he goes also. License plates, pictures of books, it's in the words he speaks(I was copying off of the suicide blonde, a character in the book). The Number 23 is from director Joel Schumacher, who usually does great films. Besides Batman & Robin. Jim Carrey didn't deserve as Razzie nomination. I actually thought he was pretty good. The Number 23 was a clever film. It is a film for everyone. Even for people who are horny( Because there are tons of sex scenes. The Number 23 has only one ridiculous thing. I do give it a recommendation."

"smkroh","8","2","4","29 June 2009"," Good Psychodrama, Not Bad Thriller
","Ah, the tyranny of expectations! I remembered this film was considered bad when it was released, but after watching it and thinking that it did its job well, I decided to go and find out what the critics had to say. A tomato-meter of 8%? Why? In a spoiler-laden analysis below, I will do my best to break down why I thought it was effective, and why I suppose most others didn't.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the average moviegoer presumably knows there is nothing ominous or dangerous about the number 23. What is unexpected and satisfying is that the movie and the characters in the movie know this too. It's not about evil forces or vast conspiracies centered around a number. It's about the seductive qualities of obsession and the fragility of a happy, normal life. I don't know why someone who was actually paying attention to the story would insist on the movie being ""about"" the number, but I suspect that most of the bad reviews spring from that stubborn misconception.<br/><br/>You start with a decent guy who leads an ordinary life. He finds a book that gets under his skin. It doesn't necessarily make sense that a guy like him would be so easily ensnared by the book's premise, but there is a lingering suggestion that there's more than just the conspiracy theory that gets to him.<br/><br/>I don't know if it was one of the movie's intentional red herrings or if I manufactured it in my own imagination, but my beginning belief was that an undiagnosed infection (rabies or otherwise) from the dog bite he suffers in the first scene would prove to be the fuel of his descent into madness. That fades out of likelihood rather quickly, but the story provides the justification that the book gets a grip on him via the perceived similarities between his life and that of the book's protagonist. It's a little thin, but it's enough to keep his obsession moving forward with a patina of respectability.<br/><br/>And this is one of the several places where the movie both plays fair and exceeds expectations. The answer to the riddle justifies that thin motivation both by revealing that the connection between Carrey and the book's protagonist is deeper than supposed, and that Carrey himself is more susceptible to obsession than he seems.<br/><br/>Another place where the movie goes beyond the status quo of the genre is in the non-cartoonish progress of Carrey's obsession. On some level, he obviously knows that it can't be real and that he risks losing himself and everything he values for an illusion. I felt the pain of his struggle to avoid falling into the abyss. There are pitfalls at every step. Maybe he will assault his wife. Maybe he will destroy his marriage by giving in to jealous suspicions about her relationship with a male friend. I kept expecting him to snap and for the movie to turn into a low-rent The Shining, but that never happens. Reading the book messes with his head, but whenever he puts it down and deals with the real world, he doggedly clings to an insistence on facing insane possibilities in the sanest way he can.<br/><br/>Even as the climax builds to the big revelation, the movie doesn't cheap out. He is given a gold-plated excuse to turn on his wife, but he still doesn't want to. He DID uncover a skeleton that was subsequently made to disappear, and his wife's hands ARE dirty. Lest we think the movie will take the cop-out of it being all in his head, his son was there as a witness. He, she, and the audience are never off the hook. I began to suspect where the plot was headed while his wife was exploring the abandoned mental hospital, but the depth and totality with which the book's hidden authorship would encompass all the threads of the story was still a surprise to me.<br/><br/>Family is powerful in this story, all the more so for steering clear of stock ""no one believes me, no one will help me"" thriller conventions. His wife's one act of apparent betrayal is actually an expression of how deeply she loves him and how desperately she wants to preserve what he is and means to her and their son. The son is eager to help his dad and willing to let the craziness slide for the time being for the sake of the father that Carrey has been. No eye-rolling, no lectures, no pat dismissals or hysterical denunciations--his family and friends are as desperate to save him as he is to be saved.<br/><br/>The movie sets you up to expect the story of a good man driven to become a dangerous, paranoid freak, but ends by revealing the tortuous road by which a dangerous, paranoid freak became a good man and fought to remain one. It meditates thoughtfully (for this genre, anyway) on what might constitute sufficient atonement for his past. It was once said that the best revenge is living well, and perhaps that is the best atonement too. His wife, understandably and forgivably, wants him to stop short of facing the music. She doesn't want to lose him and she feels (not thinks) that he has suffered enough. But it is a measure of just how decent a man he is that he must go all the way. The price will be high, but knowing he lived up to the ideals of the man he (and everyone else) thought he was is worth that price. And by choosing to pay it, he sets an example of integrity for his son that will leave a positive legacy for generations to come.<br/><br/>This movie deserves more credit for unexpected nuance, decency, and grace. Give it another chance!"

","As I heard from word of mouth that Jim Carrey was starring in a new film, I thought it would be great to watch, considering many other classics he had starred in (Ace Ventura, Bruce Almighty etc.), but then I was told it wasn't a comedy, and that the movie was actually going to be a thriller. From this, I was automatically unconvinced that the movie would be great. I was wrong I watched this movie recently, and I was quite impressed at how Jim Carrey changed his acting style in such a sharp way, and the fact that he did it well was also impressive. It has a strange storyline, and although I'm no hardcore movie critic, I found no obvious errors in scripts and I personally thought the movie was great in technical terms. The movie is scary, and at the same time, makes you think about whats happening. Its nice how the director has made everything add up in the ending, but I was disappointed not at the actual ending, but how things had turned out for Carrey and his family.<br/><br/>However, the movie can get a little boring and too 'blah, blah, blah' at some stages.

"Phantasm01","5","2","4","14 April 2007"," Not as bad as the critics say but still flawed....
","The Number 23 is a victim of the concept being much better than the execution. There is a decent plot here to create a very compelling thriller but the script cheats the film on many occasions. It's unfortunate because the film is drenched in a very hypnotic style and the performances are top notch. I suppose the script needed many more revisions before it went into production because what we have here is a fairly interesting, yet flawed movie going experience.<br/><br/>Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) is leading a seemingly normal life with a seemingly normal wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen), and a seemingly normal son, Robin (Logan Lerman). Everything changes the day his wife purchases a copy of a book entitled The Number 23 at a used bookstore. The book is about the obsession of the main character, a detective named Fingerling, with the number 23 in its various permutations. Walter becomes obsessed with the book. He senses an eerie connection between himself and Fingerling and, like the protagonist, he believes there's something important about how often 23 appears in his life. A psychologist friend (Danny Huston) suggests that he sees 23 everywhere because he's looking for 23 everywhere, but Walter ignores this sensible advice and begins to imagine conspiracies and murders.<br/><br/>This film currently sits with an 8% at Rotten Tomatoes.com which probably makes it one of the first truly univerally panned films of 2007. I'm here to say that the film isn't nearly as bad as those reviews would indicate. In my opinion this isn't a great film or even a very good one, but it isn't a film that should be thrown away and forgotten. There are a few things to rave about. I'm going to take a moment to take up for Joel Schumacher. Many people called him a hack after he destroyed the Batman franchise with Batman & Robin. After this debacle many people seemed to forget that Schumacher is capable of making really good films. Before Batman & Robin he gave us The Lost Boys, Flatliners, Falling Down, and A Time To Kill. After Batman & Robin he gave us Tiger Land, Phone Booth, and Veronica Guerin. These are all good films in their own right. He applies this visual approach to The Number 23. For the scenes within the book he creates a very compelling neo-noir world that is actually quite engaging to watch. I almost wish the whole film took place within this setting. Schumacher surely knows how to create style and its one of the best things about this film. I refuse to blame him anymore for Batman & Robin because after watching the special features on that DVD, it's clear that the film fell victim to studio interference. I think everyone should take a look back and re-examine how they feel about Mr. Schumacher.<br/><br/>The acting also works well. I was a bit worried about Jim Carrey being in this film because I didn't think he could handle certain aspects of the role. I don't question his abilities as a dramatic actor since he was quite good in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Truman Show. My concern was whether or not he could play the paranoia associated with the role and thankfully he showed me he could. This is a very nice turn from Carrey and it will probably be forgotten because the film hasn't received many great notices. It's not the best performance of his career but it's definitely something different for<br/><br/>him. As the Fingerling character within the book, he is oddly engaging. He does things with his body language and his eyes that are very subtle and effective. Virginia Madsen is saddled with the supportive wife role but she makes the most of it and probably makes it more compelling than it was on the written page. I think Madsen is a very good actress and it's nice to see her getting more exposure since she was in Sideways. She is also a wonder to watch during the neo-noir scenes but she is in too few of them. Her and Carrey share a decent chemistry that works well for the film.<br/><br/>Too bad the script lets them down. The 23 Enigma is an interesting concept and sometimes the film uses it well but it ultimately plays second fiddle to a rather bland murder mystery plot. If you pay enough attention the conclusion is easy to figure out and once you do, you have to suffer through 15 minutes of an elaborate explanation. It's unnecessary and poorly done. The last act of this film is truly a mess. The script becomes a muddled mess and the film ends with a whimper rather than a bang. It cheats some of the decent ideas that came before it and makes the film end on a very sour note. The film also has way too many cheesy moments that had the audience laughing unintentionally. I could've done without the dog popping up everywhere (it makes sense if you've seen the film) and some of the dialogue between the characters is a little unnatural.<br/><br/>The Number 23 has an interesting concept but unfortunately the film doesn't do much with. I can only recommend this for some of the nice visual tricks and fine performances, but even with that, I don't think it will be enough to satisfy the audience. You want the numbers to add up but they never do in this valiant, yet flawed effort."
"blue_brief","7","2","4","14 April 2007"," Heads Up to Jim Carrey
","This movie sure settles the deal on Jim Carrey's acting skills. He just pulled this one right-off, proving that he can be in comedy, drama, and even thrillers. The other casts weren't much of a help. But I'd say they were alright. The movie's plot maybe similar to many other movies such as The Secret Garden and more wherein huge stars such as Robert de Niro are a cast in. heads up to the creativity of the writers and the director. Somehow this movie's able to pull the audience into its story, with all the paranoia. Watching it sure made me lose my mind, counting letters of my own name as I watched it. Certainly, I won't be giving more credit to this movie than I already have.

After that point it becomes a little more interesting, but it never really lives up to it's potential. Joel Schumacher really has a knack for screwing up a movie, He seems to be unable to pull together a coherent story and instead seems to be focused on creating some sort of hip fashion sense that he has never been able to pull off. All you have to do is look at what he did to the ""Batman"" series to see that this guy does not know what he is doing.

However, the plot leaves a lot to be desired: the idea is nice, but more than a half is too slow and focused on meaning of numbers, without any events that would be helpful to comprehend what is going on. The last half an hour is more thrilling, but ending scenes are trivial, amount of twists and turns is limited. Well, I have lived for decades in the house No 23, but the movie did not give me any creeps :)<br/><br/>Additional points from me due to no aliens-ghosts etc involved, and for the fact that I did not figure out neither the truthfulness of the events nor the killer."
"eckhouse24","8","0","0","6 May 2007"," The Number 23 is fine performance by Carrey
","The Number 23 *** out of **** Joel Schumacher is a director who may forever be known for the disgrace that was ""Batman and Robin"" but Schumacher has done some pretty entertaining films, such as The Lost Boys, A Time To Kill, and Falling Down to name a few. ""The Number 23"" is another film I would throw on that entertaining list though it is not without it's flaws.<br/><br/>This film stars Jim Carrey who once again proves that he is more then just a slapstick comedy actor. In this film, Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, an Animal Control worker who is pretty content with his life but becomes obsessed with a book that his wife gave him after getting bit by a mysterious dog. He believes that the book is about him or at least mirrors his life. The main character in the book, a detective named Finerling (another character played by Carrey) becomes involved in a murder mystery that is somewhat disturbing and yet Sparrow seems to feel connected to everything that is going on. And as Fingerling in the book becomes more obsessed with the Number 23, so does Sparrow. The events in the book begin to mirror the events going on in Sparrow's life. Soon, Sparrow begins a journey to find out who the author of the book is.<br/><br/>The scenes with Fingerling are stylish, somewhat of a comic book feel. The ""real"" moments in the film have a nice dark and creepy feeling to it. The jumps from ""real"" to ""Book"" are done really well.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is alway to perfection. Jim Carrey gives a stunning yet erie performance. He plays Walter Sparrow with a sense of warranted sympathy yet you can't help but be afraid of him as you join him on his obsession. Virginia Madsen is Agatha Sparrow, Walter's wife. She plays the part so well that you feel scared for her as she is watching her husband fall deeper and deeper into obsession.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is stylish and fun to watch, filled with suspense however, I felt the ending fell a little flat. A flat ending can really derail a film and though this film suffers because of it, the acting, writing, and suspense keeps you into the film all the way to the end which makes it still worth watching."

There were a few plot holes that didn't fill out at the end totally, but all in all it came together and had a halfway decent ending.<br/><br/>Like I said, I really wanted to love this movie, but I only ended up liking it.

I never felt connected to the number or the process - like in A Beautiful Mind when Russel Crow is making all the connections - you see it too. Not so with the number 23. A lot of the examples didn't even add up to 23. They added up to 34 or had to be divided twice, etc. There is a decent twist, but how it comes about is not believable - it is just thrown out there with no depth. I did like the way the movie is shot and the dark aspect when he is ""reading"" the book is excellent. It wasn't so bad that I wanted to walk out, but I was glad it was free.

It was even kind of promising in the beginning.It didn't look bad, and premise -- that Jim Carrey becomes obsessed by a book he receives and begins to find strange significance and the number 23 in his normal life -- is interesting. Shades of ""The Shining."" But when the ""mystery"" was made clear, everyone in the theater just kind of went, ""Are you kidding me???!!!"" People were leaving the screening lamenting the hour and 40 minutes of their lives that they'd never get back.<br/><br/>Personally, I think Jim Carrey is actually a damn good actor.

","Greetings again from the darkness. I was so looking forward to this. A nice cast, an intriguing premise and a director with something to prove. All the ingredients, but in the end we have no cake.<br/><br/>Fascinating facts and creepy images and coincidences involving the number 23 are just skimmed over. Instead we are given what feels like 80% set-up and 20% explanation. What's missing? The guts of the story, that's what! The set-up drags on so long it actually becomes boring. There is so little suspense and so few thrills and so little drama, I am not even sure what to label the film ... other than disappointing.<br/><br/>I usually enjoy Jim Carrey in his serious roles, you know ... ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Majestic"". However, in this film he doesn't even seem like a real guy. Plus I couldn't help but think of ""Ace Ventura"" when we first realize he works for animal control. This film is just too dark and bland to allow his charisma to come through. Virginia Madsen is stuck in another thankless role. Can't someone please cast this charming, talented lady in a real movie? Support work by Danny Huston, Ed Lauter, Rhona Mitra (ex-""Boston Legal) and don't miss Bob Zmuda in a brief role. Zmuda is Andy Kaufman's former sidekick.<br/><br/>Really don't have much good to say about the execution of this one. Had high hopes and just feel let down. Not unusual for a Joel Schumacher film."

Jim Carey's acting was great. What's wrong in the movie is the story. It's way too confusing and complicated.<br/><br/>I watched this movie on DVD. It took me 3 times before I could finally finish.

However, if you have sleeping problem, this movie is much healthier than sleeping pills."
"Trelloskilos","1","3","8","26 July 2007"," What a wasted opportunity
","Firstly, let's imagine that the film wasn't called ""The number 23"", but was called ""The colour Blue"" (or any other colour except Purple). Imagine, if you will, that the main character comes across a book that seems to have an intimate link with his own personal history. Then imagine that the book instills in him a healthy interest in the colour blue. Suddenly, he goes round observing blue objects with unhealthy fascination. He thinks about the colour of his first school uniform, the fact that as a boy, he had to traditionally wear blue, he hears 'Blue Moon' on the radio etc. - are you gripped yet? No. Didn't think so.....<br/><br/>But hang on a sec....this is about numbers, particularly, a number that has a very important place in numerology, conspiracy theories, Illuminati history, religion etc. There is already an inherent mysticism about the number 23 that a casual Google search will reveal. Yet the film fails to exploit any of that. It might as well be the number 31, the colour blue, or the letter D.<br/><br/>So, now that the relevance & cultural impact of a number with a huge degree of potential to the overall plot has been grossly diminished, what do we have left? Well, we have a very confused plot remaining about a book, a string of highly unhealthy coincidences, a cast of characters who seem too quick (or too gullible) to believe in any old rubbish (For an even worse example of this, watch M.Night Shyamalan's 'Lady in the Water' and despair at a whole apartment block full of imbecilic residents!!), and then, a few disparate glitzy arty 'MTV' shots, just to give the film a bit of street cred. Jim Carrey doesn't lend much to the film, other than his name & star appeal. The film didn't benefit from his acting skills, and he didn't really benefit from the film. It could have been any faceless B-movie actor in that role & it wouldn't have made the film any more or less appealing.<br/><br/>The sad thing is, I enjoy a good film with a good 'unreliable narrator' twist in it (6th sense, Usual Suspects etc.), but there are increasingly too many 'bet you can't guess the twist' films that really ruin the genre. (starting with everything Shyamalan has done since the 6th sense, and every copycat film trying to jump a bandwagon!). Unfortunately, the worst thing about the Number 23 isn't the acting, confused plot, or the lack of incorporating the more esoteric aspects of 23 into the plot, but with the 'big denouement'. No, I didn't guess it, but when it finally revealed itself, I was totally underwhelmed. Then, to add insult to injury, the film went on for yet another 20-odd minutes with a very mawkish, tedious and overlong explanation.<br/><br/>There! Film review finished <br/><br/>(ooh! Spooky! That last line had 23 letters in it! Someone call a doctor!!)"
"rocknrollrebel","10","3","8","16 March 2007"," The Best Thriller Since The Sixth Sense
","It's funny that the same critics who panned comedy classics such as Dumb & Dumber and Ace Ventura pan this completely different film and criticize Carrey's performance. They're the ones who in their two-faced reviews told him to do better films.<br/><br/>I see the same thing happening with Adam Sandler, who has made several great semi-dramatic films in the past few years.<br/><br/>Eddie Murphy, twenty-five years and twenty family films since he revolutionized comedy with Delirious, is finally getting some respect, as is Bill Murray. Hopefully Carrey and Sandler won't have to wait that long.<br/><br/>On to the film itself.<br/><br/>While it's not Oscar material, it's the type of film that deserves some respect from critics. Critics praised Robert DeNiro for Hide & Seek and damn Carrey for this role.<br/><br/>Then again, the critics probably would have loved DeNiro in The Mask.<br/><br/>This is a hell of a film and probably the best thriller since The Sixth Sense or at least since Clint Eastwood's very underrated True Crime. See it too, by the way.<br/><br/>The film is about Walter Sparrow, a family man, and the book that changes his life.<br/><br/>About the ending: I won't give it away, but the critics must be out of their damn minds. Seriously, how the hell else are you going to end it? Anyway, go see this. One of Carrey's best performances so far."

Some people think its just silly and there was no reason for the subject to even be brought up. 3)People are just stupid and don't have anything better to do with their lives but complain. But seriously, give the movie some credit. It had good actors, pretty good acting, it was racy, thrilling, and it had its comical moments. Instead of being so strict, laugh at life a bit.

I really wanted this to be a great movie, I think Jim Carrey is absolutely wonderful in dramatic roles. I didn't realize until I sat down in the packed theater, that the director was none other than the batman killed, Senor Joel himself. I let that slide, hey, lost boys is good... when you're drunk. So, the premise was interesting, until I thought about it, then it just made me want to leave the theater. Jim Carrey does pretty decently, in the beginning, but in the final few scenes, when his acting skills are needed the most, he fails and the audience did nothing but laugh. Now, I don't blame the performance on Jim Carrey, an actor can only be as good as the man directing him..... Point made, this movie, other than being a laugh riot, was terrible. The first act was decent and then it spiralled to hell from there.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this movie... SPOILERS AHEAD.... Is when Jim Carrey sinks into madness and decides to stay at a hotel.... Now he brings clothes for the night, that's it.... And he sees this magical dog outside that he's been chasing, that follows him everywhere, so Jim magically grabs a tranquilizer gun, which mind you was the size of a shot gun, from his jacket and chases after this dog..... Because when I go out for the night, I bring my magical jacket that can hide my giant ass tranq gun, because who knows when you'll need a tranq gun.

"Coventry","4","3","9","7 June 2009"," 23, 2323 Moments of Sheer Silliness
","There was a time when Joel Schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors. Back in the late 80's and early 90's, when his name was attached to several great films like ""The Lost Boys"", ""Flatliners"" and ""Falling Down"", he truly was one of the most gifted directors in Hollywood. Then came the stupid ""Batman"" sequels, unfortunately, and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in Schumacher's hands. Both ""8MM"" and ""Phone Booth"" could have been much better films and even the incredibly imbecilic concept of ""The Number 23"" should have been processed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie. Literally from start to finish, ""The Number 23"" desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clichés from the big book of cinema history, including heavy-voiced narration, flashbacks, disorderly structure, characters with multiple personalities, numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings. Nothing helps, however, simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast & crew. As much as you try to associate with the lead character and be open-minded regarding the insane theories, this still remains a movie about a two-digit number and two-digit numbers aren't scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare non-comical role) is a bored animal trapper whose wife Agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday. The book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23. Walter almost promptly identifies himself with the book's protagonist (a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide) and begins to spot copious examples of the 23 enigma in his own private life. I did some research on Google and Wikipedia and, apparently, this whole 23 numerology nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly connected to this evil number. Well, that's just  crazy! But hey, I'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, regardless of how demented they are, and I can only share my humble opinion on a movie that is based on an out-and-out berserk enigma. ""The Number 23"" is not suspenseful, in spite of several gloomy set pieces and nasty make-up effects, and never at one point manages to make you contemplate about the role of numbers in your own life. All cast members perform below their normal capacities, but it was still nevertheless a joy to see the lovely Mrs. Virginia Madsen in a relatively big production again. Definitely not recommended in case you're looking for a solid and creepy evening of thriller fun, but endurable and not entirely without merit."
"xxChronusxx","Null","3","9","14 February 2007"," cinematically well done, but not a big enough payoff
","I saw this at a screening and while the story is actually pretty good with only a couple of holes, there is no big payoff and when the real deal is ""discovered"" near the end of the film, it was like oh, okay. Then you start asking your self why Virginia Madsen's character would do some of the things she did during the course of the movie. You could see it coming and it wasn't a real shock or surprise. It also wasn't as dark as the trailers made it seem. I was antsy through the first hour since it seemed to take forever to develop. There was a lot of voice-over material as well, so instead of visually seeing the story unfold, you have it read to you (It would actually work just as well as a radio show for that matter). There are a couple of interesting camera shots, some good cinematography and Jim's performance is atypical for him (in that it is not his usual comedic fare) and actually very good, but there really is nothing spectacular scene wise that warrants watching this on the big screen. rent it on a slow night."
"PhantomAgony","Null","2","5","3 March 2011"," The #23 = lunacy & disappointment
","I have wanted to see The Number 23 ever since the intriguing trailers aired on TV back when it was in theaters. Finally, years later later I got to see it & it was nothing but an utter disappointment - a plot filled with lunacy & a story filled with nonsensical writing. Let me be clear - I love psychological thrillers, even ones w/ a paranormal twist so The Number 23 was right up my ally which really shows just how bad this movie is & believe me, it is awful.<br/><br/>The only real Pro here is Jim Carrey's dramatic acting. He took dreck & ran with it & his performance is pretty good. Too bad the film he was in, is not.<br/><br/>CONS (Plot holes/Sloppy Writing) - <br/><br/>1) The conviction of the Professor for Laura's murder was hard to believe. Is it really conceivable that he would be hailed the murderer, no questions asked when Laura's boyfriend, the man she was cheating on, turned out to be crazy, had just tried to commit suicide & had left a confession of sorts as well as ramblings all over the wall of the hotel room he had jumped from? When the wrong man was convicted, why didn't the Doctor who read Walter's manuscript come forward? What about DNA evidence? The murder happened 13 years prior - the date of death on Laura's tombstone says 1991. It may not be the 21st century but we saw Laura cut Walter's hand before he killed her. His blood was ALL OVER that crime scene especially mixed all over the knife with her blood yet apparently none of that matters.<br/><br/>2) The son's age - too old. The murder happened 13 years prior, Walter than tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized for a period of time, he then first met Agatha when he was being released & a pregnancy takes another 9 months so the child should not be over the age of 11 tops yet he's clearly a teenager. No mention of the son not biologically being his.<br/><br/>3) In order to allow Agatha to move Laura's skeleton unseen, the movie had Walter/his son leave to find a pay phone to call the police. Cell phone anyone? This movie takes place in I am assuming 2004 since it's 13 years after Laura was killed (1991) so it's kind of unbelievable that they wouldn't have a cell phone.<br/><br/>4) When at first Walter thinks that his wife is 'Topsy Kretts' he mentions how her maiden name was 'Pink' & how it was mentioned in the book, etc.. but later we find out Walter is the the actual author of the book, the book he wrote before meeting his wife so is it just coincidence he used her maiden name? Odd.<br/><br/>5) Walter's Memory Loss - We are to believe that Walter blocked out the whole Laura part of his life. Fine.. the problem comes with the #23 being completely erased from his memory as well. As Walter reads the book, he draws on similarities between his childhood & Fingerling's childhood so that aspect of his memory is intact. We then learned that the #23 came into his life as a child after his Father committed suicide, so why couldn't he remember the #23 as an adult? That makes no sense..he can't have his childhood memories intact but conveniently not the ones about the #23. That's just bad writing again.<br/><br/>6) After Agatha gets the ID from the Doctor right before he committed suicide which really, makes no sense since he turned out to be completely innocent of all crimes - she finds the chest with Walter's manuscript/comics, etc.. Her friend, the Professor randomly shows up... Huh? Who called him? What was that?<br/><br/>7) Is it really believable that Agatha wouldn't take the book away from Walter after he started becoming obsessed to the point where he was having dreams about killing her? The obsession even started rubbing off on her son.. yet she just let them continue to read the book, the book that was causing Walter to descend back into madness. <br/><br/>8) Walter's past. Walter is an obsessive person. Is it believable that he wouldn't be curious about the part of his life that he lost? Wouldn't he want to know why he tried to commit suicide? Wouldn't he go back to the hospital and talk to the doctors? Apparently.. no which is just stupid. Even stupider is the fact that when the book was making Walter go crazy, not once did Agatha bring up his crazy past. Surely she knows that he had spent some time in a mental hospital. Heck, she met him as he was being released so she had to have known and if she didn't, that would be an even bigger plot hole. Obviously the movie didn't want to give Walter's crazy past away too early BUT after knowing the truth, it just makes for some unbelievable dialog between the husband and wife.<br/><br/>9) The dog, Ned. Everyone saw him. He existed yet his presence was some paranormal aspect of the story that was never explained. If he was sent to unveil the truth so justice could be served, why wait 13 years? If it's because Walter had just found the book & the #23 again, then why did the book wait 13 years to find him? Never explained.<br/><br/>10) A nit pick - Walter who is obsessed w/ the book & can't put it down seems to take forever to read the whole thing yet the wife, who surely wasn't obsessed seemed to have finished it in a day.<br/><br/>In a great movie, things like these can be overlooked but in a movie where nothing seems to work, these plot holes & ridiculous moments are evident & unforgivable.<br/><br/>3/10 is my rating."

After witnessing many a negative review on the film, I decided to check it out myself and I was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't say that this is the best movie ever. But it is much better than critics have given it credit for! The Number 23 is just as it sets out to be: a good psych thriller/mystery story that isn't too fancy or ridiculous. Granted, the fantasy world does require a bit of suspension of reality, but is it really that hard to watch a muscular, tattooed Jim Carrey? I don't think so.<br/><br/>But this film has merit other than physical attraction. I was very impressed by Carrey's turn at serious acting, and wouldn't mind if he tried it more often. Of course, comedy is his forte and he is talented at that. But this serious role was just as good as his comedic work. Critics didn't like it because they aren't used to it. But Carrey can't always be Lloyd from Dumb & Dumber; he is allowed to play more intelligent characters (I still love Dumb & Dumber, don't get me wrong). A performance like this helps you appreciate his diversity as an actor.<br/><br/>There were also many complaints as to how the film was written. What's to complain about? No, its not Inception. But its plot flows nicely, uses logical progression, and has a satisfying ending. It's an entertaining story that gets your mind going about just what numbers and relationships might mean to you.

","I absolutely adore this movie, despite a few minor issues. I found the story to be deep and intelligent with an incredible performance by all the cast. And the further the film goes the more you can feel the paranoia of the number, and that paranoia is what keeps the film feeling insane and amazing. There are hardly any scenes wasted and all the hidden 23s kept me looking for it, even after the film was over.<br/><br/>I've been hearing that a lot of people were having issues taking Jim Carrey seriously because of his previous works as a comedian. However, if you just look at him as a character and not think of his other roles while you watch the movie, he does deliver an incredible performance.<br/><br/>Now, here are my few issues with the movie. There are a couple plot holes that distract momentarily from the overall feel, but, if you're not paying attention you probably won't notice them. However, they are there none the less. The major plot holes were that some people did not react to a situation the way that they normally would, and the morals of one character in particular (I will not say which one so I don't have to put a spoiler alert on this) change so drastically that it is hardly believable, however, again, if you're not paying attention, you probably will not notice this issue.<br/><br/>The major thing that makes this movie so incredible is the paranoia. The story is great, the acting is incredible, and the projection of the entire film was exceptional, but the paranoia just drove the whole thing home and made it top notch. If you don't like films that are strongly relying on paranoia, then you have absolutely no reason to see this film. However, if you love paranoia as much as I do, then this is a film you cannot afford to not see."
"from_christmas_past","5","2","5","23 July 2008"," Tame as the enigma surrounding 23
","Hardly scary and mostly tame, The Number 23 is a film that neither succeeds as horror nor as a thriller. The numbers and incidents indicating the enigma of 23 are so far-fetched that it is difficult to believe any of those. The film is better in the first half when the suspense is built up using some slow, but occasionally intriguing, storytelling. By the end, the director tries to pull a Nolan-esquire twist to turn the story on its head and turning the movie into a sub-standard affair. Too much time is spent explaining the twist, quite contrary to classic thrillers that invite the audience to use their intelligence (and imagination). There are some nail biting moments, but they are interspersed between too many lifeless moments to have any impact. Left completely at the whim of a placid story, the actors struggle to perform in any memorable way. While Jim Carey tries to carry the film on his shoulders, we have definitely seen much better performances from him (comic or otherwise). Too convenient in its explanation of major plot elements and too slow to help you suspend disbelief, this movie is a mediocre fails to thrill. Watch it only if you are obsessed with 23 (and bad thrillers)."
"sme_no_densetsu","5","2","5","5 January 2008"," Irritatingly stylish with absolutely no substance
","This movie is handicapped with so many flaws that my enjoyment was hampered considerably. I hardly know where to begin.<br/><br/>First of all, who keeps hiring Schumacher to direct? The washed-out noir look is considerably overused and the direction is generally inept and/or derivative.<br/><br/>The acting seems worse than it is because the script is awful. Mainly because it takes the central concept too seriously to be appreciated by anybody but conspiracy theorists. Not only that, but large portions of the film are presented in a cheap, pulp fiction style that is obviously laboured. It's the kind of thing that might've been barely passable back in the '40s/'50s when that type of fiction was at it's peak. The main storyline at least keeps you interested but the attempts at seriousness are uninspired, to say the least.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, I persevered and stuck around until the end but, unsurprisingly, that was a disappointment as well. Watch the movie if you must but don't expect anything remotely close to another ""Truman Show"" or ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""."
"SteakSalad_101","4","2","5","29 September 2007"," A below-average, washed-up wannabe psychological horror film
","Usually when one comes across this film, their very first initial reaction is ""Jim Carrey in a horror movie? Er..."" Nevertheless they are still compelled to see it. As was I--but given the absolutely dreadful reviews ""The Number 23"" reeled in from distinguished film critics, I decided it wasn't worth my time and probably was just another lame excuse for a psychological horror film made in 2007. But today I decided, what the heck--we'll see if it's bad or good, as I paid a rough $4 at the Blockbuster counter to rent it.<br/><br/>The Number 23 is a psychological horror film that deals with a man named Walter Sparrow (Carrey) whose wife gets him an old book entitled ""The Number 23,"" which is about a sketchy detective named Fingerling who had a life filled with tragic loss, false love, murder, and above all, an unnatural obsession with the number 23. As Walter reads the book, he notices more and more striking similarities between him and the character, and it gets to the point where the number 23 becomes his central life figure as well, and slowly he believes he is transforming into the character that he thinks is a paper replica of himself.<br/><br/>Pretty weak storyline, eh? Yeah, I thought so too. Fortunately the film keeps itself on its feet (sort of) through skilled directing and editing, decent acting, an eerie atmosphere, a well-written screenplay, and just the sheer excitement of watching Jim Carrey in a role that is completely polar opposite of Lloyd in ""Dumb and Dumber."" Some scenes are extremely intense and shocking in a good way, ways that'll make you pull the blanket up to your chin, and eagerly await what happens next.<br/><br/>Other times you just want to go to bed. What is unfortunate about the movie is that the bad far outweighs the good. The decently-structured film is overrun and overkilled by extremely graphic and gratuitous sex scenes (75% of which really weren't necessary), laughably over-dramatic moments, and a ridiculously clichéd, washed-up ""twist"" that you didn't see coming because it's just so absurd in the first place. Many of the ""freaky"" references to the number 23 dealing with history are also factually incorrect.<br/><br/>Overall, it is quite obvious this film was a failed attempt at being a remembered Hitchcock-style psychological horror film and while it was an entertaining watch, I can't help but feel cheated out of that $4 I spent today.<br/><br/>I await the next great modern psychological horror film since ""Saw."""

","OK, ""The Number 23"" features Jim Carrey in another dark role. This time, he plays dog catcher Walter Sparrow, feeling sort of uncomfortable with his job. His wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) gives him a book with the same title as the movie. It not only tells a story which seems eerily similar to Walter's life, but also identifies various things relating to 23. As Walter reads further, he begins to sink into madness, worrying that the number might be more than a number.<br/><br/>The movie has an interesting plot - I must admit, I never knew that all those things related to 23 - although it seems silly at times (now that I think about it, the ending was a little predictable). I mean, anyone can find numeric patterns if s/he searches hard enough, and it could just as easily be a complete delusion. But more than anything, I like the sinister setting and Carrey's nearly deadpan expression throughout the movie. It does make you wonder whether or not 23 might hold the answer to anything in your own life. Worth seeing, if only once.<br/><br/>Oh, and the other loose connection to 23? The movie was filmed in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Cocoa Beach was the setting for ""I Dream of Jeannie"". ""IDOJ"" star Barbara Eden's birthday is August 23."

The movie itself has an excellent story line and it is so incredible what these writers come up with. I already posted a comment, and wanted to post another one to tell everyone just how wonderful this movie is. I am not too into scary movies, but this is more of a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I don't like the blood and gore, and this movie had enough to make me want to close my eyes, but not too much that I wanted to throw up somewhere. It was ablsolutely perfect!! OH, and the ending was incredible. It was not what I expected at all, and I was really impressed. The last thing you want is to walk into a movie and know the ending half way through.

","I am personally a fan of actors who go outside their normal genre and take on projects that are totally different. Like Ashton Kutcher, after doing That 70's Show and some other comedies, it was really cool to see him in The Butterfly Effect. Jim Carrey had already done this when he took on the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind project. By him taking on The Number 23, it shows how multifaceted he is as an actor. Although he will always be known for his comedic adventures, he should be remembered for also being involved in dramas and an amazing suspense thriller.<br/><br/>In the film, he plays an average everyday dog catcher, when suddenly ""fate"" takes over and he begins reading a book that seems to be about his life. He figures out how the number 23 relates to him in a million different ways.<br/><br/>The scenes from the book reminded me of Sin City with the darkness and contrast of colors.<br/><br/>It was an amazing movie i would recommend to anyone.<br/><br/>The ending will absolutely surprise you !"

Jim delivers a spectacular performance, i would recommend that you see this movie a few times in order to take everything in. the number 23 does have an eerie hold and this takes you in to see the odd things numbers can create, and takes away your sense of security knowing that something as simple as a number can drive you to the lengths shown in the movie. this is a must see."

The ending is a bit disappointing but even with that it was a really good ride more enjoyable for the journey than the destination and the acting was superb by all the people involved. The scenes felt tight and coherent and despite the complexity of the plot it was a really neat film that held together very well. The cinematography and settings were all very believable and some scenes in particular were truly dreamy and above par especially the ones that occur inside the novel. Jim Carrey did a great job of keeping his character serious and scary. The psychological torment of his character is very well told and very heart wrenching to the observer. There were a few cliché's and other minor imperfections but the movie seems to take a hip and savvy approach to old screen tricks which makes them seem less like deficiencies and more like witty directing and editing. This is probably the movie I've most enjoyed this year along with Pan's Labyrinth."
"DonFishies","6","2","5","24 February 2007"," An intriguing and thought-provoking idea, but a very disappointing film overall
","I was born on February 23. Right away, you can tell my interest in The Number 23, which just so happened to come out the same day. It did not look particularly good, but it was an intriguing idea and had Jim Carrey, who I have always been a big fan of. Sounded like an alright combination in retrospect, but less than stellar in reality.<br/><br/>Walter Sparrow (Carrey) is living a quiet life. He is a dog catcher, and on one fateful day, his birthday of all days, he is called in to grab a dog just before the end of his shift. He fails to get it, and as a result, is late to meet his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen). When he finally gets to her, he finds that she wandered into a book store and began reading a book. Entitled ""The Number 23"", she finds in intriguing and buys it for him. Slowly afterwards, the book and its titular number begin to become more than just an obsession for Sparrow.<br/><br/>Casually moving back and forth between Sparrow's slow obsession and the characters in the book itself, Fingerling and Fabrizia (Carrey and Madsen again), the film sets out to accomplish a lot. But with on again, off again Joel Schumacher at the helm, someone had to know that the movie was in jeopardy from the moment it started.<br/><br/>While Sparrow's story is told rather simplistically, the novel's story is told in all sorts of formats. It tries to be noir in many instances, and tries to be overly stylish in others. Half the time, you are sitting attempting to get involved in the really silly and boringly narrated story (again, by Carrey), and the other half is spent squinting attempting to see what is going on on-screen. The majority of scenes in these sequences are either far too dark or far too bright to make out anything distinguishing. Yes, we can see Carrey, and we can see other characters, but anything else is a real chore. It relies far too much on CGI, and far too little on the set design itself. And it got really annoying seeing some of the camera angles and slick editing techniques done during these scenes. They glared of being overdone and glared even moreso of overcompensating.<br/><br/>Overcompensating for what you may ask. And the answer of course, is the story. Yes, it is intriguing, but the end really does not satisfy what the beginning sets out for. It wants to be a psychological thriller, but it does not dare to dig deep within Sparrow's head. It wants to be a guessing game, but it only offers a few guesses before giving away the answers. It reeks of leaching off older films that did similar things, but were done so much more clearly, concisely, and better. Watching this just makes me think Schumacher had no idea how he wanted his picture to end, or even how he wanted the middle to be. Fernley Phillips was only a first time screenwriter during the production phase, so his cuts and edits would have more than been legit. But of course, he failed to act, and therefore has set himself up a simple twisty thriller that could have been a lot more complicated.<br/><br/>What is the real core of the movie, and what will essentially be why it was ever popular at all, is the titular number. I spent countless minutes before, during and after watching the movie trying to find combinations of numbers that would equal out to 23, or just already pre-existing numbers to see if I could find it. I did more than a few times, but it more than frightened me when I actually did. I felt the fear, and the desperation of wanting to be rid of it. But of course, I am stuck with it, and even now I am questioning where I can find other 23's. In that respect, the film delivers high in its thought-provoking nature, and even higher in the fact that you do not need to see the movie in order to become obsessed with the number and idea of the film.<br/><br/>Carrey does not seem totally at ease in his part. Yes, he pulls out the stops and has pitch perfect emotions, but he looks bored. He has the scheming look on his face of ""There really was nothing better?"" for about ninety per cent of the film, and the other ten per cent is at random crazy or happy intervals. He just lacks the spark needed to really make the film zesty, and unfortunately, having to hold up the film on his shoulders, Carrey fails.<br/><br/>Madsen is not all too bad as the wife stuck in the middle of the broken down husband. She plays the role convincingly, but it really does not look like there was much more for her to do than what she does do. If her part was written with a lot more action, than she may have been able to help life Carrey's performance, and actually made it worthwhile to have do. Danny Huston does fairly well for himself on the other hand. He is deliciously evil in one scene, and very subtle in one scene. You know from the start that something is up with his character, and Huston does a great job in ensuring that the audience never quite places what. Unfortunately, the script does not say much of his greater aspirations for the film, and as a result, only contributes to its disappointing finale.<br/><br/>On the whole, the film is disappointing and not all that great. But for the sheer idea of becoming obsessed with a number more unlucky than that historical number 13, it is a worthwhile and decent watch. Just do not expect anything more than average at best.<br/><br/>6.5/10."

","I just got back from the movie with my mom and it wasn't all that great to say the least. I admire Jim Carrey, but I didn't think this was his kind of movie because I have always seen him as a really funny guy, and his humor still flowed throughout the film. The storyline was original though. It was freaky how all those dates and letters and numbers and stuff add up to 23...hence the title, right? But yeah, if you're looking for a scary movie to clench up to someone else at, then pick a different one because overall it wasn't that suspenseful or scary.

"simonparker1990","7","2","5","24 February 2007"," 23 reasons for the Number 23
","The concept of the Number 23 has intrigued me ever since I first saw the trailer for the movie nearly a month ago. Until that point I was not aware of this bizarre myth of the number, I had no idea that supposedly the number 23 was the number that surrounded our lives, and influenced events that occurred. But then I saw the trailer, and ever since then, like Jim Carrey in this movie, I became slightly obsessed with the idea and the number. After doing a bit, well a few hours admittedly, of research I discovered some very disturbing and amazing facts about the number. For example, the 9/11 bombings occurred on the 9/11/2001, 9+11+2+1 = 23. Here's another one, the Hiroshima bombing occurred at 15:08, 15+8 = 23. And to the top it all off Mayans traditionally believed the end of the world would occur on the 23rd December 2012. For the year 2012, 20+1+2 = 23. Yep there's loads of little facts like that that all add up to number 23. Coincidence? Well that's up to you to decide, but ultimately your feelings on these bizarre coincidences will also affect how you feel about this movie. If you go into the film believing that this number 23 legend is a load of absolute rubbish and that none of it is even remotely interesting then you will leave the movie feeling exactly the same. If you do find the coincidences intriguing then you will be guaranteed to leave the cinema feeling very paranoid and slightly more aware of all the numbers you see in every day life. The Number 23 is a good movie, not a great one to be certain, but a good one. Its idea stands out the strongest and the performances from Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen are both brilliant. However the movie has many problems, maybe 23 of them? (spooky). Anyway the problems are usually small but still unfortunately noticeable. <br/><br/>Well now then, I'm going to list 23 good points for this movie, as I still did love it, I won't try the 23 bad points as that might take a long time for me to think up, but will instead do a brief summary of the bad points.<br/><br/>THE GOOD POINTS!<br/><br/>1. The plot is very, very interesting. 2. Jim Carrey delivers one of his strongest performances to date. 3. Virginia Madsen adds very good support in a role that could have been bland. 4. The films fantasy sequences look beautiful. 5. You'll have fun trying to guess the twist. 6. The nice little touches of the number 23 being practically everywhere will please eagle eyed people. 7. The opening credits are great. 8. The comedy at the beginning works well before turning very dark. 9. The movie never feels overlong, and has a decent run time. 10. The atmosphere in some sequences is brilliant. 11. The actual detective story for the book works very well. 12. Any sequence with Danny Huston is particularly memorable. 13. The murder bits are well staged without ever feeling ridiculous. 14. Jim Carry's character is very believable, even when he is ridiculously paranoid. 15. The music score adds great atmosphere without ever being stupidly loud and overbearing. 16. If you are a fan of the concept you'll adore the movie. 17. When the twist does come its explained pretty well, despite the fact I felt the twist was a load of rubbish. 18. The movie is wrapped up very neatly, surprising as after the twist I thought it would struggle to recover. 19. Errrm, errrm. Oh OK I give up now, god this is difficult.<br/><br/>Anyway just to wrap up what I've just written, the Number 23 has very many good points and I still do recommend it very much.<br/><br/>Now then, the bad points. Unfortunately the movies twist is just a bit too far for my liking. Some people might like it, perhaps it was just to silly for my liking. But in my eyes I felt the twist was just a poor way to wrap up what could have been a very decent murder mystery. The exactly 23 minutes of explanation after that might make it a bit more understandable and possibly verge on passable, but the fact is that it just never feels very good. The script also has big problems at times, while for the most part it is inventive and witty, other parts feel too clichéd and predictable. But perhaps my biggest moan has to go with Ned the dog, I won't ruin what Ned the dog is, but any scene I saw with that damn dog just made me either smirk or laugh out loud. It just seems a bit ridiculous and just took away an extra edge the movie needed.<br/><br/>Overall The Number 23 is a good movie that remains and intriguing and entertaining piece of cinema. But what could have been a brilliant movie settles for just a decent one, good performances and a brilliant plot are marred by a dodgy twist, some scripting problems, and of course Ned. Still if you are interested in the idea I recommend you see it as you are likely to like it, but if you're a bit against the idea there is a high likelihood you'll leave the cinema with the exact same opinion."

I won't even bother trying to précis the plot - such as there was - but what I will say is that everybody involved - especially Joel Schumaker - should be deeply, deeply ashamed.

A perversely idiotic take on the actual power of mathematics, with magic number patterns.<br/><br/>The film tries to have some stylish film noir undertones, in parts playing with colours and shadows. The music is unmemorable except for a terrifically hilarious saxophone number.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is uncharacteristically stilted, given his success just prior with Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.

I was rather disappointed to discover the sex scenes... they seemed fairly pointless most of the time, only serving to make it a 'grown ups movie', I suppose... I was curious about this film because I've never seen Jim Carrey in anything apart from comedy, and I have to say that I was half-impressed, half-disappointed... Plus I've seen way too many parodies of this movie to talk it half seriously... A lot of things were left unanswered... Like, who was the guy who came to pick up the boxes? And why was his PO Box address in the back of the book... bah.. Also the mumbling whilst adding up to 23 made it impossible for anyone to keep up with what was being said. But if you're looking for something, of course you're going to find it everywhere... if the movie was called 29, they'd come up with a whole heap of historical references for 29, AND make everything add up to it...

Jim Carrey seemed to try, but he spoke all his lines as though he were some diabolic cartoon character. The other actors all seem to try their best but are kind of wooden. The plot has a good basis, but the melodramatic lines make it dull and kind of stupid. I was laughing during the whole second half of the movie, and after five minutes of that I got tired of that.

If that reviewer reads this....IT WAS A STRAY DOG THAT, AS A DOG-CATCHER HE WAS SUPPOSED TO CATCH! THAT AND THAT THE DOG'S NAME ADDED UP TO TWENTY-THREE! Oh and to the reviewer that wonders why it is that if he loves the book given to him on his birthday by his wife Agatha as it only has twenty pages in it, well there are two things wrong with that. The first is that IT HAS MORE THAN TWENTY PAGES IN IT, AND THE SECOND IS THAT Every time HE COMES Across A PART THAT IS SIMILAR TO OR MATCHES/MIRRORS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN HIS LIFE HE GOES OFF AND THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATES IT AND EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED TO IT! I don't often give films a 10 rating but I have with this one and boy does it deserve it!

"moimoichan6","3","2","6","14 March 2007"," The 23 reasons why this movie sucks.
","1. Joel Schumacher is one of this director to avoid at all coast : his all filmography is a kind of joke (especialy when he tries to do serious movie : only ""Phone Both"" was watchable, thanks to the script and original idea of Larry Cohen ). <br/><br/>2. He has ruined the ""Batman"" franchise for years with is ridiculous and childish version of the Dark Knight, before Christopher Nolan reinvents the character. <br/><br/>3. Jim Carrey is a great actor, but he has to choose his director more carefully (that's the second time he's playing in a Schumacher's movie). <br/><br/>4. ""The number 23"" is one of this movie that tries to be intelligent and clever, but that just manages to be rather stupid and over pretentious.<br/><br/>5. It only fools the spectator with an apparently sophistical plot, useless complicated dialogs, and multiple but predictable twists.<br/><br/>6. It even quotes Albert Camus : come on Joel, you really think you gonna make us believe that you read more than a summary note of ""Le Mythe de Sysiphe"" ? <br/><br/>7. It pretends to be original but the all thing is a sort of copy of David Fincher's aesthetic and especially ""Fight Club"". <br/><br/>8. It's an opportunist and stupid copy, who pretends to be original and clever. <br/><br/>9. First copy of Fincher's : the opening credit, taken from ""Se7en"". <br/><br/>10. Second copy of Fincher's : the first scene uses the exact same time effect than in ""Fight Club"" : the movie begins, then the Narrator says that it began earlier, and we go back in time for a second flash back. <br/><br/>11. This effect is absolutely useless in the movie, as well as all the other effects, witch are just here to remind us we're watching a wanna be sophisticated thriller. <br/><br/>12. The thematic of the movie is exactly the one of Fincher's. <br/><br/>SPOILLER ALLER : METAPHORICAL SPOILER, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEE THE MOVIE, GO TO REASON 14 AND IF YOU SAW ""FIGHT CLUB"" BUT NOT THAT MOVIE, (wich is a very wise choice), GO TO REASON 15 (and if you haven't see Fight Club, go to see it, why are you wondering if you should see ""The number 23"", while you can see the original thing ?) <br/><br/>13. It's allays the story of a man who looking for evil, in order to fight it, until he realizes that he's the devil he's looking for, and has to kill himself to exorcised it (see ""The Gamme"", ""Alien 3,"" Fight Club"", and... Oh yeah, ""The number 23"", how strange...) <br/><br/>14. And I'm not even talking about the ending, witch totally belongs to the ""Fight Club"" universe, and that we saw 10000 times since : it's not new nor original since 1999!!! <br/><br/>END OF METAPHORICAL SPOILER <br/><br/>15. The all obsession about the number 23 is rather ridiculous and never credible. <br/><br/>16. The fictions scenes of the book are equally realistic and grotesque than the others : isn't there something wrong here? <br/><br/>17. The all script is predictable and grotesque.<br/><br/>18. Jim Carrey's wife 's reaction is an absolute nonsense : the spectator doesn't understands the reasons of his obsession, how could she ? <br/><br/>19. And what about her nice best friend, who's ready to do anything in order to help the husband of the woman he loves ! <br/><br/>20. In fact, all the secondary characters are barely developed and they are all absolutely not credible (especially his family and his son...) <br/><br/>21. A lot of scene are absolutely not necessary, whereas lots of points are to be develops (especially the way Carrey's becoming obsessed by the book and the number 23...) <br/><br/>22. If I'm putting a 3 and not a 1 to this movie, it's that I also have 23 reasons why I enjoy the movie (a little bit) : and they're all : JIM CARREY. But that only shows the arbitrary of the number once again. <br/><br/>23. Do you really need another reason not to watch this dull and pretentious movie ?"
"Quinoa1984","4","2","6","6 March 2007"," this maybe could be a little more tolerable as a half hour Twilight Zone episode...wait, without commercials, 23 minutes!
","That is one of the goofy comparisons you might make, as I did, when this goofy psychological thriller ended. Because despite what might have been director Joel Schumacher and DP Matthew Libatique's loftier intentions with the grit and 'mainstream-noir', the writing ends up cramping up everything that might have been worthwhile. There is a premise here, just not one that goes down very fast in anything that seems sharp or with a real edginess that I could have latched onto. Fernelly Phillips, on his first feature as a screenwriter, comes out with many ideas and gimmicks and, to be sure, contrivances that reminded me of the gimmicks I saw from the lesser screenwriters at my film school- it's almost like pulling together some kind of general theme and extending it to see if something really sticks about obsession and the symbolism of numbers, or *a* number in this case as the be-all-end-all of meaningful numbers. Maybe if he had focused his energies on more of the noirish aspects of the characters, as opposed to flaunting the number 23, I wouldn't still be making jokes about numbers adding or equally somehow to 23, and almost hating myself for making those jokes at the movie's expense.<br/><br/>Maybe it was to be expected that Schumacher, who hasn't really made a very satisfying film since the mid 90s, would gravitate to material like this that would at least allow him some time to exercise his 'weird' directorial chops. And really, there is some potential in this as well; Carrey's dog-catcher protagonist is given a book on his birthday (which is on 2/3, ho-ho) called the Number 23, which deals with a sax-playing detective with a dark past who gets involved with an even darker, more sadistic woman (Virginia Madsen, who also plays the 'real-world' wife of Carrey's character, as he envisions it as he reads it anyway), and the sadism and murder and madness that ensues. If there was just a straight adaptation of the book AS the movie, or if the archetypal figures that lay in this pulpy world inspired in part by serial novels were just put forward simply without the number symbolism, it would be a much more intriguing movie. Especially because said 'imagined' scenes showing what happens in the book are shot in a perfectly abstract style, where even in the choppy edit parts there's still a vicious vision going on. These sparks indicate that there COULD be some talent in writer and filmmaker.<br/><br/>As for Carrey, he seems to be just going through his motions for what he can do as an actor (as with Madsen, up to a point), but it's not enough to stop what happens with the script, which at times seems to be going at lengths to continue that montage in Pee Wee's Big Adventure when Pee-Wee sees all the bikes going by when his is gone. Soon Carrey's ""every-man"" sees it everywhere, with numbers adding up, the combinations endless, and it all leading to what ends up being so predictable I wouldn't dare spoil it not because it's very important but just to not insult your intelligence reading this. Just let it be known that Phillips decides to take that easy-route of the main character really having to face head-on everything that he's encountered so far and then re-contemplate everything in his entire life. This, which makes up the last fifteen minutes, is excruciating in the length of the exposition, with all the answers spoon-fed to the audience so that nothing is left questioned about who this man really is or what he's done. It compounds what has already gone on with the pretentious obsessive qualities, of it being about the 'trick' instead of it being more interesting about characters (the very last scene also made me shake my head and do all but throw popcorn at the screen).<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's a pretty stupid entry in the careers of both actor and director, which also happens to include a supporting character of a dog named Ned (who provides a very unintentionally funny scene with the dog on one end of the road and Carrey in his car at the other), Bud Cort in the thankless role, and lots of big-budget attention paid to the grungy details of what is under a happy existence to reveal the wretched skeletons in the closet (or rather under a stone in a park). It's too conventional, in all actuality, to follow up on the daring it portends in the already pushy trailer and ads."

","A gal buys her guy a book to read. It's called ""The Number 23"" and it advertises itself as a trip into the heart of paranoia. The guy, not the reader type, starts reading it reluctantly and slowly. But the more he gets into it, the more parallels he finds between the book and his own life. Well, that's paranoia for you alright.<br/><br/>Storywise this film isn't too bad. It relies a bit on the ability to believe in numerology but not so much that it becomes completely unwatchable when you don't believe in such. The things that happen aren't too out of the possible, and with that it becomes a pretty much OK mind warping thriller film. I say pretty much OK because it fails to get out of the ""thirteen in a dozen"" range for the most of the time.<br/><br/>The actual build up of the film (acting, music etc) isn't half bad, it works well enough.

","Jim Carrey surprises us here by appearing in a serious mystery suspense movie. In the beginning, we can still recognize his smart-alecky sense of humor, but this disappears as the movie follows the paranoid obsession experienced by the protagonist, Walter Sparrow.<br/><br/>I like the fact that his whole family is involved in the development of his problem. I like the father-son relationship displayed, as Walter interacts with his son from beginning to end. His wife is played very well by Virginia Madsen. I was about to say ""played very smartly"", however, I remembered that it was her critical yet inexplicable action in the beginning of the movie that triggered the whole tragic chain reaction Walter had to undergo.<br/><br/>Bottomline, I expected something more. The weak set-up made the ensuing problem situation was too contrived. Despite majority opinion, I was satisfied with the ending. It is just that the route that director Joel Schumacher took towards that ending was unsatisfying."

","One of Jim Carreys more serious roles but a great one at that."
"VenturousArtist","4","1","2","20 January 2020"," ""The Equation is Perplexing.""
","The Number 23 is an intriguing concept starring Jim Carrey as Walter Sparrow, a lighthearted but somewhat disturbed dog catcher, who becomes introduced to a mysterious book entitled ""The Number 23"" by his wife Agatha portrayed by Virginia Madsen. Initially, Walter doesn't seem phased by the book until he soon descends into absolute madness realizing he's more connected to the writing and author.<br/><br/>As already mentioned the concept is intriguing but the overall execution is middling. Walter's deranged journey uncovering the depths of clues further explaining his connection found in the novel, including why ""23"" is specifically endangering, has great ideas but wacky structuring and pacing. While the cinematography and soundtrack steal the show, the other half with writing and performances could've had more adjustments.<br/><br/>Once we're introduced to Walter's culprit of obsession we're also introduced to another story that seemingly outweighs the main premise. Although they're connected the other story following a detective named Fingerling has more flair. With better writing, either as the main premise or told differently, it would've been more intriguing. The same goes for Walter's story as we're introduced to other characters serving great importance to his ongoing misadventure.<br/><br/>But neither characters and premises in the main or parallel stories are given enough exploration for enjoyment. There's instances where certain unexpected twists and subplots are introduced but the film's length and structure doesn't help enough. Even when Carrey portrays one of his absolute disturbing performances the film doesn't give him enough time or ways to convince audiences.<br/><br/>With two different convoluted stories occurring, and many underutilized ideas wasted, the film never reaches its fullest potential and feels lesser about the importance of ""23"" when it's more focused mixing concepts. Mathematically speaking, there's also not enough equations to make the film more interesting without seeming convenient to elaborate anything happening. The obsession of the number becomes totally sidetracked by unanswered questions and ideas that makes things more disjointed and implausible.<br/><br/>The equation is perplexing."

Carrey's acting is lethargic and the secondary cast are poor and uninteresting. <br/><br/>Let's start with the premise; a man obsessed with the number 23, okay, I'm all for original plots, but the writer made little effort to make the phenomena believable.

"MovieMusings","7","1","2","10 January 2009"," not as bas as critics suggest
","SPOILER ALERT - Only read this review after you have seen the movie. In my opinion, you would not be wasting your time in seeing it, but if you do, reading this review will help confirm that, contrary to what so many others might argue.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey continues to infuse his work with a hint of religious or moral message - this movie ending with a Bible quote may have triggered sub-conscious rejection by all those who out and out hate on this movie, which does have a pleasant ending.<br/><br/>The ending, by the way, has the protagonist saying something to the effect that ""this may not be the ending you want, but it's the way it should be,"" as they protagonist did ""the right thing"" at his own cost.<br/><br/>The movie isn't really about the number 23, although on the surface everyone wants to make it out as such. That's the problem - it's disappointing if the issue is supposed to be about the numerology, weak as it may be.<br/><br/>This is a film about a disturbed fellow who killed someone, hid the body, framed an innocent man who went to prison for the murder; wrote a confession which one of the psychiatrists who dealt with his treatment took possession of and rewrote as a novel. That novel manages to end up in the protagonist's hands, and as he reads he can't help but recognize parallels in his own life that begin to awaken the repressed memories he had of his real life before the attempted suicide.<br/><br/>The madness in which he wrote the book; the re-write that obscured some of the real connections, and his own psyche are the reasons the protagonist had to go through the process the movie follows.<br/><br/>Ultimately, upon remembering everything that happened, what he did, etc., his decision to ""make things right"" by admitting to the crime, freeing the wrongfully convicted, and being sentenced to serve time for his crime, all on the basis that as a father who wants to send a clear message to his son about justice, this was the right thing to do, is satisfying.<br/><br/>The meandering path the movie followed to get to that point may not have been perfect, and the somewhat preachy tone of the narrative followed by the imposing Biblical quote from Numbers 32:23, ""your sins will find you out,"" may rightly have left a bad taste in some viewers mouths.<br/><br/>But, the resolution that a crime that had not been properly solved was now clear and a person who owns up to his guilt and anticipates a life of clarity after facing his consequences with the full support of his family appeals to one's inner sense of rightness and goodness and honesty and justice.<br/><br/>Perhaps we've become so jaded and cynical in the current state of affairs in our world today that such purity can't be taken at face value.<br/><br/>I would suggest, however, that the manner in which the protagonist's mental condition was presented is a tad curious. Could someone go through such a change of condition over time, from a confused young man from a home with a father who commits suicide who kills his girlfriend in a jealous rage, buries her, frames an innocent to take the fall, writes a convoluted confession infused with pseudo-numerological rantings and then jumps to his intended death to a psychiatric hospital for therapy who leaves the institution ""cured"" even though he has no recollection of what happened? What life could he possibly have? He settles down in a job which he keeps, has a beautiful wife, a cool teen kid for a son, and mental and emotional stability with no relapses, no recurring nightmares that seem oddly real, no nothing until the book shows up through ""providential"" circumstances? Are we really to believe the dog saw him bury the woman, understood this to be wrong, and showed up at the restaurant knowing the protagonist would be along and would allow the dog to lead him to the grave, which triggered no recollection in his mind at the time? And, why would his wife remove the bones of the girl? If she knew nothing of his past, she'd have no motive to ""protect him"" from anything, since she would not have assumed the bones had any connection to him.<br/><br/>There are not a few questions that pull at the over-all execution of the story in film. A perfect movie this is not.<br/><br/>But I've seen plenty stupider movies get much better reviews than this one, and that seems odd to me. A movie with a moral message needs to be given the benefit of the doubt, in my opinion, because too much time is spent on senseless entertainment that often must pander to the lowest sensibilities (toilet humor, sex, violence for the sake of it) and leaves nothing to inspire any sense of higher ideal. This movie attempts to do so. Maybe poorly, but the attempt itself is worthwhile."

He stars as Walter Sparrow, a dog-catcher who is given a book by his wife for his birthday. As he reads the book more and more, he starts noticing similarities between him and the main character and slowly begins an obsession with the number 23.<br/><br/>If you were to tell someone 10 years ago that Jim Carrey would play the lead character in a serious thriller, they probably would have laughed in your face. After starring in Liar Liar, Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber, it's hard to imagine that he would be able to pull off this kind of film, but he does, although Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind had all ready established him as a serious actor.<br/><br/>The Number 23 is a very thrilling movie and will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. With twists and turns around every corner, it certainly had me guessing right until the very end.<br/><br/>This may sound strange, but The Number 23 actually put a curse on me for a few weeks after my first viewing of it and I'm sure it did for many, many others. What I mean by this is that whenever I saw a bunch of numbers, I would add them up to see if I could make 23 and if I could, I was completely freaked out by it. Also, I was seeing the number 23 everywhere I looked, although it wore off after a while.<br/><br/>One thing that I think The Number 23 needs more of is humour. The problem with it is that it takes itself too seriously and I would have thought that with Jim Carrey in hand, it wouldn't have had this problem.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Number 23 is still a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat movie. I give it 8/10."
"blairgallop7","8","1","2","29 July 2008"," An underrated yet good thriller
","A movie that is mind-bending and compulsively watchable,The Number 23 is a good example of a true psychological thriller.Many things in the film were either unexpected or not expected.The film focuses on Walter Sparrow(Jim Carrey) who begins reading a novel by the name of The Number 23 which focuses on a character called Detective Fingerling(also played by Jim Carrey) which Walter sees as similar to himself.Virginia Madsen and the rest of the cast were also good but in a way,Jim Carrey stole the show.In my view,Jim Carrey gives one of his best but also most interesting and different performances of his career.He proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he can be a serious actor to be reckoned with.It is a bit of a shame that he was nominated for a Razzie Award instead of a Golden Globe or Oscar for his performance as well as getting negative reviews and being underrated.It was directed and written well.Good effort,though."

","There seems to be an overall negative feeling about this movie and I can't understand that. This movie was definitely creative, there was no movie like it. It was interesting, and I am sure that if someone looked into their own life they would discover that something adds up to 23. For Example I'm Married July 26, 08 (7+2+6+8=23) It's amazing the things you can find in a conspiracy like this.<br/><br/>Jim Carey was actually good stepping out of his normal role as a comedian, he was a lot better then Robin Williams in 1 Hour Photo. He was entertaining and gripping. There are twists and turns and things you don't expect. The Supporting Characters added an interesting comparison to the main character.<br/><br/>The movie was interesting and worth the watch.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"piattbruner","7","1","2","27 May 2008"," A must watch, in a ""one time only"" kind of way......
","Now as with most movies that are watched in a friend's basement at three in the morning, they always seem insanely great for that first thrill. Now of course, being it three in the morning, anything that isn't an infomercial would most likely thrill you. In my personal opinion, 23 was a good movie. A little bit better than just okay, but not exactly great. While it stayed with me for a few days after watching it, and while it made my friend a bit TOO paranoid a couple nights afterward, the second time around with 23 wasn't as amazing as i had remembered it. While it was nice to see Jim Carrey playing another role other than that of the nice funny shy guy, and while the story itself was different than i had thought it would be, something just didn't make the connection with me. Detective Fingerling seemed a bit to generic, as did all the other alter-egos that portrayed the people in Topsy Crets' uncanny book on Walter Sparrow's (Carrey) life. There were parts in the movie that were also just a little bit pointless (it might only be me, but i didn't quite see the whole purpose of the suicide blonde character). As confusing as parts of the movie were and how disappointing the ending was (Carrey finds out that Topsy Crets aka""top secrets"" was really...himself. And that Carrey suffered from amnesia after a failed suicide attempt) The first three fourths are pretty great. The acting was good and the movie was filmed beautifully. If you have not seen this movie yet, I would still recommend watching it at least once if you see it on TV or come across it at a video store. If it still doesn't quite grab you the first time watching, check it out again in a dark quiet room in the wee hours of the morning. Everything just seems a little bit more mystifying that way....."
"eirenightshade","9","1","2","29 January 2008"," Profoundly Unnerving
","I was immediately interested in the basic plot of this movie; a man who is obsessed with the number 23 because it is somehow connected to every part of his life. I had no idea what I was going into when I started watching it, but I wasn't expecting much. The commercials I'd seen for it seemed typical of the generic mystery-thriller that are a dime a dozen these days. I'm not too proud to admit I was absolutely, 100% wrong.<br/><br/>This film has taken quite a bit of heat for being ""predictable"", but even if you DO end up guessing how it will end and dismissing it as predictable, I think you simply can't think outside the box. One of the things I realized in retrospect after watching this film was that throughout it, I didn't care how it would end. I didn't think about it. The storytelling, superb performances, and the general setup that was established within the first 20 minutes was so real and engrossing that I actually felt like I was a part of the story rather than a casual observer. It draws you in and makes you a part of the dark, grimy world of Walter Sparrow. This is not a film anyone should sit through if they are shallow enough to only care about the ending. The thing that makes this a great piece of film is that throughout it, you KNOW that something isn't quite right with Walter Sparrow. You can see that from the very first scene in the movie, so clearly the writer had never intended the ending to come as a big shock. I think they succeeded perfectly in making a movie where you breathe the character's breath, walk in their footsteps, and feel their frustration. THAT is what makes The Number 23 so heart-stopping and suspenseful. You don't watch it from the comfort of your living room...you watch it from the eyes of a paranoid, obsessed, unhinged man whose life is spiraling out of control. THAT is what makes this movie brilliant. Anyone who criticizes this film for being predictable is just not able to grasp that there really is something much deeper going on then just two hours of action and a cookie-cutter ending. The writer of the film obviously intended to do something original and he pulled it off flawlessly."
"raymond-15","7","1","2","13 January 2008"," Something different for Jim Carrey & something original for movie goers
","This film is worth seeing both for its original theme and for the stunning dramatic performance of Jim Carrey. It's a psychological thriller about obsessive behaviour that can drive a victim to madness.<br/><br/>Numbers are a part of our every day lives whether we are concerned with distance, time. prices or a day at the races. A number on a baker's van could foretell the winner of the steeplechase. All you have to do is convince yourself that numbers are more than just numbers; they have a special message or a special meaning.<br/><br/>In this movie the number 23 is all important, and a rare book published on the subject has 22 chapters which Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) lives by. The interpretation of the numerological arguments gets him into a lot of trouble including some wild and dangerous nightmares.<br/><br/>It is completely fascinating that important dates of world events when separated into single digits can add up to 23; not just one or two events but very many. You are more than half convinced there is something in it. But while you are thinking about it Walter comes to some serious conclusions and makes accusations that will change not only his life but the lives of others.<br/><br/>For something original and different, this film fits the bill. I loved the epilogue.....a quote from the Holy Bible. And would you believe it, verse 23?"
"slwp_moussau_69","9","1","2","12 January 2008"," Sends chills down your spine
","What a movie, it had it all- suspense that kept you on the edge of your seat, murder and lies that makes you wonder,humor from a truly hysterical guy Jim Carey, the balance between coincidence and reality where you it makes you really think what if? There's nothing better than a movie that makes you questions your own beliefs or really gets you thinking and this movie does that. You don't have to agree with all the theories said.... i know i didn't but it truly keep you thinking the whole movie.<br/><br/>The actors were superb, the plot was ingenious and very much unique. To be able to create a whole movie just around a number and the concepts behind it was just brilliant. Fast paced,clues and symbols here and there.... what more can you want. Although Jim Carey's hair was questionable lol thats about the only fault to the movie but who really cares about that.<br/><br/>P.S Just remember one thing after you watch this movie... don't get obsessed with the number, obsession is a killer. I rate it 9/10. Go see it."
"dan_marsala","7","1","2","20 December 2007"," great for smart people
","To be honest, when i first watched this movie I wasn't really focus on it. Thats why I didn't get it at all, but at the end I didn't lose the rhythm of the whole deal. If this isn't based on another idea, then i think this is the best screenplay I've read in this year. I don't know where did they get all those 23s but they really spend some time. Thats the deal with have nothing to do with your time, isn't? hehe...just kidding. Jim Carrey is a great dramatic actor, I'm a big fan but i've never watch a dramatic movie played by him, I usually watch him doing comedy, so he is another surprise . The ending was un-expected,too. In these days is very wear to find someone that takes the right chose in a movie"
"davetex","7","1","2","17 November 2007"," This movie is better than everyone says
","Recently, I came home from the video store with this one and ""1408"". I told my wife that the night's movie theme was horror movies based on numbers that got lousy reviews when they came out.<br/><br/>1408 lived up to my expectations (see my review), but this one was considerably better than I expected.<br/><br/>You have to admire really funny guy Jim Carrey for trying so very hard to break out of being endlessly typecast as the really funny guy.<br/><br/>Sometimes he is more successful than he is here, but frankly, I think he does a pretty good job of it, given what he has to work with. I suspect that this movie never would have been made without him and that he signed up because the story let him play so many different types of persons. He gets to play Walter, the nice guy, and also Walter, the tortured soul, and most fun of all, Fingerling, the weird goth/film noir detective. Sometimes, the real Jim Carrey, a really funny guy, peeks out from time to time, but on the whole he plays it straight. Trouble is, we keep seeing Jim Carrey, the really funny guy. Whoever thought it was good idea to make him an animal control officer as Walter, forgot about Ace Ventura, and well, the audience probably didn't forget. It sure occurred to me.<br/><br/>The animal control officer designation is necessary, I guess for the ""dog"" plot device that is used in the film, but I think I would have tanked the dog and used a crow or something and made Jim Carrey an accountant or some such. And anyway, how does an animal control officer get such a really amazing house? But, that's all nitpicking.<br/><br/>The plot line is a bizarre mishmash of ideas and is convoluted and contrived, but I thought the direction and in particular the camera work was very good. The lighting in particular, I thought excellent.<br/><br/>The cast is well chosen and they all do their jobs competently, but the really interesting thing is watching Jim Carrey, as always, in a Jim Carrey movie. The guy can act, no doubt about it. I find it ironic that he is so good that he can do comedy like literally no one else (which everyone will acknowledge is very difficult to do well and all the junk that comes out under the National Lampoon or Saturday Night Live Alumni brands is proof of that) but he seems to want to be a ""serious"" actor. <br/><br/>Keep trying Jim, I'll keep watching."
"p_j_taylor2003","8","1","2","24 October 2007"," Poor mans memento/Secret window.
","Jim Carey stars as I like to see him....Straight! His countless performances as a clown, have meant that I'm automatically put off his films. I also read a few reviews before I watched the film, so I wasn't over enthusiastic. There probably lies the reason I thought this was actually quite good....Yes you can pick holes in the storyline all day long. But this kind of film appeals to me. Think of it as Secret Window with a big influence from Memento. Because of that, you can't level any marks for originality, and at 8/10 I reckon I've probably marked it a point higher than perhaps it deserves. But I wanted to bring an air of respectability to its meagre 6.3....Its better than that surely?!?"
"gavin6942","7","1","2","30 September 2007"," Far Better Story Than the Consensus Let On
","Jim Carrey stars as a man who discovers a book with striking similarities to his own life. He becomes obsessed with the book and its fascination with the number 23. Eventually, he discovers the book is not a story at all but a confession of a real-life murder, and the second half of the film deals with him trying to find the author of the book (the killer).<br/><br/>When this came out in theaters, I was mildly interested in it. More for the number 23 than for the story or Jim Carrey. Numerology is an interesting thing, and while I don't believe in it I find it can be played out very well in films. This film is no exception -- the writer made sure to fully cover the obsession with the number as well as the rational explanation of how it can appear so often in the natural world. I appreciate the second part especially.<br/><br/>Many people, I think, were afraid of Carrey taking on a serious role. He does have a difficult time being perceived as serious by fans, and even I thought he seemed unnatural. Don't get me wrong -- ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is an amazing movie, and Carrey was wonderful in it. Here, too, he comes across as dramatic and dark -- a raw, sexual beast with a shady past. I never expected a Carrey of this magnitude and it's a nice change.<br/><br/>Tom Lenk shows up briefly, as a book store clerk. Every time I see Lenk I feel bad -- he always gets one or two lines in his movies, but never a leading role. Please, Hollywood, this is a funny man. If not a main character ,at least give hi ma supporting role that really adds to the story. If Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd can make movies where they just show up and make crack comments (thank you, Judd Apatow) then so can Lenk.<br/><br/>This movie has some twists and turns and doesn't really pick up until they begin to track the killer. Even then, it twists and turns some more. I suppose some people could have predicted the ending or a few of the twists, but I didn't. And that really impressed me -- an ending that made sense and was not foreseen. Sure, some parts stretch the imagination and reality a little bit, but nothing seemed impossible.<br/><br/>I found this to be one of the better thrillers or semi-horror (if we use horror very loosely) films to come out in 2007. Over all, this has been a disappointing year. Other than, say, ""Vacancy"" I really wasn't all that impressed. So, this might be the drink of fresh water some people had been waiting for. I know I was pleasantly surprised and impressed, and I hope you will be, too."

","Just got done watching the Number 23... Ever since I heard the premise I was dying to see it, abstract ideas like this really get me thinking and on that level Number 23 doesn't disappoint...<br/><br/>The movie opens by making you feel for Sparrow (Carrey) by showing you his somewhat boring life and highlighting his relationship with his family, which is really important... Slowly the warm and fuzzy feeling dissipates... Sparrow's wife Agatha buys him a book for his birthday, a book called The Number 23, and immediately Sparrow begins jumping to conclusions, drawing parallels, and computing nearly every number or word he comes in contact with, somehow they all come out to 23... Sparrow seems to be losing his sanity, but then switches into ""detective"" mode to find the author of the book who, according to Sparrow, is a murderer...<br/><br/>The movie contains a twist or two but they really aren't that great, though there is a period of ambiguity when you're on the edge of your seat wondering ""WHO WROTE THE BOOK!"" and its not guaranteed you'll be right as there are quite a few characters to chose from...<br/><br/>The movie left me with questions, they never address whether Agatha knew what she was getting into when she bought the book or if she stumbled upon it by chance... as for the ending it wasn't the ""out with a bang"" some were perhaps expecting, but thats better as far as I'm concerned, and the movie cuts off leaving you with a mystery, room for the imagination to play...<br/><br/>It's an intriguing movie, not without its flaws, but in a Hollywood world obsessed with crappy remakes and CGI its good to see a smart, suspenseful, and truly original movie like this..."

The story was eerie, which put you on the edge of your seat while you are watching it. It makes you think about your own life.

"siderite","8","1","2","28 July 2007"," A very nice psychothriller
","I had to get rid of my wife before watching this film as she totally refused to watch a Jim Carrey film. I can understand her reluctance to watch a movie she sees as another series of weird faces and toilet humour like The Mask or Ace Ventura.<br/><br/>But no, this movie is nothing like that. I always thought Jim Carrey has it in him to be a great actor. I don't know if this particular movie is a masterpiece of his, but he plays well and fits the character as a glove. You can associate this film with the Truman Show, I guess.<br/><br/>It is hard to talk about the movie without spoiling things. The obsession with the number 23 is not the bulk of the film, though, it's just a premise for a smart, intelligent script. The movie is also a combination of noir-detective film and psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Bottom line: way under-marked film on IMDb, without being a great movie, it is a good one, one that deserves recognition for a smart, unpredictable story and good acting."

","In all the movies I've seen Jim Carey in I was never able to forget he was,well...Jim Carey. With this movie the inner actor breaks free of the man himself to become the character and not the actor playing the character. In other words, no rubber faced overacting here, just an excellent portrayal of a one-time institutionalized mental patient who was ""cured"" and years later is, seemingly, once again heading for a break due to a book he receives as a present from his wife<br/><br/>Strangely the book is exactly about his life...and how the number 23 is darkly connected to it. But there is one difference, his character in the book is a murderer and since he is a family man that can't be him...As far as he knows? <br/><br/>This movie is fairly polarizing and is likely to be one the viewer either strongly likes or dislikes. You have to be committed as it isn't easy entertainment or fast paced. Instead it's atmospheric tension and moodiness slowly builds and pulls you in deeper if you can stay with it. It gets very creepy and only in it's ending does it let up. In fact it is, in MHO, an excellent psychological thriller until the ending, which is light and almost happy. Hey, that in and of itself is an unexpected twist, yet it's the only weakness in an otherwise solid movie. Recommended."

","I often find ( to my own disgust) I agree with most film critics' reviews. Perfect Stranger is a prime example. All the horrible things that were said about this film are true. I literally mean all of them. However...The Number 23 is a fine film. The film critics got it all wrong.<br/><br/>The Number 23, a story of obsession. Obsession with The Number 23, with death, with sex, with the past...It's a film about a paranoid man ( or is he right on the money?).It dares to ask us some philosophical questions: Does fate exist and are we bound to it? Are we responsible for our own choices or is a larger force at work? Can a man really change?. TN 23 asks us all those questions but doesn't go far enough. Unfortunately it stays pretty much on the surface most of the time. I wonder if Joel would have made a more daring film if he wasn't bound to some Hollywood censorship. The Number 23 isn't' what it seems: The whole numerology and paranoia storyline is just a tool to tell a completely different story. A much more interesting story that I will not unveil any further as it would be blasphemous...<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed to see another plot-driven film with a surprise ending. A film can be excellent without the often unnecessary twist ending. Also, the viewers will probably always associate the film with the ending and that's the only part that will be remembered. The twist wasn't that surprising either and it certainly was one of the most predictable and less ingenious plot twists. The best recent ones still remain Skeleton Key and The Sixth Sense ( ah also Lucky Number Slevin). <br/><br/>Jim Carrey does a good job although I was never truly blown away by his performance. He does, however, confirm his great performance in ESOTSM and proves he can be taken serious as a drama actor. The other actors were very mediocre, no real highs or lows. The director applies his own style and we can definitely see Joel's trademarks once again. Certainly not Joel's best film but a nice one to add to his portfolio.<br/><br/>The Number 23 is one of the few interesting films the year 2007 has produced and is definitely worth a look. Don't expect a masterpiece, because it has quite a lot of flaws, but try to start the film objectively and you will have a good time.<br/><br/>7.2/10"

The way it is done in ""Number 23"" is quite brilliant! The obsession will reveal the truth but isn't truth itself! No,this is not gibberish! This all will make sense when you have seen the movie! The twist in the final scene (Look closely at Carrey and the clock) is there to mess with our heads one last time! ""Number 23"" doesn't depend on scary or disturbing scenes like in other thrillers! That doesn't mean that ""Number 23"" isn't scary or disturbing! It is scary and creepy but more on a psychological level! This movie is truly amazing and very entertaining!<br/><br/>(Special note: I have read some user comments (on message board) and really got mad! It seems that some people trash this movie without really explaining what the problem is with the movie! Trashing and bashing is easy! Try giving some constructive feedback!

"fellattiouk","9","1","2","17 June 2007"," Provocative, Gritty and Clever Storyline
","I over-looked this film many times before, knowing that it was another attempt from Jim Carrey to cross-over from 'rubber face' comedy acting in pursuit of a more 'serious' role. However, I wish I'd seen it earlier. For me, Jim Carrey's attempts have finally paid off - as he carried the story line superbly well, especially as you watch his character delve deeper and deeper into this creepy, psychological paranoia.<br/><br/>To some, the plots twists and turns maybe foreseeable, but I feel it is Jim Carrey's (Walter Sparrow) and supporting actor Virginia Madsen's, believable and strength of acting that pushes through these criticisms and takes the viewer on a surprisingly well balanced and clever storyline. As Walter Sparrow becomes obsessed and engulfed within the thick of the story, such disturbing paranoia is well portrayed and reminds me of Joel Schumachers' other films, i.e. 8MM and Phone Booth. Where the characters lives are twisted, ruined and unrecognisable.<br/><br/>The grittiness and over-exposed (lighting effects) used, when the book is read by Walter Sparrow adds another element to the film, you get a true feel for the secondary characters and reminds me of old-fashioned detective films in black'n'white, those of you who have played Max Payne will know exactly the mood that this bleak, dark and disturbing type of cinematography can achieve.<br/><br/>Above all, a well written, well balanced, thought provoking film, with the perfect amount of pace and suspense to keep you intrigued till the end credits - don't get to obsessed though, as it will get you thinking about the numbers in your birth-date?"

","I had high expectations, maybe that's why I ended up not appreciating the film. The concept sounds intriguing enough to make a good film. Unfortunately ""Number 23"" didn't accomplish this. It's main flaw is, that it never makes up its mind about whether everything is to be taken with a grain of salt not. After about half an hour, it gets quite annoying how Walter tries to see 23 in everything around him -- one's laugh nerves can't helped being itched. That this is not a good thing for a film trying to build up suspense needn't be said. To say that these flaws were compensated by good acting would unfortunately be a lie. I wouldn't go see this film."

","I'm writing this comment still thinking in that number, is amazing how you can put things together that make seem the number 23 appear!. Well i hope the movie effect don't last too much, but i can write some things about this movie. First, it was a good movie for me, i expected more of it, but was good for me; i has always loved how Schumacher brings a totally well adjusted atmosphere to the movies; the colors, the places, the darkness and all is great, so the movie at some parts was really scary and spooky, that's Shumacher signature, like 8mm and Batman Forver; the script was original for a thriller, that's good specially when you are a movie fan and the thriller movies start to look all like the same, this paranoia involved about a number is absolutely great obtained. When the movie started and i saw Jim Carrey, it was difficult for me not seeing him as a funny role, but while the movie evolves, he perform a really good acting that erased me the funny Jim Carrey that i'm used too, that was great! The NED dog was a good reference to The Omen (1976) that makes this movie scary at times. I also found a good message after the movie, but i left that to you because this movie is really worth to not be spoiled in a comment. The only thing that i didn't liked of the film was that i expected a more scary and thrilling movie, but that is far from a critic to the movie, is just a personal feeling.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE FILM: Jim Carrey is Walter Sparrow, a common man who work in an animal control department, suddenly his girlfriend Agatha (Virginia Madsen) finds a book on an old library, the book name was ""The Number 23"", she decide to give the book to Walter as a gift. Walter start to read the book and to develop an special obsession for the character of the book, Fingerling, who has a lot of similarities with Walter, the character of the book, Fingerling, a detective, develop an obsession with the number 23, this number appear in all the things of his life and he starts to think that it means something more. Walter, while reading the book start to find that this number is also appearing in all his life. Robin Sparrow (Logan Lerman), Walter's son, start to live his father's obsession; and Isaac French (Danny Huston), a psychologist tries to help Walter with this obsession.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Terminator97C","6","1","2","20 April 2007"," The Number 23 is better then most thrillers, due to its attention to detail.
","My first impressions of ""The Number 23"" from the advertisements were that this was going to be another horror/thriller dud. Hollywood seems to be filled with them recently, and the reason they keep getting pumped out is that they make plenty of money.<br/><br/>Luckily, ""The Number 23"" is better then than most. It definitely stands out from the others as it has quite an intriguing mystery to it.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) an animal control worker that is given a book by his wife (Virginia Madsen). The book just happens to be called The Number 23.<br/><br/>Sparrow begins reading the book and becomes startled when the book has many similarities with his life. He becomes engulfed in the book and obsessed with the number 23 because it is everywhere he looks. As he continues reading, the character in the book commits a murder, but Sparrow is too nice to kill anyone. Right?<br/><br/>The idea for this film may not be as original as one might think. The premise of the film actually reminds me of Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi."" In which a man become obsessed with the mathematical figure of pi (3.14) and discovers the number everywhere and it begins to ruin his life.<br/><br/>""The Number 23"" really goes all out in convincing the viewer just how crazy the number 23 can be. The writers find its existence in everything. Whether or not they are real, I have no idea; but it sure sounds good.<br/><br/>The movie gets you so convinced that everywhere the viewer looks in the movie they can find 23. It's on the license plates, the cash registers, and anywhere else you look. That is one of the great aspects about the film. The film constantly barrages the viewer with subliminal messaging of 23. Also I noticed when Sparrow goes to the King Edward Hotel, with its neon sign the O and T are not light up. Nifty isn't it? <br/><br/>Not by coincidence the movie was released Feb. 23. See what I mean by they went all out?<br/><br/>""The Number 23"" is directed by Joel Schumacher who has had his good films (""Phone Booth,"" ""The Lost Boys"") and his bad films (""Batman and Robin""). I think you can chalk this film up as one of Schumacher's better films. <br/><br/>Schumacher does an interesting trick while Sparrow is reading the book. The audience is vicariously shown what Sparrow is imagining as he is reading that has this surreal and slightly out of focus look to it. I have never seen a movie recreate the mental process of reading before. It definitely works though, and it adds to the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the ending is not as bombastic as the movie wants it to be. It's not bad, but it's just not really shocking. Or at least I thought so. Not to mention the ending probably takes about 23 minutes to wrap everything up. <br/><br/>You are never on the edge of your seat and that is where this movie really fails. As a thriller it is important that you are constantly tense about what is going to happen next. <br/><br/>I give ""The Number 23"" three out of five (2+3) stars. Uh oh! I gave a two on my last movie review and now I give this movie a three. Put them together and you have23!"
"Robert_duder","7","1","2","4 March 2007"," Good not great, but still gives you a little fun idea to play with with some good performances....
","Thrillers are tough nowadays...we have seen almost everything and it's pretty common for most main stream thrillers to follow the typical path of the genre and not provide anything spectacularly new to it. I think that's where Shyamalan really took the world by storm because he managed to breath HUGE life into the genre and honestly I saw a little of that style in The Number 23. They even attempted, although a little forcefully and not really successfully to give us that Shyamalan/Sixth Sense ending but somehow fails to be as shocking or surprising. The idea behind The Number 23 is fantastic. A woman comes across a book which she passes onto her husband who seems a little bored with his life and suddenly becomes compulsively obsessed with the number 23 just like the character in the book. He begins to see how the number 23 affects him personally and takes him on a mysterious quest to find the writer and eventually thwart an decades old murder. They manage to captivate with that notion and also manage to show to us how the number 23 is integrated into our life and our science and our religions and mythologies (the whole 23 concept is not new to 'real' literature.) So the film works and the cast is good and they all work together with one particular performance standing out more than others.<br/><br/>I have always known Jim Carrey was versatile. He has done some incredible work far beyond her bizarre face shifting comedy that made him famous. Unfortunately his other ventures haven't been nearly as successful which is too bad because he is good and very convincing in dramatic parts. The Number 23 is no different. He gives an awesome performance that far outshines that of his co-stars and really shows a man that sinks into insanity. I thought his performance rivaled that of similar roles like Nicholson's Shining, or Harrison Ford's What Lies Beneath. I think in time people will appreciate this film and his performance much more. His wife is played by Virginia Madsen who seems to always be a critical favorite. Honestly I've never been a big fan...not that I dislike her performances but always find her a little bland and this was no exception. Next to Carrey's brutally honest and emotional performance she seemed so downplayed and almost boring. They worked well together but she just didn't give much to the plot or story. Logan Lerman plays their son in a small but effective role and most of the time shows more emotion and ability than Madsen does and I'm sure this will do big things for his career. One of the truly great things about some members of the cast are the alternate roles they get to play as the novel plays out in Carrey's mind. Carrey himself plays the mysterious dark detective 'Fingerling', Lynn Collins does a great job playing three different roles in Carrey's fantasy, and Danny Huston plays a small almost unnecessary role but still he does alright.<br/><br/>Overall it just felt like there was a lot that didn't need to be there. They took far too long to explain the ending. I understood after they revealed it in the first five minutes but yet the explanation continued for 15-20 minutes. I didn't mind the very final scenes, I thought it was 'just' and 'a decent ending.' As Carrey's character says himself 'it's not the perfect ending, but it's the right one' and that's very true. I personally would not have it ended in any other way and in some twisted way it's a good, happy ending. No matter how you feel about some of the minor issues with the film or maybe that it's just a little bland for a thriller you will leave the theater adding numbers in your head and thinking about the number 23 and I'm sure that was a big part of the film makers goal. Certainly Joel Schumacher is no stranger to film making both really bad, and really good but he has this way of rushing things and trying to piece together elements of what could be good too quickly. This film does fall victim to that a little bit. It's definitely not bad, and I think well worth seeing but it won't blow you away. It's just an okay movie. 7/10"

","I still rate this excellent film 10 out of 10 (I actually think the ""23"" in the title meant that I would vote this 23 out of 10 if I was able to), but I noticed that this movie doesn't have as many references to the number 23 as you believe it would. There's a lot, but not as much as expected.<br/><br/>WARNING IN CASE YOU DIDN'T READ ABOVE: SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>This movie focuses more on how Walter Sparrow's life is getting consumed by a book he forgot he wrote. He had killed a girl on her 23rd birthday and automatically regretted it, and so he wrote a suicide note and survived, so he was taken to therapy for the next year of his life and meets Agatha.<br/><br/>My opinion is that the movie should have been called ""Fingerling"" since the main character in the book he wrote was named Fingerling.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW BELOW: Oh, well.

This event causes him to be late in picking up his wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen). Agatha is waiting for him in front of a book store, and she decides to go inside to kill some time because Walter is late. Today is Walter's birthday so she purchases a book, ""The Number 23,"" as a gift. Walter being bitten, then being late and the purchase of this book is the beginning of a chain of events that will change their lives forever. As Walter reads the book, he finds the story is almost a parallel to his life, and the writer was writing about him. The only problem is that people in the book become obsessive with the number 23, and they end up dead. The number becomes a curse to anyone who discovers its meaning.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The movie is slow for the first hour until it gets to the part that explains to the audience what the real story was all about. By that time, I was bored and tired of watching. I looked at my watch 3 times wanting it to end. I just didn't like any part of the movie. Jim Carrey was the wrong person for this part and the storyline was just bad. They tried to make everything right at the end, but as far as I was concerned, it was too late. As for the number 23, if you are looking for the number, you will find it, especially, if you can calculate the number 23 any way you want using addition, subtraction, division and even the number in reverse until you get the number you want. The number 23 is a big lie. Save your money on this one. (New Line Cinema, Run time 1:35, Rated R)(3/10)"

The last third is so preposterous, it really ruined the film. I left the theater feeling cheated.<br/><br/>You would think that Jim Carrey, Virgina Madsen, and both their agents would have told them the script needed to be fixed. Besides the really stupid ending, the attempts at humor are really lame. Everything that is wrong with this film could have been fixed before they started filming. It's hard to believe anyone could have read the script and thought this would be a successful movie. It's a shame, because this could have been a really good film."

The movie eats up so much time visualizing the damned book that it will obviously turn out to be a convoluted back-story. Gee what a surprise ...it turns out to be a convoluted back-story.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the era in which film-makers learn that a little production design goes a long way, and that design is still no substitute for a worthy script. Number 23 never accidentally veers towards human psychology or natural behavior of any sort, in deference to reverse engineering the entire story backwards from its zowie (not so zowie) twist ending, which makes the foreground an afterthought; and it's complete obedience to the production design gods. Writer Fernley Phillips (!) can not steer this idea to a good movie. It's just another overwrought consumable. If you're hoping to see yet another breathy, sincere narrator explain his way through over-produced imagery, this is for you. I know I really craved another closeup of a clock with its second-hand ticking ominously. 23 is shockingly amateurish.<br/><br/>This is a companion piece to ""The Nines"" which, despite reviews to the contrary, is actually crappier.

"editor-299","4","2","8","22 February 2007"," Carey film cannot decide its genre
","Coming off his most unfunny comedy last year (""Fun With Dick and Jane""), Jim Carey has turned to stark drama in Joel Schumacher's dark and dreary jaunt into cinematic paranoia, ""The Number 23."" Unfortunately for all involved, this picture can't decide whether it wants to be a murder mystery, a family drama or a psychological thriller. This confusion, as well as a story that meanders all over the map, leaves viewers bored, confused and generally stupefied.<br/><br/>In fact, as a thriller, it comes in above the truly horrible ""Stay,"" but far below Johnny Depp's ""Secret Window."" Carey plays Walter Sparrow, a disgruntled animal control officer who is bitten by a mongrel dog one day. This causes him to be late to meet his wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen, ""Sideways""), which in turn allows her to browse an old bookstore and purchase a beat up tome called ""The Number 23."" <br/><br/>When Walter reads this book, he believes it is his own life story, but cannot quite put his finger on some of the events. These scenes are accompanied by unnecessary sequences of Walter's fantasies regarding certain chapters in the book. He imagines himself to be ""Fingerling,"" the lead character, a private detective who beds several women and even murders one of them.<br/><br/>The more he reads, though, the more he slips into this paranoid world in which 23 becomes the center. The number of letters in his name add up to it, as well as other more trivial equations. Soon, he is writing these calculations on his furniture, the walls and even his body. His descent into madness and this bizarre behavior also begins to drive a wedge between Agatha and his teenage son, Robin (Logan Lerman, ""The Patriot"").<br/><br/>Here, the movie tries to become an old-fashioned murder mystery with Walter as a tough-talking gumshoe (in a series of fantasy flashbacks). In ""real"" life, he goes to prison to interview a man charged with murdering a missing coed; tries to trip up the book's author (Topsy Krets) by sending 23 huge boxes of Styrofoam peanuts (yep) and even tries to dig up the woman's body in a public park. All of this leads us to a conclusion that Stevie Wonder could have seen from a mile away.<br/><br/>Carey, who excels in comedy as well as drama (at times), is fine here, as is Madsen; but the scattergun script and lack of clear, coherent direction doom this enterprise and makes one feel that one has been through this before.<br/><br/>And that's not a good thing."

Of course, now he is too old to be doing physical comedy; his trademark. By the way, 23 is a prime number, and he was a member of the prime time players. Also, Don Mattingly, Michael Jordan and Lebron James all have 23 as their jersey number. But none of them are murderers. This film looked like a Carrey home movie rather than a Hollywood production. The production values were amateurish. I couldnt decide between a 2 or a 3 (23). So, since I am a fan of his comedy, I gave him a 3."

It is centered around a conspiracy theory that, in itself, is just plain ridiculous. I couldn't take any of it seriously.<br/><br/>Aside from the stupid plot, 'The Number 23' is also a tediously dull movie. It moves at a snail's pace at the best of times, in fact most of the time it does no moving at all. It's repetitive and goes nowhere.<br/><br/>Less than half an hour in and I already couldn't wait for it to finish. Carrey himself doesn't do much wrong, but he doesn't exactly shine either. How can he with such dreadful material?"
"zkonedog","6","1","3","1 September 2017"," Intriguing, If A Bit Manipulative
","The best kind of psychological thrillers are the ones that drop hints throughout the movie about what the ending might turn out as. Then, there is the ""next tier"" of thrillers, where the ending is a bit more manipulative in the sense that it is dropped on the viewer suddenly and cannot be reasoned out along the way. ""The Number 23"" falls in that latter category. It isn't an all-time great psych thriller (like The Sixth Sense, Memento, or Jim Carrey's own Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), but it does have enough mystery an interesting moments to be an entertaining watch.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Number 23"" tells the story of Walter Sparrow (Carrey), whose wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) finds a book at the local bookshop entitled The Number 23. While Agatha looks at the book as ""interesting fiction"" and nothing more, Walter becomes obsessed with it and the number it idolizes. A colleague of Walter's, Isaac French (Danny Huston), tries to dissuade Walter of his obsession, but that only serves to heighten is paranoia about the way the story seems to be intertwining with his reality.<br/><br/>If taken solely at face value, ""The Number 23"" is a pretty good flick. It has an engaging mystery, Carrey is a great leading man, and the ending is indeed a surprise, to say the least. For those looking for a good psychological thriller from time to time, this one fits the bill.<br/><br/>Here's the problem for certain viewers, though: This is my favorite genre of film (and thus I have a somewhat high bar set for it), and ""Number 23"" doesn't quite measure up to the greats of that genre. It isn't a ""smart"" thriller, if you will, but rather more of a manipulative one in the sense that the twists and turns are completely out of left field and not necessary germane to the story. It comes very, very close at times, but overall (under the direction of Joel Schumacher) it doesn't quite take that ""next step"" into being a film I'd ever want to re-watch again.<br/><br/>So, I think a person's enjoyment of ""The Number 23"" will depend on their familiarity with the genre. If you aren't a pro, this one will get the job done. If you've ""seen them all"", though, this won't be at (or necessarily even near) the top of the list."
"skibordr0980","4","1","3","28 August 2017"," The acting is fine. The rest is pretty bad.
","I never write reviews, but this movie prompted me to.<br/><br/>There is some pretty bad writing in The Number 23:<br/><br/>Carrey, Narrator: ""Time is just...numbers with a meaning attached to them.""<br/><br/>Carrey, Narrator: ""She said she was a good person once. But now?"" Suicide Blonde: ""I'm a bad person."" -- I laughed here.<br/><br/>Carrey, Narrator: ""I was right. She was in danger. I just didn't realize the danger was me.""<br/><br/>Later, Carrey tranquilizes a dog in a cemetery. A priest and a groundskeeper (the dog's owner) come out of nowhere, and Carrey asks the groundskeeper why he named the dog Ned. At no point does anyone ask why this man is shooting dogs with tranquilizers (he doesn't identify himself as animal control). Instead, they answer Carrey's questions and chat with him like a casual acquaintance.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have to mention the pacing of this movie: It's probably one of its biggest flaws. Like 25 (23??) minutes in, Carrey's character is essentially a firm believer in the whole conspiracy. That. is. WAY. too. fast. The movie doesn't try at all to get you in the main character's head-space. So at 37 minutes, when Carrey asks his friend, of the number 23, ""is it God?"" I couldn't help but roll my eyes.<br/><br/>It's not only how fast Carrey ""believes,"" it's how little it takes for him to be pushed off the deep end. Carrey's two characters are drowning in a bunch of confirmation bias, which comes across more as ridiculous than spooky or suspenseful. The Hiroshima bomb was dropped at so- and-so time, which adds up to 23. Okay? What time was the Nagasaki bomb dropped?<br/><br/>On the topic of the plot: It's much too easy to foresee the twist ending just shy of the hour mark. In the movie's book, the murderer (Carrey) gets away because the lover senselessly picks up the knife and gets his finger prints on it. At 55 minutes, Carrey says that the killer in real life from 15 years ago was discovered because his finger prints were all over the knife, HEAVILY implying that the convict, like the character in the book, was framed.<br/><br/>There's also a major plot hole at the end of the movie. The hospital that Carrey is committed to runs through his family history, finding out that his father committed suicide. They don't, however, find that his longtime girlfriend was recently murdered by stabbing? A nearly identical case to the one in his book?<br/><br/>Also a bus almost runs Carrey over at the end because it never slows down, despite seeing Carrey in the street from at least half a block away. Then it speeds on by when he steps out of the way, like a train would."

","Joel's Schumacher's The Number 23 is a tedious, stodgy and pompous film that rarely manages to entertain or intrigue.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey has proved himself worthy of dramatic roles, Truman Show (1998) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), being his two best non-goofball acts. While Jim Carrey's performance here is undeniably the most entertaining part of this mess of a film, it's appreciated for all the wrong reasons. The film practically drowns itself in it's over-seriousness and melodrama, making the often-charismatic Carrey feel drab and lifeless. <br/><br/>Watching the film is quite literally the equivalent of listening to a deranged conspiracy theorist explain his theory to those unfamiliar with it. In fact, that IS the story verbatim. While the ""23 theory"" itself is quite the intriguing coincidence, it's just that- a coincidence. However, the film is so persistent in pointing out as many coincidences as possible that are completely irrelevant. It frankly becomes an annoying and distracting plot element that comes off as aberrantly stupid rather than cleverly absorbing. <br/><br/>The film had the potential to be a fascinating and brilliantly twisted psychological tale of obsession and mental illness, but instead, reserves the majority of focus to it's laughable ""conspiracy"" gimmick. Schumacher sure had a knack for finding these ""23 enigmas"", it's just a shame that making a cohesive film didn't add up to 23."
"jaredpahl","3","1","3","18 March 2017"," Jim Carrey Cannot Quite Breathe Life Into This Dopey Thriller
","The Number 23 is a psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher, and while the film contains an interesting premise and a juicy role for its star, it never coalesces into the taught adult entertainer it is trying to be.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Jim Carrey's Walter Sparrow, a dog-catcher whose life is soon thrown into turmoil as he begins reading a book titled ""The Number 23"". The book seems to be based on his own life, and it details the seemingly supernatural aura surround the number 23. Through his reading, Walter begins to obsess over 23. The plot makes more than a few major leaps in logic in order to spice up Walter descent into madness. I won't say these logical forgivings are deal breakers. In fact, there are some neat ideas in The Number 23 (The hook about the titular number is at least mildly intriguing), but Schumacher and company don't do enough to mold these ideas into something entertaining.<br/><br/>Jim Carey is the main attraction here, turning in a rare dramatic performance. Carrey has an excellent track record with dramatic material (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), but here the focus of those three wonderful movies is not there. Walter as a character has no defining character traits beyond obsessive or psychotic. Carrey tries his best to energize the role, and he is the most interesting part of the film, but his performance is really nothing special and it certainly doesn't make the plot any less silly.<br/><br/>I think Joel Schumacher is often unfairly criticized for directing the worst film interpretation of one of the most popular superheroes ever. Schumacher is a competent director and he can (and has) done great things when paired with good material. In The Number 23, he is lost. This film treads just too close to Lifetime movie territory. The emotional beats never quite hit, the story is clumsy, and the characters are foggy archetypes. The Number 23 has an interesting Jim Carrey performance and it made me look at 23 in a new way (which is something), but there is not much to recommend with this messy thriller.<br/><br/>35/100"

This movie is the perfect proof Jim Carry can be dramatic.<br/><br/>Terrific tension, amazing acting by every single person featured in this movie, excellent production, perfect directing, outstanding performance by Jim Carry, fantastic story and an astonishing plot twist.<br/><br/>I saw yesterday Yes Man for the second time, so it was so different watching Jim Carry acting so dramatic when you're used to watch his comedy films.<br/><br/>I am definitely gonna watch this movie again. This is a no brainier. I suggest you watch a comedy film with Jim Carry in it, and the next day watch this one. You'll be blown away by his terrific acting in a dramatic role."

","this movie is a good example of a fault a lot of newer movies seem to make. since the audience is getting accustomed to plot twists, most plot twists that make any sense at all will be predicted by people and thus not really surprise them. to get a feeling of how much the ability of people to foresee plot twists has changed, just watch the usual suspects. i think most people nowadays would see the ending coming from a mile away, when back when it came out it apparently surprised most people<br/><br/>so in order to make a really surprising plot twist, movies just make plot twists that make no sense at all, and are thus impossible to predict<br/><br/>this is the case with the number 23, which starts up nicely by building up suspense and developing its characters and then follows this up with a plot twist that makes absolutely no sense at all based on anything we ve seen so far. i felt pretty let down when after the first two thirds (23!) the whole plot started going down the toilet.<br/><br/>the acting also gets pretty bad from there, apparently even the actors didn't know how to deal with the sudden complete change of the characters they are portraying<br/><br/>the horrible Hollywood ending seals the deal for this mediocre movie, instead of focussing on the good part (showing the decline into paranoia of a normal person) it tries to be too many things at once and ends up being some garbled garbage"

","Many may still find it difficult to forgive Schumaker for making 'Batman and Robin' but 'The Number 23' is nowhere near as bad. Actually the first two thirds of it is excellent. It's beautifully shot and has the viewer hooked. The special effects, cinematography and lighting are first rate. The tense and dark atmosphere of the fantasy sequences and paranoia and the element of suspense completely involves the viewer. It is only in the final 20 minutes, where the conclusion is slowly revealed, that the film goes downhill. Given the lead-up one would have expected something more impactive. Not that this is the worst possible conclusion the writer could have come up with but it feels like a copout and ruins the significance of the number 23 as mere symptoms of Walter's paranoia. Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen are amazing in their respective roles. They have great chemistry and form a very likable pair on screen. Overall, the first 80 minutes of 'The Number 23' is an absorbing thrillride and I'd suggest people to stop watching after that but given the high level of suspense, I'd probably be ignored."

","If I hadn't known that The Number 23 was based on an eponymous novel by Fernley Phillips, I would probably have thought it was another of Dan Brown's thrillers set around a conspiracy theory. <br/><br/>Walter Sparrow stumbles upon a novel based on a guy named Fingerling and how he realizes that the number 23 was all around him. Walter gradually starts believing that the novel was in fact based on him and, like Fingerling, becomes obsessed with 23 and starts noticing it everywhere- 9/11 2001, 9+11+2+1= 23, JFK was killed on November 22, 1963 2+2=4 and 1+9+6+3=19 and 19+4= 23, Caesar was stabbed 23 times- you get the drift. I found it oddly reminiscent of Dougals Adams fans' obsession with 42. Or the conspiracy theories surrounding the number 11 in the wake of 9/11. <br/><br/>A promising premise alright. Jim Carrey proves for the first time since Eternal Sunshine and The Truman Show that he can, well, act. The narrative is taut and the movie chugs along nicely without letting you lose interest. And that's where the positives end. <br/><br/>The climax inevitably forms the backbone of any psychological thriller. Psycho, Shutter Island and Fight Club wouldn't have been half as memorable as they were if it weren't for the sheer brilliance of the denouement. And that's where The Number 23 falls apart. It was unraveling with speed and machismo, promising to tower upwards in a great final revelation. But instead it turned inward and ricocheted blindly backwards. Instead of opening up the throttle and letting the number have real meaning and significance, Phillips turns the plot inward and shells up the climax with a muffled grunt.<br/><br/>I have given the movie 7 on 10, but it could quite easily have been a 6. Or worse."

","On his birthday, Walter Sparrow, an amiable dog-catcher, takes a call that leaves him dog bit and late to pick up his wife. She browsed in a bookstore, finding a novel, a murder mystery with numerology that loops constantly around the number 23. The story captivates Walter: he dreams it, he notices aspects of his life that can be rendered by ""23,"" he searches for the author, he stays in the hotel where events in the novel took place, and he begins to believe it was no novel. His wife and son try to help him, sometimes in sympathy, sometimes to protect him. Slowly, with danger to himself and to his family, he closes in on the truth.<br/><br/>Many people, with the critics, have panned this film. Well, I actually don't know about the people, per se, but I know that a lot of people did not like this movie. I gave it a watch and it's not as bad as many people put it out to be, even the Razzie nomination to Jim Carrey. This film may be ridiculous because you get a set of numbers, and it all equals the number 23. Well, how you got that in the first place is to put the numbers in different order, or add or subtract or multiply or divide, or put the numbers in fractions, or decimals, or....you know what I'm saying. In order to get the number 23, you'll have to do many of those things...however, that is the point of the film.<br/><br/>Who cares if you have to do all these crazy stuff with numbers. It's better to just go with it than to question a billion of things that comes into your mind when watching the film. Watch and enjoy; that's all I'm saying. When I saw the film, I was pleasantly surprised on how close you have to pay attention to small details and how intelligent the film wants the audience to be.<br/><br/>So you get to get caught up in this ridiculous act with the characters in the film to do something that leads to the number 23. Maybe your name, phone number, licenses, etc will equal 23. Maybe not, but this film catches your attention from the first scene and it will continue to do so until the end.<br/><br/>The problem with this film, however, is that it tries to get too clever and smart that you just don't seem to care about halfway through the film. The film also feels entirely so long, when the film is actually about 90 minutes. I did like the ending, though. It was really different and satisfying.<br/><br/>Everyone gives a good performance in here. In fact, the same actors/actresses play different characters at once. Is it to confuse you? Probably not. The film was good and some dumb fun, with some slow parts, but in the end, it's a truly satisfying film for me."

","A natural characteristic of films with many plot twists are occasional holes in the story. Movie's aren't required to fill in these holes but their void doesn't mean a film is terrible.<br/><br/>I found 'The Number 23' to be an entertaining thriller that kept me guessing. Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen both give good performances and sell a complex, perhaps too complex, story about one mans'...make that two mens' obsession with the number 23.<br/><br/>I found the symbolism relating to the dog was a nice touch. Reading some of the reviews here it is obvious that some didn't pull anything at all from the dog in the story...I thought it added a nice touch...and really led the audience to believe that Jim Carrey's character was destined for death. An earlier review said that they didn't like Jim's(Walter Sparrow's) narration because it gave away his fate..that because of it they knew he would live...?????......what planet was that reviewer from... narrators die all the time...and then many times they talk after their own death... terrible comment... this selection has been nitpicked to death... surely not for the acting, or the direction, or the story... but because of the uncomfortable ending, the fact that Jim Carrey is playing an unfamiliar role... and because it's hard to predict what's going on... THis isn't a fantastic film but it is MUCH better than I expected....so if you're like me....and have put this one off because of all the negative press... go ahead and give it a whirl.. you might be pleasantly surprised. 60/100<br/><br/>You MIGHT like it if you liked:Stigmata, Session 9 , and Angels and Demons."
"brokensilent","4","1","3","3 March 2008"," Watching A Train Wreck
","I had to see this movie because I wanted to see how Jim Carrey did in a serious film. He wasn't bad but this was a poor choice for a breakout film. The movie's storyline was laughable and not believable. The idea of twenty three made me snicker because they had to twist and manipulate nonstop to try to make the connections. If you ignore every number but 2 and 3, guess what, you get 23 and that's what this movie plays on. The perfect picture is painted with only parts of the details and it gets on your nerves after a while (like after the first five minutes of the 23 storyline). My husband and I were rolling our eyes through the entire film and had to watch it until the end, because it was like watching a train wreck, you know it's going to be a hideous ending that you'd rather avert your eyes from but you've got to watch anyways. I will take my hat off to Jim Carrey, I actually bought him as the lead character, I just hope that he chooses better movies in the future to display his serious acting capabilities."

","I have never really understood the conspiracy theory behind the number 23. I'm pretty sure that if you choose another number and do the same ridiculously complicated calculations people do with number 23 you'll get a similar pattern.<br/><br/>But what matters here is not so much the plausibility of the conspiracy theory but the quality of the movie, which, in my opinion, is not so great. The acting is very good, with Jim Carrey showing once again that he's not only a funny face that makes us laugh. He actually can act. And Virginia Madsen is competent as usual.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is that, in trying so hard to make us believe in the plot, it fails to entertain. I got lost in some parts trying to understand the connection with 23. For instance, why exactly is pink 23? Also, some things were left unexplained that should have been better explored for the sake of the story. It seems that, at the end of the movie, Joel Schumacher was running out of time and had to finish the movie on a rush leaving several loose ideas in the air."
"MLDinTN","2","1","3","28 January 2008"," tries to hard to be clever
","I think the writer of this movie thought the story was clever, but it is too clever for its own good. The story just gets crazy and out there and hence becomes uninteresting. Jim Carey plays William Sparrow, a man who beings to read the novel The Number 23. He begins to find similarities between himself and the main character of the book, Fingerling. I never got how their two lives were similar. The movie explained this poorly. Sparrow begins to come up with all these crazy figures of how to get the number 23 or 32 or any variation. He says this plus this plus this equals 23, How weird? I just didn't get it. He has dreams of killing his wife and jumps out a window, but really doesn't. I'm not sure.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I didn't like the story. I didn't think it made sense."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","3","11 January 2008"," Just about adds up
","Probably the most impressive thing about this film  apart from the fact that Jim Carrey can appear on-screen without being intensely annoying  is the sheer deluge of information regarding the number 23 rather than anything to do with the plot, style or technique. Carrey makes a good job of portraying an average Joe slowly coming unhinged as he identifies a little too closely with the character in a book purchased for him by his wife, especially as he has to overcome a plot which immerses him in 'paranoia' a little too quickly to be comfortably believable.<br/><br/>For all the talk about the number 23, the film is more about fate and the way that seemingly insignificant events can have life-changing consequences. Dog-catcher Walter Sparrow resists the unwelcome advances of a work colleague at a Christmas party so, two months later, she spitefully sends him on a job one minute before knocking off which makes him late picking up his wife, who browses in a bookshop while she waits and buys him the book that propels Walter on his devastating journey. It's coincidence disguised as fate, really, but it holds together quite well for the purposes of the story. Writer Fernley Phillips, whose first effort this is, does well to tap into our seeming fascination with numbers (just look at the message boards and trivia section for this flick to see what I mean) and combine it with a paranoid thriller/mystery that just about manages to work.<br/><br/>The only major flaw is the way that Philips can only tie up all the loose ends through the use of a lengthy explanation (to both us and Walter) which tends to rudely eject the viewer from the film and back into their seat. The complex plot is all very clever  even though it doesn't quite hold together  but any explanations required should be reserved for the after-movie discussion/reflection rather than the last reel of the movie itself."
"tallguy62","6","1","3","24 December 2007"," Really not a bad movie at all
","People love to bash Jim Carrey just like they do Will Ferrell. I prefer to judge actors by their performance in the movie at hand, not how stupid they have been in other films. It is hard to do with someone as ubiquitous and obnoxious as Jim Carrey. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie in that Jim Carrey did a good job and the movie, although not one of my favorites, did have an intriguing premise and was, for the most part, entertaining and interesting. The plot was hokey, but somehow the actors did a good job of portraying mystery and even horror.<br/><br/>My main complaint about this movie, is that after its real denouement, it should have been over, but then it drags on for another 25-30 minutes or so. Once we learn what happened to Jim Carrey's character, the movie should have been over. What was Joel Schumacher thinking to make it drag on after that, with Carrey's character gyrating in a ridiculous manner? It made for an extremely poor, unsatisfying ending. It reminds me of the ending of Sandra Bullock's recent bomb, Premonition. The silly ending spoiled both movies. I think it is still worth watching, but don't expect a good ending."
"MrGKB","6","1","3","16 December 2007"," The premise was intriguing...
","...and the execution was stylish, but even on second viewing, Joel ""Phone Booth"" Schumacher's psychological thriller, ""The Number 23"" didn't quite live up to its numerological promise. The script by newcomer Fernley Phillips mines the rich field of mystic numerology to set up an interesting mystery, but everything falls apart in a mundane third act wrap-up that negates everything that has come before, and leaves the audience scratching its collective head at the raft of ""oh, c'mons"" and ""now hold on a seconds"" with which Phillips & Schumacher leave them.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, I really wanted to love this movie. I was a Robert Anton Wilson fan back in the day--the Illuminati trilogy, ""Principia Discordia,"" the Church of the SubGenius, and all that other tongue-in-cheek hokum. I even had a casual ""obsession"" with the number 23, though nothing like that of Walter Sparrow, the protagonist of this movie, played by Jim ""I Am Not Just a Comedian"" Carey. Phillips' screenplay, though, clever as it is, just doesn't add up to much more than an overly spelled-out twist finale, very disappointing not only because of its relative mundanity, but because of its illogic.<br/><br/>Still, the art direction, production design and so forth are all well done, very noir-ish in the ""fiction"" scenes. Matthew ""Phone Booth"" Libatique's camera wrangling is excellent, as is Harry ""Flushed Away"" Gregson-Williams' music. The acting is decent, though I think Carey was not the best casting choice; his rubberface comedic persona seemed to be lurking just beneath the surface of what he was doing, and buying him as a sleazy detective (even a fictional one) with a hinky-dink for BDSM is quite a stretch. I have every respect for Carey as a dramatic actor (cf. ""Man on the Moon"" and ""The Majestic"" and even ""The Truman Show""), but the role simply called for someone with a bit more gravitas. Virgina ""Sideways"" Madsen (whose 40th birthday was 9.11.2001---ooooh, spooky!) does fine as the wife, Logan ""3:10 to Yuma"" Lerman is serviceable as the son, Danny ""30 Days of Night"" Huston does the shrink thing, and the woefully under-appreciated character actor Mark ""Mulholland Drive"" Pellegrino has a superb scene as the man at the apparent center of Sparrows' obsession. Also watch for a brief appearance by the great Ed ""Seabiscuit"" Lauter, another great and mostly unlauded character actor. Oh, yes, Rhona ""Skinwalkers"" Mitra is more than appealing as the sex object, even moreso in the unrated DVD director's cut.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's the collapse of logic that relegates ""The Number 23"" to the status of ""just another movie, could have been great, but..."" I'll not spoil anything for anyone reading this who might not have seen it yet, but suffice to say, you're going to finish up your filmwatching experience saying, ""Hey, wait a minute! That doesn't add up..."""
"luke-346","6","1","3","6 December 2007"," An interesting concept... and that's about it!
","From the director of such cult classics as ""The Lost Boys, Flatliners, Falling Down"" and such huge flops as ""Batman Forever, Batman & Robin, Phone Booth"", this film could go one of two ways, and it did the latter! In brief, the film tells of one mans obsession with the number 23 after the purchase of a book. It is an interesting concept, much in the same way as Phone Booth is, but it fails to live up to anything but that ""an interesting concept"".<br/><br/>The film reads as a question on the main characters sanity and whether the number 23 can ensnare and consume people. It can do, and this evident in the fact that if you look hard enough you will find it for example the Number 23 is Joel Schumacher's 23rd project as director, the DVD has 23 chapters and the main character, Walter Sparrow, had an obsession with the saxophone. The saxophone, of course, has 23 keys. Yes, that's right; the obsessions in the film are tenuous to say the least and unfortunately this is an issue which is never really addressed.<br/><br/>The film (with Schumacher on board) is stylish of course, but I couldn't help thinking that I wish this film had a lower budget and was released on the European circuit where I feel it would have favoured much better. The film was too polished, it needed to be grittier, dirtier, more consuming and interesting (but on a deeper level).<br/><br/>Psychological thrillers are tough and are one of the few genres that produce masterpieces so rarely, they are often ridden with a cliché narrative which usually culminates in a twist, and this film is no different and given the films mediocre script the vast majority of audiences will see it coming which leaves the film with a weak ending. It is unfortunate as I would have liked to have witnessed a clever film; instead I've seen a good director make another hash of an interesting concept!"
"rkloth","2","1","3","24 November 2007"," Drivel
","This movie is best described as dysfunctional. It is poorly initiated, with a confusing start that later reveals itself as something to be rightly confused about. It doesn't even attempt to set the viewer in the proper context of what is past and what is present, and this is done without purpose. I kind of feel like the director shot a bunch of scenes and counted on the audience to make excuses that justify the lack of credulity to many of the events that take place. The ""twist"" is what the movie tries to provide a climax to, but fails miserably in its attempt to appear like a 6th sense wanna-be, without the ability to adequately set things up. I blame the director entirely, thinking the porn industry has lost one director, but surely one they can easily replace."
"bretthernan","5","1","3","19 November 2007"," 23 Times I Nearly Fell Asleep
","Having seen many examples of well done film-noir classics, I could not help but feel as though there was something sadly missing in this film's attempts to evoke the same type of atmosphere as them, and after it ended I realized that this was because it lacked a logical plot, was filled with a sense of unreality and featured drab and unimaginative characterizations, all of which served to repel me from being able to engage with the film in a way that took me out of my living room in front of a TV and into it's world, something that it was trying to rely upon to successfully tell its story in an entertaining way. <br/><br/>Amongst its major plot elements though, it did have some charming moments but these were few and not enough to warrant a good review. Carey's skill as a dramatic actor is definitely more akin to these types of interactions rather than the serious and hard-boiled character he attempts to portray here. The incredulity of the plot also kept me at length from wanting to believe in the story. The 'significance' of the number 23 as a plot device struck me as trite, confused and downright illogical, as did the reactions of the other characters to its quasi-mystical significance, and the 'surprising plot twist' at the end of the film was a cliché that has been used too many times in these psychological thriller-type films over the last 10 years to have any substantial impact on a well-schooled viewing audience. <br/><br/>Jim Carey is a good comic actor and he has proved himself also capable of believability in the 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', however with this film his acting seems to be reaching to try to do something that perhaps, to me, his cinematic persona won't let him? I think that given the right roles Carey could offer the world some truly inspiring performances, but following the road this film is on won't bring that out of him.<br/><br/>The evocative cover art offered a 50-50 chance that it was going to titillate and excite me, and I hoped it would because Carey would be great to watch in a well-scripted and plotted thriller, but upon viewing this movie, at least 23 times during the ordeal I nearly fell asleep and considered turning it off."

"jpschapira","3","1","3","24 September 2007"," The worst thing
","How nice of ""The number 23""Explaining us everything before the movie is over, in case we didn't understand it; or is it that it was impossible to understand. Anyway, even considering the fact that the movie tries to explain itself, there's another fact that doesn't change: ""The number 23"" is a mess from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) finds a novel in one of those destined moments that we let through. He starts reading it and he becomes obsessed with itWell, the novel says it's 'a novel of obsession'. He narrates what he reads in the novel, but his character had started narrating his own life before; so there's a point in which the narration and the narrators mix up and if you analyze things logically, nothing makes senseMostly near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Yes, Fernley Phillips' first screenplay has a premise we haven't seen before, but also yes; it uses the same tricks used in the films we have seen before. Is it true that we've not seen anything like ""The Sixth Sense"" since it premiered and everyone started copying or reformulating it? For almost ten years, movies similar in style have taken some cinematic licenses and worked (I'm not giving names), but others have exceeded the number of licenses, and turned into something like this film.<br/><br/>For me, ""The number 23"" is more than a mess and a bad film, it's also a disappointment. I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey and of director Joel Schumaher. The first one is one of my favorite actors and the second one has made, among other things, three very different movies I respect and admire: ""Tigerland"", ""Veronica Guerin"" and ""Phone Booth"". This movie is easily the worst thing they've done in their careers.<br/><br/>Carrey's narration is so unconvincing, so relaxed, as if he was doing ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" again. It's not that the movie doesn't help his performance; he doesn't understand his character, or his nature, and thus his performance fails. Maybe he thought that he was doing ""Eternal sunshine"" because a lot of shots are out of focus and he constantly wakes up in different states and places.<br/><br/>But ""The number 23"" is a different trip of the mind, and Matthew Libatique's beautiful photography (try to catch ""The Fountain"", you'll be amazed) might be the only good element wasted in the movie that goes back and forth from present time to a film-noir style of film-making, which Libatique captures perfectly.<br/><br/>Even if we wanted to, we couldn't even say that ""The number 23"" is an exercise of style, because there's an understood intelligence found in the screenplay that obliges us to follow the story attentively, although it's still mess; but there's nothing easier than realizing whether a script takes itself seriouslyThis one really does, and it makes it worse.<br/><br/>To finish up, this is not only the worst thing Carrey and Schumaher have done; also Virgina Madsen, and the rising Logan Lerman, and Danny Huston, who had been giving some good appearances. There's one good thing the movie does though, and that's making you want to find out about what the hell is up with number 23."

","Not just because of that theme in the movie. Which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot. No.<br/><br/>I watched this, knowing I would not like it. I HATE numerology. Whenever someone starts going off about patterns with numbers I feel the urge to slap them. My own brain starts hurting out of empathy. And fully aware this is a movie just about that topic, I couldn't resist the urge to watch it and maybe get a good laugh. But it wasn't funny. Just exactly the dumb sort of ""Isn't this totally scary and yet amazingly cool?! I can turn any crap into 23!"" dialog I was afraid of. As soon as the son started to chime in, I knew this movie is a turd, no matter what happens. But I hardly ever stop watching a movie I started. I sat through it. I enjoy the pain.<br/><br/>The movie pretends to mock numerology under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly. But it rides that wave as much as it's supposed to crush it. I don't see that message. I only see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify. <br/><br/>Top that off with the usual ""surprises"" - trying to put another twist to throw you off, that makes no sense, and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narration up to there - and you get one hollow piece of movie-making. That just happens to be centered around the topic I despise. If only it did not try to be serious and rather had been some hilarious movie with actors I don't give a damn about. But I was starting to like Carrey...while it's not his fault, he is trying. It's not even good for watching with a bunch of friends and mst3k the hell out of it.<br/><br/>My expectations were low enough for someone to trip on them, but this movie managed to live up to be one of the worst I've ever seen."

","Acting, style, cinematography etc. aside, this movie suffers from serious flaw - the story.<br/><br/>The whole premise is that 23 appears everywhere to Jim Carrey and others, but the way they find it is sooooo amazingly terrible, that it's not even laughable. For example:<br/><br/>""Laughable"" has 8 letters. ""Letters"" has 7 letters. 8 + 7 = 15 and 8 + 15 =23 OMG!!!!!!! 23!!!!!!!<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>I am 25 right now. I have 2 legs. 25 - 2 = 23 OMG OMG!!!!!<br/><br/>It. is. THAT. bad.<br/><br/>It's just one of those movie where the overwhelming insanity / irrationality of the protagonist is supposed to dupe you into feeling that the story is genius.<br/><br/>Worth a watch if you have been accidentally locked in your room with nothing else but a TV, DVD player, and this movie.

From the get-go, as soon as he hears of his fathers obsession, he jumps on the bandwagon and is hysterical about it. Totally unbelievable.

","In yet another attempt to break away from the manic comic persona that has become his stock-in-trade, Jim Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, an animal control expert whose life is literally taken over by a strange novel he is reading entitled ""The Number 23."" In it, the protagonist - whose life story, Walter believes, greatly parallels his own - becomes convinced that the number 23 exudes a kind of mystical power over the fates and lives of certain, specially chosen people. Soon Walter is seeing 23s all over the place and slipping further and further into paranoia and madness just like the character in the book.<br/><br/>""The Number 23"" is a gimmicky, insubstantial thriller that is facilely consumed then instantly forgotten. The movie keeps cutting back and forth between Walter's life in the real world and re-enactments of events in the novel, which are basically silly film noir knockoffs done in murky, over-stylized settings. Though there are a few fleeting moments of quality in the wrapping-up stage of the drama - where the filmmakers actually seem to be pulling the story elements together in a semi-coherent fashion - there's little to engage our interest in most of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Carrey, Virginia Madsen as his wife, and Danny Huston as a professor friend of the couple, aren't given much to work with in terms of character development. Everyone simply seems to be going through the motions, marking time till a more substantive movie heads their way. Here's hoping such a project won't be too long a time in coming."

","Joel Schumacher might be one of those run-of-the-mill Hollywood filmmakers on the surface, but his films do express an urge to push that mold just a little bit each time out. He was behind the simple yet intelligent character study ""Falling Down"", the poorly conceived but sexually dark ""8mm"", the thriller with an irresistibly limited location ""Phone Booth"", and the smaller human drama of ""Veronica Guerin"". Now it's ""The Number 23"", a stylistic thriller that feels like big Hollywood's delayed response to Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"". The film stars comedy film regular Jim Carrey in an all too rare against type performance as a family man with a job with animal control. None of those details are really all that important, however. What's important here is that his wife, played by Virginia Madsen, discovers a book in one of those dusty rare and used bookstores, entitled ""Number 23"". She quickly breezes through the book, but once he picks it up he becomes obsessed by its content, which is seeped in numerology and told through a dark fantasy world full of sex and violence. It's a reasonably interesting film that bridges the contemporary fascination with the likes of numerology with a rather pedestrian storyline that occasionally feels like an attempt at the style of the stronger work of M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs""). Due to its thin storyline ""The Number 23"" is often far more tedious than it is engaging however as proof of Carrey's dramatic talents (even to the point of having an unfamiliar timbre in his voice-over narration) this is a worthy effort."
"sferg62","4","1","3","10 March 2007"," Serious actor?
","The Number 23 does not prove that Jim Carrey can do a non-comedic role. How can anyone take a movie seriously when one of the characters is named Robin Sparrow? At times, you can see Carrey struggling to maintain a straight face while delivering the dialogue. I did get a few laughs from the movie, but most of the time, it was strained and boring.<br/><br/>I think that you'd have to be one of those people amazed by the ""similiarities"" between A. Lincoln and J. Kennedy to enjoy this one. Or maybe you'd believe that Nostradamus predicted this film in his writings."

","""The Number 23""(2007) I liked this move very much. I found this to be a great thriller story with all its twist and turns. I must admit this one kept me interested until its very end. I must say Jim Carrey did a skillful job in this film. He came across the screen with this character role at times with very high marks, as far as I am concerned. This man does have great acting talent and it goes far beyond his usual comedy roles. He manages here to convince the audience and myself that he can act out with complete excellence, when he is asked to do so. Jim Carrey gave this role he played in this film all he had and it was a very impressive performance indeed. He does need the credit that is due for his efforts in this movie. This film has the story and has the acting to earn a strong #8 in my personal opinion. I would truly enjoy seeing this side of Jim Carrey more often. If you do see this movie you just might agree.

","I enjoyed this film, although I was baffled about the relevance of the number 23 throughout history, and how one man can suddenly realise it is affecting him directly. Never mind, I thought to myself, let's just enjoy it for what it is, after all, there's only repeats on TV. So I watched and watched and watched. Now I'm a convert. I am convinced that the number 23 guides me. I was 23 when I met my wife. I always drive at 23 miles per hour in 30 mph zones, just to be on the safe side (no speeding tickets), I watched Shaun of the dead 23 times (until last night, but I won't count that one - I was drunk), when I get up in the morning I have 2 slices of toast + 1 apple + 2 cups of tea (2 + (1+2) = 23!) My birthday is 16th July (16+7=23). There may be some truth after all, I thought. So how could I randomly take dates,numbers, etc., and still get the number 23? My final test was the most compelling of all. I discovered my maternal grandmothers date of birth (4th September 1916) 4+9+1916=1929, on my wedding anniversary (celebrated recently) I added the amount of years I've been married, 10 (1929+10=1939), also I have been reading about the Titanic recently so I took away the year the titanic sank (1912 - 1939-1912=27, then finally took away the score out of 1,000,000,000 which I rated this film, 1, I did this four times just to be sure (27-4=23) and there you have it! I must stop writing now as a very nice man dressed in white has to re-strap me in my lovely tight jacket and take away my laptop.

I'm not sure if it was the point, if it was Joel Schumacher's goal, but I think the movie was loosely based on paranoia rather than the number 23. I suppose that most people disliked this movie and left the theater with the wrong idea because they didn't pay attention to the ending due to making prior judgments about the movie. <br/><br/>At the end of the film we are told that it was Jim Carrey; Walter Something(sorry about forgetting the name) is the author of the book and that the main motivation for his fear of the number is the fact that it was the last thing that his father apparently had to say (or write, for that matter). The ending explained that the movie was simply saying that you will find fear if you just manage to look hard and far enough. It is NOT saying that you should add up your date of birth and the letters in your mother's maiden name and find out whether it adds up to 23 or not.<br/><br/>AMAZING movie, go see it. I guarantee you'll leave the cinema pleased and talking about it to everyone who saw it."

","This film is a big disappointment. It takes its inspiration (and cinematographic content) from a medley of other, far more original and infinitely superior, films: Pi, Memento, The Machinist, Sin City. Overall comes across a dumbed-down , hotchpotch of different cinematic styles and ideas.<br/><br/>Carey just about holds the thin threads of the film together. However, he never looks sinister to me and I still keep on thinking he is going to start contorting his face, particularly at key bits in the film. He is so much more effective in the ""fluffy"" psychological roles we have seen in Eternal Sunshine.. and The Truman Show. In this film, he lacks the innate edge that enables other (more able) actors to create credible and truly scary characters.<br/><br/>Go to see this film by all means and make up your own mind. However, you may want to spend your hard-earned cash on much better releases, such as Pan's Labyrinth. Failing that, perhaps you should wait until it comes out on DVD?

What the picture turns out to be is an extremely 'plotty' yarn about a man lost in the maze of his own history. A lot of the exposition involves the hero recounting the plot of a novel he's reading - this was done extremely effectively, and hats off to Schumacher for the technique.<br/><br/>As for the rest, it's all story - and if you are interested simply in a narrative unfolding simply for the fun of finding out what happens next, it's not bad at all.

"munky_sak69","8","1","3","23 February 2007"," A quick Review with no spoilers!
","As usual, I dragged my recently hyper ass to the movie theater on Thursday nights to check and 'see' if the movies that premiere on Friday were up to par and satisfactory in the eyes of the customer. As usual around 19 people showed up which is quite the norm, and we watched the new Jim Carrey movie,' The Number 23'. At first i was a little skeptical about this movie, because if there are no monkeys drinking beer or picking Ace Ventura's butt, then it must not be a good Carrey movie, but was I wrong! If your reading this you HAVE TO see his new movie! It rivals and surpasses any recent horror/ thriller movie I have seen in years. Not only is the acting superb, the plot, the character placement, and the story line behind the film play in so well. If you haven't heard, the movie is about a little red book titled, 'The Number 23', and looks like an amateur piece of fiction that Sparrows' (Jim Carreys) wife buys for him to read. The mystery of this number comes in a little strong at first, but captivates you in a weird, un-like Jim Carrey, way. This role shows just how talented Jim is, and how well he can deviate from his stereotypical role as a comedian. There are tons of scenes that cut back and forth, relentlessly drilling into your head that this number is not just a coincidence, but it is alive. The story about the odd number reveals itself in every possible way imaginable. When and IF you watch this movie, and you should, pay close attention to ALL minor details. The more you watch, the more likely it is that you will find the film fascinating. Almost all background scenes can be put together to form the number 23. The movie is short, but it is well directed in such a way that you are never far from the edge of your seat, and sometimes you lean so close to the screen, you catch yourself from falling off from not only the seat, but from Sparrows' mind as well. The number controls his life and at the end of the movie, all you can think about is if the number is actually true. The reason this movie is so great, because it continues to entertain hours after its over. Before leaving the theater, every birth date, word, number of people, chairs, hats, glasses, body parts, etc, were analyzed to see a possible trend. Things to remember, include, what is this movie's release date? Be sure to check all background settings from windows, to people, to letters and paintings. Take a look at sentences, sentence structures and recognize awkward letters. These will come into play in the movie and make the experience, so much better. Some creepy things my friends and I discovered where....The time we left the theater, was 2:23am (all this no is BS). There are 13 seats in the middle row of the theater and 5 on each outer row, and that equals 23. Olvers birthday is, April 2nd, 1984. 2+4+8+9 X 1=23. Gas was 2.23 when we left. There are 23 doors in the movie theater hallways, 10 theater doors and 13 office doors, closets, exits, etc. Now I know this is all in good fun, and is extremely corny, but it makes the movie that much more enjoyable. This movie is a definite instant hit in my books. Jim Carrey proves himself as not only a tremendous actor with grandiose skills, but a versatile character, ready to make us cry with laughter, or castigate our inner fears."

This film was a suspense, but it did have a few funny parts. Virginia Madson did a wonderful job, she held up her end and then some. Logan Lerman is on his way to becoming a money maker.<br/><br/>The critics are too single-minded, like the only thing Jim Carrey should do is comedies. At this point, he knows what to choose, and what not to choose. He is the master at comedies and has a feel for outside genres. He was excellent in The Truman Show, Man On The Moon, The Majestic, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I don't know who's seen Simon Birch (TV), but he was good in that also. This movie definitely deserves more credit than what i've seen, and so does Jim Carrey in his role plays, Oscar or No Oscar, he is an all around great actor, and one of the best of the 21st Century.<br/><br/>Acting is a job but some like Jim Carrey can take it to the next level, for the entertainment purpose. I read a comment that said that this film should be nominated for a razzie award, which is totally absurd. Joel Schumacher has had a lot of experience and has worked with Jim Carrey before, he knew what to do with this film, and did it justice, in my opinion. I would like to see where Jim Carrey goes in his selection of non comedies now. This film only made a little over $30 million at the box office which tells me people need to be more open minded to different types of movies. It sucks to see a movie this good do so bad. This in my mind is at least jim carrey's fifth movies that the academy should have acknowledged."

I found Virginia Madsen's character to be slightly annoying, and his son, although adorable, was almost an unnecessary character and did nothing to further improve the plot.<br/><br/>It was overly-predictable and somewhat unoriginal. But nice job to Carrey, it would be nice to see him take on some more roles like this. He was the only thing that really saved this movie.

If you plan to see this movie with an interest in numerology, symbolism, esoteric signs, or the occult, you will be disappointed. If you like the movie ""Secret Window,"" then you basically have seen ""The Number 23."" If your primary interest is to see a movie about psychosis or amnesia, then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>I gave the movie a 7/10 rating because I decided to have an open mind about the acting and the real plot (not the trailer version). Carrey's performance is excellent, and a refreshing change from past roles. Had I not seen the trailer and ignored the pre-release hype, I probably would have been more intrigued.<br/><br/>Many viewers have written that the first half of the movie is extremely dull. I disagree; I think it just wasn't what they expected. Having that knowledge prior to seeing the film, I paid close attention to the first half of the movie. There are many ""clues"" to alert the viewer what is to come. Pay close attention to Ned the dog. Also, if you have seen ""Mulholland Drive"" you will understand my advice, even though ""Mulholland"" was about lucid dreaming. Ned is a type of flashback, not a dream."

But i must say the direction and plot of the movie is a total weakness,i really mean it,from the very first 30 minutes of the movie to the end of it we just watch plot holes,non logical happenings that really a man cant find an answer for it. we may say that its a fantasy genre but at least we must face some logical reasons for some affairs,how the his wife removed the skeleton?and my very important question is that why his woman bought that book for him?how old was he when he committed crimes that when he met her he was 23?no noticeable facial changes during all these years!plot,what a disaster,i wish i had not watched it."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) lives a quiet life as a humble dog catcher. But he has a bit of a troubled past, with his mother's death at eight years old, his father's subsequent suicide and discovering the body of a blonde woman in a nearby house at around the same time. For his birthday, his wife gets him a book, a detective novel, about a character named Fingerling who is driven mad and commits murder after becoming obsessed with the number twenty-three and all the weird coincidences it has. But the more Walter reads the book, he becomes obsessed with the coincidences between himself and the main character, and starts to worry that he will come to do exactly as he does.<br/><br/>Former rubber faced funny man Robin Williams tried his hand at thrillers with the likes of Insomnia, One Hour Photo and The Night Listener. So it's interesting, if nothing else, to see how former rubber faced funnyman Jim Carrey would fare. Even in a serious role, he's still hard to buy and can't quite shake off his funnyman look and delivery. So with a leading man who isn't completely up to scratch, things are already looking down for this psychological thriller outing.<br/><br/>The film tries to be a clever, twisty-turny thriller and you certainly have to pay attention to everything going on, but this feels less to do with it being genuinely intelligent and gripping and more to do with it being muddled and confusing, more a sign of director Joel Schumacher crying for help than making a masterpiece.<br/><br/>One thing the film does manage to do is make a genuinely interesting point about all the bizarre connections to the number twenty three and incorporate it intelligently into the story. But after a while this starts to get on your nerves more than keep you involved in the story, making you want to think more about the number twenty three bus service than the film. And I thought 13 was the unlucky 'three' number? **"

Murder and madness follow in a not very clear (its one of those movies that get so confusing that at a certain point you're told whats happening), and not very good thriller. Made on the cheap for a a budget equal to Carrey's regular salary this isn't all that great, its not bad, but its not very good.

","The Joe Cool Experience: The Number 23(2007)<br/><br/>Starring: Jim Carrey as Walter Sparrow/Fingerling Virginia Madsen as Agatha Sparrow/Fabriza Logan Lerman as Robin Sparrow Danny Huston as Issac French/Dr. Miles Phoenix<br/><br/>Plot: A man finds a book called The Number 23 and begins to read it. As he follows the characters in the story he finds they closely resemble his life and he also sees the number 23 everywhere. He soon finds out that the character in the book becomes a killer. Does this mean he will kill too? Is the number 23 really controlling him?<br/><br/>I was so excited about this movie when first hearing about it. It looked like a smart thriller and featured Jim Carrey returning to another serious role, which he is good at. But what I got was a contrived mess that seemed like it was rushed and thrown together. Before I go into complaining, I'll just state what I did like about it.<br/><br/>This movie had a very strong cast. Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen carry this movie on their backs, and try to drag it away from the corner that thrillers like this are all shuffled into. I thought the idea was great, and the fact they created lots of examples of how the Number 23 is everywhere(although some of them were reaching...32 is 23 reversed!) helped the ""curse"" aspect of the story take hold.<br/><br/>However this movie DOES go into typical Hollywood thriller mode fairly quick, with all the minor and the one major plot twist being things that can be seen coming from anyone with half a brain. This looked and felt paint-by-numbers. It's pretty much an example of, ""If you've seen one, you've seen them all"". Only some of the others were done better. The ending definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All the build up and then it ends rather abrupt and anticlimactic. The subplot with the dog was especially stupid and really had nothing to do with anything in the long run.<br/><br/>This movie tries to hard to be scary but really doesn't do that. It tries to be funny, and thanks to some moments where Jim Carrey's natural style of humor comes forward, it succeeds. Some of the attempted humor falls flat. It tries to be a mystery, but it's a puzzle that is easy to solve. It seems like on almost every level this movie fails, except for the actor. The actors tried here and that I can appreciate. But when the script is less-than-average the acting can't save it.<br/><br/>Overall, The Number 23 tries to be many things and fails. I don't recommend it, unless you just love Jim Carrey and want to see another of his movies. But even then I think you should be able to skip this one and it won't matter much. So do just that, skip this one.<br/><br/>Rating: * of *****"
"binkyli","2","1","4","3 March 2007"," A great waste of talent at a production cost not merited
","Twists and turns abound in this wannabe thriller with no thrills and nothing scary. Great acting by Jim Carey and Virginia Madsen, although there was no chemistry at all. There wasn't a clue or character that was properly threaded, which makes one wonder how a great filmmaker like Joel Schumaker could be so careless. All told, this film tries to be ""too smart"" for its own good, and leaves the viewer very unsatisfied on every front whether you go to be ""scared"", ""entertained"" or to be a detective and figure it out. Don't bother, as the filmmaker will explain it all to you in the last 5 minutes, and you'll walk away no doubt muttering, ""who cares?"" or ""you must be kidding..."" or ""then why did that character do xyz... Better yet, rent the 2003 film ""Identity"" starring John Cussack, Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta, Rebecca De Mornay and Afred Molina et.al. which is a much better attempt at a psychological thriller using numerology with twists and turns and for the exact same production budget of $30M. My take: ""The Number 23"" should have been made for $5M or less with the same cast working at reduced rates with a filmmaker that was prepared to try a little harder to make the story gratifying to the audience without insulting the film-goer's intelligence or wasting its money."

The cinematography was fantastic especially while JC was reading. I liked the concept of being obsessed with a number, but I feel like the story outside of that number obsession was unoriginal (secret window).

"avgmoviefan","5","1","4","25 February 2007"," the problem of Voice-Over and Music
","there are enough comments focusing on character and plot that i'll focus on the voice-over and music.<br/><br/>my doubts started with the voice-over. generally, a voice-over is a crutch that supports a script that fails to show what it should. if it's important enough for the audience to be told something, it should be seen instead- film is a visual medium and voice-overs are a cop-out. and once you've seen the movie, there's no need in subsequent viewings to hear the voice-over again. not all movies with voice-overs suck, but the majority do. in the case of number 23, the voice-over is counter-productive in two ways: (1) carey's delivery is inconsistent; (2) it deflates any developing sense of menace with carey's character.<br/><br/>the second problem area (for me) concerned the music. this movie screams for a unique score with a unique instrument. with the repetition of 23, that repetition should have been carried over into the music, but instead we're offered one scene with a song from the killers, then the rest of the movie gets your standard violins for suspense fare. not unique at all. they could have done something cool like use only 23 notes or something like that to create an interesting auditory experience, but no, it's the run-of-the-mill filler, and it just doesn't fit with this movie.<br/><br/>overall, the failings of the voice-over and music indicate the major problem with the number 23- interesting concept, poor execution."
"jaredmobarak","6","1","4","25 February 2007"," I think you knowThe Number 23
","Director Joel Schumacher can go from great (Tigerland), to very good (Falling Down), to classic nostalgia (The Lost Boys), to utter garbage (Batman & Robin). When I hear that he has directed something new, I usually begin with a cringe before checking out the new trailer. The Number 23, however, started its advertisement with an interesting premise, great cast, and finally the Schumacher stamp of unknowingness. I didn't care that much, thinking that this could definitely go in the great category and cement a change for the better in his oeuvre, starting with his trilogy of Colin Farrell films to 2004's rock-infused Phantom of the Opera. Unfortunately the film ended up falling flat in many instances. I'm not sure though, how much of that fault lies in the director's hands. The acting is top-notch, the visuals are stunning, and the change in mood from present, fiction, and reality is deftly handled. Maybe the trouble is the average script used, which includes the oldest twist in the book, that couldn't be saved even is Kubrick came back from the dead to take a stab at it.<br/><br/>The Number 23 is about a man that becomes obsessed with a book about a detective and his descent into the world of coincidence the number creates. Walter Sparrow, (Jim Carrey), is confused by the many parallels to his own life that the nightcrawler Fingerling has, soon believing the novel was written specifically about him. Sparrow falls deeper and deeper into the number's grasp until he must find out who the author is and see how the story really ends before he becomes Fingerling himself. Schumacher tells the story through three intertwining plot lines: Sparrow's life and reading of the novel, Fingerling's journey through the starkly contrasted film noir world, and the reality of what these two paths crossing means. The transformations our three principle actors make between the environments are stunning and well constructed. Carrey and Virginia Madsen are completely two different people when playing Walter/Fingerling and Agatha/Fabrizia respectively. Besides the lighting and filtering of the film stock (the film noir world is stunning to look at with its over-exposed aesthetic and hard-boiled detective undertones), the performances are complete opposites of each other. Whereas Walter and Agatha live a perfect suburban life, normal jobs and good parenting, Fingerling and Fabrizia are creatures of debauchery and self-confidence, slithering through a land of crime and darkness with one another's sexual company as an escape from it all. Madsen's entrance to a She Wants Revenge song (which I learned was picked by music connoisseur Carrey) is remarkably bold and sets the tone for how different the two worlds really are.<br/><br/>While the film had this darkness to it, and you wanted there to be a tragic ending fitting to the mood that had been built up to, you end up getting an exposition scene explaining all the events that transpired along with the most obvious plot twist Hollywood uses almost once a month. It is a real shame that the ending had to be such a whimper compared to the fast-paced, paranoia-infused beginning and middle. The script just didn't seem polished enough or smart enough to take a chance on a conclusion that stuck to what the film as a whole was trying to accomplish, in my opinion at least. You also had the character of Isaac French, (the great Danny Huston), become wasted space. There was so much that could have been done with him to create more tension between the Sparrows with his ""is he cheating with the wife or isn't he?"" thread. The alter ego Dr. Phoenix was, however, a delight, no matter how brief he was actually on screen. With a little more time and fine-tuning, this film could have been very enjoyable, but instead it ultimately ends up being a nicely acted and shot, mediocre thriller."

","What was more pathetic? Jim Carrey's acting or the plot? Concerning the story, do you remember ""Se7en"" from David Fincher or better ""A History of Violence"" from David Cronenberg or ""Angel Heart"" from Alan Parker? If you saw and liked those fantastic movies then ""The Number 23"" is exactly what they are not, boring, non-thrilling, ridiculous. This would not change even if you would have cast Mickey Rourke for the leading role, though the presence of Jim Carrey gesticulating like in ""The Mask"" and ripping his guts out to convince the spectator of his dramatic qualities manages to push the idiocy of this mess even further.<br/><br/>Right at the end they even burn like 15 minutes to explain in detail the whole movie as if they would say ""here you dumb ass... just in case you missed something important..."". That's the point where you understand that this was probably a comedy after all intended for children under twelve.<br/><br/>Great acting by Virginia Madsen though, beautiful and sexy as always.<br/><br/>Stay away.

Interesting, though not gripping, original enough, and visually good.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some (logic) problems: why does the shrink react so melodramatically and slash his own neck - immediately - upon seeing Carrey? That's a pretty drastic reaction even for a shrink-turned-loon. Why all the nonsense scenes with the all-present dog? If the movie wanted to be supernatural it should have gone that route instead of the thriller route.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed the movie became a thriller. At least there were no cops and serial killers, but must every movie have a murder case at its core? Is that all that happens among humans that is relevant/interesting? But the biggest problem is how Madsen found the book. The script-writer obviously noticed this flaw (probably very late), so he tried to neutralize it by having Carrey say that ""the book found HER"". That doesn't exactly help, and it's utterly insufficient. Again: the movie did not take the supernatural route hence this kind of destiny nonsense simply won't wash. And besides, didn't Carrey say at the very end that ""there is no such things as destiny""? The odds of Madsen finding Carrey's book - which must have been published with only 5 copies or something - and then giving it to him for his birthday are almost as small as that of Susan Sarandon accidentally writing a Shakespeare play even if we give her an eternity to do it and a million typewriters (and a billion monkeys to help out)."

He desperately wants his script to be oh-so-clever, with a denouement that comes out of left-field and stuns viewers with its originality; instead, he loads it with plot-holes aplenty, mawkish sentimentality, and a ridiculous ending.<br/><br/>Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, an affable dog-catcher who becomes obsessed with The Number 23, a book about a detective called Fingerling, whose life bizarrely mirrors his own. In the book, Fingerling becomes obsessed with the number 23, which he discovers occurs in all aspects of life. Sparrow realises this to be true and becomes fascinated with the concept.<br/><br/>As Sparrow delves further into the strange book, his paranoia grows, and he uncovers a terrible secret which turns his life upside-down.<br/><br/>Despite his best efforts (he packs the film with plenty of stylish flourishes), Schumacher is unable to rescue The Number 23 from sinking under the weight of its flawed premise, and contrived and nonsensical plot twists. Put quite simply, the film doesn't make any sense!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the only way for you to truly understand how messed up this film is, is to watch it for yourself."

Because this film isn't all about explosions and special effects. You have to think all the time and really believe in the words that are said in it. I give a big applause to the writer. It was really hard to make a film out of one number 23 or two numbers if you put it this way - 2 and 3... or a lot more numbers like 11+12 and so on. I loved the story line. It keeps you in action all the time with these jumps from the present to past and a little bit to future. Actors. JiM is really a good actor. Although being serious isn't his best decision because in some parts of the film you can see a spark in his eyes that shows that he wants to do or say something funny about that part. Virginia Madsen... Now that's another story. In parts where she is Agatha Sparrow it's fine but when she is Fabrizia... Sorry, I don't buy it. Her acting is like she was forced to do it.

To be fair, I have seen a lot of psychological thriller movies so I was doomed to see repeating plots eventually. Off the top of my head I would compare this to Fight Club, The Machinist, and Memento. It's just not interesting anymore. There were a lot of options to take this particular story in a cool new direction, but they were probably banking on a mainstream audience that hasn't reached their saturation point with this plot twist.

","A thriller doesn't necessarily need a great plot in order to be thrilling; the execution tends to be more important, but when your lead villain is a two digit number, the film in question is likely to have some big problems on its hands. Rated purely on its structure and thriller elements, The Number 23 is actually not a bad film; but every time I stopped to think about what it is actually happening, it was impossible not to think about how ridiculous this film is. The plot focuses on Walter Sparrow, a man who finds himself being dragged into a nightmare after coming across a book called 'The Number 23'. The book, written by the enigmatic 'Topsy Krets', soon has Walter believing that it's all about his own life. It's not long before he realises that the number 23 is actually all over the place; his name adds to 23, his birth date includes the number 23, his house number is 23...etc etc. We then follow Walter as he develops his obsession and tries to get to the bottom of the mysterious book.<br/><br/>I can only speak for myself, but personally I wouldn't be too concerned if I noticed that a few things in my life added up to the same number. The silly plot could have been forgiven more easily if there was some underlying point to it all; and while it's somewhat explained at the end, overall I have to say that this film is both silly and pointless. That being said, the film is therefore unintentionally very funny, and despite the fact that it's very silly; The Number 23 is at least rather entertaining. Jim Carrey was great in The Truman Show and good in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, despite the film being rubbish and he's not bad in this; but the actor is clearly more suited to comedy, and I was a bigger fan of him before he started taking on 'serious' roles. The rest of the is very much secondary to Carrey, but I always enjoy seeing Virginia Madsen and Danny Huston is solid as usual. The much needed 'wrap up' ending doesn't really come; though we do get some explanation for it all. It doesn't make a lot of sense, which isn't a big surprise but in spite of all the problems; I can't hate this silly film too much."

The Number 23 suffers from some major problems, which I feel we need to get out of the way right away. 23 problems? Oh, I'm sure I can find them, however, I don't think this website is going to allow such a lengthy review, so I'm going to narrow it down to 5 major problems. PROBLEM # 1: They STUFF useless facts about the number 23 down your throat! Famous and infamous people died on this day, The Titanic sunk on the month of such and such, on the day of the 23rd, ya ya ya, you get the point. It gets downright annoying. Okay, we get it, you're trying to establish that 23 is a freaky number, we got it! For the purposes of the movie we will believe it. Only a logical person would know the truth about the number 23 anyways. ( And that is, it's just a number!) PROBLEM #2: Story suffers from plot holes. PROBLEM # 3: Unanswered questions by the end of the film. PROBLEM #4: Impossible scenes that take place on film, but lack logic on how they were done. For example, a buried skeleton is supposedly moved, yet it is not explained how it was moved without a damn shovel. How? It was done off screen, I want to know! PROBLEM #5: Too much mystery, and not enough suspense. The movie plays too much on trying to be a mystery, and as the story unveils, more and more of the mystery is solved, but the REAL mystery remains unsolved. And that REAL mystery: What's the real deal behind the number 23? What's it's origin? Why is it a number that attracts such darkness. Okay, we are going to talk about a sixth problem here, and that is we not only fear the number 23, but multiples of 23. The word PINK, for example, corresponding to the letters to numbers of the alphabet, adds up to 46, and 46 dived by 2 is....drum roll, please...23! Well, 2 plus 3 is 5, far from 23! And 2 take away 3 is -1. See, I'm good with numbers, too. Is this a scary movie? I wouldn't say so much scary, as downright disturbing. The entire movie I'm rating at 6 stars, however, Jim Careys strong performance as the lead earns it another star. Nice work, Carey. Story goes like this: a book is given to Sparrow for his birthday. It turns out the book is about the number 23, and yet it only has 22 chapters. As he reads the book, he becomes obsessed with not only the events in the book, but also with the number 23 itself. He believes the book is about him. Too many coincidences. A few twists and turns, and this movie becomes a mind boggling, ""numbing"" roller coaster of a ride. If the movie doesn't follow you the rest of your life, trust me, the final scene will!"
"Kirpianuscus","Null","0","2","13 October 2018"," Jim Carrey
","Obvious, he is a great actor. This film is a good proof. Not only for inspired portrait of a victim of paranoia but for the art to give coherence to a plot not always convincing. A thriller like many others. Remembering the talent of Joel Schumacher but not being more than a remember. Because the work of Jim Carrey seems not only giving the realistic image of a man becoming piece of a book , but the need to impress of story did not works in many scenes."
"Phil_Chester","Null","0","2","12 October 2018"," More miss than hit
","Joel Schumacher tends to have a hit or miss track record, and this is more of a miss for him. A potentially powerful idea is frittered away by Schumacher's obsession with style over content. The end result is OK and watchable, but it could have been so much more powerful."

","Worth watching for Jim Carrey's performance. Incredibly well-produced. The story? Depends on your personal taste. Some people will love all the hidden meanings and fatalism of the numbers (numerologists?). But even if you're not into the character's obsession the mood of the piece will carry you along. For a plot that depends on the logic of numbers though it is highly irrational!"
"filipemanuelneto","6","0","3","1 January 2018"," The ending ruined the movie.
","We know that the so-called ""conspiracy theories"" have become popular. To their fans, there is virtually no detail of our everyday life that isn't likely to be associated with any weird conspiracy. In this case, the film associates this idea with numerical obsessions and the search for patterns and relations between totally distinct occurrences. The concept explores the surreal, and is quite original, in that it's uncommon in thrillers (at least, I don't remember any thriller with this recipe before).<br/><br/>The screenplay tells how Walter, a perfectly ordinary man, begins to feel threatened and chased by a number after reading a disturbing book. He seeks, and finds, these number attached to different facts and situations, and we begin to question ourselves about his sanity. The film starts well: the initial credits, graphically elegant, were an original way of introducing the theme to the audience and giving it some credibility. I also liked the way Walter is introduced, and how the film emphasized his normality. He's just a guy just like any other, with values and integrity, trying to get his life, who ends up getting caught up in an obsessive whirlwind. His transformation is evident and, at that moment, we're already attached to him because we gain some sympathy for Walter, and our curiosity is fed by every discovery.<br/><br/>However, certain things become too predictable... for example, it's clear from the outset that Fingerling will be a negative alter-ego of Walter. Predictability should have been avoided and corrected, but it's still a minor problem... the biggest problem is the end, which leaves the guiding line too long and ends up having a disappointing and anticlimactic result. A more built and less conventional ending would have made this movie exceptional. At that point, it was a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>I have nothing to say about Joel Schumacher's direction. He's far from being a very good director but has succeeded here. On the other hand, I have a lot to talk about Jim Carrey. I am increasingly convinced that this actor has been underestimated. He became popular thanks to comedies and got very attached to them in our head, so we were surprised when we realized that he can also be a great dramatic actor. But let's be honest: it wasn't his first dramatic film, on the contrary. He seems to be making an effort to show us versatility, and it's up to us to realize that. He was very good here, made a solid and well made work... and I believe I realized, I can see better the potential of this actor. Harder to swallow were the sex scenes. In fact, I felt that, sometimes, they were left in the film. But it's alright. Virginia Madsen also did a good job here, as a dedicated wife and companion or a fiery Italian, with somewhat nymphomaniac outlines (the two actors played two characters, ego and alter ego).<br/><br/>Technically, the film has some brilliant moments. Cinematography begins with warm tones but suffers a violent concussion with Fingerling, carrying itself of cold tones, light-dark, emptiness and shades. From then on, as the obsession progresses, everything becomes colder. I also noticed some excellent camera shots, including the intelligent use of reflexes.<br/><br/>This movie is one of those that can get us mad... it had everything to be very good. An original idea, excellent actors, an able director and good production values. The script started well and was convincingly developed... but when they should have put the cherry on the top, everything collapsed like a house of cards. Frustrating."

","The Number 23 is a Joel Schumacher film starring Jim Carrey, Virginia Madsen and Logan Lerman. It's a psychological thriller about a man (Jim Carrey) who becomes completely obsessed with a book his wife bought for him entitled ""the number 23"". He starts to add up numbers of all the things in his life and they're all adding up to the number 23 and what is occurring in the book is eerily similar to his own life. This movie was widely panned by critics, audiences were kind of split down the middle by it. I am one of the people who likes it, but doesn't love it. It's not the greatest thriller but it certainly isn't terrible like many many critics stated it was. This is a film that has very good performances by talented actors. Carrey and Madsen are both very good in the movie and don't think either of them got enough credit or any credit at all for their fine intense performances. The script isn't weak per say, it's just not very strong. But to be honest, I wasn't really looking for amazing dialogue, I was looking for an interesting psychological thriller and that's for the most part what I got. The plot has some twists and turns at different points along the way, which is always good, I love a thriller with some twists. This twist was good, not the biggest most shocking reveal ever, but satisfying enough. 7/10 overall for The Number 23."

The film starts to get so confusing that Walter in finding what its, the book ""#23"", all about that he loses his mind as in reading it he comes to the book's 23rd chapter that he finds out to be totally blank. The reason for that is that who ever wrote it was Laura's killer and didn't want the police or anyone reading the book to find out his identity!<br/><br/>***MAJOR SPIOILERS***Idiotic to say the least with so many sub plots that are enough to fill at least a half dozen movie scripts the movie is just too insane, like Walter Sparrow, for anyone to either grasp understand or follow. Jim Carrey who incidentally got paid $23,000,000.00-There's that darn number 23 again- for his role as Walter Sparrow also was awarded by many film critics as being the worst actor of the year 2007 in his role in the film. The ending had Walter finally solve the mystery of Laura's murder by him finding out, with the help of his wife Agatha, that he not only wrote the book but was also the main character in it. That he in the end luckily got off with a light sentence in that the judge and jury declared him to be mentally insane when he wrote it."

","As an initial viewer back when The Number 23 was shown in theaters, there was a lot of anticipation that was only let down afterwards. Now after seven years, I thought I'd give The Number 23 another try since the plot escaped my head and the twist was forgotten. Unfortunately, there was no change in my feelings for this film, which is utter disappointment. There was so much potential for this film with its cool plot idea and solid cast. The plot line of everything in your life (birth date, address, social security, driver's id, etc.Â…) all adding up to the number 23 is an interesting concept. However, a non-interesting side story between pseudo-characters in a book with all around hideous acting and writing really shot down any possibilities this film had. The film did have the properties to make a great horror thrill but instead I found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of The Number 23."
"adamscastlevania2","3","0","2","12 October 2014"," So broken that it becomes a chore to watch
","(22%) A quite sizeable misstep in Carrey's career that is messier than Jim's character. The biggest problem is quite a big one all told, and it's the plot. It just doesn't work. Carry's on-screen wife finds an old book in a book shop, she reads it all cover to cover in less than 10 minutes flat (sizeable flaw number 1), then Carrey spends almost the rest of the movie reading and obsessing over it like a man who has just discovered fiction for the first time in his life (sizeable flaw number 2). And his obsession is based around a number because it appears to be interconnected to many different things in his life as well as in history, but that's what numbers do, they interconnect with each other so 23 is just as interconnecting as 104 or 73 or any god damn number (sizeable flaw number 3). The ending is a terrible slap in the face, heap of piffle that even manages to let down even a poor movie (sizeable flaw number 4), and even before you get there the movie is overly confusing, badly edited at times (notice the god-awful cut just before Carrey is about to say a line?), and it's one of those movies that gets worse the longer it runs. And I'm quite sure I could get to sizeable flaw number 23 if I could be bothered, but it's no worth it. I like Carrey, he's the best thing here by a mile, and there is no reason why the cannot be in movies of a dark nature, but he should have kept well away from such an awful broken script."

","It is nice to see a film where the comedic Jim Carrey plays a serious and somber character. Here, he is Walter Sparrow, who is obsessed with a novel given to him by his wife that involves the number 23. Walter finds much similarities between himself and the novel and searches for the author, for he believes that it was written about him. What follows is a decent amount of thrills and suspense that will keep the audience guessing and entertained as the mysterious elements surrounding the number 23 show up one by one.<br/><br/>The movie is also, unfortunately, riddled with some plot holes and disturbing/confusing scenes, which I won't elaborate into since I don't want to give any major spoilers. However, the surprises, acting and tension build-up in the plot make up for the downsides and make this a satisfactory film.<br/><br/>Grade C+"
"mitchellbooks","4","0","1","20 January 2014"," Carry was wrong for this roll
","This film shows that Jim Carry can not do a dramatic roll and that he should stick with comedy. Virginia Matson was very good and carried the picture. The cinematography was very good and so was the directing but with Carry in the lead it all became unbelievable. Maybe it is the fact that Carry has become so well known as a Jerry Lewis want to be that he may never be able to preform a dramatic roll or it could be that he has not had enough training to be a dramatic actor. I believe that this was the movie which started the down fall of Jim Carry as a box office draw. If you look at his film history you will see from this film on he has not done well and it appears that the public was upset with such a bad performance. On the other hand, Virginia Matson has a very bright future as an actor and this film did not hurt her at all."
"Leofwine_draca","5","0","4","31 July 2013"," A dull little movie
","THE NUMBER 23 sees Jim Carrey in a so-called 'serious' role playing a normal family guy who gradually becomes obsessed with the number 23. That's the extent of the plot; does it sound gripping to you? No, me either, and this movie turns out to be a relatively pointless thriller that covers the same type of ground as a dozen others. The only problem is that those others were better.<br/><br/>The crux of the plot seems to hinge on who the author is of a mysterious book that leads to Carrey's obsession. The stakes, therefore, are hardly high; at least in films like KNOWING, the central characters have portents of impending disaster and try to do something to stop it. I never felt drawn into the premise of this film, was never really bothered whether Carrey figured it all out or not. It's as if a one-sentence premise was written down and then a lacklustre film constructed around it. Where's the danger, the suspense? <br/><br/>The jury's out on Carrey in this film. He tries to be serious, but his manic moments recall THE CABLE GUY and he can't resist throwing in some goofy humour. Personally, I think he has zero range, as evinced by this and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. The supporting players are better: ageless Virginia Madsen as his wife, Danny Huston as a typically sinister type, a little role for Ed Lauter. It's not enough to stop this being anything but average, though."

","In the world there is apparently some ""23 enigma"", where the number 23 appears in many prominent places in history, for example, blood takes 23 seconds to circulate round the human body, William Shakespeare lived 23 April 1564-1616, Bonnie and Clyde were shot dead 23 May 1934, and many other connections, and this film was made to expose this, from director Joel Schumacher (Batman Forever, Phone Booth). Basically on his birthday, animal control officer Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) is bitten by a vicious dog he is trying to catch and late to pick up his wife Agatha (Candyman's Virginia Madsen), but when they catch up she is in a bookstore buying his present. She has bought him a red covered murder mystery book called The Number 23 written by someone called Topsy Kretts, and soon after starting to read it he is captivated by it, because he finds connections in his own life and experiences with the number 23, he starts dreaming things associated, and he even associates with the story of the book's character Fingerling and his love Fabrizia. Walter is becoming obsessed with the novel that he is desperate to finish it and find out more about the writer, even going to the lengths and trying to find Topsy Kretts, based on some of entries in the book that lead to addresses and people who may know him, only Walter's teenage son Robin (Logan Lerman) is prepared to help him, but not Agatha much. He eventually finishes the book, which ends on a blank spot, and he is sure that it is not a fiction book, and the writer is a real man, and the name Topsy Kretts is of course a pseudonym for the words ""top secrets"", but his obsession for the number 23 is causing not just distress and paranoia, but some danger to his family. In the end, the murder mystery story of the book is finally revealed to him, as he finds the room written about in the book, a motel room 23, and on the walls are written the words for the final chapter of the book, and in fact, Topsy Kretts is Walter himself, he erased any memory of the murder of Laura Tollins (Ali G Indahouse's Rhona Mitra) when he was sent to a mental institute, so in the end, knowing he did wrong he hands himself in to the police to serve some time and relieve his guilt. Also starring Danny Huston as Isaac / Dr. Miles Phoenix, Lynn Collins as Suicide Blonde / Mrs. Dobkins / Young Fingerling's mother, Michelle Arthur as Sybil and Mark Pellegrino as Kyle Flinch. Carrey gives a reasonably interesting double edged performance with the small amusing moments we're used to overpowered by his dark aide, and Madsen does well as his worried wife, me myself I do not believe in any conspiracy theories or connections like this, it is just coincidental, certainly the story is chilling enough to be interesting, but overall the film is a slow and sometimes predictable psychological thriller.

Basically, it turns worse and worse. I think the film tried to hard to be unique or something new to attract fans of this genre, because everything began to fall apart. Little scattered pieces of scenes (comic-book esqued) were not needed, and made the film even worse. The lame struggles are seriously boring and Jim Carrey's performance was mediocre at best. Everything else was fine, but doesn't make up for the mistakes. Then we have the end, which was seriously a disaster. It still arises questions and left many unanswered. So, that about wraps it.

","This movie got terrible, terrible reviews, at least where I live, and it all made me even more intrigued to watch it than I would be over any other thriller/mystery movie. After watching it, I am rating it 7/10, although I have to admit it is quite flawed, but in a very interesting, almost fascinating way.<br/><br/>Walter Sparrow is a regular family man, until his wife presents him with a mysterious novel written by one Topsy Kretts, which is entitled ""The number 23: a story of obsession"". Sparrow becomes effectively obsessed with the story told in it: apparently an autobiography of some mystery person who narrates his childhood, how he became a detective, and the onset and further consequences of his obsession with number 23, which he claims is ""persecuting"" him. Sparrow's life becomes dominated by his new obsession.<br/><br/>The theme about the doom brought about by number 23 is not as well done as I'd hoped for, which makes it -to me- become an uninteresting anecdote or background motive. The protagonist actually suffers from this obsession and is afraid of the number, somehow, but the movie never succeeds at making us a participant of this feeling of impending doom. (In fact, the movie is quite funny at times.) For me, this is a major flaw in the movie.<br/><br/>Then, it becomes something entirely different: a mysterious film, certainly, where we can follow the protagonist in his torment and his quest to get rid of it, in which he tries different possible solutions while he tries to figure out the identity of the mysterious writer. The movie can be watched as a kind of drama with supernatural or mysterious elements, and I believe that if you watch it from this perspective, you're more likely to enjoy it and find worthwhile qualities in it. Ultimately, I feel that number 23 and its mystical story are the proverbial McGuffin asking us to focus on the character of Walter Sparrow and his story, although this purpose is probably not made clear enough, and the movie seems so flawed because of that.<br/><br/>There are more reasons that make this movie better than average, and they are, first, Jim Carrey's good performance; second, the Lynch-esque, dream-like parts; and, finally, how pretty the film is to look at, with an awesome use of color."

One might argue that this is a tale of paranoia, thus that is ample explanation. Its all just a little hollow. The performances are good without being spectacular, enough to do justice to the characters portrayed. It flows along well enough, however amidst various plot twists it all just seems to fall in to place a bit to easily. Overall its a muddled film, where it actually could have been quite compelling."

","I didn't expect much from The Number 23 and it certainly delivered. First the good points. Jim Carrey's dramatic acting is excellent and he's proved his versatility in previous films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In Number 23 he may have reached his apex, but for reasons to follow we may not have seen his full potential. The lighting and cinematography in this film is superb and it certainly makes an attempt to mesh with the plot/storyline. Now for the reasons why The Number 23 is so disappointing and/or rated so poorly. Jim Carrey has what I call ""William Shatner Syndrome"". Meaning, anything outside his typical comedic role makes many feel uncomfortable. I can imagine how many people immediately think Captain Kirk while seeing a Priceline commercial and how much of an idiot he looks like trying to be silly. The same applies to Carrey in dramatic roles and I don't think he'll ever be able to shake the rubber man moniker for some fans. He could if he was cast in a film with a good script. Why Carrey would do a film like Number 23 boggles my mind, and I blame this on his agent. The script and story of this movie is pathetic, completely un-engaging and unbelievable. If this story was to be graphed out on paper and charted, it would look like an upside-down ""V"". It plods in the beginning, builds ""somewhat"" to a peak, then falls of the edge of a cliff. I compare this story to something that would be made for television, or at best an HBO original presentation.<br/><br/>I gave this film a rating of 4 only for Carrey's acting and detail to lighting and cinematography. If I could segregate a minus 10 for the story I would, but I'll have to settle for minus 6.<br/><br/>Come on Jim, you've proved you can do better then this. Fire your agent."

Of course, when you arrive at 23 through a complex set of equations pulled from your nether regions, it's easy to make it add up to something portentous.<br/><br/>For example, the devil's number is 23. (Rationale: 666 is 3 sixes. 3x6=18. 18+5=23. 5 is 2+3 after all, 23, right?; that's why we add it to 18...) Yet this psychological thriller is an entertaining diversion, moving at a pace that prevents us from seeing the stupidity in 2+3=23 (yes, this is the ""intelligence"" level of numerologists).<br/><br/>Another extraordinary performance from Carrey, playing more than one character again (his real-life persona who is slowly unraveling, and his delirium fantasy called Fingerling, in total control of his Clive Owen longcoat). Virginia Madsen plays Carrey's wife and scary Danny Huston plays a psychologist friend. Both of them turn up as analogues in Walter Sparrow's deliriums.<br/><br/>Joel Schumncher directs (also directed Carrey in BATMAN FOREVER) and Fernley Phillips screenplays with the Rod Serling handbook planted firmly in lap.<br/><br/>This movie made me realize all the uncanny coincidences in MY life and the 23-conspiracy that surrounds us: did you know that every month has at least 23 days in it?; or that the English alphabet has more than 23 letters?; and I'm OVER 23.... oh my goat-faced deity!

","The Number 23 centers around dog-catcher Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) and his discovery of a book entitled ""The Number 23"" that seems to mirror his life along with the continual occurrence of the number 23, based upon the real life theory, the 23 enigma. Starting innocently and with much promise, The Number 23 is a reasonable attempt at a new psychological thriller.<br/><br/>The first sign of attraction, or for some, repulsion, is the casting of Jim, which sees him cast in a completely different role that usual. Instead of your usual wacky humor that Carrey has to offer, you are treated to an especially dark and deeper role than he has ever tackled before. Whether your a fan of him or not, JC holds quite a good performance as Walter, who slowly spirals into madness as he reads more and more into the book and uncovers an undesirable thirst within himself for the truth behind it. While I believe his boundless comedic performance could have hurt his opportunity to play this role, he shows his diversity and intact acting skills, having absolutely owned this role if it weren't for Schumacher's directing.<br/><br/>This brings me to the main problem I had with this film, the direction. This, mixed with the poor script, brings this film down immensely. Things feel awkward in so many places and your often finding yourself hiding a cringe. You want this to succeed so much, and it has everything in it to do so. But then a character comes out with an absolutely atrocious line or does something that is so out of place. Things feel messy and broken and you can only imagine at what this film really could have been. Even the climax that is reached at the end feels ultimately forced by Joel.<br/><br/>This aside, the film has many points of merit. The whole film, for instance, looks absolutely beautiful, with their DoP really outdoing himself. Not to mention the 23 references are very interesting and mind-bending. And as said before, performances are actually very good, it's just the direction and writing that ruins it for everyone.<br/><br/>The Number 23 could have been much better if taken on board by a different director. Sad to say, Joel really does ruin this one for me, but I can still respect a lot that this film has to offer and regardless of Schumacher, I still feel JC was excellent, or at least showed he could have been and still can be.<br/><br/>Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Productions - www.myspace.com/screamingjapanproductions"
"dromasca","4","0","2","6 October 2008"," this was a comedy after all ... oh, it was not??
","I love Jim Carrey's work as a comedy actor, but I can understand his wish to play at least once a 'serious' role, to prove that his acting skills are valid in other acting registries. Problem is that unless your name is Tom Hanks or Robin Williams this is not an easy task.<br/><br/>In the case of 'Number 23' there is another problem, at least for people like me who have a very hard time in believing that occult sciences or theories like numerology are anything else than fraud in real life and good pretexts for horror stories in literature or on the big or little screens. Many great thrillers are based on these, among other my number one science fiction series of all times 'X-Files'. What happens there is that the acting style required by such movies needs to be very restrained and controlled in order to have the maximal effect on viewers, in contrast with the terrible things we witness on screen. Restrain is however one of the least skills in Jim Carrey's acting repertoire and this is the principal reason of his failure in this film. His indecision or impossibility of controlling the grimaces we so well know from 'Mask' or 'Ace Ventura' combined with the lack of any day-to-day logic in the story made me at some points hesitate between the options that maybe director Joel Schumacher made some smart parody and all will end with a laugh and the option that this is just a failed thriller with a huge miscasting in the principal role, a miscasting voluntarily assumed. Unfortunately, the later hypothesis is the real one."

I'm afraid it doesn't really work. Then again none of the film really works. It's sole plot consists of someone making connections to the number 23 while weird, not very deep physiological occurrences happen within his very mind. This goes on for two hours. Two long, strenuous hours of grainy, barely lit settings where Jim Carrey goes; ""2 and 3 make 23, interesting. It must mean I have to have flashbacks now.""

","I think there are a lot of movie goers that have a hard time with Jim Carrey as an actor. Many of his characters are goofy and downright idiotic and so many are exaggerated caricatures of real life that its hard to take his work seriously sometimes. I have seen brilliance in his work on a couple of occasions, but this movie by far demonstrates a side of Jim Carrey that is well into the realms of his developing into becoming a great actor, not just a comedic actor. Jim Carrey displays a depth that he must really have had to work hard to find, because his character is dark, brooding, almost evil to the point that we all can feel the insanity that must be creeping into his characters consciousness as he progresses through the story. A sign of a really good actor is when the actor is able to disappear so well into the character that not only does the audience stop thinking about the person on the screen as being Jim Carrey, but also starts thinking that the person on the screen is really the character living and breathing in their own right. Jim Carrey masterfully is able to do this with this character Walter Sparrow. I enjoyed this movie immensely and hope to see Jim Carrey continue his exploration into dramatic roles. He is fully equipped and capable of carrying a lead role in a drama and am glad to see that he has a very smart agent directing the scripts and projects he chooses to do."

","The movie's pacing was too slow and pedantic for my taste perhaps, relying too much on visual gimmickry. I did, however, enjoy Jim Carrey -comedians tends to have a dark side to them and in this way he gets to play it out (maybe that'll prevent him from sinking into a deep depression, psychosis or suicide). I was not crazy about Virginia Madsen in either of her roles - she seemed too matronly for the femme fatale and too old for the wife. She is wonderful but a tough one to cast because she looks so steady, stable and mature which ages her. In fact, while lying on her side on the bed sleeping at the end of the nightmare scene, she looked like Bette Davis in All About Eve.<br/><br/>What I was really impressed with was the introduction where the significant events encompassing the number 23 are flashed. I would bet there were 23 flashes as well, but I could not count during this viewing. The 23 stabs that was flashed? Ceasar was stabbed 23 times. Dr. Sirius Leary (seriously?) is interesting because Sirius the Dogstar rising from behind the sun on July 23 signifies the start of the dog days of summer. In Airport, the mad bomber sat in seat 23. There are lots of '23' referrals (for more 23's,see http://www.geocities.com/fairyoflyonnesse/ as well as other sites).<br/><br/>And let's not forget 23 Skidoo, the 23rd Chapter called Skidoo in Aleister Crowley's Book of Lies in which the commentary says 23 Skidoo means ""get out"" and the chapter describes ""a man ridding himself of all his accidents"". I believe that Walter Sparrow says something of the sort. It almost seems as if the movie was based on that chapter."

I guess they kinda over did it just a tad. I mean, they were making everything end up the number 23. If you thought that hard about it and got so paranoid you started working it out on your bedroom walls then yeah you'd probably find the same number, a lot. And yeah you would drive yourself insane. It all is kind of, well, predictable in a way. I didn't see the end coming at all. I honestly didn't think it would be him..but if you were his wife, why on EARTH would you give him a book he wrote that drove him crazy and act like you knew absolutely nothing about it while watching him slowly turn insane and say he's being paranoid. It's just common sense really. Plus why was the book in there in the first place? That guy was pretty screwed up and yet he found the time from his busy life of working out ways to torture himself with the number 23, that he just thought he'd go and sell the book to a book store so other people can go insane like him.

This is like ""Jacob's Ladder"" meets a soft core 1980's George Michael video (""I want your sex"" comes to mind - maybe Schumacher directed that too) from the word go. I found myself laughing out loud at much of the ""dream"" stuff. Then there's the dog - supposedly an ""evil"" creepy dog - which comes across as a dog from a McDonald's commercial. I mean, were all the Dobermans being used for the Omen remake??<br/><br/>So then the movie takes forever to get going, but finally gets a bit interesting in the middle (maybe 10-15 minutes), then... oh man, all downhill from there. Not thrilling, just confusing. Not scary, just alternating funny (Jim Carrey's overacting gets more funny here than his comedy roles) and predictable.<br/><br/>******* MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS **********<br/><br/>Then it all unravels for that ending. And we have a scene where VIrginia Madsen has (apparently - the story is very muddled at this point) just found out her husband is a psychotic murderer, and she says something like ""that's okay honey, you weren't a bad person that turned good, you were a sick person that got better."" Now, I'm thinking, okay, she's actually the bad guy, she used a mentally ill guy as the fall guy. Because no one in their RIGHT MIND would say that - but there was no further twist, so she meant every word! <br/><br/>Then we get this cuddly Jim sitting in prison with VO that's like ""Because I turned myself in, I'll probably get parole, and return to a normal life."" Yeah, when your 12 year old kid is 50, my friend...<br/><br/>So why did Virginia Madsen buy him the dreaded book in the first place? At what point did she know his murderous secret - has she always known, or did she just find out? If she just find out, why in God's name is she digging up the remains of his victim? Why is it played as sort of okay that Jim murders the woman just because she has a knife fetish?<br/><br/>I don't know, I was more disturbed by the choices of the filmmakers here than any of the characters in the movie.

","A potentially memorable and novel movie sunk by lacklustre direction and misguided casting. Jim Carrey is Walter, perfect father and dog catcher, improbably married to still gorgeous and devoted Virginia Madsen with whom he shares the ideal marriage, the perfect teenage son and a wonderful home. Through a series of bizarre coincidences his wife Agatha is uncontrollably drawn into buying him a mysterious self-published book - The Number 23 - relating the story of an omnipresent force driving its central character to madness by manifesting '23' in all aspects of his life. As Walter immerses himself in it he grows convinced the curse is real and the book his biography, igniting a desperate struggle to contact its author and reveal its mysteries before his family is destroyed.<br/><br/>It's a clever concept, playing on the tension between the numerological book as an inescapable force propelling Walter towards destruction counterbalanced by his equally dangerous obsession with it as his only path to salvation. Regrettably instead of a layered approach we get simple Hollywood clichés: fog machines, nightmare sequences, flashbacks and haunted dogs. The movie never convincingly infuses the supernatural into Walter's world, disjointedly jumping between them whenever the book mystery falters. The number curse ultimately feels like a plot device to rescue the movie's momentum instead of integral to the narrative, another smoke effect eventually discarded in favour of wild coincidence to tie the few plot lines together it bothers to close.<br/><br/>Sinking the film further is Carrey's woeful miscasting in the dual role of loving father and the book's central character, detective Fingerling. A 'father of the year' crown can't overcome that far from warm and empathetic, outside the home he's insincere and sarcastic, typically smirking, a smart ass who enjoys ridiculing elderly strangers walking dogs and verbally abusing medical professionals. The transformation from paternal model to paranoid threat isn't horrifying when Carrey's bipolar dad makes it credible from the start. As 50's lady killer Fingerling he's completely out of his depth. The role targets a menacing goth/noir outsider in black overcoat and black silk shirt, long black hair oiled back, covered in black-ink tattoos and brandishing a saxophone. It hits Woody Allen channelling Marv from Sin City. Fingerling gets significant screen time with no hope of working.<br/><br/>A potential supernatural cult classic, it's soon forgotten."

To put it in simpler terms, 'The Number 23' is like a poorly made puzzle. It was rushed to get made, so not all the pieces fit. As far as acting goes, there's really nothing to write home about. Carrey is adequate but fails to be wholly convincing. This is not because of Carrey's lack of talent as a dramatic performer. Carrey has taken on dramatic roles before in 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show' in which he was nothing short of fabulous. In this, he's disappointing because the script he has to work with is just...pathetic. Virginia Madsen is decent as well but suffers from the same problem. The best performance of the film, which is not a great performance to any degree, comes from the very talented and very underrated Danny Huston, the son of heralded director of 'Chinatown', John Huston.

"halbarad_loire","6","0","2","1 November 2007"," A thrilling film
","I write this review, as late as it is to the release, due to my feeling that the film is underrated and under-appreciated.<br/><br/>This film. It is plain from the title and film overview that the main character Walter Sparrow (Carrey) reads a book which contains a story around the number 23 and he begins to see it everywhere. The way this is explored is terribly gripping, once the film gets going i found it difficult to even blink until the final. The story does, however, drop off at a rather quick rate, but still has a fulfilling ending which leaves explanations for the main themes of the film and also leaves you with questions that can be answered by paying attention to the details of the film.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was splendid. From Jim Carrey who, without a doubt, has now proved himself to be a well rounded, well-versed actor of any genre and talent. From his comedy of 'Ace Ventura', drama of 'Eternal Sunshine' to the thriller that is 'The Number 23' he deserves more roles and i cant wait to see him branch out more. In addition to him, his partners were great. Virginia Madsen plays the housewife well to begin with, seems to deteriorate in performance to the end for my liking, but still delivers her dramatic moment well. I would say more on that, but that would be a spoiler. I preferred Logan Lerman in The Butterfly Effect, but he also performed as well as can be expected here.<br/><br/>I would say the best part of this film, is the connection you can make to certain characters. Carreys growing obsession. Madsens worry about him or the son just enjoying it all and then getting interested. The people are down to earth and believable, some of the events are almost too much of a coincidence to be true - but isn't that what a conspiracy theory or obsession with any idea is all about? Coincidence is a key to life for people who believe in these conspiracies or any all controlling word/number/anything.<br/><br/>I recommend the film to those who like a psychological thriller. To those who can pay attention and notice little details. I do not recommend it to someone who is planning on walking in and seeing Jim Carrey make jokes for an hour and half, and not for those who expect straight forward shocks."

Carrey is competent, although I do tire of his sad attempts at trying to humanize his characters with the input of sprinklings of his individual brand of goofy ass comedic style. Other than that, he does manage to put the sell on the character well enough, as does his costar.<br/><br/>The problem is that mood & pacing choices by the director have taken a fairly plain story, & tried to bestow cryptic ambiance to it, & fails dismally. Plus, I was less than entertained by the formulated abstractness, like the appearances of the dog, & the novel depictions. I just kept wishing he'd finish reading the damn book, which seemed like a fairly academic read. I'll also add that in hindsight, Carrey just doesn't carry the look of a rough, homicidal character well, either.

","The Number 23 is a stylish thriller about a man who reads a screwy book and becomes obsessed with the titular number. Sounds intriguing, but there's simply not enough substance behind the style (perpetrated by director Joel Schumacher and cinematographer Matthew Libatique) to justify the ominousness. The movie feels like a conspiracy theory spouted off by a aged wino, although Jim Carrey, as the suddenly changed protagonist, is appropriately grim and unhinged throughout.<br/><br/>Carrey is Walter Sparrow, a pet-control officer (i.e., dog catcher) who begins reading a self-published, self-printed book called ""The Number 23"" by a pseudonymous author, Topsy Kretz, that seems to eerily mirror Walter's own life and that points to 23 as a number steeped in meaning. As Walter reads, he becomes more and more attuned to the number's presence, even creating grand stretches of truth to make it fit (such as sometimes adding the digits of numbers to get 23, and other times adding the combined numbers, anything to reach the goal). In between reading the book - which most of us would probably finish in an evening but that Walter takes many days to complete - Walter has vivid nightmares that end with his killing his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen).<br/><br/>The question isn't really whether Walter's insane, because clearly he's a bit not sane.

The movie doesn't address why some people who read the book don't get all bent out of shape over it, or why this particular number is more powerful than any other number. It simply tells us that the number 23 Means Something, and that Something is never a good thing.<br/><br/>Walter's desperate attempts at retaining his sanity and solving the mystery of the unknown author draw both Agatha and their thirteen-year-old (what, not 23?) son into the situation, which is good, because it gives Carrey something to react to other than mood lighting and creepy basements. Carrey leaves most of the shameless, doofus mugging aside for a more ""serious"" - scare quotes totally necessary - acting here, opting instead for a mostly constant eye-lolling hysteria and paranoia.<br/><br/>If the movie had wound up being a stark psychological thriller with no easy ending, it might have been serviceable, but instead it's wrapped up way too neatly for such a plot based in mysticism and conspiracies. At the end, you kind of expect someone to remove a rubber mask and say they would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for that meddling thirteen-year-old kid, his bookstore-owning milf-like mom, and his wacko dad. In short, the ending is trite and utterly predictable, a little too realistic and believable in a movie that could have used a shot of imagination adrenaline."

","** out of **** stars<br/><br/>Let's see...14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 equals 23, which was my departed grandmother's favorite number and the year she was born, 23 minutes past the 23rd hour. Assign the number any way you choose and ooh be very scared. Be EXTREMELY scared when you throw in a brain-dead looking mutt to go with 23, and you have Schumacher's latest attempt at a dark suspense fest with The Number 23. Oh yeah, 23 is also my record in Cuervo shots at my favorite dive on 23rd street in the 23rd state in the union.<br/><br/>Carrey carries the film to about it's halfway point, then we lose sight of him, not caring much. Don't look for any crazy expressions to come from the comedian Carrey, as you have seen in The Mask and Me, Myself and Irene. No. And don't expect an embodiment of a character as he did with Andy Kaufman. This role is a sad and peculiar devolvement for Jimbo. Where's The Riddler when you need him! I know, we don't need him. Virginia Madsen, like usual, is underused as the supportive, speculative and peculiar wife. Her talent, like Carrey's, is suppressed, and it's almost painful to watch her try to rescue her underdeveloped character from near anonymity. <br/><br/>To give credit where credit is due, there are a couple of interesting scenes in The Number 23 that showcase some very crafty cinematography. They are arresting enough on their own without having to be convoluted within the incoherent narrative of this silly story.<br/><br/>I don't know about you, (and I realize this is a work of absolute fiction) but I don't know of anyone who often reads his novel in a dank, dark basement, or spends his time at graveyards on a regular basis like Carrey does in this movie. Schumacher keeps his film dark and blood-red and gloomy and rainy and smoggy and gloomy and rainy and dank and on and on and on from beginning to end. Even Flatliners and The Lost Boys had a little more daylight in them, and we're talking about medical students obsessed with death and teenage vampires!<br/><br/>If you feel like watching this film, even if it's out of mere curiosity...make sure you do it while enjoying about 23 catnaps, that way you can kill 23 birds with one stone."

I'll admit there were some scenes that caught my eye such as the 23 bullshit where the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 everywhere he goes, but that was pretty much the movie in a nutshell?! For crying out loud this was supposed to be a suspense movie and being labeled as a psychological thriller I would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind but instead what did we get? We just got something as shitty as an animal control guy finding himself in the middle of a mid-life crisis and his journey to redemption. Kinda like an old-man flick if you ask me. I probably should have just rented Wild Hogs, it wouldn't have made a difference. I mean who are we kidding, they should have made someone else the killer of that girl. By juxtaposing Sparrow with the protagonist of that book The number 23 they were pretty much giving out the movie to the viewers by hinting that he was the killer all along. How would that have shaken our heads?

Oh, the acting is fine, it was that the story dragged too much. We got the idea pretty quick but the director thought we needed more time with Walter reading the book and conjuring up the episodes within. Those episodes were too dark for anyone to follow and no one knew what was going on anyway. The sex scenes in the beginning and also at the end of the movie really didn't do much to advance the story.

","I did not find this movie intriguing and the number 23 enigma seems contrived and nothing more than silly child's play. Not wanting to give the plot away, I have to say that Jim Carrey's character goes through a development, from childhood to present adulthood, that seems far fetched and hard to believe. I also found Jim Carrey's performance under par and not touching at all. If you want to see a great movie that deals with mental illness I recommend Cronenberg's SPIDER. This movie is very disturbing and features a great performance by Ralph Fiennes. However 'Spider' is not as easy fodder as 'The number 23' - but so much more memorable.

","The Number 23 has masterpiece written all over it. Anyone who has ever had a fascination with numerology or been a student of numerology could have written a better script. This film falls way short in delivering as a psychological thriller. Schumacher, Carrey and Madsen are not at fault. The direction and acting, though not stellar, are above average. The beginning of the script is good. It draws you in and holds your interest. Schumacher uses camera angles and coloring well during the narratives read from the book. The scenes allowing the viewer to see what the character is reading are the brilliant spots in this film. Once the character's obsession with the number 23 begins, the script starts unraveling. The number 23 is just left dangling. Repeatedly seeing, saying and writing the number 23 becomes boring. Character development becomes shoddy, the plot becomes Hollywood predictable and the twists and turns though existing, do not thrill. Still I can't rate the film lower than 6 stars because Carrey and Madsen worked diligently with what they were handed. Fernley Phillips needs to attend script writing 101."

I expected a lot more, at first it was hard to keep track of what was going on and understand what part fits where in the movie. What should have been the foundation of the movie was not even elaborated on, when they discuss what 23 is all about to begin with, they throw certain undeveloped ideas and cut off there and jump to the next idea, as though dumbing down the audience.

","Here, folks, is Jim Carrey's newest movie. His career seems to be veering into darker territories again, like he did on 2004's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But this one crosses the line between morose and sad into actually frightening at times. It's too bad that this is such an underwhelming and generic movie, because Jim Carrey in a horror/thriller sounded like a cool idea. But while this movie is visually pleasing and good if you've never seen better ones, it's really not all that impressive stacked up to the bigger names of the genre. Sadly, the plot twists and turns here are rooted deeply in the likes of Fight Club and El Maquinista, to the point where I have to say that it'd be a better idea to watch those movies instead, and just skip this one entirely.<br/><br/>I don't think Jim Carrey was fully ready to step over the line and into darker, more feral territory. This movie is dark, that's for sure, but it doesn't feel genuine or real. The darkness and morbid atmosphere at work here generally feels forced and contrived instead of actually working. El Maquinista went straight for the jugular with psychotic scares and twists, and that movie was naught but a Fight Club clone anyway, but it still made The Number 23 look like a timid child in comparison. They tried to be dark and morbid, but they slightly missed the mark here. Maybe next time?<br/><br/>Shame, I wanted to like this movie so much, but it's just weak compared to it's influences. Jim Carrey and the other stars here bring up the score, as does the polished and quite well done directing and script, but I have to say that there are other movies that are far more deserving of your money."

While I admit, many times, I felt myself rooting for ""the number"", especially at the end, thinking it quite poetic that Sparrow should end up committing suicide, (succesfully) anyway. THAT would have been a beautiful ending. All of the characters actions do, indeed, make sense within the world's context. The ending shot of the 2 and 3 on the clock as well as 23 occurrences where two items simply happened to form the number (roadsigns, basketball jerseys) were disappointing, but the actual numerology and parallels between Fingerling and Sparrow, as well as the darker lighting, add to making the movie creepily real.<br/><br/>Where Carry is told that hes finding 23 because hes looking for it, blows away the ""23 enigma"", but the movie nonetheless continues to please.

","I'm of the opinion that the genre 'mystery thriller' is not an easy one to handle for a director. A master of this genre in the not too distant past was M. Night Shyamalan, who showed that you either need a damn good story to make it work (""The Sixth Sense""), or you have to have the feeling for what buttons you have to push when and how (""Signs"", ""The Village""). A mistake one can easily make, and here I'm coming to Joel Schumacher's ""The Number 23"", is that you try to cover the lack of enough own ideas by shouting the ones that you have as loud as you can. But in almost all cases this doesn't help, because the audience will notice. So you need really good images to keep people interested. Some of the images in ""The Number 23"" have a captivating quality, but most of them are just hackneyed in a ""We've seen that a 1000 times""-way. Sorry, but showing hundred different ways to get to a result of 23 doesn't make a movie exciting."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","5","0","2","11 April 2007"," An exhausting exercise in grasping at straws
","Joel Schumacher is one of the singularly most inconsistent modern day directors, with strongly watchable films such as ""A Time to Kill"", ""Falling Down"" and indeed even ""The Lost Boys"", but with relentlessly poor films that dilute the quality of his resumé. As if putting nipples on the Batman suit wasn't a severe enough offense, this man is guilty of advertising his upcoming films so well that every time I'm there. The Number 23 is such a film -- suspenseful in trailers and content -- but so tremendously, fearsomely, unbearably so-so when it gets down to business and the theatre is dimmed.<br/><br/>What the film is, more than anything, is blatant conspiricists fodder, a masturbatory love letter to those who seek a correlation in everything, and thus find a correlation in everything. The numerology obsession that Jim Carrey's character develops does not actually serve a significant point in the film, and is undoubtedly only present to instill the 'chill-factor' in audiences. It is a crying shame then that this is one of the least impressive features of 'The Number 23', as it's basically 2 very long hours of grasping at straws: ""23! That's 2 and 3, and if you divide 2 by 3 you get 0.666! OMG!"" It gets old soon: ""What?! 14 plus 9? That's 23!"" followed by shocked, horrified faces. Everything from buses, dates and names seem to conveniently adhere to this number pattern (oh, and this is Schumacher's 23rd directorial effort, dum dum dum!).<br/><br/>There are two story lines operating seamlessly throughout the film -- there's normal family father Jim Carrey, and then there's the dark detective Jim Carrey as Fingerling in the book that he is reading, called ""23"". Jim Carrey aptly balances drama, thriller and comedy, weaving all dramatic components into a layered and believable performance, as he usually does. The real pleasant surprise in the film -- and indeed it's only accolade -- owes much to the bold neo-noir edge in the book ""23"". It's as stylized as Sin City in dark damp urban alleys, although not as compelling.<br/><br/>Apart from the noir storyline, ""The Number 23"" reeks of b-movie quality and set-ups, like a bad horror movie in which Virginia Madsen actually goes out in the middle of the night to visit an abandoned mental institution with barbed wire and no light, and proceeds to run around the dark corridors looking for clues. Wow, let me just tick off the cliché from the formula. It is unforgivably far-fetched, featuring silly canine symbols to top it all off. Most plottturns and twists are predictable, as should they be to ground the audience, but the final payoff is thankfully not easy to anticipate.<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"DICK STEEL","7","0","1","7 April 2007"," A Nutshell Review: The Number 23
","Joel Schumacher re-teams with Jim Carrey in the latter's latest attempt to tangent away from the comedic genre, trying to seal himself as being capable of pulling off a dramatic role time and again. I thought he had decent outings with The Majestic and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (my favourite 2004 movie), though I must admit his brooding, obsessive character in The Number 23 totally wiped out traces of that trademarked smirk off his face. You don't see him smile in this movie.<br/><br/>Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, an Animal Control Department employee with a beautiful functional family, who on his birthday, was given an independently published book by his wife (Virginia Madsen) called ""The Number 23"". He reads too much into it, and suddenly, everything else in his life adds up to this magic number, fueling an obsession of trying to get down to the bottom of the mystery, and to locate the book's writer, who seemed to have understood and written about Sparrow's own life.<br/><br/>Running parallel to the main narrative, like a story within a story, is that from the book itself, where a man known as Fingerling (also played by Carrey, with mean body tattoos), pens down his thoughts like a diary, as a detective undergoing some strange series of investigations pertaining to the number. You can argue that the characters in the book look like their ""real life counterparts"", because that's probably an angle you adopt when you read a novel - trying to picture the character in real life, and in this case, Sparrow sees very much of himself in Fingerling, and plucks the others in his life, into the other characters.<br/><br/>Naturally there is a reason to all the madness, as the story on the number works its way to the finale. In fact, you'll probably guess the outcome midway in the movie, though you'll wonder about the exact ending, dwelling on morality, a what-if you can cover up your mistakes, or to choose to own up kind of situation. It's quite refreshing an idea, with the story centered on the plausibility of conspiracy theories involving the number 23. In fact, there are interesting associations with the number, however, this becomes tired during the times when it is contrived - you know how when dates and times involving the fictional characters suddenly all add up. It's too much of a coincidence.<br/><br/>But no doubt you'll have fun in trying to discover the easter eggs of the number 23, when it appears in the frame of the movie. There are so many, you'll begin to lose count. The special effects and editing also play an important part in the movie, transitioning between current and events with scenes from the book. The opening credits were reminiscent of Se7en's, and the entire mood of the film was dark and mysterious enough.<br/><br/>It's a reasonable mystery thriller, so long as you don't poke your nose too far deep into the number 23. Remember, it's all fiction, and for all intents and purposes to make the movie work, just take it as it is, superficially at face value. The only pitiable gripe about the screening here is, in the name of profits and a general PG rating, much of the crucial scenes, some involving important snippets of dialogue, were left on the editing room floor - for reasons of nudity, violence and bloody gore. So if you're a stickler for such things, and mind you the censoring was badly done, you might want to opt for the DVD instead.<br/><br/>Be sure your sin will find you out - Numbers 32:23"

The plot seems so exciting but somehow it fails to entice me in the show as I feel that the show did not succeed in actually showing how 23 destroys a person's life. I mean OK, so it keeps occurring everywhere but so what? It's irritating but it can just be ignored. So what if the woman has 23 pairs of shoes? Was she wearing a pair of shoes and if she did, did he even count the one she was wearing? I do not understand why 23 is a curse. All the examples shown seem to be more like pure coincidences. OK maybe I'm just missing something important here. Well, anybody cares to explain?

","Well well, Jim Carrey in another serious role.

One of these similarities is the reoccurring of the number 23. It is all over, counting out the numbers in his name add to 23, seeing it on the streets, being born Feb. 3 (2/3) Many of them which is a pretty interesting idea, but some are far-fetched. An example of that was: a girl was complaining about how the color PINK was her favorite color, and that pink is a certain percent red and a certain percent white, and when you divide the red by the white you get 23... which is kinda like whoa, but more so like... shut up... The movie has some cool twists, a decent ending, but overall the movie was a bit of a let down. It is a very intriguing movie, that when you get home will definitely get you looking for the number 23, i have found a few, felt pretty cool, (although i am already into that kind of stuff, looking for patterns and stuff).<br/><br/>Overall a legitimate movie, with great acting done by Jim Carrey, and if you feel like rethinking things a little, then go see it...

","The most ridiculous and implausible movie of the year (so far) comes in the form of 'The Number 23'. It's not a descent into paranoia, it's a descent into bad film making. Through an interesting concept comes ludicrous and frustrating plot twists, each contributing to the film's complete void of originality. You'll groan with impatience, waiting for it to come to an end, and when it finally does, wonder why you just wasted 90 minutes of you life on a stupid number.<br/><br/>February 3rd, just like any other day. Except for Walter Sparrow, it's his birthday. And while his wife waits for him to pick her up after work that evening, she picks up a book at a local store and gives it to him as a present. The Number 23, the book is called. 'A descent into paranoia'. The book tells the story of a man who's become haunted by this number. Its patterns are everywhere, from everyday life to the inner-workings of the universe. 23 is all around us. When Walter begins to notice profound correlations between his life and that of the book's author, he too begins to notice that his own life is surrounded with the number. Desperate to find answers, Walter sets out to uncover the secret behind this mysterious force, a journey which will reveal more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>This film's trailer gave me reason to believe that Jim Carrey's dip into more serious roles had again brought him success and fortune. The concept is no doubt an intriguing one - a number that mysteriously runs the universe. But is it enough to sustain itself for 90 minutes? No. The answer is a resounding no. It becomes clear very quickly that 'Number 23' hides behind this theory to act as a masquerade the fact that there is absolutely nothing beneath the surface. No logic. No vital signs. It relentlessly bashes you over the head with its premise to no end, and when faced with answering questions, it cuts and runs with a hokey twist that will drive an audience to the point of heckling and finding humor where it's least intended. Believe me, I bear witness to that.<br/><br/>Joel Schumacher, you don't fool anybody. Your antics are so wrought with problems, I'm pretty sure I can come up with at least 23 of them. The only redeeming value to 'Number 23' is a fresh sense of style, brought to you by the people who gave us the sweeping masterpiece, 'The Fountain'. But even this becomes a problematic flaw of the film when too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing. There are some innovative aspects to it, like the grainy and edgy look, but it's laid on to the point where it seems they're compensating for the film's dreariness.<br/><br/>It's no secret that Jim Carrey has been suffering from an identity crisis in recent years. Though he delivered a career performance in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', it's also led him to make some rather poor career moves. Add 'Number 23' to that list. It's not that Carrey isn't a talented actor... but only under certain environments. His performance here is so misguided and out of place, it's just awkward. Not bad, but awkward. Virginia Madsen has nowhere to go with a script that's equally a dead end. The pestering sore of a son is more unintentionally funny and annoying than anything else, whose only purpose appears to be spouting off lines that were left over from Carrey's character. There's not much to say when a script makes its characters unlikeable and shallow. It simply paves the way for a dog to steal the show.<br/><br/>'The Number 23' may work best as a way to play a game with friends - spot the number 23! And you know the best thing about this game? You don't have to see this movie to play it. And I suggest you remember that. It'll save you some money, sure, but more than that, it'll save you a lot of needless frustration. 'Number 23' poses some interesting questions, but don't look for any answers. It's all a grand coy, a stupid train wreck of a film. A train wreck you don't want to watch."

","What happens when audiences have seen the same concept a million times over? Naturally, at the point it gets repeated, they get bored, which is why the ending of 23 gets slammed despite the consensus of many that this was a well made effort, in it's initial parts by Schumacher-Carrey and company.<br/><br/>Well? It is, combine it with adequate styling from Schumacher, and his DP Matty Libatique, and hints of Carrey's comedic charm that audiences are so ready to laugh at before things get dark. The film contains absurd attributions to the numerology concept in here, and the twist ending is even more absurd, and again clichéd - but not to say it isn't redeem with a little hope for human potentiality to set things right. Because unlike most movies of its kind, 23 offers us a glimpse of a little of that hopefulness, which is why I want to give a bravo to the writing despite its rotten clichedness... Even if the final shot ends with ""resolute ambiguity"" that counts for nothing because audiences even applauded when that ""ending epigraph"" (is that a correct term?) was flashed before credits rolled.<br/><br/>Still, I feel this is an underrated film, and you know my reasons for mentioning why it has some; if any redemptive value."
"burkino_026","6","0","1","25 March 2007"," Exceptional Jim Carrey and interesting story
","Jim Carrey was exceptional. Maybe it was just that i never seen a Jim Carrey different from the clown as he always makes in a exceptional way, giving life to otherwise nonsense movies (if they make the mask 2,3,4,5,6,7 I'm gonna see them all just becoz the cast is with him) <br/><br/>By the way he plays a different role without all the clown stuff and the result is great for the kind of movie he's acted in. <br/><br/>The story is also quite interesting, not something i really love, but it was pretty interesting. At a point in the movie i was gonna quit getting more interested and started thinking it was rubbish, but then near the end it all made sense and it became two times more interesting than at the beginning. The ending is appropriate so i don't think people is gonna be disappointed with it like in those movies u remain seated staring at the white screen thinking ""what the ..... i shouldn't have spent my money in this crap"" but it's more like ""wow man.... that was a switch"". I liked it overall, the way the scenes were directed and the whole movie goes. It's something i recommend to everybody as it doesn't have a big violence impact i think, i mean, there are violent scenes but nothing i believe to traumatic, apart from one particular scene in which i jumped on the seat almost to the roof ... beware of that, sadly i cant tell you when it is or it would spoil it, so you are gonna hold your coke tighter.<br/><br/>Very good movie that i really enjoyed in a stream of bad crap like even similar in genres to this."
"shelvis-2","4","0","2","25 March 2007"," On a scale from 1 to 23 - this movie rates a solid 4.
","Well, the premise had promise. The execution was an... uh.. execution. I can't remember the last time I heard so many people snickering in a movie theater. How do you read this dialog & not recognize the absurdity of it? And all of the ""23 mystique"" failed to intrigue. The string of numerical facts was a stretch at best. The only highlight if I had to cite one -- would have been the dark rock tune that played about a third of the way into the film. It seemed to perk the audience up, if only for a moment. If you decide to go ahead and watch this film BEWARE OF SERIOUS PLOT HOLES! Also, bring a box crackers, that's the only way to enjoy so much cheese."

","I actually really liked this movie. It's pretty interesting and sweeping and the plot is just outstanding. There are a lot unpredictable events which changes the direction of the plot, and there are some startling scenes (when the blonde girl suddenly suicides, for instance) and overall it's a pretty thrilling movie. The acting is great too, the players seems like they play themselves, and the passage between the past and present just works great. Also the facts about the number 23 are pretty interesting and will make you think about this number after you'll watch this movie. And if you'll be patient, you will see some ""hidden"" mention for this number. 'Jim Carrey' does a great job here, he usually plays in comedy movies, but he had no difficult to play a dramatic character (though he still has some funny moments here).<br/><br/>Overall, it's a amazing movie and which also makes you think about this one after you'll watch it. Highly recommended!"
"stephenson86","7","0","1","9 March 2007"," Carrey soars, Madsen bores!
","I was quite gripped by this film from the beginning, Carrey really pulls you into the films progressions with his voice-overs and ""flashbacks"" so to speak. By far his best performance since 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' Carrey proves that his acting range is a lot broader than you may think. Still however he has his occasional comedy moments (at the start) but as the intensity of the narrative increases, so does his acting. This seamless transformation makes his character seem as real as the person sitting next to you, as you really begin to relate to him sharing his feelings of fear, anxiety etc.<br/><br/>However if we were to call Carrey's performance black, Virginia Madsen's performance would be white. She is as dull as a grey wall and has the emotional range of a bin, quite possibly the flattest acting performance i have ever seen. She is to this film what Steven Seagal is to the world of film, annoying, out of place and really should rethink what she is doing. But this really is not too much to worry about, because like a drunken night she can easily be forgotten.<br/><br/>As for the film, the narrative is relatively easy to follow. It is well explained and never at one point was i unsure of what was going on. The use of clever camera shots, edits and voice-over allow you to predict what might happen but if you don't really know what to look for then you not worry as the films ending is unpredictable no matter how much you read into it, yet if you do figure it out i doubt you will be able to back it up with any hard evidence, has the surprise factor of the twist in 'The Shawshank Redemption' although not as memorable.<br/><br/>If you want to be disappointed then go and see Norbit, if you want to watch a film that will leave you feeling fulfilled and also quite curious about what you can turn into the number 23 on the way home, then see this film. Easily one of Carrey's best films and easily one of Madsens worst. Yet the latter doesn't ruin the film, it just merely makes you want to see more of Carrey. Truly memorable and a nice return for Carrey after a year of nothing. Kudos."

","nice editing, the sound fits somehow, the director knew when and how to combine special effects with in camera effects.

""to be honest i didn't get it"" - in that moment i have seen something else in Jim .. a new but somehow old Jim.. nice scene.<br/><br/>the tension accumulate as the movie goes.. the script is original, the ending unpredictable, what more could you ask?<br/><br/>i have one question.... the writing on the walls and on self is an American thing? (Constantine, stigmata, Davinich code and most of the lunatics movies) .. well in a sequel of Constantine, Jim should appear there, as an evil Constantine :)."

","This was a really weird movie. At first I thought the guy was going insane but he was really reliving his past. His wife tries to ignore it but she gets caught up in the situation. I thought the guy in jail wrote the book and was lying about being innocent but it turns out he was telling the truth. The patient actually wrote the book and the doctor read it. he became consumed by it and had it published by Topsy Kretts so no one would know who the real author is. The book was written as a confession to an unsolved murder 13 years before. The dog was protecting the grave of the woman who was murdered but whose body had not been found."
"mel555","9","0","1","4 March 2007"," was it chosen?????
","Hi everyone my comment on the title (23) Joel Schumacher' 23rd project as director, of course numerology is there and no where for it to hide. for those who don't really understand that, there is no number higher than 9,the root number to all knowledge is 5, this being arrived at by the adding together of numbers greater than 9 as in the name JOEL SCHUMACHER there are 14 letters that equals 5 as in the title and number of projects all equal 5,, But hey, this is not about a mans desire to choose or make things appear that way, some would say that is the way it was always going to be. a little like a merger between the making of a film while being filmed. of course one can make things fit just about anything, how many three's, how many four's, BUT they don't mean anything, 5 does, ???? this is the big dog and it bites.YES great choice of title. question??? was it chosen or was it always going to be that way.... go watch."
"ugurel","7","0","2","3 March 2007"," an interesting story of a life
","I just came from the movie and should say that Director Joel has made a good one that brings about a little question in watchers' mind.The movie is a bit like ""Six Sense"" because of the development of the story that the truth lies at the end and probably you got amazed and think how Walter had such a different life.I really appreciate Jim Carrey that he has the ability to gain every role that can take place in a movie.This time again we did not laugh at him but his serious look deeply caught our interest in the film.Morover since the movie is a thriller, you sometimes feel like nervous or bored but overall it is a good story.I like the films which have a shocking ending or the endings which you never had thought at that way.Consequently this film is one of that so i really enjoyed it.But it has also some pitfalls which you do not remind."
"kevin-caprani","7","0","1","1 March 2007"," interesting and entertaining
","This is a good watchable movie for an evenings entertainment, all the acting performances are top notch and Jim Carey proves once again that he is much more than just a rubber faced goon, the premise of the film centres around the character portrayed by Carey and his belief that his whole world and maybe ours too is under the influence of the number 23, this comes from reading a strange book that eerily seems to script his own life, Carey's character becomes more desperate as more and more events seem less and less in his control, despite some bad reviews this film is never boring and always entertaining, i think the wide difference of opinion is the willingness of the audience to accept the initial premise of the film, suspending disbelief is often a prerequisite for what after all is on first view a somewhat outlandish concept."
"bbSouthstreet","7","0","1","27 February 2007"," Jim Carrey's Finest Hour
","Being a big Jim Carrey fan, I was heartbroken when I couldn't see it on the very first day it had opened. But lucky me, just yesterday I was fortunate enough to see it and I have to say, this is Jim Carrey at his finest hour. Unlike many other fans of his, I knew that he'd do a top job in this film as he does with all his other dramas, Eternal Sunshine for instance. But unlike Eternal Sunshine, Jim gives us a dark and frightening performance as a man slowly going insane from paranoia. Also in this film we get Virginia Madsen, who does probably her best acting job since her role as a detective in Candyman, which is saying a lot since she has been in other films since Candyman. Now onto the director, Joel Schumacher, sad to say I never saw any of his best films, Phone Booth or The Lost Boys, but seeing this film will make me want to go out of my way to rent and watch his past work.<br/><br/>Overall, The Number 23 is a must see for any Jim Carrey fan and if you are looking for a good mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end, then look no further. So hold on to your popcorn because Mr. Carrey will entertain you as he does shock you."

","I went to see this movie this weekend along with Reno 911 and Bridge to Teribithia. I was impressed by Reno's humor, to me Bridge sucked.<br/><br/>But oh wow. Number 23 was an almost perfect movie. What most critics probably don't realize is the amount of thinking that went into this movie. The ending quote about sins finding you out sums up the whole film and it is from Numbers- 32:23.<br/><br/>I usually go with my friend every two Saturdays and we movie-hop. In the past six weeks this was by far the best film I have seen. A great twist in the end, though somewhat predictable is a big thumbs up. Surprisingly Jim Carrey's acting is somewhat good. You almost think he really is going psycho.<br/><br/>Thumbs way up.<br/><br/>""It was almost a perfect movie."" - Michael Hu (he's one of the kids I went to see it with.)"
"wvhillgal","9","0","1","25 February 2007"," He is just awesome!
","I was not a big fan of the comedies he did, but just like Robin Williams, he is just a fantastic serious actor. What disappoints me, however, is how Hollywood never even gives the man a nod. In this movie, he is as believably crazy as Jack Nicholson is in the shining. The movie was not predictable for me, which is a rarity.<br/><br/>The subject line is fascinating and throughout the movie we could hear other moviegoers counting. On the way home, the kids had out their DS's and were figuring up their names and everything else. I think we all have our little quirks, mine being the number 5, and it's easily understandable how the subject matter could be all consuming."
"xredgarnetx","6","0","1","25 February 2007"," The Number 23 means....
","Jim Carrey is on the trail of an author who wrote what appears to be a murder mystery that parallels a real-life case. Carrey isn't sure which, and off he goes in obsessive pursuit. He ends up identifying with the book's main character, a seedy PI who eventually commits murder. One may be reminded of IDENTITY or STRANGER THAN FICTION as Carrey works to clear the name of the man convicted of the murder. Ultimately, the author is revealed and all's well, more or less. The astute viewer will have guessed the killer's ID half way through. Now for the bad news: Carrey is not good enough an actor to pull this off. He does not have what I would call the gravitas. With his strange hairdo and odd antics in this movie, I was reminded of Ace Ventura and kept waiting for Carrey to begin mugging and laughing like a hyena. Virginia Madsen is fine as his long suffering wife and murder victim in the novel. I enjoyed a moment here and there, but not the whole movie. Director Schumacher has come a cropper with this one. It would make a perfect 90-minute feature on AMC or Channel 13/PBS. As a big-budget theatrical number that I paid good money to see, it falls down long before the sweet-as-molasses conclusion. See PRESUMED INNOCENT for a similar plot and much more intriguing ending."

","""The Number 23, its everywhere... and its coming after you!"". What is 23? Is it a code? maybe, is it a demonic number? Possibly, or is it simply a number?. At the moment The Number 23 is a movie, in which you can get most of your questions answered about this number. Remember, this movie is fiction and for all you believers out there...don't believe in this movie, don't start going around making wild and random conclusions about this number, don't even try and look for it, but you probably will. <br/><br/>Jim Carrey delivers a great performance in this Joel Schumacher thriller about a man who's drawing wild conclusion about the number 23, believe it or not if you add Virginia Madsen + Jim Carrey, you get the number 23, same thing goes if you add Joel Schumacher and Jim Carrey, you get the number 23. (Spoiler) Now, back to the actual film, the film starts off with Animal catcher Walter Sparrow(Jim Carrey) bored to death in his vehicle waiting for his shift to end, to kill some time, Walter decides to 'meow' like a cat at a passing dog. Later, Walter explains a couple of useless things, then 2 min before his shift to end he get's a call to go and catch a dog outside a Chinese restaurant, Sparrow isn't happy, so long story short- Walter ends up finding a an evil dog which Walter ends up following in a cemetery in front of a grave stone, Walter doesn't know it yet, but that grave stone will free him...so to speak. After being late to pick up his wife, Walter finds Agatha in a book store looking at a red book(which was in plane sight before picking it up by the way), Walter ends up getting that book for his birthday which is called ""The Number 23"", and this is where the movie officially starts off, Obsession, Suicide, Murder etc... Most of the movie is told through the actual book ""The Number 23"", while Walter is reading it he is imagining himself as the main character and you see the story played out in a high white contrast color. Jim Carrey plays 2 different kind of characters, Walter Sparrow(himself) and a detective named fingerling, in my opinion the acting for the detective part is spot on, definitely looks dark toned and creepy etc... I love the way they actually made the story go back and fourth cause you never got lost, you always knew what was the story and the real world because of the different colors and brightness, and of course Jim Carrey himself. (end Spoiler) There are a couple of twists and turns to keep you interested in the movie, a lot of random things which add up to 23 are in this movie...a lot. That's the only downfall, the movie has so many things in which it draws its 23 out of and all of it is pointless, and we don't even know if its real or just fiction, like the number 32 is 23 reversed, who cares! It doesn't mean its 23, you decided to switched those numbers and concluded that it meant something, or other random and useless crap. <br/><br/>But, the movie still keeps you guessing until the very end. Also, here's another pointer, if you think you see the number 23 everywhere and concluded that its..well, everywhere, that's simply because you're looking for the number and your simply finding it everywhere, but if you'd stop looking then you wouldn't find it at all."
