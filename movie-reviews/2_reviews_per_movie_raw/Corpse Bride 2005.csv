","I think that The Corpse Bride is a beautiful story. It's about true love and kindness. Johnny Depp is a perfect Victor Van Dort and all the characters are played wonderfully. The animation is superb from facial expressions to a reflection in a tear drop. The ending is one worth waiting for. It's an excellent film that all families should see. I'd suggest not taking children younger than 8 or 9. They might not understand the story line that young, but they'll love the dancing skeletons and the fun songs! That was a surprise: all the songs they sang. If there's one song you must hear it has to be the skeleton one, but also the piano sequence is beautiful as well. Hope you enjoy the film as much as I did!"
"LivinForMovies","8","237","291","2 August 2005"," Entertaining movie, won't disappoint those that want to see it
","I got to go to an advance screening of 'Corpse Bride'. The anticipation for the movie was high as the theater audience was clapping and yelling.<br/><br/>I had been afraid this was going to be too reminiscent of 'Nightmare Before Christmas', but it was delightfully original. That is potentially what I enjoyed most about the movie. It's quite an original story.<br/><br/>I commend Burton and all those who worked on this movie. I really enjoy watching the animation, and the characters are all very well developed. It's so good in fact, that I can't imagine this movie being done with real actors.<br/><br/>The songs in this movie are good and enjoyable. I don't enjoy them as much as I did 'Nightmare's', but they do justice.<br/><br/>The voice work in this movie is great. Depp(whose praise I'm not sure will ever stop) did excellent work. I don't think I would've known it was him, that is if I hadn't already. Albert Finney is great, and it's so nice to hear Michael Gough.<br/><br/>My only criticism of this movie is they don't always take enough time. It starts off wonderfully with the wedding rehearsal, introducing us to the characters and the situation. Then Victor takes ends up ""running into"" the corpse bride, goes to the ""underworld"", and the whole thing is explained with a song. I was left wanting more when it came to the corpse bride and the underworld. Then the movie continues at a nice level, just that one part left me wanting more.<br/><br/>It's a good movie. If you want to see it you shan't be disappointed. If you don't want to see it, it might be a pleasant surprise."

","After enchanting audiences with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" Tim Burton brings another stop-motion animated spectacle, ""Corpse Bride."" In this story, Victor Van Dort, an inept young groom-to-be, can't make his way through his wedding rehearsal. Going outside to get his lines right, he accidentally winds up marrying the corpse of a murdered bride-to-be. The animation is spectacular, proving stop-motion can be good enough to compete with computer animation. Johnny Depp provides the voice of Victor, showing mild-mannered and nervous grace. Helena Bonham Carter is the voice of Emily, the Corpse Bride, giving the dead character lively emotion. One striking element of the movie is the color scheme. In the living world, there is no bright color, making a near-black and white appearance. The story is well-written, and the music is good. Overall, ""Corpse Bride"" must definitely be seen!"
"shawn2724","9","116","147","24 September 2005"," Tim Burton Does It Again!
","In Tim Burton's dazzling Corpse Bride, both Tim Burton fan freaks (I was raised on Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice) and new inductees alike will find something to like here. The exceptional stop-motion animation (which has seen an upgrade since 1993's classic Nightmare Before Christmas) joins with top-notch voice talent (Depp and Helena Bonham Carter stand out here) and typically good score/musical work from genius Danny Elfman to create a wonderful movie-going experience. Yes, this is a movie for anyone - in fact, I think teens and young adults will enjoy it more than younger kids with its dark at times bold humor and fast-paced banter (particulary in the clever songs). NO, it is not as good as Nightmare Before Xmas, but it may be that it would be hard for any film to match that picture. As usual, Tim Burton is always at the top of his game when he sticks to his favorite formula - exploring the darkness of the human soul with off-beat humor. Well-paced and a terrific ending wrap up this well-crafted package! 9/10 stars - it's awesome."
"seaview1","9","84","111","26 September 2005"," Real Emotions Breathe Life in THE CORPSE BRIDE
","Don't let the creepy title of this animated, musical tale throw you off. In the tradition of other excellent, animated features of recent years, The Corpse Bride will surely rank as one of the best. Granted, this kind of film may not be for all tastes, but if you can get past the title and are game for a wondrous, haunting world of fantasy and love, then this is your meal ticket.<br/><br/>Victor and his parents meet Victoria and her family to attend a wedding rehearsal. Unbeknownst to Victor's family, it seems Victoria's parents are broke and desperately need the marriage to secure their future. Yet, marriage is new to the nervous Victor, and when he gets jittery at the church, he runs off and into the woods to collect his thoughts. There, he jokingly recites his wedding vows and slips his wedding band on a finger shaped piece of what appears to be wood. The next thing he knows, the wooden finger is a real finger belonging to a former bride, and she has sprung 'alive' to his offer of marriage. As Victor reels in horror and confusion at his 'corpse bride', he is whisked away to another world of people who have died. While the corpse bride is partly decomposed, she retains much of her former beauty. Yet others in this strange land are mere skeletons and rotted flesh. It turns out that the corpse bride was to be married, but her groom had evil plans for her. She has been waiting for her true love ever since her demise. Meanwhile, Victoria's parents are approached by a mysterious, handsome suitor who wants to marry Victoria. Victor must make a fateful decision and choose between the two brides even as the dead descend on the land of the living for a wedding ceremony like none other. One groom and two brides-what to do? This is Tim Burton's latest foray into stop motion animation, and he and Mike Johnson direct with economy from a relatively simple screenplay by John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson. The characters, especially Victor and the corpse bride, are well etched and create an emotional bond with the audience. Although we want Victor to marry his love Victoria, we grow to feel sympathy and attachment to the corpse bride as well. As for the images of the dead, Burton and company do a delightful job of making what, on the outset, could be grotesque and turning them into energized, playful souls. There is a terrific Peter Lorre homage with a worm who keeps popping in and out of the bride's eye socket. After a short time, the skeletal limbs and discolored dead no longer seem frightening or gross. Ironically the most colorful sequences involve the world of the dead while the living are painted in austere, lifeless mutes of gray.<br/><br/>Much of the production team are veterans of other Burton films. Longtime collaborator Danny Elfman again provides an atmospheric score and a handful of nifty, little songs to move things along. Even the voices of the principals are Burton alumni, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter (Burton's significant other). Give Depp credit for voicing a British sounding character convincingly while others like Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Tracey Ullman, to name a few, are quite effective at bringing their figures to life. It's a testament to Burton's imaginative appeal that twice the usual number of major acting talents contributed to this work.<br/><br/>For all those who loved Burton's earlier produced efforts, The Nightmare Before Christmas (whose ghoulish nature is quite similar) and James and the Giant Peach, this is a worthy followup. The animation itself is virtually seamless, and the characters and figures move as in real life. It is a far cry from the Rankin-Bass Christmas specials of the 1960's. The set designs and costumes are very much Gothic in style. It seems that Burton is drawing from his own films or is perpetuating his influences as evidenced in his previous films like Beetlejuice, Batman, and Edward Scissorhands particularly in his obsession with the good and evil in man. It also delves into the perception of life versus death. Who is really alive and who acts like the nonliving? It is evident that the true antecedent of The Corpse Bride is Burton's own version of Washington Irving's Sleepy Hollow with a nod toward Dickens (with its contrast in class distinction and its unsavory characters), especially the Miss Havisham character in Great Expectations.<br/><br/>The Corpse Bride marks a continuing peak in the current revival of animated feature films which was signaled by Toy Story a decade earlier and has been raised to new heights with such recent triumphs as Shrek and Finding Nemo. The final shot is a wondrous, memorable end that recalls the transformation scene in Disney's classic, Beauty and the Beast. In fact, so good is its animation and technique that it is easy to forgive any shortcomings in what is basically a one act, one note story albeit told with sincerity. With just a bit more pathos and storyline, Burton's team would have had an instant classic. It's a near miss, but its status as the best animated film of the year is secure."

","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride was one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. My mother and I are so happy that he made another beautiful and original animated film since The Nightmare Beofre Christmas because we waited for it for 10 years. I'm glad to say that the wait was worth it. The Corpse Bride is a wonderful emotional yet fun story with heart. We had a wonderful time watching it in the theaters and we can't wait to go see it again this weekend. The visuals are so amazing that you'd have to go see the movie with your own eyes for its impossible to explain there perfection. The characters all look stunning and there are so many wonderful new characters in this movie that will keep your eyes glued on the screen. The voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson are packed with fantastic emotion and acting. The score goes very well to the movie and the four songs that are performed sound wonderful. My favorites were ""Remains of the Day"" made me feel like dancing: it was such a jazzy fun song with the cool voice of Danny Elfmen. And my other favorite was ""Tears To Shed"" it broke my heart. Helena Bonham Carter sang that song with such heartbreak I loved it! The story is very entertaining and it has so much heart in it and Gothic like background. I loved the dialog some of my favorite lines were ""Why Go Up There When People Are Dying To Get Down Here"" and ""Can A Heart Still Break Once It's Stopped Beating."" But the most important thing is that this movie makes you feel less frightened about death. Death in this movie is a lot funner than living and the dead are always having a good time and partying that you feel like dying is not so bad. You should take anyone to see this movie if their paranoid about death it will soften their fears, Overall I strongly encourage anyone to go see this movie. I hope Tim Burten wins the Oscar for best animated movie this year. He truly deserves it! Thank you Mr. Burten for the Corpse Bride, Nightmare Before Christmas and years worth of your great films."

","This film is 100% spectacular, in my opinion. As we all know from the previews prior to the release, Johnny Depp's character must choose between his living and dead brides, essentially. To be perfectly honest, throughout most of the film, I was undecided on who I thought he'd choose and be able to work it out with. This is accounted for by wonderful story-fying and lovely screen writing! Danny Elfman is the musical genius still, not that I had any doubts.<br/><br/>Overall, throughout my viewing of the film, I was in awe, gales of laughter, near tears, or just plain excited! Tim Burton has done it again.<br/><br/>AMAZING FILM!"
"Elvison","10","87","123","27 September 2005"," Magic Music by Elfmann
","Corpse Bride works for me on so many levels but outstanding is the integration of music and words. The musical that blended the words and music to such a level that one could hardly imagine the film without the composer's contribution. This should be advertised as Danny's production as was the practice of Rogers and Hammerstein, or Irving Berlin or Cole Porter. We have a new art form here: the animated opera. Music is alive and well in the world of the dead. The music in the titles presents themes which continue into the film. An important part of the love story is the interest of the main characters and their methods of expression of emotion via piano music. The characters exist in an aura of sound. Imagine a Russian epic without the Lara Theme or Rick's place without Sam's piano. This film has achieved an identity that says this is music and this is what the movies has to say. All awards to those involved!"

"XFLRWF","8","58","84","17 September 2005"," Honeymoon for ""Corpse Bride""
","Hello all. I had the privilege to catch an advance screening of ""Corpse Bride"" today so here's my take on it.<br/><br/>Presenting subjects which are typically dark and frightening and show them in a positive light has long been a trademark of Tim Burton. In the director's latest film, ""Corpse Bride"", Burton spins death and murder into a charming musical about the power of love. Burton applies the same technique as with his last stop-motion picture, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas, but with a more fluid and smoother effect. Lead by the vocal talents of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, ""Corpse Bride"" is a terrific achievement of film-making.<br/><br/>On the day of their wedding rehearsal, arranged lovers Victor (Johnny Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson) run into a complication with the ceremony: Victor cannot remember his vows. While practicing in the forest, Victor mistakenly places the ring on the finger of a dead woman (Helena Bonham Carter) and is immediately married to his new bride, Emily. While Victor searches for a way out of the underworld and back to Victoria, he learns of the devious plot of how Emily was murdered and experiences the beauty and charm that still resides in her. Victor must decide whom he loves more: his bride-to-be or his corpse bride.<br/><br/>Tim Burton and Mike Johnson create a contrasting yet complementing world. The background and setting for the living is dark and cloudy. This is matched by the dark clothing, mundane lifestyle, and pale complexion of the citizens. Characters who are more full of life and color occupy the underworld, a location that is supposed to be bleak and gloomy. The stop-motion animation style is accomplishedly used to bring these objects to life. They never fail to capture emotion nor are they afraid to be as outrageous as they can with the characters' design and movements. This is best illustrated when the directors capture an elaborate song and dance number detailing Emily's demise.<br/><br/>The screenplay penned by John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson feels targeted for younger members of the PG audience. There are many puns is regards to death, e.g., ""dead right"", and the end is predictable thanks in part to an obvious foreshadowing detail. But that is not to say the film is a failure. The writers do a great job with tackling the morbid topic of death and turning it into a love story. <br/><br/>Whenever there is a Tim Burton film, Johnny Depp will usually be leading the charge. ""Corpse Bride"" is one of those instances. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter lead a talented cast of actors in providing the vocals to their characters. Depp gives Victor the frightened, insecure persona that befits the young man who is unsure of just about everything in life. Emily Watson does the perfect counterpart for Victoria. She is more confidant and less shy than her groom-to-be and she brings out the more attractive qualities of Victor. Carter provides Emily with a loving and caring demeanor. She genuinely cares for and loves Victor and she will do anything to make him see that. Even more skillful is her ability to bring out Emily's sadness. Audiences will feel her pain when she cries and the emptiness she feels when all she needs is love. The supporting actors are also expertly cast including Christopher Lee, Albert Finney, and Michael Gough. Each performer's voice brings out the ideal quality and trait of their character that one can imagine them performing the role in the flesh.<br/><br/>The title of ""Corpse Bride"" almost gives the wrong impression about the film. The movie is a love story albeit with a darkened twist. It is not meant to be frightening but rather it shows a peaceful and romantic co-existence between the living and the dead. Audiences will be fascinated with the seamless quality of the animation and the vocal talents that give the characters life. For ""Corpse Bride"", the honeymoon is about to begin. <br/><br/>CORPSE BRIDE Starring: Johnny Depp, Helen Bonham Carter, Emily Watson<br/><br/>Grade: A- <br/><br/>Honeymoon for ""Corpse Bride"" 8/16/05 (released 8/23/05)"
"Mike_Wiggins","9","11","13","5 January 2006"," Tim Burton and Danny Elfman do it again with a macabre romance only they could successfully make!
","I recently did something that I haven't done for over 20 years: I bought a movie soundtrack. That was because I was so enchanted by Danny Elfman's score in ""The Corpse Bride"" that I HAD to hear it again ... and again. What with the haunting main melody heard throughout the movie contrasted with the catchy jazz tunes of the underworld (the name of the lounge was the ""Ball and Socket"") plus songs like ""The Remains of the Day"", ""Tears to Shed"", ""The Wedding Song"" and a brief piano solo (and a piano duo), I really felt, as some IMDb reviewers have alluded to, that I was watching a Broadway production. It was also interesting to note that Danny Elfman was the voice of the underworld band leader (Bonejangles).<br/><br/>*** MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW *** *** YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!! ***<br/><br/>Now that you know that I loved the music, I will say that I really liked the movie. I found the plot a bit weak but still quite enjoyable. While we, as the audience, are supposed to empathize with Victor's dilemma at having to choose between Victoria and the Corpse Bride, to me it lessens Victors character because it shows him as being wishy-washy and even a bit of a jerk. I just wished he were given a little more backbone. At the end of the movie, when the Corpse Bride makes her metamorphosis (quite beautifully I might add), the trouble is that there is no apparent vehicle for this change. While it doesn't ruin the movie, it kind of leaves me hanging wondering ""What just happened?"" For example, I would think that the maggot, who is resident in the Corpse Bride's eye, could have been revealed to really be a caterpillar and from there you have the vehicle for the change. I really liked the pre-wedding celebration in the underworld. This joyous part of the movie was probably the most difficult to compose and shoot what with all the motion. The music at some points in the celebration reminded me of Walt Disney's ""Cinderella"" when the mice were making Cinderella's dress. It is only one of two places (that I remember) where Danny Elfman's score shifts to major key, instead of the traditional minor key in Burton/Elfman collaborations.<br/><br/>*** END OF SPOILERS *** <br/><br/>The stop-motion animation is exquisite. For example, the movement of cloth (including veils) was amazing. In the attention-to-detail arena, there is a skeleton dog in the underworld whose movements were so good I thought I was looking at a real one. It still amazes me how you can make a stop-motion production that includes the numerous combinations of pans and zooms that this movie had. I can only imagine the agony there must have been trying to shoot it, not to mention re-shoots. If you read the TRIVIA section, you will notice that ""...it took the animators 28 separate shots to make the bride blink."" Many other, less patient or less funded, animators would have settled for 8 separate shots.<br/><br/>Now, as for rating the movie, it was more difficult for me than I expected it would be. In the end I give the movie 9 stars. But I will say that without Danny Elfman's score, I would have rated ""The Corpse Bride"" at 8 stars. To those in IMDb-land who have made comparisons between Elfman and Richard Rogers, I am beginning to believe you're absolutely right."
"trickyhappyelf","8","105","166","11 September 2005"," Another beautiful Tim Burton movie
","i just saw this movie at the Toronto film festival. Tim Burton, as with most of his movies, makes the setting and visuals the most important part. And what a beautiful movie it was, the animation was astounding. You could tell that each frame was tirelessly worked on in order to make each little piece have its own distinct look. The plot is unimportant, and cliché, but that doesn't matter. This movie shouldn't be watched for the storyline. The voice acting was very convincing, especially the lead, Johnny Depp, who does a great job as the shy, clumsy Victor. The only character i really didn't think was needed was the worm, who was just included just for some childish comedic relief, which took away from the dark mood of the picture. Though not as enjoyable as ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" it still was a very good animated movie. 8.5/10"
"Cel_Stacker","8","11","14","12 October 2005"," Exquisite (haven't seen that word in a while)
","Burton takes another playful swipe at his stop-motion heroes with this nicely-done treat.<br/><br/>Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is a milquetoast. A bumbling, unlucky dreamer. To make things worse, his parents (multi-talented Paul Whitehouse and Tracey Ullman) are forcing him into the classic ""arranged marriage"", which is more like a contract with the cash-strapped but aristocratic Everglots (Albert Finney & Joanna Lumley). Things turn around, however, when he meets his intended, Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) who is actually very attractive, inside and out.<br/><br/>The ceremony is as arranged as the marriage, unfortunately, and the frustrated minister (Christopher Lee) demands that Victor take time out to PRACTICE HIS VOWS. This too, is awkward, as in the midst of his rehearsal, Victor places a ring upon a corpse's poking finger (just the place to rehearse a wedding, a cemetery) thus rousing the title character (Helena Bonham Carter), who leads Victor on a voyage through life and death and an unwitting quest to figure out what he really wants.<br/><br/>Exquisite, yes, and enjoyable, but not without a few flaws. Most of the songs, while well written, feel out of place, and potentially powerful villain, Barkis Bittern (post-Doctor Who Richard E. Grant) doesn't seem to be allowed to do enough. But the good far outweighs the bad--moviegoers who get past the title will find a light-hearted romp that is rife with parody and spoof, from the Harryhausen brand piano to the diminutive character Bonesapart (played by the diminutive Deep Roy). A cameo by Jack Skellington would have been cool (O.K., Disney) but Danny Elfman's Bonejangles does pull off an eye-popping number. Even the unsettling, Peter-Lorre-channeling maggot residing in the Bride's skull threatens to steal the show. Good cast (with many Burton stalwarts, incidentally), with the philosophy that less is more make for a good time.<br/><br/>Like it or not, it is well-worth noting that this film delivers many firsts to film-making, including new-style digital camera-work on refined stop-motion. To animators and film students, this offering comes highly recommended."
"danielagigante-35250","4","4","4","18 February 2020"," It's Watchable
","I felt compelled to write this review after seeing how many 9s and 10s this movie is receiving. Let's get it out of the way right now: this movie is not a 9 or a 10. Look, if you're a Tim Burton superfan you'll likely enjoy this film. It's watchable and the animation is pretty cool, as always.<br/><br/>The plot though. I don't understand how Burton made this much of an amateur move. Victor never seems to have any serious attraction in either woman. Sure, he and Victoria are getting chummy over the piano, but there's not much more than that. It's never established, anywhere in the film, that Victor and Victoria have grown to really like or love one another. And for confirmation of this, prior to Victor getting married to Victoria, he's totally read to DIE so he can marry Corpse Bride.But wait, that's not where the problems end.<br/><br/>he relationship between Corpse Bride and Victor is probably more poorly developed than Victoria. Here's a woman he basically kidnapped him and refused to return him to his family and wife. Victor obviously has no interest in her early on due to him lying to her in order to get out of the land of the dead. The only indication Victor's feelings for her have changed is the duet (who would have guessed?). He then falls for her deeper when she says she doesn't want to kill him (what an angel!). But of course, he clearly never was deeply in love with her as he doesn't fight her when she decides marriage isn't right and encourages him to marry Victoria.<br/><br/>These are giant gaping holes in the basic development of the money. It's also a bid boing and the scores aren't particularly good."
"tedg","Null","20","29","6 January 2006"," Chopin's Grave
","I liked this a lot, and a large part of the reason is that it is pure a Burton film as we are likely to find.<br/><br/>And when I say Burton, I mean that oddly successful collaboration between him and Elfman colored by commercial realities.<br/><br/>The big picture is that there are very few filmmakers with the skills and courage to be unique, to make movies that only they could. This goes beyond style into the nature of the soul.<br/><br/>If you do not have an interesting soul, you cannot be an artist. If you do not have the courage and ability to reveal that soul in some way to us, you cannot either. So hurrahs for the few in the world of film that do.<br/><br/>In a way, this film is a notion expanded around Ub Iwerks' (yes, that's a real name) ""Skeleton Dance"" done for Disney and quoted in a couple more hip Betty Boop cartoons. In another way, it is a simple date movie: boy gets girl, boy loses girl by misunderstanding, boy gets girl back and the thing ends in a wedding.<br/><br/>And also in a way, it is a love poem to his girl friend. I'm fascinated by these things, where a talented director (usually a man) can shape the image of the woman he loves. Films DO influence how we think of love, but this is more genuine and powerful than any of them, this real love that shines through purely cinematic means. Just think about casting the woman you love as a corpse! She is as alluring here as she has even been.<br/><br/>But beyond that is something that is more lasting, the business between Depp and Burton. Johnny is a fine actor, but many fine actors don't get the opportunity to explore new and unknown corners of darkness. He has and is better off for it. And so are we, though whenever this happens we end up with a new character template that inevitably becomes a stereotype. Depp already mines that stereotype in his Pirate movies.<br/><br/>But what concerns us here is how Burton/Elfman deepens what he has with Depp. He introduces the character as a pianist, and does so with a piano piece. That piece is a skillful blend of Chopin and pop, but more on the Chopin side. For many, Chopin is the most nakedly emotional yet dark soul they will encounter. No humor, only intimacy and passion. <br/><br/>So two clever things were done with this. The first is that the Depp persona (though an animated avatar here) was made deeper by reference to our deepest pianist. The second is that a few musical scenes and effects are set up, all of which reference the scene in some way. There's a sweet musical duet with Helena where they do fall in love. There may be few things more lovely than making love via music played to each other -- with each other.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"bgood26","9","10","14","28 September 2005"," A new generation of animation
","I don't care how visually brilliant an animated movie is. These days, if it doesn't have a good story, interesting characters, appropriate music, and competent actors, the movie is going to suck. I want to feel like I'm watching a live-action movie. Fortunately, Tim Burton is a wonderful storyteller, and ""Corpse Bride"" is an example of his imagination.<br/><br/>Victor (Johnny Depp) is about to meet his bride Victoria (Emily Watson) for the first time. It's early 19th century England, so it is an arranged marriage. During the rehearsal, he keeps flubbing his vows, panics, and runs into the woods. He practices, and when he finally gets it right, he places the ring on a tree branch. Except that it isn't a tree branch. It's the finger of a corpse (Helena Bonham Carter), and she thinks she's now married to Victor! He runs, crashes into a tree, and knocks himself out.<br/><br/>When he comes to, he finds himself in--it's not really Hell, and it's not really Heaven, so we'll just call it the underworld. Bonejangles (Danny Elfman) tells the ""tragic tale of romance, passion, and a murder most foul"" in a jazzy song-and-dance routine. Victor becomes friends with Emily, the Corpse Bride, and she falls head-over-heels in love with him. But he's not sure if he wants to live among the dead, and he's torn between Emily and Victoria.<br/><br/>The stop-motion animation is the same style as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" The animation has come a long way since 1993, but I liked ""Nightmare's"" story more. There are some parallels, but contrary to rumor, Jack Skellington does not make a cameo. Overall, this is a beautiful love story with likable characters, catchy music, and, of course, visually brilliant animation.<br/><br/>PG for scary stuff. Most kids who understand death and/or love will enjoy it."
"DICK STEEL","9","11","16","30 September 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Tim Burton's Corpse Bride
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp? Sign me up for it, anytime! I've pretty much enjoyed their collaborations, from Edward Scissorhands to Sleepy Hollow. Hot off the heals from their box-office success Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, their latest collaboration sees Depp lending his voice to Burton's macabre vision in a stop motion animated movie, along the veins of Nightmare Before Christmas (NBC).<br/><br/>The story's a little bizarre, a little morbid, but hey, it's Burton on familiar grounds. The Von Dorts and the Everglots have agreed to an arrange marriage between their children Victor (Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson), but Victor, fumbling the marriage rehearsals, runs away to seek solace, and accidentally unleashes the Corpse Bride Emily (Helena Bonham Carter, giving the character an impeccable Brit accent). So begins a crazy love triangle of sorts, involving characters from both the realm of the living and the dead.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Burton managed to squeeze a couple of subplots into this relatively short film, and touched on themes like arranged marriages, what's in it for both families (The Von Dorts are the newly rich, wanting to add prestige to their family name, while the Everglots are bona-fide aristocrats who've gone bust, and need the dough to continue their lifestyle and save face). Different facades of love are exhibited between Victoria-Victor-Emily, one which is the more conventional (and maybe improbable?) ""love-at-first-sight"", while the other, growing to love a person (though it happened within 24hrs, so what?) You might be able to guess the ending and the relations between some of the characters mid-way through the movie, though some might prefer an alternative ending. If you're acquainted with Burton's works, it's typical of him and his style, so you'll see it coming the way it was, as per his dark visions.<br/><br/>The art and characters are very NBC-like too, with their small heads and extremely long limbs. Stop-motion is difficult to do, and watching it in a digital format brings out the crispness of the figurines. Burton loads the film with many supporting characters, each with its own zany behaviour, and some even spoofing characters from movie classics. Somehow Christopher Lee's Pastor Galswells suffered from LOTR's shadow and always reminded me of Saruman, though I think the reference was unintentional.<br/><br/>And what's an animated flick without humour? Corpse Bride has tons of references, and both physical and dry humour to satisfy both camps. The music's also top-notch, but what can you less expect from another long time Burton partner Danny Elfman? Though you can hear shades of Batman in the instrumentals, the songs and lyrics are really a class of their own, bringing this musical to life, just like what Elfman managed to do for NBC.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, even if it means forking out S$9.50 on a weekend for a less than 80 minutes show. I can't wait for another dark stop-motion animated movie from Burton. Bring it on I'd say!"
"AlsExGal","7","8","11","31 July 2015"," Good animation, but not one of Tim Burton's best
","I probably would have liked this movie more if I had not already seen - many times - ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which was a brilliant and original piece of work. This movie does share some of that movie's qualities - haunting soundtrack, bumbling authority figures, a tall thin protagonist who is searching for something, a heroine whose limbs easily detach, and a dear departed house pet. It also has some interesting ideas of its own - the living looking and acting as though they were already dead, versus the dead living it up, since they have no more worries and forever to look forward to with the prospect of all of their loved ones returning to them one by one. In fact, the only time the living seem happy in this film is when the dead return to the land of the living for a truly unique wedding and instead of menacing or haunting the living, there are tearful and happy reunions. However, the individual characters in this film are just not that interesting.<br/><br/>In short, even though all of the characters in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" are dead, they just seem more alive and motivated than the characters in this film. Also, this movie is darker than ""Nightmare"" and not as funny, so kids under 10 might find it too intense and probably not as interesting. Thus, although it is worthwhile viewing, I'm just afraid that Tim Burton set the bar too high with his previous animated film."

How often does that happen? <br/><br/>Utterly wonderful, pure Burton, with all trademarks - dog, snow, favourite actors, oblique references to earlier Burton films. Like Nightmare? Only in the sense that it's easily identifiable as a Burton Stop motion movie! The cast were perfect; is it my imagination, or do some of the characters vaguely resemble their actors faces (NOT Ms's Lumley, Horrocks or Ullman - but that chin on Barkis Bittern....) Danny Elfman again proved that he can translate Burton's concepts into music. We came out singing the songs. <br/><br/>Beautiful, bittersweet ending...as the lights came up, I was wiping away a tear. Like all TB films, though, the more you know of him and his films, the more you'll enjoy it. Can't wait to see it again!"
"jon.h.ochiai","9","8","11","2 October 2005"," 'Til Death...
","Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is deceivingly titled. Though its lead character is in fact dead, ""Corpse Bride"" is inspired dark comedy and an unexpected touching love story. ""Corpse Bride"" is traditional stop action animationa very time consuming process. A lot of time was also invested in the movie's storytelling. ""Corpse Bride"" is a macabre fairy tale. Director Tim Burton is either hit or miss for me. Burton as usual is absurd and eccentric, but here he also follows a conventional fairy tale in spirit. This is largely due to the screenplay by John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson. Their crafted tale is funny, clever, and also in love with its characters. Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is all hit. An almost unrecognizable Johnny Depp voices Victor Van Dort the young man who inadvertently ""marries"" the Corpse Bride (voiced by the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter). Being that they are literally from different worldsone being that of the livingtheir future is cursed, so to speak. Their believable love story ultimately makes ""Corpse Bride"" this wildly funny dark fairy tale about love and selflessness. Very cool stuff.<br/><br/>Victor (Depp) is victim of an arranged marriage to Victoria Everglot (the very charming and strong Emily Watson) of the noble, but bankrupt Everglot family. The Van Dorts are the nouveau rich, in search of title. Hence this marriage fulfills title and wealth. Win. Win. You would think. During the rehearsal a suspicious relative Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) arrives a day early. Even his name is unsavory. Although Victor accidentally finds his soul mate in Victoria, he can not bring himself to follow through with the rehearsal. He flees to the forest. There he professes his vows to his true love, and the Corpse Bride (Bonham Carter) accepts. They leave for the world of the deadthe catch being that Victor still has a heart beat. Victor's stay is both hysterical and just plain weird.<br/><br/>""Corpse Bride"" does telegraph a plot point prematurely, but overall the story has a charming and touching twist. Credit its amazing voice actor talents. Johnny Depp gives Victor an innocence and strength of character that is never frivolous. Emily Watson threads the fine line as the ""other woman"". She gives Victoria great compassion and heart. This is really Helena Bonham Carter's showcase. As she voices the Corpse Bride she is initially unaffected, not realizing her fate. Then there is a visceral sadness when she comes to terms that she must go without love. She poignantly says, ""My dreams were taken from me."" So does she now take this away from someone she now loves? This really makes ""Corpse Bride"" a funny, inspired, and special movie. This is Tim Burton's best work. See ""Corpse Bride""."

","This stick-figure animated film offers good visuals, inventive-looking characters (that being perhaps the most fun of the film), and a decent story that finished with a very nice ending. There are songs in here but they are only so-so, and certainly not the attraction to the film.<br/><br/>The story starts off slowly, but once the characters went down under into the land of the dead, not only did we finally start seeing some colors other than blue, but the whole film came alive and pretty much stayed that way until the end.<br/><br/>As with good animated movies, there is so much you can see that you can't take it all in. It's a feast for the eyes with all the wild-looking characters and nice drawings. Getting good visuals from director Tim Burton is no surprise; he always comes through in that department. Unfortunately, he also usually delivers an anti-religious cheap shot or two.. Here, the minister is pictured as a sour old guy. Burton also pictures clerics in a negative way, and the occult in a positive way. However, he certainly makes interesting films, no matter what the subject matter, and there usually isn't a lot of profanity in his films. There is none here whatsoever.<br/><br/>Overall, an inventive film and fun to watch once you get past the slow first part."

","I am part of a select few here in the las Vegas area, that have been privy to a advance screening of THE CORPSE BRIDE. I have to say it was one of Burton's best. I used to think his animated short VINCENT, was his second best. Having JUST seen the movie ( no more than 45 min ago ) This movie was just as good as nightmare. Actually, you could see were there are even better moments in the CORPSE BRIDE. ( IE new camera moves ). <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a 10!! I am going to be seeing it MANY more times before it is let out of theaters. HIGHLEY recommended!! As always, Mr. Burton has NOT let us, his lowly Fanboys down! ;)"
"jeslongo","7","8","12","5 October 2005"," Here's the thing
","People say that Corpse Bride was horribly boring, etc. HOWEVER, that is because they are comparing this nonstop motion picture with Nightmare Before Christmas. Those who were really upset after the movie, saying that 'it's definitely not Nightmare', you are absolutely right. It is not Nightmare. It's Corpse Bride, a completely different movie. Everything was comparison, Nightmare to Corpse Bride, and yes, I'll admit, I enjoyed Nightmare more. However, when going to see this movie, you cannot compare Corpse Bride to Nightmare because then yes, you will be upset. If they had done another Nightmare, they would have done it years ago. But this is a different movie with a beautiful plot when you think more closely about it. It's a very strong plot of love, betrayal, hate, death, etc and you see that very strongly if you listen closely to Danny Elfman's wonderful music, vocal and instrumental. Basically, go into the theaters with an open mind and enjoy and pay attention to the movie because it truly has strong, very strong, meanings. If truly watching and comprehending, at parts you cry and at others you smile. It's very clear that it is beautifully created and the actors match their parts well, but the storyline is simply beautiful. Do not think about Nightmare because that movie has been finished years ago, but enjoy Corpse Bride. I will not give anything away, so I leave my review at that. Enjoy Corpse Bride people! And for others who think I am Anti-Nightmare or something, I am seriously not. I loved and still love that movie, but just enjoy Corpse Bride without judgement until after the movie."

","This is not my favourite Tim Burton movie by a long shot, but I did find myself enjoying it. The animation is absolutely amazing with the dark bold colours and inspired visual ideas. The music is good too, it adds very well to the atmosphere. The four songs are pretty decent, if nothing special. Remains of the Day was the one I liked best. The script is witty and deliciously dark in places, while the story is clever and fairly original, even if it drags slightly occasionally. The characters are wonderfully quirky and the voice work from the likes of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter is top notch. All in all, a beautifully crafted film, if not quite Burton's finest hour. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"mentalcritic","8","4","5","20 December 2005"," Burton returns to what makes him work best...
","In a nutshell, Burton works best when he is at his mildly weirdest. For all seventy-four minutes of The Corpse Bride, we get the Tim Burton who made such gems as Ed Wood or Beetlejuice, as opposed to the Tim Burton who made such unmemorable pieces as the 2002 Planet Of The Apes or Big Fish. In essence, The Corpse Bride is Burton simply being Burton, rather than a big studio filtering Burton through their lens. It is far from perfect, but it is a charming little piece that is really on fire when it works. Much like Ed Wood, Burton brings back a core cast to provide voices for his stop-motion creatures. Some of the voices, such as Tracey Ullman or Jane Horrocks, hardly have any distinction. Others, such as Christopher Lee and Johnny Depp, remind you why Burton chose to work with them in the first place. In fact, it is Christopher Lee's voice acting that steals the show during most of this piece. When his ridiculously-shaped character is present, one almost salivates in anticipation of his next statement. For certain, this is one of Tim Burton's most satisfying creations.<br/><br/>The stop-motion animation is also brilliant, although one has to wonder if the painstaking work done to achieve it was worth the result. Sure, these puppets move so subtly that one could mistake them for real actors if not for their ridiculous body shapes. Observant viewers will note the use of stop-motion legend Ray Harryhausen's name on a piano, but I think that Harryhausen would look at this piece and wonder if maybe just a little too much effort is involved. On the other hand, compared to the so-called ultra-realistic effects of such films as the recent Star Wars episodes or Final Fantasy, perhaps the obvious fakery combined with the smooth and strangely lifelike motion has its own peculiar charm. In that sense, Burton's greatest charm, his ability to mix the absurd and unreal with a grounding in reality, is what makes The Corpse Bride work. The film is a delight to look at, one more than just one level. The attention to detail in the backgrounds of some scenes alone is breathtaking.<br/><br/>Sadly, the weakness of The Corpse Bride is in its soundtrack, and to some extent its story. I do not know whether this was partly the fault of the theatre I saw it in, which gets worse every week, but critical moments such as when we learn how the Corpse Bride became a corpse in the first place were almost indecipherable. Were it not for an exceedingly obvious plot and some pre-release hype, I would have had no idea exactly what drives the Bride to so doggedly pursue Depp's character. The Van Dorts and the Everglots are about as deep as a puddle, and Barkis Bittern only exists to give the audience something to sneer at. Fortunately, Burton is also wise enough to give this character the send-off that he anticipated the entire audience would be chanting for by the time the film finished. But aside from Victor Van Dort and the Corpse Bride, we know about as much about every single character in the story by the end of the film as we did at the beginning. It is this absence of dimensions that scuttled both Planet Of The Apes and to a large extent Sleepy Hollow.<br/><br/>However, if Tim Burton manages to control his propensity to create shallow characters, he could potentially reach even greater heights than his biopic of Ed Wood. His scene composition and design are beyond reproach. He must also be given credit for occasionally turning to the kind of subject matter that Hollywood would not normally dare touch. It is he who gave us back a Batman who gave a reason for doing what he does other than the opportunity to nance around in a funny suit, after all. Helena Bonham Carter should also be reminded that this is easily her most non-mainstream role since Fight Club, and not coincidentally, also her best. Johnny Depp proves that apart from providing a distinctive or memorable leading man (he doesn't here), he can also be depended upon to put in a solid performance. Anyone who is familiar with Burton's dramatic leanings will have no trouble guessing who Victor Van Dort is meant to be a proxy for. That Depp restrains his urge to make his presence felt in order to fit the wider dramatic picture is a true credit to him. And the animators, of course.<br/><br/>Out of ten, I gave The Corpse Bride an eight. It is not Burton's best work, nor is it the most compelling film I have ever seen. What it is, on the other hand, is a walk through the imagination of a non-standard man that manages to be entertaining and charming as it is also puzzling. And I know I will not be the only one to say that Hollywood needs to make more of those films."
"coyote-43","5","15","27","3 December 2005"," Well made, but disappointing.
","I was looking forward to this movie because I'm a huge Tim Burton fan, the concept is GREAT, and the animation looks fantastically amazing.<br/><br/>I really, really wanted to love this movie.<br/><br/>As far as the visual direction goes, I was not disappointed! The set design is beautiful, the puppets are beautiful, and the animation is incredible! The directing and editing is terrific. If I must compare this movie to Nightmare Before Christmas, I admit Corpse Bride was, at least, much more visually stunning.<br/><br/>The story, however, is a disappointment. The visual storytelling and the voice acting is good, but the actual plot and script leaves much to be desired. The first musical number was a good introduction to the setting and plot, but the others seemed like wasted opportunities to get to know the characters better. The subplot with the villain seems to just get in the way of telling an interesting story. Overall, there was a lack of motivation and character development in the main characters.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, Victor and Victoria haven't changed at all. You get the idea they're both still just following their parents wishes. The ending is confusing as Victor and Victoria haven't really gotten to know each other at all. --and you never really learn if Emily loved Victor or just the idea of getting married. I'd have liked to see the characters evolve. Especially Victor. I'd have liked to see him do something because HE decided to, not because someone else told him to or made him feel guilty.<br/><br/>As a Burton fan, it was a big relief to see that while he was the director, he was NOT the writer. Watch this movie for the visuals if you're an animation fan, but don't expect much else (besides selling a lot of toys at Hot Topic)."

","What can I say about this movie, other than that it is completely beautiful? I am truly wowed by the set, and the music was lively and fun, and overall, on the whole, the reason I go to see movies. The film is a little bit of everything- romance, tragedy, action, mystery, horror, that is why it may only seem to appeal to the ""Hot Topic"" audience, and that is not without reason. <br/><br/>This is not a little kids movie, I would say, unless your kid is about nine or ten, you should think twice about taking him or her to see this movie, you may just want to rent the classic ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and see how they fare on that. <br/><br/>However, to me, the downside was that it was slightly rushed and short, and could have used more songs. Be warned, some of you may need a tissue at the wonderfully done (but still, very sad to me) end.<br/><br/>Overall, I know when ""Corpse Bride"" comes out on DVD, I'll be one of the first to buy it."
"angelynx-2","10","5","7","25 September 2005"," the dead have much more fun!
","It's plain to see which side of the life-and-death divide Tim Burton's heart is on. The living, in Cousin Tim's universe, are stuffy, status-obsessed, grey people who frown upon music, deviations from the norm, and the frivolous notion that couples about to wed should--the very idea!--LIKE each other! Whereas downstairs in the land of the dead, skeletal barkeepers sing up a storm, there's hot jazz, dancing, bright colors, and (maybe not so surprisingly) very warm hearts. Heck, the dead even have cuter dogs (a common Burton theme and true again here). Victor, a very proper young man so non-morbid that he collects--and then releases--butterflies, accidentally finds himself married not to his living fiancée Victoria, but to the winsome and lovely Emily--whose only failing as a wife is her residence outside this mortal coil. (Tell ya the truth, though, he's not good enough for her; he's just too uptight, and the never-ending party vibe in the Ball & Socket Tavern seems to give him, well, butterflies.) How did sweet Emily end up a Corpse Bride? Will she be avenged? Can Victor and Victoria find their way back to each other and a subdued, proper, contented (but bloody boring!) life? You will have a great time finding out, cos this is a complete gem, funny, touching, dark and sweet, with the prettiest ending I've seen in years. It really did make me both laugh and cry, and I hardly ever get to say that. Tim, darlin', I forgive you for Willy Wonka; this one will go straight into Goth hearts worldwide and last for ages. (footnote: kids in the crowd we saw it with actually got up and danced in the aisles to the cookin' jazz in the closing credits! ever see THAT before? maybe the dead can even show us living stiffs how to have a good time. =)"

But the scenarios are great, the doll's expressions are lovely and the voices of Johnny Depp,Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson are cool.:D<br/><br/>There are cute messages in the movie, but I think that little kids would be kind of frightened with some scenes in it.

The voices for the characters were well chosen and the design and characteristics of the characters was very vivid and real-like. I am going back to see it this weekend, and am sure the movie will be just as enjoyable. Johnny Depp was very interesting to watch mold this character directly from just working on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and still manage to make this character just enough before falling over the edge. The music by Danny Elfman was again, like always as he tends to pair Burton often, was quite mystical and serenading."
"MovieManMenzel","9","14","26","23 September 2005"," Tim Burton has twice in one year proved to me why he is an amazing director. The Corpse Bride is a beautiful, original animated masterpiece.
","I am a huge Tim Burton fan and I have been ever since I first saw ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" in theaters back in 1993. Tim Burton's vision and his ability to create stop-motion animation films is the number one reason why I consider him as one of most unique directors in Hollywood. So after watching and enjoying ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"" earlier this year, I was wondering if ""The Corpse Bride"" would be as wonderful as Charlie was. And for the answer to that question continue reading to find out.<br/><br/>""The Corpse Bride"" is about a man named Victor (Johnny Depp) who is about to be married to Victoria (Emily Watson). As they rehearse the wedding, Victor accidentally keeps stumbling on his words and ruins the rehearsal. Victor then runs out of the room ashamed of his behavior and goes into the woods, where he is alone and he recites his vows only to set his wedding ring on the finger of the dead Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham-Carter). By placing his ring on the corpse bride's finger, she wakes from the dead and takes Victor as her husband. But Victor is supposed to marry Victoria and now has a serious problem on his hands as Victor now is committed to two women!<br/><br/>For those who are fans of the 1993 film ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" should run out right away to the theater to see ""The Corpse Bride."" The animation in this film is beautiful and as an active movie-goer I have not seen a movie display this type of animation since ""The Nightmare Before Christmas!"" I know why too because this animation takes a lot of time and energy and no one other than Tim Burton seems to be that dedicated enough to their work to make a film quite like ""The Corpse Bride."" As far as the animation goes this movie BETTER win Best Animated Feature this year at the Oscars! 12 years ago ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" was robbed of this honor and Tim Burton without a doubt deserves an award for his ability to create a stop-motion animation movie and for all of the time he put into it.<br/><br/>Now while the animation is just as brilliant as ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the movie's two main characters are extremely enjoyable, this movie does not beat out ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" as my favorite Tim Burton film. Why is this? Well for a few reasons, while I liked the music in this movie, the soundtrack for Nightmare was better, as well as the characters and to be honest Nightmare's story was a bit superior to that of ""The Corpse Bride."" While I didn't fall in love right away with ""The Corpse Bride"" as much as I did with ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" the first time I seen it, this doesn't mean that I didn't love the film because I did. I think when I watch this film again, probably sometime this weekend; I will probably love it more. I went into ""The Corpse Bride"" expecting the best film ever created! Why? Because ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is my favorite film of all time and I guess I was expecting that all over again! But ""The Corpse Bride"" is a lot different then Nightmare! <br/><br/>""The Corpse Bride"" is one of those films that as it continues on, it only gets better. The ending at least for me was a bit surprising and I really didn't see it coming. Tim Burton's style and vision for this film really makes the movie worth while. No other director pays as close attention to detail as Burton does which is why I say he's my favorite director. His imagination runs wild in all his films and this movie is no different. When you watch ""The Corpse Bride"" you realize what a truly original film this really is and how much time and effort when into making the film. While ""The Corpse Bride"" is not ""The Nightmare Before Christmas 2"" it's still a one of a kind masterpiece, that will be a cult favorite for many years to come! <br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""the Corpse Bride"" is a 9/10. Give Mr. Burton the Oscar for Best Animated Film because no one deserves it more!"

","Stop-motion animation is a rarely used medium these days, but one has to admit -- when it's done, it's usually done very well. 'Corpse Bride' is a great example of this; every visual in the movie exhibits beautiful style and craftsmanship. It's a shame they had to waste all this eye candy on a script which is so thin and lifeless (like a corpse bride, har har). The premise is interesting, at least -- a nebbish groom winds up accidentally ""marrying"" a zombie -- but all of the interesting possibilities of the premise are ignored, as the plot mostly adheres to overdone kid's movie conventions. There's a bad guy, and cutesy little supporting characters, and parents that just don't get it, and everything else you expect to find (and are disappointed to find) in this type of film. Mostly these conventions just distract from the love triangle that is central to the movie, and which is never developed as fully as it should have been.<br/><br/>'Corpse Bride' is also a musical, but you'll wish it wasn't. Generally musicals feature a wide range of emotions in their songs, and since this is a bittersweet love story, you would expect that to be the case here. Not so! It seems that few of the characters are able to lift themselves out of their self-pitying depression for even a few bars of any song. It's probably the worst score I've ever heard for Danny Elfman; just one drab, interminable tune after another.<br/><br/>I'll probably watch this movie again, simply because the animation was that good. Next time, however, I'm muting the sound and turning some other music on."

"retroanglophile","9","7","11","25 September 2005"," Brilliant, Just what we needed to liven up this poor cinema year!
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is almost nothing short of what I hoped for. The animation is top-notch, right down to boob jiggles and puddle reflections, and each character's voice is matched perfectly to go with who they are. The art, to die for (no pun intended) but I found it quite the opposite of Nightmare. Nightmare is filled with curly-Q's, while Corpse Bride is almost straight. Which I am pleased with to a degree, because people usually think Burton works in the same style time after time. Also, I love how they made the ""land of the living"" very dull and straight-laced, with tones of brown and grey, while the ""land of the dead"" is filled with bright colours and welcoming in every area. Though, I never quite thought of it looking like a market place in Cairo. The story, charming. Very charming. Plus, it had an unexpected lesson to be learned; don't take what isn't yours. Oh, and don't marry for money.<br/><br/>This being Mr. Depp's first voice role, I found him perfect in every way, plus I found moments where I forget it was him doing the voicing and simply thought it was Victor up on that screen. <br/><br/>Now, the music. First off...BIG. DANNY. ELFMAN. FANGIRL. There were only four musical numbers (while Nightmare had 14, I believe) and shockingly enough, I was pleased to the limited number. Now, I'm going to find every possible excuse for what I am about to say not to be true...but most of the songs were quite busy, packed, and difficult to understand. Now, this could have been due to the sound system of the theatre in which I was at, (I went to one built in the late 20s) or maybe I'm not as plugged in at one in the morning when it comes to sound or maybe it was just because it was my first time. Just something, ANYTHING, besides the fact Danny let me down in the song department...BUT! He made up for it in the score department!!! While I still find Sleepy Hollow to be his best score, Corpse Bride is a close second. Each piece matches perfectly with what is going on in the scene, though the score is over ridden a lot during the film, by the dialogue and the other action going on screen, and in order for it to heard appropriately one must simply listen to the score alone. <br/><br/>All in all, lovely film. A wonderful breath of fresh air for both adults, and kiddies alike. And who was it that said the Oscar for best Animated Film goes right here? Well, who ever it was...they are right!<br/><br/>*SPOLIER*<br/><br/>I am normally one who cheers for the ""underdog"", I was quite so when it came to The Phantom of the Opera, but Corpse Bride is different in every way, and it should be perfectly clear why Victor can not go with Emily! Besides it being so obvious with their names...hello...Victor...Victoria. But Emily and Victor never really click save for the piano duet they do, but still, that isn't enough, and I don't understand how one could see Victor staying down there while his one true love is above with a broken heart. In addition, by the end of the film, Emily is perfectly fine with giving Victor back because she understands she has ""stolen dreams from someone else""."
"Animated_Antic","9","2","2","9 October 2017"," A sweet and emotional film.
","""Corpse Bride"" is probably one of Tim Burton's most unique films. Not just because the film itself has a very unique story, animation and characters, but because it is the first full length animated film Tim Burton actually directed (he only produced ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach""), the first film he received an Oscar nomination for, and the only one of his stop motion movies not to be released by Disney, but instead was released Warner Brothers. The film was also produced by Laika Entertainment, who later went on to do other stop motion movies like ""Coraline"", ""Paranorman"" and ""Kubo and the Two Strings"". With both the creative forces from Burton and Laika, it leads us to a film with a very original and emotional story, some colorful animation, and some pretty likable characters.<br/><br/>In a Victorian city, the son of rich fish merchants named Victor (Johnny Depp) and the daughter of snobby poor aristocrats named Victoria (Emily Watson) have been arranged to be married by their parents in hopes that the wealth of merchants can restore the wealth of the aristocrats. However, Victor is unable to remember his wedding vows and tries practicing them in the woods nearby, unaware that the tree root he places his wedding ring on is rather the finger of the Corpse Bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) whom he by accident engages to. He is then transported into the Land of the Dead where he is told about Emily's tragic backstory which I shall not spoil and it's up to him to return to the world of the living and set things right.<br/><br/>It was very obvious that Burton (along with Depp) were clearly putting their passion and energy into this film rather than the disastrous remake of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" which came out the same year. The film has a very creative story that feels like a fairy tale being retold despite the film rather being original. I also am astonished that a film with a story as crazy as this was able to work well in the first place. The animation is also great. It certainly looks different from Burton's previous films and I like it because it's able to establish itself as its own product rather than riding the reigns of the previous movies. The idea of making the Victorian city more downbeat, grey and dull while making the world of the dead bright, colorful and upbeat is especially clever. I also found myself getting really emotionally connected to the characters. The relationship that Victor has between both Emily and Victoria are well established and pretty believable. The characters of the dead are also a lot of fun. I really enjoyed how they looked and some of the gags that they came up with like the skeletons taking of their heads and putting them on the skeleton right next to them. As far as problems go, the villain is a little bland. While his connection he has to the plot is really well written, his personality was very boring and he really didn't stand out compared to Oogie Boogie from ""Nightmare"" and Aunt Sponge and Spiker from ""James and the Giant Peach"". I also thought Danny Elfman's songs, while well written and fun, were a little forgettable. It's a shame too as the songs from ""Nightmare"" were my favorite part. However, I do think that ""Remains of the Day"" was probably the song I remember the most due to how colorful and upbeat it was.<br/><br/>""Corpse Bride"" may not be on par with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", but as a film in general, the creative original story, the colorful animation, and some pretty likable characters. It could have been as good as ""Nightmare"" had it had a few more fixes, but I thought it was pretty impressive for what they delivered."

","Contain spoiler.....<br/><br/>I've just seen the movie last night and had to register here to leave a review for this movie. The movie was very well done. The voice acting and the singing were appropriate and fun. I will abbreviate my review by not repeating what others have already complimented.<br/><br/>I would love to see an ending that takes a different twist. It's very typical and predictable for a handsome prince to end up with a beautiful princess. A typical audience would think that Victor would end up with the living and beautiful Victoria in the end, which is exactly what happened. I saw this movie and was so disappointed that he did not end up with the corpse bride or Emily (I felt so sorry for her character - she was cheated out of her life and had nothing in return). The movie would have more emotional meaning in the end if Victor fell in love with Emily through a progression of character development, after all she shared his passion for piano and may be other things. Instead, he ended up with Victoria, who was just a pretty face. What I'm saying is that the movie could end up like the Shrek where the princess turns ugly to be with her love, rather than beauty and the beast where the prince turns handsome to be with his love. Sacrifice always represent loves more than reward."

"poolandrews","8","2","2","24 April 2010"," Wonderful dark stop-motion animated fairy tale.
","Corpse Bride is set in a 19th Century European village where Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) the son of local fishmongers is to be married off to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) the daughter of the penniless Maudeline (Joanna Lumley) & Finis (Albert Finney), as an arranged marriage for the benefit of the parents neither Victor or Victoria have even met each other before but when they do they fall in love for real. During a wedding rehearsal Victor keeps messing his lines up & takes a walk in nearby woods to practice his lines when he accidentally marries himself to the corpse of Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) who comes to life & insists that she & Victor are now married & takes him to the underworld where the dead hang out. Victor wants to get back to the land of the living & marry Victoria but his new Corpse Bride won't let him get away so easily...<br/><br/>This American British co-production was directed by Tim Burton & Mike Johnson & is a simply wonderful fantasy with gorgeous visuals & beautiful stop-motion animation, having brought it on Blu-Ray & watched it yesterday Corpse Bride is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Corpse Bride is an enchanting dark fairy tale about a twisted love triangle as Victor has two women fighting over him, one dead & one alive. It's amazing how much the character's come across, how much personality & how charming they are. Corpse Bride is also surprisingly moving with a rather bitter sweet ending that is genuinely sad & emotional. At only 77 minutes the pace is great, the film is full of memorable moments like the funny part when the skeleton's jaw drops off at the end or the touching scene between Victoria & Victor together playing a piano, there's three fun song & dance numbers although the majority of the film is spoken dialogue. With a simple yet clear & engaging plot full of great moments Corpse Bride is a unique work of art as well as a fantastic film that I thought was excellent in every way & can't recommend it enough.<br/><br/>Obviously a labour of love for many Corpse Bride looks fabulous, with it's beautifully designed sets & puppets this is a visual treat. The character's are all thin Insect stick like or fat, squat & barrel shaped & the whole film is simply gorgeous to look at. The sets are great too, from the dull & grey land of the living to the colourful land of the dead which is much more vibrant as the dead no longer have to conform to the rigid constraints of the living. The detail is also amazing with the smallest thing given utmost attention, Corpse Bride is the sort of film you watch several times & notice new things each time. The Blu-Ray I brought has several brief featurettes which are not in depth enough with none of them lasting more than nine minutes but you do get the idea behind the amount of effort that was put into Corpse Bride, from the sets to the puppets themselves which have clockwork gears inside them to control facial features & stance. Apparently Corpse Bride was shot with a digital still camera rather than a proper film camera & the individual frames were edited together. With a 55 week shooting schedule just to film the animation & not including pre or post production Corpse Bride was over a year in the making & it show's.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 a lot of time, effort & money was spent on Corpse Bride & the finished product was worth it, I also recently saw another similar film Coraline (2009) which is also beautifully animated & it's shame both films underperformed at the box-office. There's some great voice actors here, Depp, Watson, Carter, Christopher Lee, Richard E. Grant & Michael Gough all have parts.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride is a fantastic film that I loved & has now become a personal favourite of mine, from the beautiful animation & character's to the enchanting story of twisted love, I liked it & can't think of anything negative to say about it."
"Stampsfightclub","9","2","2","13 February 2007"," fantastic breath taking
","The team of Tim Burton and Jonny Depp (Edward Scissorhands) return for this sophisticated, humorous brilliantly directed fantasy animation in which a remarkably look a like animation of Depp is juxtaposed with Emily Watson's posh character to create a charming marriage focused story in which there are proposes, engagements and remarkable weddings to look out for.<br/><br/>The reason I loved this film was the slowness and gentleness of the plot. When the groom wrongfully proposes to the corpse in the forest many audiences would believe it to be ridiculous and coincidental in the way it came across. However I believed it conformed to the fantasy genre beautifully and with Burton's known dark mind for the genre it is really effective and will defiantly engage you into the plot as the stakes are raised for Depp's character as he wonders what is happening to him.<br/><br/>The two worlds are amazing. The land of the living and the land of the dead are amazingly portrayed, especially the dead as it shines with life and light, strange but a different concept to the ideology of the dead. The skeletons, zombies, corpses etc are fantastic, gruesome and funny (watch out for the singing skeleton whom I simply loved!) the living world also appears more dark and gloomy than the death world which is an interesting technique used by Burton and one which is an essential make to this film.<br/><br/>In comparison to the nightmare before Christmas the animation is fantastic. The detail to the gruesomeness of the two worlds is amazing and breathtaking. The creep characters to are also splendid and confirm to audience's expectations. Unfortunately the songs don't quite match those in Nightmare but are still humorous and do tell the story well.<br/><br/>The film is always consistent in grabbing the audience attention, the odd joke is really funny (with usually play on words and puns of the genre) the characters are interesting to observe and help make the story what it is and the animation is breathtaking, one of my all time favourite animations, after only one viewing.<br/><br/>watch it now!!!"
"eched","8","2","2","3 March 2006"," A bit of a let down, but still rather fun
","I had been looking forward to this film for a straight year. It was good, and very well done, so I must give it high marks, but to be honest it let me down a bit. The biggest flaw, and it really hurts the film, is the musical numbers. They sound horrid, but what's really bad is that they are painfully point form, as if they are only their to tell the story, instead of enhancing it. It's like their more like plot explanations instead of songs, and the fact that the song will stop half way threw, have someone talk normally for five minutes, and then suddenly start up again doesn't help much.<br/><br/>What is good though is the look of the film. It looks great, fantastic really. The characters are also rather enchanting, and though the sense of humor is very lacking, when it does pop up it helps the film a lot.<br/><br/>The best scene was the piano scene between Emily and Victor. Now that was just plain sweet. If the film had more of that and less of well, kids stuff with the songs, then this movie would be really up their and the end would of had a lot more impact.<br/><br/>As is it really just shows off old Tim having a great old time, which makes the film pretty enjoyable, but still flawed."

","What a summer for Tim! First Charlie, and now Corpse Bride! I got to see the showing yesterday at the Toronto Film Festival, and I loved every second of it! The worlds Burton has created are once again visually distinct and complete. The ""Land of the Living"" is familiar, the art design is classic Burton, with harsh lines, and almost no colour. The ""Land of the Dead"", however, is Halloween Town on acid. The neon colours, catchy music, and unforgettable characters evoke memories of Burton's earliest films like Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice. The stop motion animation builds on the achievements of Nightmare, and at some points you have to remind yourself that you're watching an animated film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with one aspect of the film. I feel that there weren't enough songs. The ones in the film were so fantastic, you will wish there were more. And the puppets preform them with the flare and spectacle they deserve. Danny Elfman's character Bonejangles is definitely a highlight. Overall, the film was amazing. Some people may say Nightmare is better, but they aren't being truthful. I will always have a special place in my heart for nightmare, but Corpse Bride does everything I loved about Nightmare, but adds real emotional depth and new characters to love. In conclusion, Burton most definitely rose to the occasion"

"The_Void","7","5","8","21 November 2005"," Dazzling Gothic animation!
","After the huge, and endearing, success of Nightmare Before Christmas - director Tim Burton has returned to Gothic animation, this time as director, with the superbly macabre 'Corpse Bride'! Personally, I prefer live action films; but when animation looks this good, I can hardly complain. Corpse Bride is rich with skeletons, spiders, maggots and a lush dark atmosphere - making this the most horrific 'kids' animated film I've ever seen. Many of the sequences really are quite macabre, which was surprising considering most kids films tend to have a 'nice' slant. One criticism I do have for Corpse Bride is that it's theme is wasted a little. The ideas behind the central plot are too complex, and the film never really explores any of them in great detail. Don't get me wrong, I like this film; but I also feel that a really, really great live action film could be made from a similar plot. Anyway, the basics of the story are that a young man forced into an arranged marriage accidentally finds himself married to a corpse after putting the wedding ring on her finger while rehearsing his vows. Oops! <br/><br/>The style of the film is absolutely wonderful. The lushly Gothic visuals are married to a distinctly dark picture, and this results in a great base for the macabre plot line. Many of the scenes look absolutely amazing - the title character's introduction scene being the best of them! Burton has gathered up an array of talent for the making of this film, including Johnny Depp, Emily Watson and Helena Bonham Carter in the leads; and horror icons Christopher Lee and Michael Gough delivering great supporting performances. Danny Elfman has created another great score, and while I don't usually say that I'm a fan of musical numbers in films like this; most of the songs here are actually quite entertaining. The character development is surprisingly good too, with the final outcomes of the leads being believable in spite of the fact that they're just lumps of clay. On the whole, while this film lacks the depth that the themes behind the story deserves; the animation is top quality, the film is lots of fun and there's enough dazzling sequences to ensure that any horror fan will enjoy this movie. Look out for the Peter Lorre-soundalike in the role of the maggot that lives behind the Corpse Bride's eye!"
"damianj","10","5","8","17 October 2005"," Macabre magic
","Tim Burton, the master of spooky, kooky and cute has delivered another classic that makes magic out of the macabre. If the whimsical story, derived from a Russian folk tale, doesn't charm the pants of you, the stunning puppets, sets and stop-animation imagery surely will. The vivid worlds, both above and below ground, that Burton has handcrafted are simply enchanting, and his second foray into stop-animation (the first was The Nightmare Before Christmas) further stamps his name as a leading artist in this medium. Corpse Bride follows the unexpected journey of groom-to-be Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp), who is spirited away to the underworld on the eve of his wedding when he unintentionally betroths himself to a dead bride. Ever since she was mysteriously murdered on her wedding night, the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) has waited, heartbroken, for her groom to come and claim her. Victor unwittingly becomes that man while practising his wedding vows in the forest and is dragged down to the land of the dead. He tries in vain to find his way back to Victoria, but his late bride is determined to make him honour the bond of their unholy matrimony, and isn't going to make it easy. The film is peppered with cute one-liners (""People are dying to get in"", one of the dearly departed says to another at one point) and sight gags (""Is it my eye?,"" the heartbroken bride asks her bewildered husband as it is popped out by a roguish maggot), and the subtle touches of adult humour are brilliant. Burton has managed to make the most unlikely, adorable  even the aforementioned eye-popping maggot, and given the afterlife an entirely new image  in Burton's land of the dead, the pubs never close and the corpses are more lively than anything you see up in the world above. Spectacular song and dance numbers complete this deliciously dark treat that will delight film goers of all ages. Take my word, you will be dying to see this one again!"
"sain2002","10","5","8","13 October 2005"," I loved it! Funny, innovative, and highly entertaining!
","Tim Burton's videos are dark, to be sure, but they do a wonderful job of mixing lighthearted humor with macabre subjects like death and decomposition! The dead people in this movie seemed so much more likable than the living, and I couldn't help thinking that Emily (the Corpse Bride herself) was far prettier and full of life than (""little Miss Living"") Victoria! As in Burton's other foray into this genre (The Nightmare Before Halloween) the special effects were both artistic as well as sinister-yet-amusing, with real personalities emerging from the excellent casting of the voices. I also thought some moments in the film were genuinely frightening, especially early on when Victor is fleeing his corpse wife, taking refuge in his fiancée's room where he then discovers to his horror that his corpse bride has followed him and has climbed the balcony and is about to enter the room! That was a brilliantly shot scary scene that reminded me of something out of Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher!"" I also loved the way they resolved Victor's dilemma at the very end when you don't know if he'll end up with a dead or a living wife. Bottom line - I really loved this film!"

","Corpse Bride is one of the best movies this year, animated or not. I'd say the best recent movie is Hotel Rwanda and the best over all is Schindler's List but Corpse Bride is in my top 10 for 2005. Corpse bride is about a man (Victor/ Johney Depp) who is about to be married even though he has never met his wife. After a clumsy meeting they have the wedding rehearsal in an old cathedral on the edge of town. Victor can not remember his vows so he runs off in to the forest to practice. He goes though the whole sacrament and then places the ring on what he takes to be a stick but what is really the finger of the Corpse Bride. Now he is her legal husband and is swept off to the underworld. The best scene in the movie takes place right after they get transported to the underworld. They are in some pub and a skeleton jazz band play's a song about how the corpse bride became the corpse bride. It's called ""The Remain's of the Day"" that song has been stuck in my head since i saw the movie on the first day it came out. Go see this movie you won't regret it!!!"
"bluedragonfood","9","3","4","18 February 2006"," Astonishing
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is, as many reviews have already said, an instant classic. Following in the hauntingly charming tradition of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Corpse Bride"" is even more endearing than it's wondrously animated predecessor.<br/><br/>To be quite frank, I had no idea what i was getting into when I saw this movie for the first time. My friends had kept telling me that it had been animated on computers, but I was pleasantly surprised that the most advanced Tim Burton got was fancy little mechanics inside the puppets. And Warner Bros. did a good job of covering up the fact that film is an astounding musical. When the movie opened with ""According to Plan,"" I almost jumped out of my seat with glee. Danny Elfman, being among my favorite composers, has pulled a golden rabbit out of the hat once more, and done what only he can: Create haunting harmonies that give you shivers and warm you at the same time.<br/><br/>The voice acting is also incredible, as is to be expected from Burton. Johnny Depp's sad, yet charming voice completes Victor's sad but charming look. Helena Bohnam Carter perfectly captures Emily's (the corpse bride's) elegance and clumsiness. And Emily Watson perfectly matches Victoria's grace and beauty.<br/><br/>But it is mostly the beautiful story that Burton tells that draws you to this impeccable work of art. When Victor meets Victoria (theatre fans out there: Victor Victoria? eh?) you immediately know you want them to be together. So when Voctor unwittingly marries Emily, you feel his fright and urgency to return home. you want him to go back to Victoria. But as Victor (and you) spends more time with Emily, we all begin to realize that she's actually a great gal. So, when Victor offers to kill himself, it starts not to sound like such a bad idea, especially since Victoria has been seemingly lost to that Barkis creep. But in the end, Emily makes an even bigger sacrifice than Victor would have by giving up her love and her dreams so she can pass them to another. And that is more fulfilling than anything I was hoping for.<br/><br/>Tim Burton also throws in a few curve balls that really catch you off-guard in the best of ways. The only really good example is when the dead walk the town. Instead of terrorizing the townsfolk, the dead are re-united with their loved ones that they have so long missed. It's touching and hilarious at the same time."
"MrVibrating","7","3","4","17 February 2006"," Burton does it again
","We all know Burton love the Gothic, the dark and the comically twisted. He uses it in all his films, in one way or another. But he is also very diverse. Movies like ""Ed Wood"", ""Mars Attacks!"" and ""Big Fish"" are proof he can do other styles as well. But in this movie, Burton does what everybody expects him to do, and boy does he do it good.<br/><br/>The art style of this movie is perfect, flawless and as Burtonesque as anything can be. The use of stop-motion puppets instead of the more and more tiring CGI gives the movie a realistic feeling and makes it feel more artsy.<br/><br/>The story might be the movies weak link but I never thought about it during the movie. Besides, it's an old folk tale, so it's bound to be pretty basic.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman. That makes a few roll their eyes but Burton and Eflman is a good team, actually. The songs in this movie were not as good a those in ""Nightmare before Christmas"" but the suited the movie fine and they were never annoying.<br/><br/>The voice work is fine, Christopher Lee is great, and the characters are really characteristic and alive, ironically enough. Johnny Depp might be a little wasted since his character is pretty unremarkable, but his involvement has to do with his friendship of Burton and not as a poster name.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to those who liked Tim Burton's earlier movies. You might not be surprised or totally blown away, but masterful handiwork like this is to be encouraged in these times of repetitive CGI children's movies. If you do not like Burton's very special style, then this movie is not for you, but for us who like a little originality in our lives, this is just right."

","By Keki Tognetti and Manny Castro<br/><br/>Tim Burton fans watch out! His new film 'The Corpse Bride' came out in theaters on Sept. 23rd, and it is fantastic. Burton comes through again for all of his fans, delivering a comical, heart wrenching, and an emotional roller coaster that you will want to ride again and again.<br/><br/>For those new to Burton's whimsical style, the film is very appealing and enjoyable for everyone in the family, though not highly recommended for those whose preference in movies doesn't involve characters singing rimes. The story takes place in a small town during what might seem to be late-19th century Eastern Europe, where everything and everyone is as boring and life-less as a stone grave. <br/><br/>The main character Victor, voiced by the talented Johnny Depp, is troubled, extremely nervous and uncertain about his upcoming marriage to Victoria played by Emily Watson. <br/><br/>Romance seemed to spark between the soon to be married couple, but just when all seemed well poor Victor takes a turn for the worse and forgets his vows, bringing shame, and dishonor to his family. <br/><br/>In panic Victor flees the wedding rehearsal and accidentally marries The Corpse Bride. He then finds himself being taken to the world of the dead by Emily, played by Helena Bonham Carter who is now his new lovely wife.<br/><br/>There she shows him a world he's never seen. While the life of the living is dull, monochromatic, and vivid less the world of the dead is boiling with song, color, and excitement. <br/><br/>Tim Burton's crusade to rescue the dying art form of stop-motion animation is seen in other Burton stop-motion projects (Vincent (1982), The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), and the 1996 release of James and the Giant Peach) Corpse Bride is a celebration of its art form. Anyone familiar with Burton's career knows that he is a true artist and each film is a reflection of his life. The film is very beautiful. <br/><br/>You can either take your children, spouse or a date. The film is very romantic yet very energetic and full of comedy and eye-popping scenes. It has something for everyone. I know the question on everyone's mind, is it better than Nightmare? The answer is no, but so what? It is a great film accompanied by amazing visuals and cool music by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>This film is one of his best works yet, though its a tearjerker at the end, it leaves you wanting more once you reach it. The movie runs for 77 minutes, no fans will be disappointed on the film itself; it is gorgeous. The only real disappointment is how short the film runs, but what more can you expect from stop-motion? It's simply a must see."
"Jacques98","6","4","6","29 October 2008"," Can't there ever be a animated movie that sustains a darkly beautiful tone?
","I'm not a huge Tim Burton fanSweeny Todd was decent, but that's all I can really give himand I've never seen The Nightmare Before Christmas, so I can't compare this to it. If you're looking for an unbiased review, this is one of the few you'll get.<br/><br/>First of all, for an animated movie, this is one of the better ones I've seen. The themes running though are not overdone clichésunlike, say, Wall-Eand it was very nice to see women in an animated film fighting for the man, and not clichéd vice versa. The plot line itself is something similar to what you'd read in a kid's horror anthology, but it totally worked for this film's style. More importantly, the plot isn't something you've heard a thousand times, and I couldn't pick out any glaring clichés. In a way, The Corpse Bride is more mature of an effort story-wise than some of Burton's live-action, R-rated films because it has more imagination.<br/><br/>The signature Gothic style is done very well, and the animation is stellar to look at. I found the use of black-and-white in the real-world sequences a bit annoying and overdone, but to each his own. For someone who isn't a hardcore Burton fan, I can't say I really even noticed the music. Every now and then I thought it was pretty, but I doubt if you're not paying a lot of attention you'll even notice what everyone else is deeming as ""beautiful and a masterpiece"".<br/><br/>The main problems The Corpse Bride had: - Most of the characters were forgettable. They play out flat, as if the plot is just using them as pawns. I wouldn't mind this if the plot was AWESOME, but it just simply isn't, and the lack of emotional attachment to the characters really gets in the way of the overall effect.<br/><br/><ul><li>No immersion. I understand this is a children's movie, and being an adult may have something to do with it, but as hard as I tried to love The Corpse Bride there was just something dull about it that I can't put my finger on. The world Burton creates is a near-perfect mix of childish macabre fantasy, and it is beautiful, but there is something missing. I assume that would be a darker plot line. The constant use of puns, also, takes away from the seriousness and beauty of the whole thing. Can't there ever be a animated, PG-rated movie that creates and sustains a darkly beautiful tone? Overall: Be sure to watch it on TV when the countless cartoon networks are playing it for Halloween. It is worth your time. It's just not the masterpiece I was hoping it would be.</li></ul><br/><br/>6/10"

","I'm no dyed-in-the-wool Tim Burton or Johnny Depp fan -- while both men have done work that I've loved, they have also given their names to projects which have ranged from 'disappointed' to 'hated it'. So I approached this film with curiosity but caution.<br/><br/>I needn't have worried.<br/><br/>In most films, it's clear within the first five minutes whether they're going to come to life or, all too often, remain a parade of cardboard characters reciting from a would-be meaningful script -- there are a handful of pictures that overcome a wooden start to blossom into glorious life, but precious few. With its opening butterfly motif, for a few moments this one could have swung either way. But when I saw the clockmaker sweeping to the strict ticks of his pendulums, I was intrigued; when I saw the fishmongers with their automatic routine, I was amused; and the instant the first song started, I was swept away.<br/><br/>This is a *clever* film. It's a witty film and intelligent, packed with allusion and in-jokes that will skate straight over the youngsters' heads, from Ray Harryhausen to Louis Armstrong and Clark Gable. Its depth and life come from the detail that makes it work on so many levels, humour and pathos both verbal and visual -- not to mention musical. (It is music, after all, that forges a link for Victor with both the women in his life.)<br/><br/>The opening scenes are a comedy of manners and class straight out of Jane Austin, as the two equally ghastly sets of parents duet in their respective snobberies: Hollywood has never hit the social-climbing target with such cringe-making hilarious results. How can the shy young couple help but bond? And when Victor wakes up in the underworld married to a gushing and trilling corpse convinced he is her destiny, who can blame him for his desperation to get away from her and back home by fair means or foul?<br/><br/>But the secret of this film is that it isn't the horror movie that could have been made out of the same material: the grotesquerie anchors the sweetness but does not lessen or deride it. If anything, it is essentially the story of a love triangle as Victor, pledged unwillingly to two women, comes to love them both. (One telling little instant comes during the wedding rehearsal, as Victoria unobtrusively comes to the rescue by relighting her fiancé's candle.)<br/><br/>The voice acting is a treat. Johnny Depp pulls off his usual chameleon act to the extent that you completely forget he's there, aware only of the character: there's no trace here of Ed Wood, Donnie Brasco or Captain Jack Sparrow. Helena Bonham-Carter has perhaps the most taxing role of all as the Corpse Bride herself, whether guilelessly girlish, heart-broken or icy in revenge, and Emily Watson brings a vivid sympathy to the part of mousy little Victoria with her surprising hint of steel. But the honours are carried off by the minor characters, from the skeletal jazz-soaked crooner to the plump zombie cook and gallant Hussar, eyeglass firmly in place despite the hole through his middle -- a galaxy of caricatures and jests poked at all classes and conditions, from the underbred Van Dorts to the overripely patrician Lord and Lady Everglot, their stooped Scottish nanny and supercilious butler.<br/><br/>In an era of two-and-a-half-hour epics, it's joy to find a film as tightly written and constructed as an old-style feature... and the animation is like nothing you've ever seen before. It's hard not to make comparisons with this year's ""Wallace and Gromit"", also an unorthodox animated film crammed with adult movie references and jokes. But the Aardman production ultimately remains a spoof, consciously subverting any serious moment for laughs.<br/><br/>""The Corpse Bride"", despite its pantomime trappings, takes that step further into self-belief and dares to aspire to genuine art. It carries it off with glorious success. ""Wallace and Gromit"" made me laugh; ""The Corpse Bride"" made me caper joyfully down the road in excitement. But then I'm funny that way :-)<br/><br/>The film is not, of course, entirely without flaw. Perhaps the most glaring, as other have pointed out, is that Lord Barkiss's identity is obvious from the moment, early on, that he mentions his tragically deceased fiancée -- fine, if the plot hadn't postponed that grand revelation until the final chapter! We know why Victoria's parents believe him to be a wealthy catch, but are left at a loss as to why he seems to be ignorant of her poverty.<br/><br/>Victoria's escape serves no plot purpose at all and carries no consequences: subsequent events would have transpired just the same had she spent the whole time locked in her room. The unintended result is that this came across as condescending filler, a ham-handed attempt to give her equal screen time. I assume that the lack of significance is an oversight and not an actual last-minute addition...<br/><br/>And the talking maggot, which might have been a successful one-off joke, verges close to irritating-cartoon-sidekick territory. Perhaps this is one element that will appeal more to children than their elders. (I must confess that the apparent Peter Lorre impression, offensive or not, had passed me entirely by.)<br/><br/>These elements aside, the more you bring to this film the more you will take back. Within the first ten minutes I was reminded of half a dozen other great films -- and all in a good way! Tim Burton's had some showy flops, but this one is the genuine article, a classic in the making.<br/><br/>I give it nine out of ten. But ask me again in thirty years' time, and maybe I'll give it a 10 :-)"
"incendiary_wit","10","4","6","24 September 2005"," A Romantic Masterpiece
","I had gone in to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride with high expectations. His previous Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) was a great film, and added that I had read a countless amount of reviews from both critics and moviegoers alike, saying only wonderful things about this movie. Also, I am a huge Burton fan, and have learned to expect the unexpected when it comes to his work. He's never let me down before, so I had no reason to doubt The Bride.<br/><br/>And I must say, Tim's done it again.<br/><br/>The Corpse Bride weaves the tale of Victor Van Dort and his interesting journey through two worlds. As the story opens, we meet fortune-less Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort, who wish to marry their son off to the daughter of aristocrats Lord and Lady Everglot in order to pump up their social status. The Everglots, as we learn later, are not wealthy at all, in fact. Because of this, they are slightly perturbed that their daughter Victoria is going to be wed to a family of such low rank on the social ladder. The nervous Victor had elongated the wedding rehearsal for three hours on account of not remembering the vows. In a comic scene, we see him trying to do everything right, but either his candle doesn't light, he knocks into the table, or he completely forgets what to say. Everyone becomes obviously frustrated, and flustered Victor leaves. He walks through the woods for an apparently long while, desperately trying to get his lines right. Finally, he recites them correctly, and places the ring on a supposed tree root. His moment of contentment is short-lived, as the tree root grabs him and the figure of a woman in wedding garb rises out the ground. He has, in fact, accidentally wed himself to the Corpse Bride. Victor, in fear, flees out of the woods, but to no avail. The mysterious corpse catches him, and brings him to the underworld, which is depicted as a snazzy, funky-colored, lively and entertaining place, much unlike the ""upstairs"", which is gray, bleak, bland, and boring- much like the people in it. Once in the land of the dead, we are entertained by a jazz number telling the story of the Bride, that leaves Victor quite confused, or slightly amused...it's hard to tell. The story continues on, with Victor's desperate attempt to see Victoria and escape this obsessive corpse. Eventually, though, a decision has to be made: Will Victor remain in the wondrously upbeat land of the dead, with this charming and beautiful, yet strange and mysterious, corpse bride...or will he return home to the one shaded land of the living, to be with the sweet Victoria, whom he has come to love?<br/><br/>The Bride is a beautiful movie that grabs the audience and pulls them in, and doesn't let go until the very end. The animation is pure magic, stunning in every way. The stop-motion technique, especially in this movie, made it all the more a visual delight. At some point, you seem to forget that these are just foot-tall silicone encased puppets being moved by people. It feels like you're right there, in the movie. How many other animated movies can do that? Not many.<br/><br/>It's all thanks to Tim's unique vision, and the way he sees things. The look and feel of this movie is classic Tim Burton, with an unusually romantic twist. But the breath-taking visuals is just one part of what makes this movie so grand. It's funny, charming, sweet, and heart-wrenching. A top-notch cast gives a superb performance, one that leaves you feeling the emotions. The story itself, (although including dead and decaying corpses acting very much alive and functioning), just seems so real. It is wonderfully romantic. The leading characters have such human-like qualities and flaws, which you don't normally see in other animated movies. The story is unique and beautiful, and very believable.<br/><br/>At a short and sweet seventy-six minutes, The Bride delivers all that's expected, and even more. This movie is definitely up there with Tim's greats, and is sure to entertain audiences for years to come."
"Quinoa1984","8","6","11","2 October 2005"," Filled with the trademark visual plethora to expect from Burton, with the laughs, very good movie
","Although I might not say Corpse Bride is a great film on the level of Nightmare Before Christmas (there are some things involved with the characters of Corpse Bride that aren't as realized as in Nightmare, and the songs aren't as instantly classic, arguable I'm sure), I would not tell you not see this film if you are the least bit a fan of Tim Burton's work or of his previous stop-motion film. This time the story brings a torn to-be married gent named Victor (Johnny Depp voices, thankfully not too recognizable) who is in that uncomfortable point as in other movies where he can't take having to marry someone he barely knows, Victoria (Emily Watson), and her money-hungry parents. So, as a lark, he places his engagement ring on a tree, and within a minute he's taken down unwittingly to the land of the dead- as the corpse bride's husband. Things get complicated then within this sort of quasi love triangle, where the terrific horror clichés (and others) of old lay the framework for a really sweet, neo-classical love story.<br/><br/>For the sheer visual marvels that Burton, co-director Mike Johnson, and their genius team (creating more than 100 MILLION frames for each second of animated film), it gets a high recommendation from me. Any reservations I have at all with the film (as I said, not as strong character connections, in particular Victor doesn't hold up like Jack Skellington did with inner conflicts) should not be held too much in comparison with the previous effort from the director. Much of the humor that is brought into the film, which involves about a couple of dozen (at least) puns and gags at old horror films (dancing skeletons and a Peter Lorre inspired earthworm give it two or three points out of the ten automatically), is key and makes the film's more serious elements some balance. It would be one thing if this was all romantic melodrama, but by making it also a sly comedy of (un-dead) manners, it doesn't sell anybody short seeing the film.<br/><br/>Kids (maybe not the wee little ones, like 5 and up) will love the wildness of the film, of the kind of awe that Burton tries to bring out in most of his films; adults will find the gags and some punchlines very funny, and there is one animated song/sequence- I forget it's name but it involves the multiple skeletons, the second song in the film- that ranks up there with 'Pink Elephants' in Dumbo for creating such an array of wonders that it practically doesn't matter what the characters are singing about. At the least, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is a complete triumph of style (not quite) over substance, and at best it delivers more for the eye than any other animated film has this year."
"noralee","7","6","11","28 September 2005"," Charming Animated Musical
","""Corpse Bride"" is one of the best animated musicals since ""Beauty and the Beast."" Danny Elfman is co-creative force with director Tim Burton, as the delightful songs, music and piano playing courtships match the distinctive ensemble of characters. <br/><br/>There are no schmaltzy Disney ballads as the songs, sung by the character ensemble, help to reinforce plot and character points. While the songs aren't classics, they are hummable. With a few more additions, Elfman could turn it into a theatrical production. <br/><br/>Each character has delightfully exaggerated features (who didn't want to cut Johnny Depps's drooping forelock off during the Academy Awards?). The crowded Victoriana setting is as fraught with visual possibilities as ""Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro)"" and Hogwarts in Harry Potter. The color scape is almost all moon-lit black, gray and blue. <br/><br/>The film is charming and funny from the opening through its smidgen too long 76 minutes (though I didn't stay through the credits). The stream of visual jokes and one-liners may go over kids' heads, such as the head waiter. The tributes to old movies also come fast and furious, from the Harryhausen piano to ""The Gone With the Wind"" satire, the Heckle and Jeckle dream sequence from ""Dumbo"", ""Barkis Bittern"" seems to look a lot like an older ""Gaston"" from ""Beauty"" or maybe ""Dudly Do-Right,"" and more. The Peter Lorre-imitating maggot was a bit much. <br/><br/>This isn't the first time we've seen dem bones dance around in animation but this is once again with a lot of feeling. <br/><br/>Christopher Lee voices the minister marvelously and Helena Bonham Carter enlivens the title character.<br/><br/>What's particularly lovely is that none of the characters are really nasty and the magical romantic triangle is resolved with no cruelty."
"evilmatt-3","6","5","9","24 September 2005"," An interesting and relevant, if not perplexing, morality tale
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is by no means a bad movie- indeed, it is much better than most schlock these days- but it is part of a growing category of films with a very specific problem. It does not seem to have a specific audience in mind, or if it does, it is not approaching that audience in the proper way.<br/><br/>Most people will see this film because it is to all appearances the follow-up to The Nightmare Before Christmas. Visually, this is true- Corpse Bride looks and feels very similar to the older film, although computer animation makes this one look even better.<br/><br/>However, whereas The Nightmare Before Christmas maintained a jovial, family friendly theme and plot (complete with misunderstood heroes and dastardly villains), Corpse Bride gives us a quiet little story about three young adults who find themselves in an impossible moral situation. Promises are made which must be kept, and out of three people, one must inevitably end up heartbroken. The three central characters are all exceedingly likable- although one may believe Emily is to be the villain of the piece, she consistently demonstrates as much humanity as anyone.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is about one very difficult moral choice that has to be made by one of the characters. The choice is made and the movie ends, but unless you're paying really close attention, it's difficult to understand why the characters act as they do, and why the film has the ending that it does. While not giving anything away, I'll say that in this sense, the third act of the film presents a very mature dilemma that children (and many adults) are not going to appreciate.<br/><br/>Of course, the frustrating thing about this movie is that so much time is spent on song and dance numbers that the moral and romantic elements never really get fleshed out. As such the film (like Victor) is stuck between two worlds, and never really makes up its mind where it wants to be. On this point, then, it fails.<br/><br/>It's probably still worth watching, although Tim Burton has done much better in the past."
"HoneyBunny2004","3","8","17","29 October 2005"," I really didn't like this.
","I thought this film was definitely one of the worst of all Burton's. I'm not sure why, just that it lacked something that usually captivates the watcher.Compared to Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow its quite unadventurous. It seemed dull and a bit lifeless (no pun intended).And didn't really have much suspense, kind of monotonous. Although on a more positive note, some of the characters were quite interesting and there were a few amusing and comical moments. The dancing and singing made it a bit more lively and a few of the characters were funny and portrayed well. The fact that the death world was lively and the living world dull, made it quite quirky and gave a good change in setting, as well as contradicting the modern worlds ideas about death."
"coney_island_baby","Null","4","7","25 October 2005"," BAD DECISION! (possible spoiler!)
","OK, I saw this movie today, and I have to say, it didn't really do it for me. I mean, the animation was amazing and the models were beautifully made, but the storyline was terrible! It always gets me with this kind of film-- the hero/heroine always falls in love within five minutes of knowing the other person. He meets Victoria, she basically tells him she is unaccomplished (cannot play piano or do anything else interesting), she does pretty much whatever her mother tells her to, and she likes to be called Victoria. So I can only assume that it is on the basis that she is not hideously ugly that Victor falls in love with her. (oh yeah, and; 'Victor and Victoria'??? ewww!) Whereas the corpse bride is open about her love for him, has a much more interesting background (he knows a hell of a lot more about her anyway) and plays the piano beautifully. They are perfectly matched! I really think he should have died. That would have really been a happy ending. Well, a Gothic ending.<br/><br/>Thankyou.<br/><br/>and btw, did anyone else get freaked out by the title? ever heard of necrophilia???"
"neon47","10","4","7","11 October 2005"," Magical.
","I know that there's a lot of people out there who are ready to compare this to The Nightmare Before Christmas, but there's no comparison. Corpse Bride and Nightmare aren't the same movie. Sure they're both Tim Burton and they're both done in a puppet style but they're essentially different mainly because Nightmare was a musical and Corpse Bride is simply a romantic graveyard comedy. Bride does have a few songs but not enough to make it a musical. Depp ends up doing the voice of Victor, who as usual in a Burton movie, does another stellar job. The movie is shot in a Victorian era making it very cool to watch. The music is done great as well; very suiting and very beautiful. The story isn't complex but it's also not meant to be. The movie is directed more towards children than adults, but that of course doesn't mean adults can't enjoy it as much as children. I highly recommend this to Nightmare Cultists, Burton fans, Halloween buffs, or anyone who likes an all around good movie."
"pixel_of_a_pixie","9","4","7","3 October 2005"," Great Animation with Cute Story
","I really enjoyed the simple and sweet story that was Corpse Bride. Undoubtedly, the strength of the film lies in its visuals and its attention to imaginative details. I don't think the storyline has the cleverness of A Nightmare Before Christmas, but for me, the animation was leaps ahead. All the cleverness of this film basically lies in the visuals. The clay look worked really well for this film because the animators took care to add in little details like the butler's nose always flipped in the air, the exaggerated features of the parents, and the waiter in the dead world being a head carried by bugs. You really have to wonder at how the creators even thought this stuff up! I wasn't a huge fan of the songs, but they fit in with the story and don't distract. The actors are terrific and very versatile, especially Johnny Depp who, to me, didn't even sound like himself. It's just a very cute and simple tale that most will enjoy, I think."
"vashstampede117","10","4","7","26 September 2005"," Another Burton masterpiece
","Burton strikes gold again with his newest stop-motion animated film ""The Corpse Bride."" The animation, along the lines of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", is simply gorgeous, capturing the Gothic fairy tale perfectly. The design of all the characters, from the bony Victor, played by Johnny Depp, to the score of undead which fill the after life is simply amazing. The score, composed by Danny Elfman, a regular to Burton films, is top notch. The piano pieces are definitely my favorite part of the entire movie, and help to portray the dark feeling of the film along with the large Broadway like singing portions which made ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" famous. Finally I'm sure you are now wondering about the most important part of the entire film, the story. This is classic Gothic romantic at its best. Burton manages to combine the themes of love and death perfectly, taking this to the level of his previous successes like ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and ""Big Fish."" He takes you from side splitting laughter to tearing in a matter of scenes. I highly suggest this film, and while I admit that it may not be for all audiences due to its dark nature, I have to praise Burton and Elfman for creating another thematic masterpiece."
"Vcaser","10","4","7","26 September 2005"," Nicer Than Expected
","Having seen Tim Burton's ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"", I assumed this movie would be visually stunning but probably completely bizarre. It seemed to be going that way at first, but this time it was actually a nice little story as WELL as visually stunning. I liked the way the world of the living was portrayed in cold monotones while the world of the dead was a riot of colors. It was a good reflection of the living's conflicts and the dead's acceptance. There are little things that go on all throughout the movie that are hilarious if you happen to catch them. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are dead-on (pun intended) in their roles! Even though the ending made me cry a little, I really enjoyed this movie. I'm pretty sure I will buy it when it comes out on DVD."
"simplesimon8","10","4","7","25 September 2005"," A visual and audio masterpiece. Beautiful!
","No filmmaker in history has nearly driven me to tears with his stories more than Tim Burton. It's really difficult to keep appearances when your squashed between several of your closest friends in a theater with tears in your eyes as a funny joke comes up on screen. Ever notice how funny you sound when your laughing and crying at the same time? Well, I was pleasantly surprised to hear the same garbled half-cry/half-laugh out of several of my friends, one of which is a 250 lb. motorcycle riding bad ass. Beautiful. This movie was a triumph for Burton and Elfman. Most people criticize it for not being ""Nightmare Before Christmas 2"", but they have to keep in mind that this IS a different movie and it shows. This movie is much darker and more emotional where NBC is a kids riot. The music is superbly Gothic and dark, just like Burton's visualization of the living plane. I can't recommend this movie enough!"
"deanzawill","1","15","39","25 September 2005"," Let sleeping corpses lie!
","WIth so much hype for Burton and this film, the in-theater experience was just like visiting a morgue. The matinée audience I shared the showing with was as quiet as if at a funeral. And, they were right, because there is nothing here we have not seen before, done better, probably by many of these same artists. <br/><br/>The story makes no sense whatever. The story is dead. Here is a boy who does nothing all day, which is his personality and aspirations. He has no motivation, and so, he is dead, and thus fits into the story. <br/><br/>Then, for no reason, he marries this corpse, and gradually comes to become enamored with the dead chick. He feels at home with the dead, since he does nothing. He has more in common with Emily as is shown by their piano duet. (Victoria does nothing, like Victor, but less since Victor seems permitted to play piano.) Just when they seem to be hitting it off, Victor returns to the surface to see Victoria and he flops again.<br/><br/>Then, in the end, he wants to marry Emily, but then he sees Victoria, and you start asking yourself....How can Victor be so shallow and have two would-be brides? Nobody believes Victor knows what he wants or who he is. So, why are we talking about him and this pointless story?<br/><br/>The music is dead, and not as memorable as many of the characters who seem to be familiar from somewhere...The skeleton dog is the same, Emily looks a lot like Sally, there are many clones..no, homages, to Nightmare. Vincent looks like Vincent from Vincent, Burton's thesis project. We have seen this before. There is neither development nor creativity. The characters are dead.<br/><br/>The movie is a short 76 minutes. And there seems to be some good go-motion animation and there is clearly some digital clean up. However, this whole project is dead. The kids in the audience were bored, confused. The adults were less so. DO yourself a favor, let dead dogs lie. Rent Nightmare.<br/><br/>Will"
"happyreflex","5","5","10","10 January 2009"," This movie wishes it could be The Nightmare Before Christmas.
","There can be no doubt about it: this movie made a conscious attempt to recapture the magic of The Nightmare Before Christmas. But it is a failure. The charm, the charisma, the sprightly feel, the memorable characters, the catchy songs, the very soul is missing.<br/><br/>Victor, the hero, is largely to blame. Or rather, Tim Burton is to blame for writing him. Jack Skellington was a fantastic character. He exuded charisma. Victor is a spineless little wimp. I can't count the times I wanted him to be a man and stick up for himself; to do the obvious things he needed to do to win out. But instead he was a passive vessel for everyone's abuse. He is a terrible heart for this film. And when he enters the world of the dead, his introduction, ""Remains Of The Day,"" finds him constantly freaked out and scared by his strange surroundings. The movie shouts, ""This is weird and creepy! Doesn't it make you feel uncomfortable? That means we're doing it right!"" But of course, after The Nightmare Before Christmas, this world isn't so weird or unfamiliar. We've seen a similar place before. And a better move would have been to show Victor becoming comfortable in this strange world. Remember how ""This Is Halloween"" invited you into the macabre and bizarre Halloween Town and made you feel comfortable in that fantastic place? Wasn't that a cool feeling? Wouldn't it have been great if your point of entry to the world of the dead wasn't such a spineless ninny?<br/><br/>And now to another flaw that sinks this film: the songs. It's Danny Elfman, of course, teaming up with Tim Burton in the usual way. But this collaboration doesn't have the magic of the Nightmare Before Christmas score. In fact, it feels totally phoned-in. The opening song, ""According to Plan,"" is such a boring piece of exposition with such un-engaging and workman-like lyrics! ""Assuming nothing happens that we don't really know,/That nothing unexpected interferes with the show./And that's why everything, every last little thing,/Every single tiny microscopic little thing must go/According to plan."" These are lines for a Greek chorus, not for characters who have names! We see this problem in other songs, like ""Remains of the Day"" and ""Tears to Shed."" In The Nightmare Before Christmas, the songs contributed to the flow of the piece. It was comparable to The Wizard of Oz. Here they just slow things down and call attention to themselves.<br/><br/>Sure, it's pretty to look at, but the first consideration, the script, was a weak foundation, and the flaws keep this film below the level of simple goodness, hence 5 out of 10 stars. Perhaps Tim Burton should have had Henry Selick direct again. Certainly he should have had the script rewritten and sent Danny Elfman back to the drawing board. The whole thing is an exercise without passion or inspiration. And not to be a formula nazi, but the film needed a third act. It didn't so much end as stop."

","First of all I have to say I didn't dislike this movie, it just left me with a strange sensation of not knowing what I had seen and that I didn't find it funny in any way. It's not a movie for children at all, some parts are quite scary and in most parts it is rather sad. Yet it's not a movie for adults either, the ""humour"" is too naive and simplistic and the plot does seem like the one in a children movie. I think that most people who enjoyed this movie are adults that 'prepared' themselves, putting themselves in the proper mood to watch this, wishing to like it. Even though the esthetics are very impressive and the sung parts are great I don't think this movie is as good as it's been said."

This film may scare children under 8 years old, my 8 year old sister was hiding her eyes on one scene close to the beginning, so be prepared. This film could be a rip off of the ultra successful 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and is no way better than it.

","On Friday, I went into the movie theater showing 'The Corpse Bride' with kind of mixed feelings. Whenever a Tim Burton film comes out you know it's going to be original and something different, but that doesn't always mean it is going to be good. Since he had just released his masterful remake to the beloved children's novel 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'The Corpse Bride' seemed a little rushed and I wasn't sure of how good it was going to be. Well, I can tell you, I was very pleased with the film. 'The Corpse Bride' isn't nearly as good as Burton's classic 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' but it was a very entertaining, inventive and charming animated feature. It was also much creepier then 'Nightmare Before Christmas'.<br/><br/>The story follows the solemn Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) who comes from a middle-class family. His parents are excited because he is being married off to the daughter of a wealthy and prosperous family (who secretly have ran out of money.) Victor is nervous about the marriage and like a klutz screws up at the rehearsal dinner. Filled with shame, Victor runs off to be alone in the creepy woods of the town. He practices his vows, and accidentally places the wedding ring on a narrow tree branch with turns out to be the remains of a dead girl (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter). Now, Victor's world is turned upside town since he is now married to one of the deceased who secretly live below the living.<br/><br/>'The Corpse Bride' is one hell of an eerie tale that will no doubt enthrall most adults, but may scare the crap out of little kids. Tim Burton does a good job with this film (it's not one of his best, but isn't one of his worst films by a long-shot). The movie borrows heavily from 'Nightmare Before Christmas' but it is still original in some aspects. Johnny Depp is perfectly cast (or voiced) in the lead along with Helena Bonham Carter. The film also features voice-overs from Albert Finney, Emily Watson, Tracy Ullman, Richard E. Grant and Christopher Lee as the town's reverend.<br/><br/>I recommend 'Corpse Bride' to those who would like to see something a tad different, and don't mind the strangeness of the film.

","Far be it from me to find flaw in this level of craftsmanship and artistry, easily the most highly specialized and organic film-making process in all of cinema. If it failed in any capacity perhaps it would be apropos to judge, but given that all I see is another painstakingly perfect instant classic (only this one without a holidayperhaps it should be played after funerals) I'll refrain. Comparisons to The Nightmare Before Christmas are of course inevitable but to me that's like trying to spot imperfections in two flawless diamonds.The visual in Corpse Bride, especially given the complexity of the puppets, is brilliant beyond anything I've ever seenevery expression (CG quality facial animation performed by cranking tiny gears within the puppets heads) and flowing costume a marvel to behold. And once again Tim Burton has managed to surround his vision with greatness. From the master Craftsman (watch every ounce of extras) to the amazing actors and Danny Elfmanwho crawls into Burtons head for another rousing opusevery bit of Corpse Bride is a product of sheer admiration and love of the craft."

","If you think about it, Tim Burton is one lucky son of a gun. Like his admired Hitchcock, he can be subversive enough to be interesting and yet, unlike other Hitchcock fans like De Palma, he manages to be subtle enough about it to keep making movies with large budgets that take the coins to the pockets that be. He has a regular working team that apparently brings out the very best in him. He has a big cult following, particularly with teenagers, I suspect larger than any other director today. And he still has hip credit, because he has never been a sell-out. Even his worst movie, Planet of the Apes, is not a sell-out, it's just plain bad. On top of that, he keeps bringing out personal childhood stories and fantasies to the screens. When I was a kid I made up stories about a private detective called Dan Smith and his black pup Balthazar, a masked undead avenger called The Jack living in a glass city from the future and comic strips with the five fingers as the main characters, but I don't think I'll ever be omnipotent enough to make movies about that and cast Johnny Depp in them.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride is a mixture of everything that you associate with Tim Burton off the top of your head. It's apparently a standard PG love triangle animated feature, but its roots dig deeper than that and resonate with less conformist undertones. Just look at the ending. Superficially, it's also a brilliant, cohesive blend of different Burton-like things. There's Christopher Lee, and because of that there are also moments that reminded me of the great Hammer Films, there's that Broadway, musical vaudeville atmosphere that he loves to recreate, there's Roahl Dahl-esquire humor, Charles Dickens-like depictions of Victorian misery and the story he has been telling forever about outcasts from society finding a way to re-conciliate themselves with the world. On his earlier, more immature films by sweet isolation. Recently, simply by growing. But while his adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was about the happy part of growing, Corpse Bride's ending is sadder and more nostalgic.<br/><br/>The movie tells a fairy tale starring the typical shy, introverted Depp character, the goth version of his Arizona Dream persona, Victor, forced to engage in marriage with an insecure, romantic, matching girl called Victoria, voiced by Emily Watson. When he f*cks up the wedding rehearsal and runs to the woods, he practices his vows alone with a tree, which just happens to be a concealed skeleton's rusty hand. He puts the ring in the finger and now he's married to the corpse of a woman murdered years ago, and embodied by Burton's new muse Helena Bonham-Carter.<br/><br/>Obvious thing to do right now is to compare this to the masterpiece that is Nightmare before Christmas. And I'm gonna be sacrilegious  it compares. In terms of story, maybe this one is less ""different"" and original, but equally gripping and smart. In terms of animation, this is the glory. They're puppets, but unlike the ones used in Nightmare with removable heads, these ones are mechanic and can make a wider range of expressions. These are the most goddamn expressive puppets I've ever seen, and they blend with the actor's voices flawlessly. The direction is smooth as silk. If I want something to complain about I might just say that it overuses ""neat"" transitions, but overall it's just one stunning image after another, moving with seemingly magic editing and pace. I can only begin to imagine the madness that the filming of this movie must've been, the kind of perfectionist torture and devotion from the animators. There's also some seamless CGI, but overall, the movie is a testament and a blow in the face of those who think computer graphics are the only way animation is going to evolve. Technology is (or should be) additive in my opinion. Or, like Burton himself put it, ""In Hollywood, they think drawn animation doesn't work anymore, computers are the way. They forget that computers are the way because Pixar makes good computer movies"". I say preach it.<br/><br/>It's easier to review bad or mediocre movies than gems like this one. Suffice it to say that, like I already sort of expressed in my Charlie review, I think Burton is entering a new creative period and he's at his peak right now. All I can do is encourage people not to miss it."

","I would give it a 10 rating, but Nightmare Before Christmas means so much to me I can't do it. But that doesn't mean Corpse Bride lacks or isn't good, oh no no no. This movie flows so well, it leaves you wanting more. The animation is flawless, the story is unique to say the least.<br/><br/>The characters each have individual traits that stick out and let you relate to them (whether you love them or hate them). What really shines though, and I can't get over, is the music. It took a few listens to get, but when I got it I was blown away. The themes that carry out thru out the movie are well crafted and arranged perfectly. The lyrics, amazing. The word play and flow of each phrase makes Corpse Bride just shine above all the other movies released at the same time. If you see nothing else this year, see Corpse Bride. It's well worth the wait and well worth the $9 or $10."

","Burton cranks up the machine again to poop out this formulaic product ...and there it sits. It cost me nada to watch and I still couldn't bear more than about half an hour. Developments are non-existent (The sole plot point is the title). There needed to be some attitude to the material, a concept...there is none. The tone is forthright. Characters just stand around, repeatedly explaining how very little is going on; stretching things thinner and thinner, until you're looking at 100 percent concentrated boredom. Danny Elfman's songs are half-hearted musicalizations of the lackluster narrative points.<br/><br/>Most of Burton's favorite visuals get recycled again. He clearly stopped thinking after he penned a gag for each scene, throughout the whole movie. That's just not good enough. His first idea is almost always cribbed from somewhere else, and has been weakened over a century to the point of cliché, by the time he finds it and shouts ""Eureeka!"" in complete obliviousness. Burton should sit down with a textbook that explains how narratives work, before he ever touches a camera again."
"dee.reid","8","4","8","26 September 2005"," Tim Burton's lovely ""Corpse Bride""
","Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" bills itself as a supernatural romantic comedy (much in the same avenue as his own 1993 effort ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""), but upon closer inspection is revealed to be something much more touching. Co-directed by Burton himself and Mike Johnson, it's a tale of lost love and what is truly meant to be, and, as usual, Burton takes a macabre spin on the material, in this case it's the phrase ""It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.""<br/><br/>The Corpse Bride of the title does have a name, and it's Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). Yes, she is dead, dead as a doorknob. She's a walking, talking, rotting corpse, with bones falling from her body, her wedding gown is torn and faded, and a friendly maggot has taken up residence in her right eye socket and from time to time offers her advice much in the same vein as a conscience.<br/><br/>As the film opens in some unspecified time in what is presumably a Victorian-age England, Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is about to be wed to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) in an arranged marriage. The two of course have never met, and both have the wedding-day jitters. Victor comes from a rich family, and his parents (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) are supportive their son is getting married. Victoria and her parents (Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney), however, come from a poor background. For the two to get married, Victor would have family and Victoria would find her way into money. The two are happy to be getting married, but is it meant to be?<br/><br/>However, Victor is such a nervous wreck he can't even remember his vows at the rehearsal ceremony. The priest gets fed up with his ineptitude to even recite a simple marriage vow and sends him out to memorize them. He wanders into the forest, practices and finally gets them right, even going so far as to use a tree limb as a woman's ring finger. But when he does slide the ring onto what he thinks is a branch sticking up from the ground, what emerges from underneath the dirt is the Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>It turns out that in the Land of the Dead (which is populated by those that look like they didn't make the cut to appear in Halloweentown), and because he was able to successfully recite his vows and place the ring on the bride's finger, Victor's marriage to Emily is legitimate. So Victor and Emily are in an unlikely but legal binding. The idea of the story is not to make Emily an object of horror, but of sympathy: she was murdered the night before her own wedding, so by being with Victor, she is given a second chance for wedded bliss that she could not obtain while alive.<br/><br/>If you know Burton, you know he specializes in freaks, and their acceptance more or less into normal society. Very often, said freaks are the heroes while ""normal"" individuals are evil. If you've seen ""Batman"" (1989), ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990) and ""Ed Wood"" (1994), you'd know this. Here, in ""Corpse Bride,"" it's no different as romance and tragedy become the centerpieces of Burton's tale.<br/><br/>The previews may mislead people into thinking ""Corpse Bride"" is a comedy, which is a stretch considering there are a few laughs but most are spare and have a macabre tone to them. The focal point is the theme of lost love, which is what should stick with viewers. The music and songs, by frequent Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, sometimes also help to drive home these points and even partially expresses Victor's newfound predicament: How can he be married to two different women at the same time? Mistakes happen, misunderstandings arise and hearts are broken in ""Corpse Bride,"" but that's love, isn't it?<br/><br/>In a time when CGI rules everything around us, it's good to see a film take advantage of the old cinematic stop-motion techniques. I've seen enough computer-enhanced blockbusters this year to last a lifetime, and ""Corspe Bride"" comes as a lively, refreshing change from what is quickly becoming the norm. Tim Burton's imagination was obviously on overdrive here but in the right spot, and ""Corpse Bride"" may very well be his most touching film yet.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This was overall a beautiful film. I happened to enjoy the Nightmare Before Christmas, and I had a feeling that this would be just as good. I was not wrong. Yes, you could see the reflections of many of the characters from NBC in this one, but I did not mind that. This was still a movie on its own. The music was fantastic, the animation was splendid, and the visuals were marvelous. I do not believe that a fan of Burton will be disappointed with this one. I like how we come to care about the characters and actually feel what they are going through just by looking at their facial expressions. That surely is quality. There are so many scenes in this movie that are extremely beautiful, one being a piano-playing scene between the main character and the Corpse Bride. There are a lot of symbolic features, which is of course typical of Burton to do, and that is one of the reasons that he is a great director. I have said so many good things about this movie, so now let us move on to the negatives. A lot of people will want to expect something new from Burton, which they will not get here, but I did not seem to have a problem with it. What I do think is that there could have been a little bit more development with the characters and a few of the scenes, but I did take into consideration that this type of animation is extremely hard work. The movie was still very well done, and I do not have many complaints about it. I think kids will like this, especially since there are enough funny moments, and older people will enjoy the movie as well, most likely for its beauty and ""cuteness"" it has to it. Burton reanimates his style through this one. That is why I think that his fans should not have a problem with this Corpse Bride =) <br/><br/>8/10 Stars"

","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005) is a stop-motion-animated Romance as well as Comedy / Family / Fantasy / Musical which takes place in two parallel worlds, in the world of living and in the world of dead. It starts in the Victorian England and tells of a young man, Victor who is to marry a girl he never met, named Victoria (Victor and Victoria in the Victorian England). Victor and Victoria fell in love from the first sight but unknown for him, Victor finds himself married to Emily, a mysterious Corpse bride, and taken to the world of dead which in Burton's movie is much more colorful, friendlier, and jollier than the world of living<br/><br/>With the running time only 76 minutes, ""Corpse Bride"" simply does not have time to become boring. It is funny, charming, and refreshingly effective in its use of the stop-motion animation in the age of the advanced computer technology. Some characters are absolutely hilarious, for example, a cute green maggot that lives in Emily's skull and pops out from her eye with the smart remarks and comments. The songs are nice; especially the one that tells the horrific story of the Corpse Bride in such colorful way that you would not stop smiling. Danny Elfman, the film's composer provided voice for Bonejangles, the singer. I also noticed the use of the elegant cutout-style animation with the hypnotizing backgrounds very much in the style of ""Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed"" (1926) directed by Lotte Reiniger, which is the oldest surviving animated feature film."

","This is an amazing movie. I had previously watched Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas and expected a similar experience: Nightmare was amazing to look at and a marvel to listen to, but in between all the singing, I found it a bit dull. This movie though, never encountered that issue.<br/><br/>Viktor Van Dort, son of a wealthy fishmonger family, is set to marry Victoria Everglot, daughter of a poor yet high-class family. The Van Dorts hope to earn high-class, and the Everglots hope to earn money. Victor and Victoria aren't keen on the idea, but once they meet in person, it's love at first site. The shy Victor, however, completely fails at the wedding rehearsal and flees to the woods. He practices his vows there on different branches, finally putting the ring on a very hand-like one. And in fact, it is a hand! The hand of Emily, the Corpse Bride, who was killed by her new husband and swore to await her true love. Victor now finds himself married to a corpse, when he wants to get back to Victoria. Although during the movie, he begins to show more care and love for his new bride. But I won't spoil the ending.<br/><br/>This movie has less music and more plot than Nightmare, and therefore isn't as dull as I found Nightmare to be. It goes at a perfect pace, mixing excellent music with even better voice-acting, of particular note Johnny Depp as Victor and Christoper Lee as the priest, Pastor Galswells. Even more so I must mention the quirky and witty humor in this movie, with many puns and cute jokes, and of course the amazing visuals - stop-motion animation at its best. This movie should be seen only to admire the animation.<br/><br/>It is a bit on the short side, standing at only an hour and 15 minutes, but it doesn't hurt the film. Rather, you can enjoy this fun and light-hearted movie to its full extent before it has a chance to drag into dullness. Many a movie have been ruined by being too long.<br/><br/>This movie is a must-see, if only to appreciate the animation. But anyone who wants some good, clean entertainment should give Tim Burton's Corpse Bride a try."
"titanrd1","8","2","3","12 October 2005"," A work of Art
","In keeping with the eeriness that October generally brings, I have seen the latest effort by Tim Burton entitled ""Corpse Bride"" (contrary to popular belief, there's no ""the"" in the title). Like Tim Burton's 1993 stop-motion classic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Corpse Bride"" takes something wonderful and makes it sinister - In this case, the accidental marriage to a corpse.<br/><br/>From the opening scene onward there's trouble brewing and you know very well that nothing can go right when you hear the parents of both wedding parties singing ""everything must go according to plan."" This song is probably the most memorable out of the entire film (which doesn't say much), but it does serve to set the stage. Indeed everything must go according to plan. The bride's parents are in dire need of money while the groom's parents seek a better reputation. Apparently this marriage can make everybody happy except the bride and groom.<br/><br/>It is at their own wedding rehearsal that our young couple, Victor and Victoria, first meet. They have a brief moment alone in which the pair seem to believe that they can make this work. Feelings of affection also begin to become apparent in this scene - perhaps they will learn to love each other.<br/><br/>As the rehearsal gets underway, we find out what a neurotic and scatterbrained person Victor is. He just can't get his vows right. The more times he makes a mistake, the more impatient everybody becomes, and the more likely he is to make another mistake. After SEVERAL attempts, chaos ensues and Victor flees. He ultimately finds refuge in a dark forest where he finally gets his vows right! He slips the ring, the symbol of his unhappiness, onto what he thinks is a twig, but is actually the remains of a woman's hand. Naturally he's taken aback by the dead chick in the wedding dress that pops out of the ground and says ""I do."" What can you do? Victor ran.<br/><br/>For a while Victor tries to rid himself of his corpse bride but he ultimately falls in love with her because she is more alive than those that can breathe. However, he also still has a soft spot for Victoria who, in Victor's absence has been betrothed, by her parents, to a Mr. Barkis Bittern who clearly has a more cynical role tin this whole story. Victor is being pulled in two directions but can choose only one.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp (Victor), Emily Watson (Victoria) and Helena Bonham Carter (Corpse Bride) lead an exceptional cast of voices. Tim Burton is, again, in his element here, creating a visually striking and sentimental work of art. The Music is okay. The songs are all forgettable and have little purpose except to fill time which this film definitely needed. At only 76 minutes, this film is barely feature length. There's little character development and everything feels a bit rushed, because, well it is. Pacing problems are bound to occur, though, when you're dealing with stop-motion animation. You simply can't tell how the final product will work out, and because of the time and effort it takes to film, you can't very well re-shoot things. ""Corpse Bride"" took a whopping fifty-five weeks to film and during this time one hundred nine million four hundred forty INDIVIDUALLY animated frames were arranged and shot. The animators had to create 28 frames just for the corpse bride to blink ONCE. You can't help but appreciate that kind of effort.<br/><br/>The story is quite original, yet oddly predictable. The dialogue is often simple but sometimes inspired - ""Can a heart break once it's stopped beating?"" As of this time, I'd say that ""Corpse Bride"" is a shoe in for ""Best Animated Picture."" It really hasn't been a great year for animation. I do not recommend shelling out nine dollars to see this film on the big screen. After only 76 minutes, you will feel cheated - it will pack the same punch on your television. Despite ALL it's flaws though, ""Corpse Bride"" is a true work of art and I give it 3 out of 4 stars."

I was discussing it with a friend of mine who argued that it wasn't a children's movie, but the reality is that it is designed for and geared toward children with MORE than enough to keep the grown-ups happy.<br/><br/>I would put this movie on par with Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's ""The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish"". It's an excellent movie to bring young children into the twisted, macabre world that so many adults enjoy.<br/><br/>I'm honestly tired of a lot of the ""safe"" and cliché children's movies that come out.

","First, let me get the negative portion of this review out of the way: I did feel a little let down by this movie. At a very brisk 76 minutes, it seems as if there should have been more story to tell, more details to give...and maybe one or two more Danny Elfman songs (even though he wasn't really at his best in this movie). A few more moments between Victor and Victoria would have been especially wonderful; their characters shared such a special chemistry with each other. The story was so straightforward, and it definitely could have benefited from slowing down the pace a bit more. (But then again, had the movie been any longer, the poor animators would have spent several weeks more finishing it up!!) <br/><br/>Otherwise, Corpse Bride was a wonderful movie. I am absolutely a sucker for the Tim Burton ""look"", which was here in spades. The slightly macabre, utterly haunting world of the dead, which was placed in direct contrast with the antiseptic, colorless world of Victorian England, conjured up some memories of Nightmare Before Christmas without being a complete retread. Also, the acting in this movie (both by the puppets and the voice actors) was wonderful. Although the characters were pretty much par for the course in this kind of movie, they were acted so wonderfully that we in the audience still cared for them and hoped for Victor, Victoria, and Corpse Bride to all have a happy ending, as they did. And although we knew from the first that Lord Barkin is a rotten apple, we want to know how he's going to get what's coming to him in the end.<br/><br/>Though slightly disappointing in the story department, Corpse Bride is still a wonderful film that will tickle your quirky-bone as only Tim Burton can. I definitely recommend this film."

","I am perplexed by the over-exuberance of those who have voted on this film. I have a feeling many have voted before actually seeing it.<br/><br/>The movie is... fine. It's really nothing exceptional. Nightmare Before Christmas blows this out of the water when it comes to character development, complexity of animation and story telling.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride was cute, nice, cliché. While it started with a strong promise and premise, with a glowing gray world with family characters, all went wacky when Victor went into the forest. This is about where you wish you were in the forest with Jack instead.<br/><br/>Unlike those you meet in Halloweentown, the dead characters are not interesting, all either blue or bones. The humor and puns are forced and repeated, in case you didn't get that pulling the sword out of the dead dwarf was funny the first, second, third, fourth or fifth time.<br/><br/>The songs were great in the beginning, sparse and annoying in the middle. At times, the sound effects were louder than the lines themselves, so lyrics of the songs and/or punchlines couldn't be deciphered.<br/><br/>The bride character was so one-dimensional that I didn't care about her, until her act about how she wishes she were alive -- a touching song there. Interestingly, Victoria, through just her ""acting"" seemed more developed than any of the other characters, save for Victor. <br/><br/>Some of the characters' actions were less than motivated. Victor suddenly going from uninterested to willing-to-marry because of sharing a 20-second piano duet with Corpse Bride? The Parents obsessed with finding Victor, then just disappearing out of the story?<br/><br/>What saved this film for me was the ending, which, while predictable, was so heart-warming and honest... Great 1st and 3rd act does not a good film make.<br/><br/>I don't want to be negative. I'm about as big of a Tim Burton / Danny Elfman fan as anyone else, (sans freakish obsessions or those who think Jack Skellington is some evil bad ass I need to buy on a t-shirt at the mall so my parents will see what a rebel I am), but this movie was little more exciting than Frosty The Snow Man. I didn't hate it. But it wasn't worth my midnight premiere.<br/><br/>You might say, ""Oh, this is a children's film. It doesn't need character development, a logical story or interesting songs."" <br/><br/>To that I might say, ""Shut up.""<br/><br/>This film will soon be forgotten, like James and The Giant Peach, whereas masterworks like Big Fish, Batman and Nightmare Before Christmas will live on forever.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading."

","Review:
'Corpse Bride' is a dark-fantasy film directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton.
I've seen parts of this movie multiple times but have never fully watched it through until now. If I am being honest, I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan and I can't really put my finger on why that is. His movies seem to be the same dark concept with different stories. Let's look at some movies that his name is under. We have 'Corpse Bride', 'Frankenweenie', and 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' and these are just his stop motion films. None have any gripping elements to bring viewers in to start watching it let alone continue through the runtime. However, out of all the Tim Burton stories ""Corpse Bride"" is one that I could see myself viewing again.
We start the movie out being introduced to Victor (Johnny Depp) and his odd mother and father. We learn that he is to be married to the daughter of a thought to be known wealthy family's daughter; Victoria (Emily Watson). When the rehearsal for the wedding goes awry, Victor sets off to the woods to practice his vows before the big day, only to become married to an undead bride when he places his ring on the corpse's finger, thinking it was a branch. Now, locked into the commitment of marriage to a dead woman named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) and trapped in the land of the undead, Victor must find away out of the marriage and look for a way back to the land of the living.
A big positive for this movie is the voice acting. It may not seem like a big deal, but having the wrong voice come out of a certain character could throw off the whole film and everybody in this movie did a fantastic job bringing their characters to life. Although, Helena Bonham Carter does such a great job giving her character personality you almost want Victor to end up with her at the end of the movie when I don't think that's the intention of Tim Burton.
I was also a fan of the musical choices in this movie. I thought it brought a much-needed energy to the overall story and was executed fully. The one thing that spoke most to me and what I thought was a brilliant concept was that fact that when the movie is in the land of the living it is very dark, and everybody looks miserable. When the movie is taking down in the land of the dead it is colorful, and everybody looks happy. Now, I don't believe that the movie is saying if you want to be happy be dead. It's just telling a realistic view on life, not everybody is happy, and maybe the dead are happy, and we shouldn't feel so scared about death when it comes.
Overall, this is classic Tim Burton and if you're a fan of his you will love this movie. It has a dark sense of humor and tell a story of death, love, and sacrifice.

","The plot and characters I found lacking. Victor was incredibly annoying simply because he refused to ever speak up for himself and tell the truth on what was going on. Instead, he stuttered through the movie, all doe-eyed, while everyone else talked over him. I found it quite irksome and made the whole plot unnecessary."

","When I saw this movie for the first time I was around 7-8 years old and I immediately fell in love with it.
I recently watched this again with my young cousin and I found myself moved several times during this movie.<br/><br/>The delicacy with which Burton narrates a story that takes place between the world of the living and that of the dead is utterly sublime. First of all, what struck me a lot is that the living world is dark and grey, while the dead world is happy and colorful.<br/><br/>The film lives on a delicacy able to entertain and move, and that is difficult to describe in words. It is a film that should be seen at least once in a lifetime, and that lends itself to numerous reading plans: a child will perceive it differently from an adult, but in both cases it will remain a great film."

","Actually liked the 'Corpse Bride' a bit more than Burton's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. Not enormo-more... but a nice, pie slice-sized bit. In fact, I would consider this film a culmination of the efforts of Mr. Burton & staff which was begun in TNBC. Stop motion, when done correctly with skill and a talented director's eye, results in one of the better viewing pleasures one is likely to see in film form-- Feast upon it ... and remember, simply because she's dead, does NOT mean she shouldn't be treated with her fair share of dignity.

"jwgclifton","Null","1","1","9 November 2014"," Great film enjoyed by my 10-year-old
","I was really taken with this film. Horror is not a genre I enjoy so this pg rated version is an excellent 'horror' - unpleasant faces in the underworld, eyes falling out of sockets and so on but as it is all animated and not too 'real' nothing to give many children nightmares. The music is a little loud in places, drowning out some dialogue (or maybe it's just my old ears). I'm surprised that no-one has mentioned the reference to Carrie in this film. When Victor is practising his vows in the wood and the Corpse Bride appears she first reaches her hand out from her grave and grabs Victor's hand, very much like the final scene in Carrie (a horror that I got through without too many major scares and now look back on with fondness). No doubt - a great film and, although it's short anyway, the time fairly flew by as my daughter and I were gripped. Watch and enjoy!"
"Rainey-Dawn","8","1","1","13 October 2014"," A Creepy Classic Animation
","A very good stop-motion animation. Well worth watching - great for the Halloween Holiday. Fun for all ages.<br/><br/>I think what I liked best about the film is the uniqueness of the story - it is quite different than any other story I have personally heard of, read or seen. The twist to this ""love triangle"" is the fact that Victor is still alive, his beloved Victoria is alive and Emily is a corpse.<br/><br/>Of all the characters in this film - it is Emily I feel bad for. She was murdered by her fiancée then (gently) rejected by Victor. In the end Emily finds peace.<br/><br/>A good film to double with ""Frankenweenie"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""ParaNorman"" or ""Hotel Transylvania"". <br/><br/>8.5/10"

I know all the words, all the lyrics and some might find me crazy but the plot is awesome and the images are so beautiful. It is nice to see how life is represented in all dark colours and how death is represented as a puke or shining colours. You must see it once in your life, it is so worth it. Tim Burton is an amazing guy, he does great movies but this one is seriously the best i've seen of him. The voices fit perfectly,the facial expressions and body expressions are really good."
"mathiasmiles","10","1","1","2 November 2013"," A very well done work by the master himself.
","Yesterday at school, I watched Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" for the third time I think. Lately, I've had Burton's work on my mind lately. I've been thinking about a lot of his movies, like his dark ""Batman"" films, the enchanted Christmas classic, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (which recently celebrated it's 20th anniversary) ,and ""Edward Scissorhands"", one of my all-time favorite movies. So watching his work again makes me realize what an interesting and talented director he is, even if he might be stating to decline slightly. And watching this movies again really captures the beauty and elegance of his works like none of his other films. The premise of the film centers on a shy, nervous man played by (who else?) Johnny Depp. He is engaged to be married to a lovely women named Victoria, played by Emily Watson. However, after getting cold feet during the rehearsal, he accidentally marries a dead women instead, played by (again, who else?) Helena Bonham Carter, who takes him to the land of the dead, to marry her. There are so many things to admire in this film. I guess the best place to start is the animation. It is simply beautiful. The character's eyes are made bigger, in order to make make them more expressive. And Burton makes the smart decision to make the living world black and white, and once we get to the world of the dead, it becomes very colorful. Not only that, but he chooses to keep the living people black and white when they are in the world of the dead. And it's clever little quirks like that make the film a great Tim Burton film. Burton uses clever uses of cinematography, tilted shots and things like that. His sense of art direction is very good as well, with nice designs done for the buildings and characters. And speaking of the characters, they are interesting, and their actors do fine. You admire how smart, sophisticated, funny, or just kind they can be, which make them all very memorable. The music is also really beautiful. Danny Elfman returns to score the movie, and creates some nice songs for the characters to sing, as well as some quiet piano music to accompany other parts. ""Corpse Bride"" is one of Tim Burton finest films. It is beautiful, funny, inspirational, and has great attention to detail. Check it out if you haven't already."

","I had seen Corpse Bride as a kid back when it came out. I rewatched it after around six years, and it's still as fun and entertaining as when I first watched it. It isn't better than the more recent Coraline or 2005's Wallace and Gromit film, but it's still enjoyable with great colors and designs. How odd that Bonham Carter was in the two best animated films of 2005. Most songs are a bit forgettable, but there is one that really stuck with me, and that's the one sung when explaining what happened to the 'corpse bride'. Overall, this is definitely recommended. It's just what one would expect from Tim Burton, for better or worse for each kind of person."
"paul_haakonsen","9","1","1","25 December 2010"," Unique and darkly romantic
","The ""Corpse Bride"" movie is another masterpiece from Tim Burton's dark, warped mind.<br/><br/>The story told in the movie is very good and captivating. It is a story that you can easily immerse yourself into and a story that is romantic in a dark way. And it has that unique Burton touch to it, being dark, twisted, funny and yet straight and to the point.<br/><br/>In ""Corpse Bride"" we have the usual outrageous and grotesque, yet lovable and adorable characters that only Tim Burton can manage to come up with. Just pay close attention to all the characters (also those that are not focus characters and just in the background), and you will see there is so much detail and personality added to every single character in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Of course, the voice cast list is phenomenal, especially Johnny Depp as Victor Van Dort. His voice is so amazing in this movie. Not to mention names like Helena Bonham Carter, Tracy Ullman, Richard E. Grant, Christopher Lee, etc. The list of good names (and voices) here is just amazing. And they all bring a unique touch to the movie.<br/><br/>As with the previous animated movie ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", the style in ""Corpse Bride"" is very unique, and there is that Burton sense of elegance to it. There is put a lot of thought and effort into the design and the creation of the sets. And it all works so well.<br/><br/>I remember seeing it when it was first hitting the cinemas, and I fell in love with it instantly. This is definitely a movie that you should treat yourself to watching, if you haven't already seen it. I bet you will love it!"
"Bloitz","9","1","1","24 February 2010"," Properly amazed and just blown away
","I wasn't really excited about seeing this movie but my friend rented it and I could borrow it. Seen quite a few movies from Tim Burton now so I thought it couldn't be that bad. And indeed it wasn't. The movie starts rather slow (not King Kong-slow so don't worry ;) ) but keeps a very nice pace. Normally I stop a movie once to get some drinks but I just couldn't stop it. I was hooked by the beautiful story along with the truly awesome animations. It captivated me in a way I've not felt for a long time (well not that long, but justs sounds better), I can't put my finger on it but the movie just works, and that's what movies should do and directors should be able to accomplish. Corpse Bride is really a fine example of Burton's talent and I'm so glad I didn't ignore it and neither should you (you probably won't find a cure for cancer anyways in those 90 minutes you'd lose if you don't like it after all).<br/><br/>Totally off-topic: In my opinion the corpse bride is quite hot really, in an animated slightly morbid way... But still."
"danne-carlson","7","1","1","4 October 2009"," A typical Burton: Good visuals, but not much beneath the surface
","Tim Burton is a director who almost always makes enjoyable movies - you can watch them, enjoy them, laugh a bit here and a bit there - but eventually you will forget them. Tim Burton creates beautiful and magical worlds, and the problem is that he often just focus too much on the visuals. <br/><br/>In that sense, Corpse Bride is a typical Burton movie. The plot is a simple fairytale which works great for the moment, but it's not something that will stay in your head. Instead you'll want to watch it for the typical Gothic style of his movies, which works great. It's beautiful animated and Danny Elfman's music adds even more to the atmosphere. What's interesting here is that the movie show us two worlds - the world of the living and the land of the dead - and it's the world of the living that is the dark place, with a color scale of black, gray and white and inhabitants that are sad, evil and greedy. In the land of the dead corpses and skeletons sing together, it's colorful and mysteriously beautiful and almost everyone there seems to be having a good time, even though they're dead. <br/><br/>The voice actors are great; as many times before, Burton features Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in his movies. They're both great. Other notable voice actors are Christopher Lee and Emily Watson. <br/><br/>In the end, it's a pretty funny movie during the time you watch it, but there's no depth in the story whatsoever. It's no movie that stays in your head. That's the reason that I can't rate it any higher, but if you get the chance to see it it's good entertainment for an hour and a half."
"AloysiusWeasley","9","1","1","30 December 2007"," Another one of Tim Burton's brilliant works
","Tim Burton may have flubbed with the remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Big Fish, but he certainly pulled no punches with this!

Difficult to do, VERY time consuming, and definitely a labor of love in this movie as well.<br/><br/><ul><li>Definitely a very cute, Gothic-y romance story - heavier on the romance than NBC, but it goes every bit as deep into the underworld atmosphere in this movie as they did with Halloween Town, and in some places, explained it further.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Excellent musical score! - Gorgeous sets and Victorian atmosphere! - You'll definitely become attached to the characters - I won't give away the ending, but rest assured, you won't be disappointed! Bottom line, I found no flaws with this movie. Not something for the youngest children to go to, but if you're a fan of Tim Burton, animation, NBC, or just in need of a a romance film without excess sappiness, this just may be the film for you. Definitely worth your time!</li></ul>"
"g-bodyl","8","1","1","23 December 2007"," Good Animation!
","This film is another good Burton animation, but the Nightmare Before Christmas was better. Yes, this film is not original but it is still enjoyable. The storyline takes place in the 1800's in Victorian London. Victor is about to marry a noble-like girl named Victoria, when all of the sudden, Victor says his vows to a innocent branch. That branch was actually the Corpse Bride and she takes Victor with him to the land of the dead. The storyline was good if not great. The score by Danny Elfman sounds like Nightmare Before Christmas, but who cares. It was still good. The voice acting is great. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter did a great job. This film might be a little scary for little kids, but everyone else will enjoy this film. I rate this film a 8/10."
"dbdumonteil","9","1","1","18 February 2007"," an enchantment at all levels
","The year 2005 was excellent for Tim Burton. A few months after he filled us with joy with his stylish rendering of Roald Dahl's novel ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"", he extended the pleasure with this stop motion picture whose only fault is to be too much short. However, it's a feast for the eye and the mind.<br/><br/>Sourced from an old legend according to which a young man accidentally has to marry a corpse bride (one recognizes Burton's inclination for myths and legends), ""Corpse Bride"" bears the trademark of its auteur, beginning with the backdrop and the scenery. A dreary, gray depiction of London tangled in Victorian values and bribery at the end of the nineteenth Century sharply contrasts with a bright, brisk representation of the great beyond animated with colorful, eccentric skeletons, living dead. Hell isn't a bad place to be, at least for th famous corpse bride who wishes to live forever with Victor. But the latter can't accept this and is determined at all costs to marry Victoria. Alas! Because they believe Victor dead, they want her to marry an unscrupulous rich man. The story is rather linear but filled with effective visual ideas, genteel humor and an indispensable dose of emotion (I must profess that I was moved when Victor was offered his cute little skeleton dog as a wedding present). And Tim Burton once said that monsters weren't so scary and felt lonely and sad. It's what we could put forward with the corpse bride who only wants to be happy through wedding.<br/><br/>This film could be ""Beetlejuice""'s son because of the manner Tim Burton represents us death. I will just regret an end made with alacrity. But for the rest: sit and savor one more extra canonical work from an auteur."
"IdleGossip","7","1","1","18 February 2007"," Beautiful movie with few faults
","Tim Burtons Corpse Bride is an amazing film. I do not know why I love it, there's just something about it. I bought it on DVD about a year after it was released because it had gotten a lot of good reviews. And my was I stunned. I watched it 3 times the first day i got it and another time the next day. It was just amazing.<br/><br/>Its about the story of Victor who is to marry Victoria. But, after a series of unfortunate events he finds himself married to the corpse bride Emily instead. It has the flavor of being made for kids, but is a movie for all ages. And I'm not usually the one to watch children's movies. <br/><br/>Both Johnny Deep, Helen Bonham Carter and Emily Watson offers some really good voice acting. One can feel that the voices really fits. The rest of the actors offer some strong voice acting too. My favorite would be Christopher Lee as Pastor Galswell. but how does it work? Why would we need so simple movie-making techniques in a time of computer animation? Because it ads a interesting feeling. And if your wondering, yes, even though its not CGI its still beautiful.<br/><br/>The voice acting is well done, the story is good and interesting, its got many good jokes and its entertaining from beginning to end. And thats what really matters. I would definitely say you should see Corpse Bride. The only fault with this movie is thats it to short. Sill, a must see in my book."
"insomniac_rod","9","1","1","18 January 2007"," A movie that suits for everyone.
","This is a beautiful Horror/Fantasy movie for kids and adults. When I first watched it on theaters I didn't care for it that much, but, on a second view on DVD I really liked it and found it to be a fantastic sui-generis movie.<br/><br/>The world of Tim Burton is dark but colorful at the same time; creepy but happy; and most of all, scary but charming.<br/><br/>This is a movie that suits for everyone. There are great comedy moments, the typical but effective love story from the graveyard, tenderness, and magic. The real world in the dark mind of Burton was great but the world of the dead is what really makes the movie... the art direction, the colors, the ideas, the characters!, etc. Everything is magical in the world of the dead. Now, with a great plot like this one, it is truly a place to visit and want to live on there.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Corpse Bride"" could be used on any Horror movie but it wouldn't work as in this visual experience. As it's a ""creepy"" theme, it needed a dark sub-plot and situations; but Burton instead decided to add the winning formula of cartoonish sub-plots and the always effective battle between good and evil at the end. The tale is simply irresistible for any viewer.<br/><br/>The characters are likable and very well defined. The music is perfect, just perfect. Not to mention the amazing f/x. Thank God CGI is not used on EVERY single movie.<br/><br/>Join this fantastic and dark world and enjoy! One of the best animated features of the new millennium.

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","1","6 December 2006"," Death is like the paradise of love and the real gate to marriage
","This animated film that uses puppets and other means to build a full show, dancing, singing and haunting included, is remarkable. Remarkable for its pleasantly morbid humor and subject. Remarkable for its caustically social criticism. Remarkable for its mesmerizing loving young characters. These are the victims of everything in the world. Of their parents, of their social position, of their young age, of their romanticism, of their naiveté and of course of all the social climbers and social vultures our beautiful human society hosts and even cherishes. It is true without these social escalating climbers life would be humdrum and tasteless. With them it tastes like mud and there is always some hullabaloo around them. <br/><br/>The plot is superbly simple. The son of a rich bourgeois family is planned by his parents to marry the daughter of a pauperized noble family who is planned by her parents to marry the son of a rich bourgeois family. They fall in love at first sight, and first touch of a piano keyboard, which is exceptional for an arranged marriage. And then difficulties pile up because a social vulture comes up and wants the girl since he is pauperized and badly informed. He thinks the noble family is rich and he wants to put his hands (and both of them of course) on the girl and her family's fortune. <br/><br/>Then, due to some local and perverse circumstances the poor young man ends up in a cemetery and he gets, by total accident, married to a dead girl, hence a corpse ""till death us parts."" But this clause is difficult to implement. The rest is to be discovered by yourself and your doppelganger because we all have a doppelganger who would like to visit the other side of the mirror, the other side of reality, the dark side of the moon and even the invisible side of our psyche. I know a lot of people who would love to visit the underground underworld just for fun, provided they can come back. Though coming back is the most difficult part of the game, and please do not fall in love with anyone on that other side because then you'll have to join them for ever ""as soon as death us unites.""<br/><br/>But the most beautiful and fascinating part of this film is of course the animation. I will not be technical but the ""puppets"" are perfects especially the skeletons dressed or undressed, dancing or not, singing or howling, playing bone percussions or bone saxophone. They can fall down on the ground and scatter all their bones and then in an instant get back up and reassemble the jigsaw puzzle of their ribs, phalanges and knuckles. There is some kind of a magical trick in that. I must say that the dancing skeletons can be alluring and even exciting. But please no S, we're not necessarily English, but we're dead. Too bad because a bag of bones can be very surprising at times.<br/><br/>The music is of course great. This is a Tim Burton film, mind you, And the music is essential to make the bone hallucination dance and sing. But the music is also essential to lure the social escalating climber into drinking the poison that was not intended for him, and he will not end like the girl he killed, ""always a bride's maid but never the bride,"" he will end ""always a bridegroom but never a married man."" Poor chap!<br/><br/>Finally it is important to know that this film is not recommended for sensitive people who should also be sensible and avoid the morbid fear and lethal angst they may feel in that funeral of a wedding, in that deadly descent to Limbo from which there is no way back. Once an underworld resident, always an underworld resident. Ask Orpheus about it. You will recognize that fascination for death that is the hallmark of Mr. Tim Burton. It is why we like him, true enough, but it is also why we come back all the time to be flagellated with bones, corpses, rotting flesh and maggots. I must say that the spider seamstresses are quite a perverse, obnubilating but so sugary-sweet-honey-pie vision. We could accept to become macabre diabetic and an overdose of that graveyard paraphernalia would lead us to the bliss of a symbolical and orgasmic death directly there in our armchairs.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

I can see Depp really pulling this off with another trademark performance. The sad fact is, Burton hasn't made a great movie since ""Sleepy Hollow"". ""Big Fish"" was overdone and over long and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was the same. And what the hell is wrong with Jon August?

","Burton scores again with this charming story. Part murder mystery, part comedy, part tragedy, and part love story, Corpse Bride is delightful. There's just enough screwball antics and mayhem to keep the kids enthralled, and more than enough witty dialog for the parents.<br/><br/>The story moves along at a brisk pace (not surprising given the oh too brief length of 76 minutes), and so character development leaves quite a bit to the imagination. There's no backstory, and no subplots, but it doesn't take long to become enamored by the characters in Burton's love triangle of the living and the dead. Depp, Bonham Carter, and Watson all turn in laudable performances, and the stop-motion animation is not just truly amazing, but a refreshing break from the computer graphic trend that's become the bread and butter of animated movies.<br/><br/>I think I liked this better than my kids (but they loved it too)."

The use of stop action animation is perfect for this film, giving characters and setting a richness and depth unavailable otherwise. This is actually a film that improves with re-viewing. Have so far seen it 3 times, and it gets better every time. The only improvement would be for it to be longer to better develop Emily's and Victor's relationship.

It brought together the the humor and wit of Ed Wood, the charm and emotion of Edward Scissorhands, the romance and beauty of The Nightmare Before Christmas and the utterly original story of Beetlejuice into a movie that will make you laugh cry and gasp with wonder at the ingenuity of stop motion animation. It's creepy yet emotionally humorous in a way that Burton fans all over have been waiting to see in a film ever since the production of Beetlejuice. I venerate Burton as possibly the greatest director of our time, and The Corpse Bride is the movie that truly defines him. It is a movie that anyone can find something special in. The voices worked with the characters in a way that The Nightmare Before Christmas lacked. The music's variety between the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead was truly spectacular. A slide from the gray, classical music of the pathetically dull little town of Victor's upbringing to the colorful, jazzy music of the partying, rowdy world of the dead. i enjoyed the subtle sense of dark, creepy humor all through the movie. In the scene of the final wedding, where the dead rejoin the living, the touching moments where the little boy found his dead grandfather and Gertrude found her dead husband I found most enjoyable.

Full of wonder... drama... mystery... humor and love! Every studio who releases animated films should study this one good. Most ""family"" films are made for kids, with those pop culture references to keep adults from going stir crazy! I sat in a theater where adult couples, twenty somethings and families with kids were all laughing at the same parts! Nothing too scary.. if your kid can handle Beetlejuice, they'll love this!

Depp as Victor mumbles along in likable ineptitude. Bonham-Carter is charming as the love-lorn corpse bride. The rest of the cast is great as well.

As an arrogant musician myself, I used to hold an uneasy and begrudging respect for some of Elfman's earlier work, i.e. Batman, etc. It was memorable but I always criticized his originality. Not anymore. He's grown into a fantastic scorer.<br/><br/>Damn those puppets are cool. Recommended."

","I just saw this movie yesterday (Sept 16th) and........WOW!! This movie was just brilliant! Everything from the characters, to the visual presentation, the camera angles, the jokes and the songs!! It was like watching another take on Night Before Christmas. (With less songs thought) All the characters are very interesting and charming in their own little way. The jokes and gags are also worth mentioning, everything from a head waiter to a second hand store. It's very clever and well thought out. And these songs are some of Danny Elfman's best work yet! Excellent beats, fun lyrics, and.......well, I could go on, but all I'd be doing is repeating myself. So let me close by saying, for all you NBC, Tim Burton, Danny Elfman and undead movie fans out there, this movie is Definitely worth checking out! ;)<br/><br/>My favourite character is Bonejangles! He's awesome! ^_^"
"FreeFallFlow","1","8","25","7 May 2006"," What the heck is Burton's message???
","I really looked forward to seeing the Corpse Bride, because of the nice trailer. I really did. I realized now after remembering the very kitsch and tasteless Edward Scissorhands and the cheesy and even more tasteless Big Fish, that Burton definitely is dreadfully mainstream. And his claiming that he sleeps at the Ritz in Paris before every French premiere of his films because it brings him luck (sic) did not help me in liking this man who thinks he is delightfully wacky and outside the mainstream. Anyway.<br/><br/>So I went to see the Corpse Bride. And I got out of the cinema really angry to have paid, wasted, 8 dollars for this stupid film. I'll tell you what shocked me (because some stuff really shocked me, without even having to think about it). Roughly, the way women are viewed. Victoria, Victor's fiancée, is a nice girl, shy and kind, but OK, to the eyes of our society,(not mine)let's face it, she is completely tasteless and a bit stupid. That's one thing. Then comes Emily (is that her name?), the Corpse Bride. Roughly, a ""hot chick"" (isn't that what Burton wanted us to think?), the West Coast version of the hot chick, super big pink lips, small very small nose that makes us think she might have had surgery (maybe with the same surgeon that Mickael Jackson), a really thin and sexy (anorexic) body, but surprisingly, amazing big boobs!!!Well, the cliché of the ""perfect"" girl, at least perfect to the eyes of the basic redneck man. The film is about the struggle between the two women, one small and ""ugly"", the other one tall and ""hot"" (I'm using brackets because to me it's all so biased, this vision of what is beautiful and what is not). Another thing that shocked me: this stupid Victor, that Burton tries to introduced as shy and clumsy, innocent and sexless, who sees that two women are fighting for him, and he does not take any clear position for none of them. He likes Emily (we don't know if he has erections when he sees her, Burton's world wanting itself to be childlike -yeah, big boobs and two women for one man, that's really childlike!!), but tells her that he is to be married; and he likes Victoria (probably no erection, but who cares), but still cannot make a decision. Here it is: two women on their knees for one men...What the hell is that subliminal message??? At some point, I remember Emily the slutty making some irritated comments about Victoria, I think she even imitates Vicoria's (small and not sexual) lips, saying that oh, she is so nice and polite and etc. <br/><br/>In the end the hot girl sacrifices herself for the ugly little girl (Glory to the fake boob hot Californian girls -ok, this one is not blonde, (because Mr Burton thinks he is doing some Gothic connoted movies, so she has to have black hair...-) .....Where is the moral in this???<br/><br/>I sense that many people did not have the same feeling about the (subliminal) message of Burton...It's sad, because he thinks that he can make his audience swallow anything, even the bad things of today's society. Don't women have enough problems with the image they give? Do they need some so-called ""alternate"" movie maker to push the whole complex even deeper??Always have to be thinner, with more and more tendency to resort to plastic surgery to try to be perfect, and Burton glorifies this terrible vision of women (because Emily, with her ""death"" is crystallized in her perfect appearance, will never grow old, so she is the real heroin in the movie) I found all that disgusting, full of unwholesome messages... Yes, that's the word, completely unwholesome. Burton is nothing but an mainstream movie maker, in spite of what he seems to think. He seems to think that whatever he releases, people will follow him (in that he is smart, because it is actually what happens...), but I find him more and more ridiculous, and even more, pompous. His imagery is really shocking and out of place in a society that has already its flaws about the men-women inequalities. Does he want every girl to be anorexic and doing plastic surgery? You really are see-through, Mr Burton, and not everyone falls for that."
"sacul1138","7","7","21","14 September 2005"," Dead Corpse Walkin
","Animated Death never looked so good, but felt so dull. After over a decade of waiting for something as glorious and fun as The Nightmare Before Christmas I walked out of the theater last night feeling like a kid at Christmas who got a new bike with no tires. I'm left thinking either my expectations could have been too high or this movie just fell short of its intended mark.<br/><br/>The movie and the animation are gorgeous, though it looks far too much like Nightmare to avoid comparisons and invoke expectations. The story is fairly basic and gets going pretty fast. Victor (Depp) is set to marry Victoria (Watson) in an arranged marriage. Victor is a nervous wreck about it and is a very jittery fellow. He doesn't have cold feet so much as nervous hands. Victoria is a flower in a family of poisonous weeds. She knows her duty and after meeting Victor seems very much taken with him. Its Victors nervous hands that set things in motion; while practicing his vows he mistaken places the ring on the finger of a murdered bride. From there the movie heads off into regular Tim Burton territory with fun creepy characters and imagery as Victor is pulled into the after life. Much like the world of Beetlejuice the dead walk, talk, sing, dance and are examples of how they died.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie Victor is trying to get out of this world and back to his living girlfriend above ground. Meanwhile Victoria's parents find another suitor to replace the clumsy Victor. Once Victor learns of her new brothel he surrenders to something that's been right in front of him; He's got a wife and despite her being dead is really quite charming. He promises his love and consents to a ceremony to finalize their vows (and his beating heart). This is where the movie really shines. The dead return to the land of the living for this wedding of the afterlife. As the dead run amok and revisit old loved ones we get the only glimpse into the charm and fun Nightmare had.<br/><br/>While the movie is actually pretty good and it is entertaining I think aside from letting expectations get in the way this movie suffers from two glaring faults; The songs and the lack of charm. The songs are like dead finger nails on a chalkboard none of them are as witty are fun as they should be to lighten such a dark movie. The lack of charm is something you wouldn't expect in a movie with Johnny Depp and Emily Watson, to say nothing of the rest of this great cast.<br/><br/>I wanted this movie to succeed in so many ways, I love stop animation, I enjoy it even more when it's not all cutesy and has a plot. I want to see more studios pulling away from CGI animated movies and investing in such craft-work as films like Nightmare showed it could be again."
"Atavisten","4","4","10","30 October 2005"," The least of the Burtons
","With Burton recreating the style of 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' expectations are high. Sadly they are not delivered. It begins swell and well with the preparations for the wedding of the son of a new-rich fish mongers family and the daughter of bankrupt noblemen. He fails doing anything right in front of the parents so he runs away into the forest to practice where something most unfortunate happens. Up till now, check.<br/><br/>Next we go to the land of the dead and the style suddenly appeals more to a 12 year old than anyone else. The corpse bride has a worm in her eye sockets and this is the most irritating ""caracter"" in an expected movie since Jar Jar Binks. Blah. And the French waiter head, well..<br/><br/>Elfman does a good job. Animation is state of the art stop motion. The rest is at worst terrible. Yes there were some spine chilling sequences, but on the whole, disappointment."
"madmanzoo","4","3","7","7 February 2006"," BurtonVision is beating a Dead Bride
","Although this movie was beautifully photographed, the art direction topnotch, and I can appreciate the wonderful animation - this film was about as dull, boring and uninspired as it gets. It is rehashed 'BurtonVision' we have seen more than a few times before. It is a simple love story that is most likely a wonderful bedtime story and would have made a better short film than a (barely) feature length movie. The story line was basically interesting, there was just nothing original done with it. The creepy and surreal world of the dead has already been explored in other Burton films so to see it yet again presented in the same way was, well, dead. The dropping body parts of the Bride and the other gruesomely cute characters of the World of the Dead were expected. We got that joke about 15 years ago with 'BeetleJuice' and more recently 'A Nightmare Before Christmas.' I assume it was suppose to be funny but again...it just lacked any originality. Everything in this film is standard. Not big deal. A lot of films are. What sets bad and good films apart is the the filmmakers' ability to switch things up so we see these familiar things as new and exciting.<br/><br/>The characters here are all your basic fairy tale types. Good guy, bad guy, heroine, antagonist, greedy parents, helpful friends aiding you in your journey, etc. Though these characters make up the heart of all stories, in this film they all but had captions telling you when to sneer and applaud. The whole Dead Crowd ganging up on the bad guy at the end. Did we all see that coming? Of course. And that maggot from inside the Bride's head!? First time funny. Second time cute. Third time dead horse. <br/><br/>The lack of creative story telling is not helped by the once again over-produced musical numbers by, Elfman. The the lyrics were impossible to understand (I had the same problem with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and quite frankly all the music Elfman does is starting to sound alike. It is one thing to have a style. It is another to have it difficult to tell what music was from what film. I think Burton needs to reel in Elfman a bit and start setting more of a vision for the music. From what I have read, Burton is giving Elfman freedom to pretty much do what he wants. It is showing. The creative team once joined at the brain are starting to clash. It began a few films ago. Hmmmm. There is always the option (and maybe a positive creative challenge for Burton)to find someone new to score his films.<br/><br/>I love Burton films. Not each and everyone is a great film but I have found something in all of them I liked enough to usually view them a few more times. In this particular Burton outing there was nothing making it worth watching more than once. It would have been nice to get the originality you usually get from a Burton film (good or bad) in the 'Corpse Bride' instead of this old imagery we have seen way too much."
"markgorman","4","3","7","2 November 2005"," A nightmare before Christmas...
","This is not really very good at all. I don't understand all these rave reviews. What went wrong? A Nightmare before Christmas is funny; has great music - also by Danny Elfman I believe; the story is delightfully subversive and the animation brilliant.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the good news. The animation in Corpse Bride remains excellent. Particularly the use of highly chromatic grading in the ""dead world"" contrasting deathly grading in the living world.<br/><br/>In every other respect it is ponderous (in the extreme) in fact I fell asleep. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe it was just plain dull. Maybe both.<br/><br/>But the truth is the story is no more than a tissue (it might have made a nice short) and the gags mostly lame and you could see them coming a mile off.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman surely trotted this one off in his lunch hour. Possibly his worst soundtrack ever and in any case there wasn't that much for him to do.<br/><br/>It's funny because the new Wallace and Gromit's a bit overrated too (but a lot more entertaining and far better scripted than this.) A project I feel. Not a passion. Sorry; I so wanted to like it too. So did my kids and they thought it was boring too."
"sjmcollins-1","5","3","7","15 October 2005"," Different doesn't equal better
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is another attempt at ""adult"" animation that falls short. It's a strangely uninvolving little film that features another barrage of unnecessary Hollywood voices, money wasted that could have been spent on better writers--well, it's a Tim Burton movie, so visuals are more the point here. The main character, Victor Van Dort, bears a passing resemblance to Johnny Depp-a little wasted in-joke that goes nowhere. The visuals take you in at some points, but the story itself is so blah that you stop caring about halfway through. Burton was on a 10 year roll through 1999, but the last 6 years have yielded one disappointment after another."

I love this movie, and plan to see it a lot before it crawls out of theaters. It's a favorite. It has great songs and the voices perfectly match the characters.<br/><br/>The story starts out with Victor Van Dort, the son of two fish merchants, who is to marry Victoria Everglott, the daughter of parents who are known to be rich, but secretly aren't, so they need their daughter to marry to avoid living the streets. They've never even seen each other before, which makes it interesting. But when Victor messes up their wedding rehearsal, he fleds to the woods and murmurs the wedding vows to himself. After he's got them down, he practices saying them aloud pretending the nature around him is his audience. But when he puts the ring on what he thinks is a stick, but is a finger, a corpse emerges from the ground and claims that she's legally he's bride. I shan't say anymore.<br/><br/>10/10. Tremendous.

She then whisks Victor to the land of the dead, and now Victor has to find his way out. Depp and Bonham Carter work their characters with magic and wonder.

I went to the theater with a group of people aged 17-22 and no one complained.<br/><br/>I love this story quite a lot. I like how everything works out alright in the end, though, considering it's a Brton film, there was some serious consideration for the possibility that victor may have ended up with Emily after all.

","Corpse Bride to me was the 2nd most anticipated movie of this year and it is better then anyone could expect. The mix of Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman and Tim Burton has had 2 successful movies this year and that includes this beautiful film. Helena Bonham Carter was the perfect choice to portray the Corpse Bride and Johnny Depp perfect as Victor, the timid main character. This film is not scary and though that's coming from a big fan of Tim Burton I know people who got scared of Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" that liked this movie and thought it was sweet so that's saying a lot. The plot is entertaining and the script was written very well. Some people are planning on comparing this to The Nightmare Before Christmas, listen, there is no comparison. Two totally different story lines and plots! In my opinion nothing can beat the Nightmare Before Christmas but this movie did come close.

"CountVladDracula","9","3","7","23 September 2005"," I absolutely LOVE Corpse Bride
","I have to say I love Corpse Bride. It is the best Tim Burton film I've seen made in at least five years. It's not as good as Nightmare before Christmas but it's better than his later moves after Sleepy Hollow.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful and the jokes are cute and random and though many were 'borrowed' from The Beetlejuice animated series I feel this is okay because that cartoon aired sixteen-years-ago and was made by Tim Burton, whom made this film.<br/><br/>The score was not Danny Elfman's best. It does not compare to Nightmare before Christmas or Edward Scissorhands but it is still beautiful, nevertheless. The songs aren't as good, by far, as Nightmare before Christmas but Remains of the day is very catchy. The character Emily (the corpse Bride) has a beautiful voice, too bad she only sings two verses in the song Tears to Shed.<br/><br/>The film is charming and has some heart warming moments. It treats death as nothing you should be afraid of. It's more of a celebration of life like the Mexican day of the dead. A child could watch this film without being too scared, they may take it like a faery tale. <br/><br/>I think this is the best film I've seen made in a long time. It was very refreshing and heart warming. <br/><br/>One thing that bothered me was that someone had told me that it's only implied that a certain character was Emily's killer. It was obvious to me that this person was her killer. And he practically told us directly that he was going to kill Victoria too. I enjoyed what became of Emily's killer though I will not spoil it, nor will I reveal who he is.<br/><br/>The characters of Victoria's parents are frustrating and offensive. Her mother refused to let the poor girl learn how to play the piano because it was 'improper' and 'too passionate'. Hopefully Victor will teach her. Also when she told her family that Victor was dragged off by a dead woman no one believed her and she was even locked in her room with the windows boarded up. <br/><br/>The characters of Victor and Emily are adorable. The ending is sweet and comforting. The dead are unintimidating (except to those who deserve it) and are quite friendly.<br/><br/>The opening scene ties in perfectly with the ending if you know how it ends. <br/><br/>References to earlier Tim Burton works: <br/><br/>Victor is mistakenly called Vincent once by Victoria's father. Vincent was Tim Burton's character from a stop motion film he did for Disney years ago and later appeared as Prince Vince on the animated Beetlejuice series. <br/><br/>The cat (Percy) that appeared in Vincent, Beetlejuice the animated series and Nightmare before Christmas also appears in this film but I only saw him for a moment and he looked to be missing his fur or now orange. <br/><br/>The skeletons had a xylophone band as Jack Skllington's children were to have according to the Nightmare before Christmas soundtrack. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp was a voice and he has starred in five Tim Burton movies.<br/><br/>The man who voiced the Nepoleon skeleton was the Oompa Loompa in Charlie and the chocolate factory. <br/><br/>Danny Elfman (whom has done the scores for every Tim Burton movie except Ed Wood) was the voice of Bonejangles, a singing skeleton. He was also the singing voice of Jack Skellington in Nightmare before Christmas, along with other characters.<br/><br/>Nepoleon Bonesapart also appeared in the episode Summer Vaction of the Beetlejuice animated series.<br/><br/>Like Sally the rag doll of Nightmare before Christmas Emily goes to pieces and sometimes the pieces remain active.<br/><br/>My favourite remembered jokes in the film:<br/><br/>Victor: 'Get back! I have a... dwarf. And I'm not afraid to use him!'<br/><br/>Maggot: 'If I wasn't just sitting in it I'd say you've lost your mind.'<br/><br/>Widow: 'You died fifteen-years-ago!' Skeleton lover: 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.' (Takes her in his arms and makes out with her)"

","I KINOW Burton can do better - this is what disappoints me most! The characters are uninteresting and really lifeless; even the living dead are really and truly dead. The Musical-Style with the singing makes things even worse. If Burton wants to copy Disneycartoons with singing and dancing,he should do so - if he wanted to make fun of them, he failed. The figures are not nice enough to enjoy looking at them - and they're not ugly enough to be interesting. I felt like looking at an introduction to a computer adventure and longed for a ""skip intro"" button all the time. ""Corpse Bride"" is not at all funny, not at all exciting, not even romantic or Kitsch... it's a pure waste of time for everybody who is over 10 years old. Even the kids will love ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" or ""Mars Attacks"" much more, I bet (like I did)! I really love animations, this is not the reason, but there are much better films than this one. The best I can say for this movie is: ""It does no harm"". Very disappointing!"

"NoGloryFx2000","2","4","11","30 October 2005"," not as good as people say
","When Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Danny Elfman get together, it's usually a great movie in the making. Sadly, this time around the new stop action animated film the Corpse Bride, fails to live up to anything they've done before. The movie starts out with an annoying and dull musical number about how Victor (Johnny Depp) is about to be wed to Victoria (Emily Watson) in a marriage arranged by both of the parents. Victors parents (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) are rich and Victoria's parents (Johanna Lumley and Albert Finney) are poor, and are hoping to make some money off of the marriage. Things start going wrong when Victor's is overcome by shyness and he just can't get his vows right and ends up having to go into the woods to practice them. This ends up being a bad idea when he places a ring a ""twig"" that turns out to be a skeletal finger sticking out from the ground and as luck would have it, he is now officially married to the corpse bride, even though he has fallen in love with Victoria. This leads to a couple different events to happen throughout the movie. Are they worth watching? No, they aren't and the movie just gets more boring with every scene. Even at an hour and 14 minutes, it still seems like the movie is lasting forever. The music isn't even as amazing as other Danny Elfman composed films. With only about 3 musical scenes, that do nothing but bore and annoy, except for a couple exciting lines by a skeleton from the underworld, Bonejangles. The story itself for the movie is nothing special or surprising, even though not predictable, it just isn't very exciting to sit through. The film wasn't all bad and full of boredom. There were some perks to the movie. The beautiful animation is great to watch and the colors and awkward looking people with their long arms are just amazing to watch. All the voice acting is amazing to, and the voices show great signs of emotion and are superb. Besides these things, they can't save the movie from being a total borefest. I'm not a fan of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", but I'd stick to this movie instead of seeing the Corpse Bride. This movie is a movie with a bad, boring story line thats nice to look at."

"hXcGeek","4","4","11","28 September 2005"," This film was mediocre...
","Let me start with what was good about this film. It was visually beautiful, as was already evident in the previews. The music was stirring and fun, as is to be expected from Danny Elfman. And, of course, the overall feel was delightfully morbid. Everything I expected.<br/><br/>The problems begin with how cheap and predictable the story was. I knew the entire story about a half-hour in. Really, the opening was quite gripping, and then after that it felt forced. ""Forced"" is the perfect word, too. It was like they were trying so hard to recreate the success of Nightmare Before Christmas that they lost the inspiration which made that movie great. The other gigantic problem was that there was only one 3-dimensional character in the whole movie. That was, of course, the title character, Emily. She was interesting. Both Victor (the main character) and Victoria (the love interest) were (though rather nice people) completely lacking in depth. They were so 2-D I had a very difficult time relating to either of them. Perhaps if the film had been a bit longer (It was only 76 mins), there could have been more time dedicated to character development. Outside of the three principles, every single character wasn't a character at all but a one-dimensional characterization. I was just plain bored with all the characters in this film.<br/><br/>Regardless of how visually appealing a film is, what makes a film great is an engrossing story. Great stories transport us to other places, into the heads of interesting people, and they teach us things about ourselves and the world. The Nightmare Before Christmas was one such story. It was groundbreaking and beautiful, that's why it captured our attention. But it was a really great story, and that's why it captured our hearts. This film was not such a story.<br/><br/>All in all, this film's worth a rental, or a viewing at your local theatre. But it's got no value after you've seen it once. Tim Burton has very much let me down. That's three films he's added to my crap-list, now (this, along with Batman Returns and Planet of the Apes)."

","No gorgeously scene, no handsome characters. In the dark camera lens, black and white becomes the theme. The moving wending vows, the family interest marriage.

When the grandson ran into the grandpa's arms, relationship, friendship and love connected the two words.<br/><br/>I like this movie every much that I can't express my feeling.

During a wedding, I saw the features of the human and I think what people will I meet in my life and what kind of people I show be?

","One of the things I like about this movie is that you can relate to the characters as if they were real. Most people read the title ""Corpse Bride"" and think that it's going to be some creepy, Gothic, scary, (you get the idea) movie that is not OK for children, but once you actually see it for yourself, you will soon realize that it is an adorable love story with great voices, animation, and characters.<br/><br/>Another great part of this movie is the animation. People these days are getting so used to computer animation that when they see stop-motion, the first thing they think about are all the flaws in the movie. To me, that is the beauty of it. Everything you see is man-made by artists and craftsmen. It's awesome."

","""Corpse Bride"" is a film by Tim Burton, who made most of his fans by impressing them with ""Nightmare before Christmas."" So, to put some extra cash in his pocket, he came out with ""The Corpse Bride."" Like most Burton films, ""Corpse Bride"" stars Johnny Depp. This time, he plays Victor, a soon-to-be husband of Victoria. Of course, he comes from a rich family, and the parents are making him marry for money. However, he can't quite master the wedding ritual. Instead of simply saying ""I do"" the ritual is long and quite difficult to remember. Anyways, while Victor is practicing the ritual in the woods, he slips the ring onto what he thinks is a stick, but it's actuallythe corpse bride! So, they get married, and Victor tries to find a way out of it.<br/><br/>This film was a lot like Burton's previous work ""Nightmare before Christmas."" Here are some similarities: <br/><br/><ul><li>The main character is male and regrets something. Jack (""Nightmare"") is tired of celebrating Halloween over and over, while Victor is ashamed he can't do the wedding properly.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Both main characters have a pet dog that happens to be dead.</li></ul><br/><br/>-Both are in love with/going to be married to a disobedient daughter who often escapes out of her room.<br/><br/>-The song with the spider and the worm sounded very similar to one of the ""Nightmare before Christmas"" songs.<br/><br/>-Both have dead people, clay animation and music.<br/><br/>The visual and sound is stunning. The stop-motion animation was excellently used, and one of the best parts of the movie. The living and dead are almost vice-versa, because the living world is boring and the dead world is colorful. The sound is excellent. The songs are reduced to about three, but they sound pretty good.<br/><br/>But, that's the flaw. The main reason I enjoyed ""Nightmare"" was the music. I remember singing some of the songs by the time the film was over. This one had about three songs, and was lacking any background music when needed. Remember that this was supposed to appeal to ""Nightmare before Christmas"" fans? Well, I don't know why people would like it as much if it had no music.<br/><br/>Music is what brought the dead to life, and what made the film fun. ""Corpse Bride"" looks slow and short, and tries to fill in the little story it has into 80 minutes. It started in the boring living world and never seemed to get away from it.<br/><br/>Good: Visuals, some good songs (even if there are only a few), funny at times<br/><br/>Bad: Only a few good songs, seemed boring, similar to ""Nightmare before Christmas""<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."
"pocca","8","2","4","3 December 2005"," Death Becomes Her
","Just your average boy meets girl, boy meets corpse, girl nearly loses boy to corpse story. The story begins in a vaguely Victorian London in which everyone and everything is in muted shades of grey, mauve and blue that suggest, well, a corpse. The wonderful irony underlying this film is that after Victor is spirited away by the vampish corpse bride, the land of dead turns out to be as full blooded and colourful as the land of the living is wan and repressed. The underworld is also the setting of a number of great sight gags that recall Beetlejuicemy favourites are the Napoleonic soldiers with cannon ball sized holes in their torsos (you can see the wine running down after it's been swallowed) and the jittery severed head (French, of course).<br/><br/>Considering how rollicking this underworld is, the ending in which Victor decides to return to the world above is inevitably a bit disappointing. There's a predictable conservatism to so many of these films in which an ordinary hero or heroine is offered a glimpse of some fantastic alternative world only to opt for everyday reality after all (Splash, the mermaid picture from the eighties with Daryl Hannah and Tom Hanks, is the only exception I can think of offhand to this general rule). I also found Emily's fate (she metamorphoses into a flock of butterflies) somewhat of a letdown as its sentimentality doesn't really match up with the jazzy black comedy tone of the rest of the film. If Emily was in fact stranded in limbo until Victor came along, the company of her cheerfully decomposing pals made it a jolly sort of limbowhy not let Emily go back there if she couldn't have Victor? <br/><br/>Still, these are relatively minor objections, and on the whole The Corpse Bride is one of the most unexpected, interesting films of 2005."

"Monotreme02","8","2","4","27 October 2005"," An inspired, beautiful tale of melancholy romance
","Acclaimed director Tim Burton's latest venture into the world of stop-motion animation, a world with which he has long been acquainted with, is an inspired, beautiful tale of melancholy romance. Don't let the creepy title of this macabre musical throw you off. Granted, this kind of film may not be for all tastes, but if you can get past the ghoulish appearance of the film and are game for a wondrous, haunting world of fantasy and love, then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Although deriving from a relatively simple screenplay by John August, Pamela Pettler and Caroline Thompson, Corpse Bride showcases characters that are well etched and constructed, and that are able to form a very strong, emotional bond with the audience. We truly feel for Emily, the Corpse Bride, whose heart was broken once before and is threatened to be broken again, by Victor, who wants to leave the World of the Dead and return to his love, Victoria. We sympathize with Victoria who, while waiting for her true love Victor to return, is being forced to wed another man by her desperate parents. And we feel for Victor, of course, for having to face this awful dilemma and choose one of the two brides. While I won't give away the conclusion, I will mention that the film's finale is one of the most beautiful scenes I've seen in an animated film. The final shot is a wondrous, memorable end, reminiscent of the melancholy ends of some of Disney's greatest films.<br/><br/>The animation is, of course, top notch. It is virtually seamless, fluent and full of motion and energy. The characters and figures move as in real life. The animators have clearly put a lot of effort into even the tiniest of details, such as the billowing of the Corpse Bride's dress, or the way her and Victor's hair move when they walk or swing their heads. The characters themselves are beautifully designed, every character having distinct traits that truly define it. Much detail has gone even into the tiniest background character. It is certainly a giant leap from the Rankin-Bass Christmas specials of the 1960s, or Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion monsters, which influenced Burton to begin work with stop-motion animation in the first place. It is even a technical leap from The Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton's previous feature-length stop-motion masterpiece, from 1993. What's for sure, Corpse Bride is a beautiful rebuke to the current trend of 3D computer animation, started by Pixar in 1995 with Toy Story.<br/><br/>The voice work is also excellent. Johnny Depp (Victor) tones down his usual eccentric acting and delivers a simple, quiet, innocent performance in a perfect British accent. Helena Bonham Carter (The Corpse Bride), Burton's fiancé for four years now, also delivers a wonderful performance, and proves her singing talents as she sings her heart out in one of the musical numbers. The other cast members, including Emily Watson (Victoria), Albert Finney (Finnis Everglot, Victoria's father), Tracey Ullman (Nell Van Dort, Victor's mother) and Christopher Lee (Pastor Galswells) to name a few, are quite effective at bringing their characters to life.<br/><br/>As with The Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton and his art and set design team paint two distinctly different worlds in the film, both an amazing visual achievement and absolutely gorgeously designed. In The Nightmare Before Christmas, these two worlds are Halloween Town and Christmas Town. In Corpse Bride they are the World of the Living and the World of the Dead. Ironically, it is the World of the Dead that is colorful and lively, while the World of the Living is painted in austere, lifeless mutes of gray. With the World of the Living, Burton paints a Victorian Nightmare, a pale, lifeless, Gothic wonderland with muted colors bordering on gray-scale and large, somber, cold yet beautifully dark set pieces. Such design is by now considered a trademark of Burton, and is expected of him after appearing in his previous films such as Edward Scissorhands, the two Batman films, and Sleepy Hollow. The other world, the World of the Dead, is livelier, the sets full of color and crammed with detail and character. In the World of the Dead, the design team create a colorful world of decaying flesh, decomposition, and a wonderful, merry good time of singing and dancing. The decaying yet colorful characters, figures and streets are absolutely brilliantly designed.<br/><br/>The music is yet another element of this film to praise. Danny Elfman, longtime collaborator of Tim Burton's (he scored all of Burton's films from his first and up until this one, except for Ed Wood), continues his trend of writing and performing songs for Burton's movies (he has previously done so for The Nightmare Before Christmas and, recently, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). His nifty little songs are really quite enjoyable, the highlight of them being a song titled ""Remains of the Day"", a pure, jazzy number Elfman clearly enjoyed composing  he even sang the song himself. As expected, the musical score of the film, aside from the songs, is powerfully atmospheric and reaches peaks of true composing brilliance at times. <br/><br/>To sum it all up, Corpse Bride is whimsical but eerie, funny but melancholy. If The Nightmare Before Christmas was a Christmas-tainted pop number, Corpse Bride is a waltz  an elegant, romantic, melancholy tale, an ode to love and sacrifice. This film doesn't only have everything I look for in an animated film, but also everything that I look for from a Tim Burton film. I'm convinced that, with time, this film will become a classic like The Nightmare Before Christmas. It's an instant classic in my book, a surefire contender for being crowned the Best Animated film of the year, and a film like nothing else at the movies these days."
"ashmoors","9","2","4","22 October 2005"," My Corpse Bride Review
","I went and saw this movie on the opening night in the UK (last night...) And it is one excellent film! The storyline isn't quite up to ""The nightmare before Christmas"", but the animation is much smoother and subtle than Nightmare. The characters expressions are probably the closest you could ever get in stop-motion (i.e. Almost perfect), and a lot of the time, the character's expression tells you exactly what they are thinking. How they managed to animate the skeletons perfectly I have no idea, but I know that they would never have attempted it on nightmare!<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, there are only three or so CG shots, these are (Sort-of Plot spoiler following) the smoke that the driver breathes out, the rain splattering on the buildings, and the butterfly shots (Opening Scene and Closing Scene... I won't ruin that for you!)<br/><br/>If you haven't been and seen this film... What are you doing?! Run to your nearest cinema now! (Finish reading my review first!)<br/><br/>Corpse Bride is definitely a come-back for Burton, after the sentimental Big Fish and sickly-sweet Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. I'd say this film isn't better than Nightmare, but it's certainly as good as, with lots more visual jokes and humour, but it's let down slightly by the linear plot. Apart from that it's great!"
"GothicZM","Null","2","4","13 October 2005"," Another Fantastic Movie by Tim Burton
","In 1993, writer/director Tim Burton brought to the big screen the world's first full-length stop motion animated film, the Nightmare Before Christmas. Both critics and audiences around the world loved the movie. It is apparent that, in modern film-making, computer animation has become the popular animation style among filmmakers, and with it comes horrible movies like Robots and Shark Tale. It seemed as if the great method of shooting miniature models frame by frame, moving them just a little in between each shot, to give the impression of movement had been eliminated from the big screen. Luckily, Tim Burton is still around and still making films. Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is the most visually astounding and emotionally touching movie of the year. Featuring the voice talents of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Albert Finney, and Christopher Lee, with music written and composed by Danny Elfman. The Oscar for best-animated film of 2005 belongs in only one place, in Tim Burton's hands.<br/><br/>Set in 19th century England, the film begins with Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) and his parents (Paul Whitehouse, Tracy Ulman) on a way to a wedding rehearsal for him and Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), his planned to be future wife, the daughter of a loveless rich couple (Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney) who is quickly losing their riches. Victor completely botches the rehearsal and is instructed by Pastor Galswells (Christopher Lee) to learn his vows. He wanders off into the forest and begins practicing. After failing repeatedly, he manages to recite his lines perfectly, using the surrounding environment as props. For the final line, he drops down onto his knees, places his ring on the roots of the nearby oak tree sticking out of the ground, and says, ""I ask you to be mine."" As the crows caw above, and the wind begins to pick up, Victor's arm is pulled into the ground, and he learns the terrifying truth. He had not put his ring onto the roots of a tree, but onto the bones of a dead woman's arm. He watches the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) emerge from the ground, accepting Victor's marriage proposal. She brings Victor back to the land of the dead, where the dead are more alive than the living. As Victor tries to explain to the Corpse Bride that their marriage was nothing but a ""grave misunderstanding"", Victoria attempts to find a way to help him back in the land of the living.<br/><br/>What truly makes the movie great is not the brief comedic moments, or intense action scenes (which it had none of). What makes this movie great is the characters. The conflicts presented between them, their emotions, their struggles, its all presented almost perfectly in this movie. The way Victor is caught between a living woman that he feels he must be with at all times, and a dead woman that he cannot bare to see unhappy and alone. Its just so believable and will actually make many viewers feel sad and depressed, especially at the very end. This sad and depressed feeling is aided by an amazing score by Danny Elfman. The score throughout the movie really captures the mood and setting. Right from the beginning, with a song that expresses the joy of the Van Dort family, and the anger, sadness, and frustration of the Everglots, all the way to the depressing score at the very end that expresses Emily's feelings. The characters and Danny Elfman's score is what truly makes this movie great. It actually had me feeling bad at several moments, which usually never happens.<br/><br/>If there is anything about the movie that brings it down, it is the fact that it is way too short. Because its stop motion animation and it takes about a whole week to shoot only one minute of film, the movie only comes to a total of 76 minutes in length. There is one major casualty because of this, and its not Victor or Emily, its Victoria. So much of the story is based around Victor and his problem, that Victoria only gets a few entrances every once in a while, and this makes people dislike Victoria. We do not get to see what kind of personality she has, her talents, and any kind of similarity she shares with Victor. This makes a lot of people not care for her. If the movie could have gone about 20 minutes longer, they could have spent a little more time building the relationship of Victor and Victoria, but that would require a few more months of filming. Despite this little problem, the rest of the movie is beautiful. The visuals, the score, the acting, the directing, the story, all of them top notch.<br/><br/>As far as animated films go, the Corpse Bride is one of the best. Better than Tim's first stop motion film, Nightmare Before Christmas, better than Disney's Lion King, better than Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and better than Wallace and Gromit. As far as emotionally touching movies go, this one really gets the job done. The kids can enjoy the childish humor while the teens and adults can enjoy the adult humor, and situations. So sit down and enjoy one of the best movies of the year. The movie that deserves the best-animated film of 2005 award.<br/><br/>Overall = 10/10 <br/><br/>Favorite Scene = (Spoiler) It is truthfully impossible for me to pick a favorite scene. The whole movie is good. The best parts though, are just about all the scenes with Victor and Emily together. Especially the scene when they go back into the land of the living where Emily begins gliding around the trees, around Victor, humming quietly at the same time, and the scene when Victor attempts to work things out with Emily after telling her that he would never marry her. While trying to explain things to her, he begins playing the piano with her in a nice duet."

","This films is truly a immediate classic, plus it's so beautifully made, well organized, and just the best. Even though Tim Burton has made some dark films in the past, this a truly less dark. The story is based in France or England where a shy young man, Victor (Depp), is going to be married. His fiancé is Victoria (Watson) a pretty nice girl who has the meanest parents. At the rehearsal of their wedding, Victor is so nervous, he forgets all his vows. So they cancel the rehearsal till he learns and remembers them. One point, he is in the night of the forest, practicing them. He has the ring with him. He finishes his vows correctly, then puts the ring on a twig as if he were putting it on Victoria's finger. But by doing that, the twig was a rotten finger, thus he resurrects the beautiful but dead Corpse Bride. She is now his legal wife! He is terrified for a few days but starts to get used to her. Even though she's dead, she loves him. But Victor is worried about Victoria, who he should have married. What will happen to Victoria? What will happen to Victor? What will happen to the mysterious but lovely Corpse Bride? This is really an exciting story, it's a little grim but lots of fun. Well, I recommend you see it if you like ghost stories. But this is for all ages, kids will love it I bet. There's lots of singing (which is fantastic), dancing (skeletons actually dance), and well-picked actors for this movie. Back to music, Danny Elfman did an amazing job, the music is grim but so fantastic. It's really a wonderful film! Tim Burton did an amazing job on this one, its such a classic already!"

Victor Van Dort using the voice of Johnny Depp and Victoria Everglot with the voice of Emily Watson are meeting for the first time only days before their wedding. Both have suspicions of one another which are demonstrated by Victor's inability to say his vows during their wedding rehearsal. This uncertainty causes Victor to stumble into the woods and change his fate forever.<br/><br/>While perfecting his vows, Victor unknowingly slips a ring upon another's finger resulting in a marriage between himself and the corpse bride played by Helena Bonham Carter. From here the plot thickens and the magic continues to unravel.<br/><br/>The animation in this movie is spectacular - it could almost be described as life-like if most of the characters were not dead. It is apparent through both the Corpse Bride and Tim Burton's last spooky computer animated movie The Nightmare Before Christmas that skeletons hold a special place in his fantasy world.<br/><br/>The skeletons in Corpse Bride are very realistic and eerie. The recent dead appear a pale blue, those that have been deceased for a longer period of time have begun rotting away showing their skeletal interiors and those that have been dead for a while are nothing but bones.<br/><br/>This movie is PG for some creepy scenes and frightening scenarios which might scare younger children and those faint at heart. However, this is a great film for everyone - not just children, families and Burton fanatics.<br/><br/>Overall the Corpse Bride deserves three out of four stars. Tim Burton's wild imagination has proved magical once again. The Corpse Bride is not as mesmerizing as The Nightmare Before Christmas, but definitely worth adding to your DVD collection."

When the tale is finished it becomes obvious which choices have taken the higher moral road and lead to ultimately more satisfying conclusions -- and often those which would not.<br/><br/>While my own personal enjoyment of the film was probably around a 6 or 7 level, I rated this at an 8 because I think it will become a timeless classic.

The claymation (or whatever) characters were ""over the top"" caricatures but fit their roles.

","By now I think most of us can agree that the two main contenders for best animated feature are Corpse Bride and Wallace and Gromit. Both films are great, but my pick would be Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of both The Nightmare Before Christmas and the Wallace and Gromit shorts since I was a child, so judging between the two has been no easy task. Ultimately, however, I chose Corpse Bride. I just can't ignore the amazing animation, acting, and of course, Mr. Elfman's amazing score, as usual. In many ways, it surpasses Wallace and Gromit tremendously.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride did have its flaws, mainly in the story. This movie is only 80 minutes. Ridiculously short, but understandable for a movie that uses a filming process so excruciatingly slow and painful. But because of its short length, at times the story seems rushed, particularly about fifteen minutes in, when Victor first meets the Corpse Bride. The entire sequence just felt to me as though both writer and director were trying to speed things along, and you never want to feel this way when you're watching something. You want it to go at an even pace. Not too slow, and not too fast.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Will you like it? Hard to say. It's brilliant, and Oscar-worthy, but that doesn't mean that everyone will like it. I'd say if you've seen anything with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, or Danny Elfman in it, then you should see this movie and you will probably like it. If you haven't, then you need to watch the trailer a couple of times and decide for yourself if it looks good. The trailer is very helpful, I promise. And F.Y.I, Danny Elfman wrote the opening for The Simpsons, and that definitely counts."

"FloatingOpera7","10","2","4","4 October 2005"," From The Maker of Nightmare Before Christmas: Another Winner
","Tim Burton intended Corpse Bride to be a follow-up to 1993's Nightmare Before Christmas. Indeed, there are echoes of the skeletal creatures frm Nightmare in this one too. But he waited a full 12 years to perfect the cinematography/stop animation to this wonderful film. Ultimately, Nightmare Before Xmas is superior in that it has better comedy, memorable songs and more interesting a story. However, Corpse Bride holds his own, and not merely because of the lavish details in every scene. Johnny Depp stars as Victor Van Dort, a pale-faced, thin and shy young man who is betrothed to marry Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson). The marriage is arranged between the bourgeois, social climbing nouveauriche Van Dorts, Victor's parents (Tracy Ulman and Paul White House) and Victoria's folks Maudelaine and Finnis (Joanna Lumely and Albert Finney). These folks are equally pale but worse, they're dull, pretentious and snobbish. Victor accidentally places the wedding ring on the cold dead hands of the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) and is now faced with a dilemma: should he honor his vow to remain married to the dead bride or will he break them and marry the living fiancÃ© ? This is an enjoyable drama with comedy and Tim Burton has indeed done it again."
"Clutch8","9","2","4","3 October 2005"," Beautiful Film
","Always being impressed with Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, I did not know what to think of Corpse Bride. It seemed a little tone downed compared to a Nightmare before Christmas. However, this motion picture had stunning animation and a musical grip that left me in awe. The characters were so believable that during the show I forgot it was animated. The voice acting was perfect, the humor was appropriate and hilarious, yet not as often as expected, because this was more of a romantic film than a comedy. I loved how they portrayed both the female characters and their status with Victor, and the conclusion to the story had me in tears. I had no idea it was going to be a musical, and while it could of contained more songs to reach a 10, I will definitely purchase this film on DVD, and thats the best complement I can give."

","Corpse Bride, is set in the early nineteenth century and is about a shy and timid young man named Victor Van Dort, who is being arranged to marry a young woman named Victoria Everglot. While they are rehearsing the wedding Victor, can't seem to get his vows right so he heads off into the woods and practices placing the wedding ring on a bony finger sticking out of the ground. To Victor's astonishment out comes a living corpse who now thinks that Victor and her are married. The corpse bride takes Victor, to live with her down under but Victor, wants to go back and marry Victoria, but at the same time he is in a bit of a situation because he also accidentally married the corpse bride. Winner of The Future Film Festival Digital Award for the film's directors Mike Johnson and Tim Burton at The Venice Film Festival. Corpse Bride, is a great looking film and I really liked the stop motion animation they did for the film. The film is also stylish and very neat to look at, is entertaining, creative, charming, very inventive and it plays out like a fairy tale with a lot of macabre humour but is appropriate enough for younger viewers. Corpse Bride, sometimes looks and feels like The Nightmare Before Christmas, because of similar animation, style and music but on it's own this is still a good film which is visually fascinating and has a sweet story that I think will appeal to those both young and old. I have been a big fan of Tim Burton's for a long time and I think there is a very good chance that this film will be nominated at next year's Oscars for Best Animated Film, and I think it has a very good chance of winning because although I haven't seen any of the other animated films that have come out this year so far, this one has been the highest rated so I'd say it has really good chances and I would personally for one really like to see Tim Burton win an Oscar."

Don't get me wrong Nightmare Before Christmas is awesome it's actually my favorite movie of all time, but there will never be another Nightmare Before Christmas.

","Written perfectly with some of the most impressive special effects I've seen in the past 30 years. One of the most well made movies ever, not just animated movie, it has a strong cast, strong direction in the hands of Tim Burton and Mike Johnson and an intriguing story. Having come off Planet of the Apes, Burton had to really make a great movie and he proved he could, a future masterpiece and deserves a far higher score on IMDB.<br/><br/>This and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory came out the same year, Chocolate Factory was more of a movie for fans of the book and not the original movie, it was not a reboot or a remake, it was a re-imagining and in my opinion, as a die-hard fan of the book, it was much better than the original and I pretty sure plenty of the other hundreds of thousands fans of the book felt the exact same way.<br/><br/>This is a gothic masterpiece and is quite possibly my favourite all-time movie, not just animated. It's a creative, creepy movie that I respect so dearly and forever will, because of how it shaped my childhood, like most of Burton's work. It is the greatest film of 2005, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a very close second. In every way, this film is perfect, I picked up absolutely zero flaws watching this. It's hilarious, sad, depressing, dark, happy and literally everything else you could think of.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's character, Victor, basically is an awkward individual who is getting married to a total stranger played by Emma Thomas (Victoria) and he goes into the woods and practises how he is going to propose to Victoria by putting a ring on a supposed stick of wood, only to find out that it is the hand of a skeleton portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter. This film is a story of life and death and life beyond death.<br/><br/>Victoria is forced by her parents to marry Lord Barkis played by Richard E. Grant, which is where a massive fight breaks loose at the end of the film. It is absolutely hilarious! My favourite line being, ""There's an eye in me soup."""

","Breathtaking animated beauty! Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is put under an arranged marriage by his parents with the similarly shy and sweet Victoria Everclot (Emily Watson). When Victor practices his vows alone in the woods, he inadvertently raises The Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) back from the dead, who believed he did in fact marry her. The idea was inspired by a 19th century poem and here there's a really fun contrast in the way the Land Of The Dead is represented in a vibrant party atmosphere and full of life as opposed the living who are dull and grey in comparison. Written by two of Tim's greatest collaborators John August (Big Fish, Frankenweenie), Caroline Thompson (The Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands) and Burton newcomer Pamela Pettler (9, Monster House) the script is beautifully kind-hearted and with a great balance of dark gallows humour and just plain funny lines delivered brilliant by the cast who are all distinctively grand! Visually it is astonishingly gorgeous, with trademark gothic sensibilities photographed by Pete Kozachik and a very talented film crew. The animation team are all individually very talented artists as seen in behind the scenes footage and the painstaking attention to detail is amazing. Most wonderfully, it features some of Danny Elfman's best work and a musical score that is heartachingly romantic and exciting; Victor's piano solo really struck an emotional chord for me at the age of 12 and it still does to this day"

","This movie is so sweet and the art style is to die for (pun intended)<br/><br/>There are a few flaws, the villain is one dimensional and cheesy, the main protagonist is a bit empty, and the romance is a bit forced. But that's all easy to forgive when presented with the adorable characters, moving songs, and hilarious moments.<br/><br/>Something else that makes this movie unique is the way it handles death. Death isn't presented as a horrible thing, and the afterlife isn't shown in any sort of religious or heaven/hell context, which is rare for most kids films that deal with the afterlife. Death in this movie is simply seen as a part of life, moving from one state of being to the next. The dead aren't angsty and sad, they're happy and living their lives in a different way than they were before.<br/><br/>The main character Emily however is where the movie truly shines. Her sweet and likable nature makes the movie so entertaining, as well as her slightly creepy but overall adorable design.<br/><br/>A great movie to put on for your kids!

","Make no bones about it, ""Corpse Bride"" is a classic stop-animation classic that will appease to both kids and adults alike. The technicalities are at its finest and the film has the right amount of ghouls and goth that has been a symbolic trait for director Tim Burton. And sure Burton does have an abundance of creative contributions to the movie, ""Corpse Bride"" was mostly given the directorial duties to animation director Mike Johnson. The age demographic for this movie will likely be for the twenty-something goths who set the mood for themselves as they await the young kiddies as they approach your doorstep as they trick-or-teat for candy.<br/><br/>Although the animation is crisp and the voice performances are spectacular, it's hard to pinpoint if they're principal target is towards kids and young adults. The settings emanate in an unorthodox surreal eternally dark atmosphere where it's foggy most of the day and the bright moonlight comes out at night. Our leading protagonist is a young man named Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) an introvert who lives with his overbearing rich parents Nell and William (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse). They had arranged for Victor to marry a charming young lady named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) whose aristocratic parents Maudeline and Finis (Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney) are now penniless.<br/><br/>The characters here all seem to have that eerie, pale-faced complexion to give them that look like they've spent their vacations in coffins. It's as though as if even the mortal characters look like corpses themselves before they get embalmed.<br/><br/>In spite of their morbid physiques, the main characters are as a whole mortals. Victor seems to be having cold feet about this fixed wedding as he wanders into the forest rehearsing about his wedding vows while he places the wedding ring on a tress branch where one of the twigs resembles a bony skeletal finger. Just like you would expect in a Gothic fable setting, from the Earth down below a corpse bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) materializes complete with a disheveled ragged wedding gown has now become his wife. Victor finds himself in a predicament as to how he he can annul the marriage or if she was the person he was intended to marry all along.<br/><br/>Victor and Emily journey their way into the land down under (not Australia) and it appears that the world down below the graves have more life than in the land of mortals. In Burton's warped mind, the afterlife is one big party where the skeletons grooving to some jazz music hotter than the devil's complete with eyeballs eerily shifting going from one socket to another. Emily herself is kind of a character with problems keeping her eyes together. In addition to that, there is a maggot living inside her head and has a striking impersonation of Peter Lorre.<br/><br/>Everyone seems inclined to the Danse Macabre Lite score along with some haunting tunes by Danny Elfman that seem to have a creepy backdrop that's more played for laughs. The fun scenes occur between the rich Van Dorts and the poverty stricken Everglots as each clan has suspicions for one another. William as a fishmonger makes good claims that his abode is larger than that of his supposed in-laws and that it;s quite ""chavvy"".<br/><br/>There's plenty of scenes to get you into the Halloween spirit with all the jazzy skeletons,rotting flesh, and a severed head that serves drinks. There's a fine balance that this movie possesses between the humour and freights. After the much bright and cheery success of ""Charlie and Chocolate Factory"", Burton decided to counteract his next project to something darker and more eerie all with great panache."

","The best thing about Tim Burton is his knack for writing stories so macabre but still filled with likability and creativity. Corpse Bride is witty, beautifully crafted and at times it makes you think a little more about honoring the dead instead of just letting them go as if nothing mattered.<br/><br/>It starts off as Victor van Dort is about to get married but is not very fond of the idea. When he later by mistake practices his vows on a dead woman he is dragged into the land of the dead and his life is turned upside down.<br/><br/>It seemed at first like a basic fish-out-of-water story, but as it progresses it evolves into both a cautionary tale of the consequences of letting loved ones down and a portrayal of forced marriages vs marrying for love.<br/><br/>It has all the Burton ingredients like Danny Elfman's talented music scoring, even though the songs weren't that memorable, and Johnny Depp as the lead role. And the crown on top is the recognicable design of the characters and the gothic setting. A fine addition to the Burton legacy."

","Corpse Bride is about what I'd imagine goes around in Tim Burton's mind in any given moment. It is a sweet fairy tale painted in macabre colours. A children's colouring book if the only colour available was grey. And, if you've liked Mr. Burton's other creative efforts, this is pretty much more of the same and thus well worth a watch.<br/><br/>The story follows a young man named Victor (Johnny Depp) who is about to marry a woman named Victoria (Emily Watson). He's out in the woods, practicing his vows, but happens to be overheard by the spirit of a dead woman, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who promptly decides that he was saying his vows to her and that they're now married.<br/><br/>It's not a bad story and fits the usual grim Tim Burton imagery well. It's at the same time gothic, melancholy and just the right kind of naive. The characters are pretty one-note overall, especially the parents, but that also fits this kind of narrative well. It's supposed to be exaggerated and somewhat childlike.<br/><br/>That being said, the film has some problems when it comes to style. Like, for example, the colour palate is about as grey as a coal mine. Even for Tim Burton. The underworld is a bit better in this regard, but not by much. The aforementioned land of the dead is also tonally jarring. The film begins as this heavily gothic Victorian affair, but then they drop into the underworld and suddenly the film is a jazz musical of all things. These two don't mix very well at all.<br/><br/>Still, I can't say I minded seeing the film. Not the best effort any of the involved people have produced, but it has its moments and is well worth a watch if you have it in you to watch yet another Tim Burton extravaganza."

","Review:
'Corpse Bride' is a British-American stop-motion animated dark-fantasy film directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton. I've seen parts of this movie multiple times but have never fully watched it through until now. If I am being honest, I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan and I can't really put my finger on why that is. His movies seem to be the same dark concept with different stories. Let's look at some movies that his name is under. We have 'Corpse Bride', 'Frankenweenie', and 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' and these are just his stop motion films. None have any gripping elements to bring viewers in to start watching it let alone continue through the runtime. However, out of all the Tim Burton stories ""Corpse Bride"" is one that I could see myself viewing again.
We start the movie out being introduced to Victor (Johnny Depp) and his odd mother and father. We learn that he is to be married to the daughter of a thought to be known wealthy family's daughter; Victoria (Emily Watson). When the rehearsal for the wedding goes awry, Victor sets off to the woods to practice his vows before the big day, only to become married to an undead bride when he places his ring on the corpse's finger, thinking it was a branch. Now, locked into the commitment of marriage to a dead woman named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) and trapped in the land of the undead, Victor must find away out of the marriage and look for a way back to the land of the living.
A big positive for this movie is the voice acting. It may not seem like a big deal, but having the wrong voice come out of a certain character could throw off the whole film and everybody in this movie did a fantastic job bringing their characters to life. Although, Helena Bonham Carter does such a great job giving her character personality you almost want Victor to end up with her at the end of the movie when I don't think that's the intention of Tim Burton.
I was also a fan of the musical choices in this movie. I thought it brought a much-needed energy to the overall story and was executed fully. The one thing that spoke most to me and what I thought was a brilliant concept was that fact that when the movie is in the land of the living it is very dark, and everybody looks miserable. When the movie is taking down in the land of the dead it is colorful, and everybody looks happy. Now, I don't believe that the movie is saying if you want to be happy be dead. It's just telling a realistic view on life, not everybody is happy, and maybe the dead are happy, and we shouldn't feel so scared about death when it comes.
Overall, this is classic Tim Burton and if you're a fan of his you will love this movie. It has a dark sense of humor and tell a story of death, love, and sacrifice.

In an attempt to practice his lines he accidetly proposes to a dead woman in the woods. Firstly disgusted by the fact that she is a rotting corpse he tries to escape her by running back to his living bride. He gets back to the world of the dead through his corpse bride and slowly starts to see her true colours. He is falling in love with her personality, ignoring the fact that she is still a corpse...<br/><br/>This movie is the perfect example, to prove that the old story sheme ,fall in love with the personality, not with the looking' isn't as dead as Victor's bride.
The film is beautifully made, heartwarming, emotional and funny, of course.<br/><br/>I would say that everyone can and will have fun with ,Corpse Bride'

","Tim Burton films are all very unusual and extravagant. His ""Corpse Bride"" is not an exception. This fantasy story is full of adventures. I like this film very much because of cute characters. They're like real people. Their features are the result of their past and the reason for their future.<br/><br/>The story begins in a small Victorian town. Victor Van Dort's parents want him to get married to young Victoria Everglot, whose parents are poor nobles. In fact, the Everglots don't like this idea very much, because Victor is a fish merchant. During the wedding rehearsal he forgets his vows so Victor goes away to learn them by heart. He repeats his word aloud and put the engagement ring on a branch of tree like if it's a finger of a bride. As you guess, that branch is a hand of a dead woman, who raises up and decides that Victor is her husband now.<br/><br/>The Overglot are worried about Victor's disappearing - they spent a lot of money on wedding and they can't postpone this event. Wait for a bit happy and a bit sad ending with unexpected turns.<br/><br/>I like it not only because of characters, but the atmosphere and the main idea. Setting is amazing - scaring, foggy and Gothic ( black ravens are included). The comparison of the underground world and the real one is also interesting. Alive people are greedy, gray and gloomy, and the dead ones are kind, merry and happy. That makes us to think: ""What's wrong with us and why are we worse than raised corpses sometimes?"" This film can fit every audience - skeletons and corpses are very funny and they aren't detailed."

Once in the world of the dead, Victor first tries to return, but after learning that Victoria is getting married, he decides to marry the dead.<br/><br/>When I watched this movie, I did not enjoy it. For me, as a bearer of Russian culture, it seemed too gloomy and, moreover, too trivial. A girl, who wants a wending with a beloved, who kills her; a young man, who occasional happened to be nearby and gave her hope... I think everyone knows such a story. The only thing that endows the film with at least some sense is people's thoughts of happiness.

","Presenting subjects which are typically dark and frightening and show them in a positive light has long been a trademark of Tim Burton. In the director's latest film, ""Corpse Bride"", Burton spins death and murder into a charming musical about the power of love. Burton applies the same technique as with his last stop-motion picture, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas, but with a more fluid and smoother effect. Lead by the vocal talents of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, ""Corpse Bride"" is a terrific achievement of film-making.<br/><br/>On the day of their wedding rehearsal, arranged lovers Victor (Johnny Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson) run into a complication with the ceremony: Victor cannot remember his vows. While practicing in the forest, Victor mistakenly places the ring on the finger of a dead woman (Helena Bonham Carter) and is immediately married to his new bride, Emily. While Victor searches for a way out of the underworld and back to Victoria, he learns of the devious plot of how Emily was murdered and experiences the beauty and charm that still resides in her. Victor must decide whom he loves more: his bride-to-be or his corpse bride.<br/><br/>The screenplay penned by John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson feels targeted for younger members of the PG audience.The title of ""Corpse Bride"" almost gives the wrong impression about the film. The movie is a love story albeit with a darkened twist. It is not meant to be frightening but rather it shows a peaceful and romantic co-existence between the living and the dead. Audiences will be fascinated with the seamless quality of the animation and the vocal talents that give the characters life."

","The Corpse Bride is a cartoon by Tim Burton. And that is very unusual cartoon. It contains death theme and love story and use puppet animation.

It was directed and produced by Tim Burton. The plot was written by John August and other talented people. The music, which was written by Danny Elfman, contributes to the atmosphere of this film.

We see two families from these layers of society that want to marry their children for themselves wants. But the hero, one of them, which is called Victor, accidentally become married the dead woman, which name is Emily. It sounds strange but interesting.<br/><br/>Setting can be understood only by adult people. But sometimes film is too childish. I really don't understand, which auditory the film aims at. What I didn't understand were Victor's actions. Every time, when he had a problem, he ran away. But only once he decided to do something important. Either he chose what he wants or writers made error in his personality. But it's not so bad on the background of many good elements of the film.<br/><br/>First of all, other characters were well drawn. I understand their actions. Also, you dive in the cartoon very deep and you can't get out: it has gripping plot, beautiful puppet animation and background music. I should say, is The Corpse Bride good or bad, but I don't know it. It is not awful and not perfect. But I think everybody would like this cartoon after watching."

","The cartoon ""Corpse Bride"" tells the story of the son of rich fish merchants Victor and his adventures. It's not a horror, but it has some elements of a fantasy. The cartoon is set in the Victorian era. Characters-dolls live in two divided worlds: the Land of the Living and The Land of the Dead.<br/><br/>The film has a quality cast. It begins when Victor Van Dort, stared by Johny Deep, and the daughter of impoverished aristocrats, Victoria Everglot, stared by Emily Watson, are preparing for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Van Dorts and restore the wealth of Everglots. Victor runs the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his words of the oath.<br/><br/>The film is full of thrilling moments and unexpected tums. The film was directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton. They were able to answer a lot of questions from viewers. And although the color scheme in the cartoon is quite gray, thanks to their ideas, the cartoon is very interesting. The musical accompaniment, created by Danny Elfman, made this picture more enchanting.<br/><br/>I recommend Copse Bride. You can immerse yourself in Victorian era, go to the Land of the Dead and enjoy beautiful music while watching this cartoon."

The ensuing drama is highly entertaining and can be watched over and again. The usual collection of memorable songs ensues and the finale is worthy of watching time and again. Even though the characters are mere cartoons the vocal acting is so superb that each character is believable and memorable. I confess that I regularly re-watch this film whenever times are 'blue' because it lightens my mood. This is among my favourite animated films.

","""Corpse Bride"" (2005) is a movie that will have your eyes constantly popping out of your head with amazement, similar to how the Corpse Bride's (Helena Bonham Carter) eyes constantly pop out of her own head during the movie. Director Tim Burton never fails to leave his audiences in awe with the fantastical nature of his films. With the incredible Expressionistic animation and hyperbolic appearances of the characters, the audience can't help but be engaged in the movie's exciting flow of the events. This film features Johnny Depp as Victor Van Dort and Emily Watson as Victory Everglot. Knowing Johnny Depp has any connection to a movie is already a good sign. It is the perfect movie to watch if you enjoy horror, comedy, and/or romance- Yes, this movie has it all! The film presents a depiction of the world that will not only have you reevaluating your daily life, but will also have you ""die"" laughing at its humor. This movie is perfect for getting you into the Halloween spirit, but is honestly enjoyable anytime of the year. I would recommend, so go out and watch!"
"sarahim-97170","8","0","0","9 November 2016"," Burton's Brilliance
","Who would've thought that an animated children's movie could depict the legend of the Faustian bargain without being horrifying for kids? Well, Tim Burton managed to do so in his film ""Corpse Bride"" (2005). Now, I'm not into scary films at all, even the slightest bit, but Burton impressed me with his inclusion of suspense and some scary elements through his inclusion of the land of the dead, while being able to tell a fantastic story of two young people and their rocky road to being wed because of their involvement with some characters from the land of the dead. <br/><br/>Set in a Victorian era village, Victor (Johnny Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson) are forced into marriage by their money-hungry parents. Burton's portrayal of the greedy parents of Victor and Victoria stand out in their physical features. They're given huge heads, probably to symbolize their self-importance and selfishness, which makes them look pretty funny in relations to their skinny, long limbs. Selfishness is a huge theme throughout this film and its displayed in an ugly, sad way, by being characteristics of people in the living world that is gray, lonely, and disconnected. Maybe Burton was also trying to teach kids how greed isn't a good quality to have? Kudos to him if he was trying to teach children through his film! <br/><br/>Burton's film was unexpected in so many ways, which we can see through the ironic differences in colors of the living and dead worlds, as well as the vibes and togetherness shown among st the characters. His decision to do so really brings out the themes he is trying to show to his audience, children and adults, of the greed we see in society, which many of us are guilty of, and how ultimately money and materialistic wants aren't worth much when you don't have people that you love, where we see some elements of the Faustian bargain coming into play. I guess that's kind of corny to say but it's true and Burton does an excellent job of showing this! Even if you aren't into children's animations and/or scary films that Burton is also known for, I highly recommend this film because he is honestly an artist when it comes to incorporating mature elements into kid's movies."

","Looking for a Halloween movie for the whole family to enjoy? Look no farther than Tim Burton's ""The Corpse Bride"" (2005). It's a film filled with romance, greed, murder, and musical numbers. Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter, staples of Burton films, play the timidly awkward Victor Van Dort and the corpse bride, Emily, respectively. Burton's films are a visual experience that blends the pastels of the 1950s with dark shades from the Victorian Era and this one is no different. Though his use of Claymation, Burton is able to exaggerate the character's physical features as well as make the living world seem dull and dreary while the world of the dead is colorful and fun. While the living tend to embody the worst of attributes, it is the living who have the best human qualities."

","The Corpse Bride (Tim Burton, 2005) is a classic Tim Burton movie. It has the expressionist over the top sets and strange character design that Burton seems to like so much. If you enjoy Tim Burton's other work, you would almost definitely enjoy this film. The Corpse Bride stars a young shy man named Victor who is to be married to a Lady Victoria Everglot, and along the way, he accidentally marries a corpse. This Corpse, named Emily, brings him into a world of the dead existing just below the living. Throughout the movie, Tim Burton really utilizes the freedom given by animation. So much so that a number of characters are just moving caricatures of what they represent. For example, the upper class, old money Lady Maudeline Everglot is more chin than face or her greedy husband Lord Finis Everglott is rounder and fatter than he is tall. All in all, this movie is highly entertaining and very enjoyable and I recommend it especially to people with small children as it is a movie the entire family will find enjoyable."

","Corpse Bride is half haunting horror and half wacky musical. The combo may sound strange, but director Tim Burton makes it work, as our heroes Victor (Johnny Depp) and Emily (Helena Boneham Carter) jump back and forth from the underworld and the land of the living. I normally don't like musicals, as the silly choreographed dancing and straightforward lyrics rarely add much to a movie, but there were certainly some redeeming qualities to this movie's show tunes. The swing jazz of the underworld had far more life than the cold hearts of our above ground antagonist (Richard Grant's Lord Barkis) and the uptight Everglots (Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney), and Emily's laments pulled at our heartstrings."

","In such a dull time full of ""new"" movies that simply repeat the same plot-line in vaguely different ways, ""The Corpse Bride"" stands out, and in a very good way! Not only is the plot something that I, personally, have never seen in another movie, the filmography is astounding, and Johnny Depp (Victor) is amazing as always.<br/><br/>Only Tim Burton could come up with something so original, so abstract, and so entertaining! Each character in the film is given a certain level of depth that is extremely important to the audience's understanding of the complexity of the ""situation"" Victor faces and sympathizing with almost every character. Not only was I left with mixed feelings about who Victor should be with (Emily or Victoria), I was left with a deep feeling of empathy for Emily, whom I originally thought was the ""villain"" in the film!<br/><br/>Furthermore, the filmography in this is classic Tim Burton. Expressionism clearly had a large impact on how Burton chose to direct this movie. The sets, as well as the characters, are abstract, angled, and unnatural. The characters have large, dark circles around their eyes and are pale and skinny. The colors of the Land of the Living are gray and monochromatic, while the underworld is lively, multi- chromatic, and bright; this is contrary to what one might expect (the underworld being dark and dreary and the living world bright and colorful). However, Burton uses these lighting and coloring techniques to convey the message that the living world is constrained by unloving parents, money, greed, death anxiety, and sophistication, while the underworld is care-free and the place to be!<br/><br/>In this way, Burton decreases the audience's death anxiety by showing that maybe life is not that great after all! Death is a party, and life is dull, so ""sign me up for a swig of poison!""<br/><br/>""The Corpse Bride"" is a must-see for anyone who likes a story with some depth and for those who enjoy animated films or Halloween films in general (so everyone). Tim Burton lived up to his reputation on this one, so trust me in saying that it will not disappoint!"
"leighkenyon15","10","0","0","12 October 2016"," A spectacular movie, a must-watch!
","Yesterday evening, while my parents were at bowling, I decided that I wanted to watch a movie instead of a TV episode. I had recently finished Sleepy Hollow (1999), a movie that I don't care for. The first two acts are good, but the third one is justeh. Either way, I decided to watch The Corpse Bride, which was listed as a 'similar movie'. I'd heard a lot about it, and I knew that it was one of Tim Burton's famous movies, but I don't know if I'd ever seen the whole thing before. Bits and pieces? Sure. And what did I have to lose for watching it? I never thought I'd have so much to gain.<br/><br/>I absolutely adore The Corpse Bride. It is a wonderful movie visually and story-wise, and it also has so much to provide under the surface. One of the things I found very interesting was that Victor (the main character) lived in a greyscale world—the world of the living. Everything was bleak, dull, materialistic. But the world of the dead, well, that was full of color, festivities and, ironically, life. There was also the small subplot revolving around how Victor's parents (who were poor) wanted him to marry rich, and they ended up choosing a rich family that had just gone bankrupt, but no one knew yet. And then the antagonist tries to marry the girl for the money as well, just as he had done to Emily/The Corpse Bride before. But in the world of the dead, there is no money. They only have each other, and it seemed to make such a huge difference. There was little to no sign of materialism in that world, and certainly no money. <br/><br/>Another part that I loved about the movie was just how hopeful it was. I really love Tim Burton's way of taking the dark and macabre and turning it into something whimsical and beautiful—something not as scary as one would normally believe. Just the visual style is good enough, but then you have how happy and kind the deceased are. When the dead come back to the world of the living to observe the ceremony between Emily and Victor, they confront the villagers, led by a tall and scary-looking skeleton. A little boy stares up at the skeleton. Everyone is waiting for the skeleton to attack. And then, with a little, hopeful smile on his face, the boy says: ""Grandpa?"" And the scary skeleton picks up the kid and hugs him, and all the other deceased start looking for their loved ones, who are all happy to see those they thought they had lost.<br/><br/>This movie made me want to start living again. It made me want to stop living in a dull, bleak world and starting enjoying it. I'm not particularly religious, so I'm not sure what will happen after we die, but we have to live this life to the fullest, right? And The Corpse Bride just hammered that into me. I hope it can do the same for others!"

Directed by Tim Burton, has a screenplay by Caroline Thompson, Pamela Pettler and John August, and the voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Albert Finney and Christopher Lee.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has a taste for strange and ""out of the box"" films, with unusual scenarios and bizarre characters. This is a well made script, with original ideas but functional, where everything fits as it should be. The selected voices belong to actors who usually collaborate in projects of this director, especially Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, director's wife and herself an actress of great vocal talent. None of them stayed behind expectations, having done an excellent vocal performance. The animations are very well done, using the stop motion technique, a lengthy process that, in this case, obtained a final result of high quality, which certainly benefited from the experience previously performed in ""Nightmare Before Christmas"". The integration of musical themes in the plot was well done, making us remember the tradition of musicals.

","I'm no big fan of these quirky, Gothic stop-motion animation type films, but I have to say that CORPSE BRIDE is a darn sight more entertaining than that overblown '90s film, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas. Tight pacing, plentiful action, some fun songs and excellent attention to technical detail make this the superior film in every way, and I can fully appreciate the fairy tale storyline of a man who accidentally finds himself married to a dead woman.<br/><br/>The film utilises some fine voice talent, which I admit was the reason I chose it in the first place. Helena Bonham Carter's vocal chords are put to excellent use as she plays the alluring, surprisingly affecting titular bride, with Johnny Depp almost unnoticeable opposite her. The pairing works so well that Carter and Depp were later also put to good use in Burton's excellent musical version of Sweeney Todd. Emily Watson, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Richard E. Grant and Albert Finney all provide solid support, and there are also a couple of made-to-measure parts for old-timers Christopher Lee and Michael Gough, who are both excellent.<br/><br/>The animation is colourful and action-packed and unsurprisingly Burton comes up with plenty of ghoulish creations, could they get away with a live action version of this? I think not! All in all a witty, dark fun little film."

","There's a couple of things to say about Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"". It's an impressive achievement in stop-motion animation, and the voices fit the characters perfectly. But I'd say that what's more important is what it says about the class structure in 1800s Europe. Set in an unidentified village - it could be anywhere in Europe, despite the English accents - there's an arranged marriage planned between the son of a nouveau riche couple and the daughter of cruel aristocrats. It turns out, after the son gets whisked away to the Land of the Dead, that this place is livelier than the ""alive"" place. There can be no doubt that the ""nice"" world of the aristocrats was a facade (it's worth noting that Johnny Depp also played James M. Barrie, whose ""Peter Pan"" constituted a rebellion against the world of the aristocrats).<br/><br/>So I'd say that's that movie's real strength. It has a creative plot, but the indictment of the aristocracy is the important thing. Along with Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough (Alfred in the 1989-97 Batman movies) do a fine job with the voices. I recommend it.<br/><br/>As for Burton's disliked 2012 adaptation of ""Dark Shadows"", I interpreted it as a look at the political situation in the early 1970s."

","Movie review The Corpse Bride is quite a good movie for a kid who doesn't get scarred easily. I remember as a kid getting very scared at the graphics and the characters in this movie. Most of it is very good, but there are quite a few scary parts. Some of the characters and designed in a spooky, scary way, trying to capture the ""just rose from the dead"" look. There is also a part where the charters are getting drunk and that might be a little explicit for a child at a young age. Emotionally bittersweet as I would call it. There's happy parts, sad parts, and funny parts. You really learn to love some of the characters. And then you really learn to hate some of the chats. It's very visually entertaining, especially for the six to twelve year olds. There are not a lot of colors, it's very bland and kept to a dark color scheme.

","Corpse Bride (2005): Dir: Tim Burton / Voices: Johnny Depp, Emily Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, Richard E. Grant, Christopher Lee: Hot after his huge success with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Tim Burton releases this dazzling stop motion animation about the old and new. Johnny Depp voices Victor who is forced into an arranged marriage by his parents to Emily voiced by Emily Watson. Victor has cold feet and after an unsuccessful rehearsal he practices his vows in the dead forest where he accidentally awakens a corpse bride voiced with great enthusiasm by Helena Bonham Carter. Screenplay is well written with Victor introduced to the underground dead society while his living bride is being arranged into another marriage. The outcome isn't surprising but the last scene is among Burton's greatest work. One complaint regards the advertising of the film to children. Due to the subject of the dead it may not be a film for young viewers. Great voice work by Depp as the timid Victor. Watson as the living bride whose groom is missing and her next suitor has other plans. Carter steals the film as the corpse bride. Richard E. Grant voices the new groom whose past brought tragedy and his current intentions are deadly. Christopher Lee voices an ill tempered priest set to perform the wedding. Theme regards selfless love and allowing it bloom and live forever. Score: 8 / 10"

","Although you may read that it's based on a 19th century folk tale, The Corpse Bride is 100% a Tim Burton creation. Just check IMDb's recommendations--the only other movies considered to be similar are by Burton. The animation is incredible, although I didn't care much for the design of most of the characters. The exception is the bride herself, Emily. Likewise, the music was extremely well done, although I wasn't into it--the songs were just sort of there for me. All the technical aspects such as lighting, composition, etc, were off the charts. But while I enjoyed looking at all the details, I wasn't really drawn into the story--except, again, for Emily. The ending is very sweet, but just sort of happens. Unlike The Nightmare Before Christmas, where the movie builds to Jack and Sally being together, I didn't feel Emily's liberation was earned. I wanted a little something more from this movie--I just didn't feel the story added up. I'll give it an 8 out of 10 because of how well made it is in nearly every aspect, even though my own impression is that it falls a little short of what it could have been."

","Corpse Bride (2005) is beautiful and enchanting; dark and Gothic, just like the typical Tim Burton's artistic films. It also has a lot of distinct characters and plenty of thought provoking hidden depths.<br/><br/>Playfully plays on social issues such as gender roles, arranged marriage, family expectation, materialism and so on using the stop motion animation technique, this film is both lovely and hilarious. At most times the whole film is quite witty, with plenty of parodies on life.<br/><br/>While at first sight it may give an impression of being a gruesome movie, you will find out that Corpse Bride (2005) is actually one of the sweetest dark fantasy out there if you give this movie a chance. It is a tragedy with mixed ending, with totally unexpected love story.<br/><br/>In brief, this unpredictable film is quite nice to watch. With creative screenplay and thrilling music or sound effects in addition to its beautiful visuals and adorable characters, this animated feature is certainly one of the best dark, Gothic musical fantasy film out there.<br/><br/>PS. My favorite scenes are the lovely piano scenes which is quite exquisite and really difficult to create!!"

","A peculiar, eccentric & darkly comic stop-motion animated musical presented by Tim Burton, Corpse Bride is about Victor & Victoria who are hesitant at their arrange marriage to each other but soon fall in love during the first meeting. However, at the wedding rehearsal, Victor is unable to recite his wedding vows correctly & later flees to a nearby forest to practice then but as soon as he gets it right, he finds himself married to Emily; the Corpse Bride, who then takes him to the Land of the Dead while a new match for Victoria comes out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Nicely directed by Tim Burton & Mike Johnson, the animators & puppeteers have done a fantastic job in bringing the stop-motion technology to the screen in a manner that only evokes admiration for their craftsmanship. The plot ain't that superior but it still manages to make its story work with sharp photography, wonderful music & songs by Danny Elfman and brilliant voice performances from Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter & other supporting cast. On an overall scale, Corpse Bride is a hilariously creepy, downright imaginative & endlessly enjoyable flick that may not amaze but sure will leave you satisfied in the end."

While Ms. Watson has long been recognized as one of the most gifted, talented, and majestic actors working in any medium today, she proves here that there is literally no limits to what greatness she can attain. No one who hears this performance will ever forget it and it is a tribute to Tim Burton that he had the wisdom to cast her in this modest film.

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","10","0","0","22 December 2012"," A different take on the afterlife
","Director Tim Burton really knows how to make dark tones not seem all the dark. Look at one of his first examples in filmmaking; Beetlejuice (1988). Sure the character of Beetlejuice played by Michael Keaton was a little not your usual dead guy but there were actually a lot of laughs to be had. Same goes for this movie.<br/><br/>The story is about shy man Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) who is having an arranged marriage with also a shy, sweet young lady named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson). Unfortunately, Victor is rather opposed to whole idea because he just doesn't feel like he could be ready for such a commitment. So in a panic, he flees from the practice session to get some fresh air. While in the forest, he recites his marriage vows and accidentally awakens the corpse bride played by Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>Now that Victor has disturbed the dead he must make a choice to whom he will marry. All the voice actors give an excellent performance as their characters. Depp is great at making himself sound inferior and feeble as the meek Victor. Watson and Carter both play sweet female leads as well. Even composer Danny Elfman has voice role in this film. Quite rare if you ask me on Elfman's part. But his score is just as abundant like the rest of his collaborations with Tim Burton. This score well appreciated because of its sense of emotion and tone.<br/><br/>The animation is great here too. It actually reminisces to Burton's film of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (1964) featuring stop motion animation. Obviously since the it was 2005 the filming techniques have become much smoother so it looks even better than before. The art department I could tell had a good time with this too. The difference between life and death are quite the opposite. Normal life is gray and dull while the afterlife is colorful and vibrant. Which could almost suggest that death is more fun but most of us don't have that kind of mentality.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is enchanting and fun altogether. The animation is spectacular and the voice acting is wonderful."

The voice talent of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson helps make their characters endearing, wistful and funny. Others in the talented cast are equally good.<br/><br/>The absurd story gets loving attention to detail and mood, its atmosphere and look bordering on Charles Dickens at his darkest. All of it is given a sort of grotesque charm, no matter what the characters or situations are, including a singing maggot! Very original, with the charming ""piano duet"" for Victor (Depp) and Emily (Carter) by Danny Elfman sounding like a segment of classical music.<br/><br/>Admirers of Tim Burton's art of animation will surely rank this among his best creations. Rightfully, it was nominated for a host of awards in the animation field."

","""I do"". Those are two words that Victor Van Dort just can't seem to say. He practices and practices but saying his vows aren't an easy thing for him to do. Perhaps it's because he barely knows her and doesn't love her. Or because he is a nervous wreak. Which is it? Either way, it clearly isn't going according to plan. Victor wanders off into the forest and while practicing his vows yet again, he finally gets them right. Unfortunately, it happens at a very inconvenient time. A dead woman, buried in the ground, has been waiting for the perfect man to come and say the exact words that Victor said and she believes it to be for real. She brings him into the world of the dead which is not at all what he is looking for. Tim Burton's idea is a strange and creative one but, to me, there was clearly something missing. Johnny Depp does a mediocre job playing the selfless and kindhearted Victor but that's just it; its mediocre. Same goes for Helena Bonham Carter as the corpse bride and most of the other voice actors. But as I said, Tim Burton's ideas are creative as usual, and the animation that he hadn't used since ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", works well here."

","Corpse Bride is Burton's finest since Ed Wood. It's a sweet simple story about romance and sacrifice. And I have absolutely no idea why it continues to be overlooked. Yes it's not as technically impressive as Nightmare but I don't think it was supposed to be. Everything that made Burton's earlier films so great is here. Johnny Depp is once again in top form as the timid groom Victor. Depp takes what could have been a boring character and makes him very likable and endearing. Helena Bonham Carter provides the voice for one of her more innocent characters. You really feel sympathy for the Bride and want to see her get a happy ending of sorts. Other cast members include Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee, and the late Michael Gough who all give really good performances. Nightmare Before Christmas is still the masterpiece but this film is also absolutely wonderful."
"StevePulaski","8","0","0","14 May 2012"," The deader the better
","In a world where so many animated films are effortlessly vibrant and soaked with bright candy colors, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is a dark, yet rarely dreary exercise, with dark subject matter taken in a harmless and fun form. The story is cute, the voice acting has a fine elegance to it, and the mischief and cinematography is delightfully cinematic.<br/><br/>Any expectations of frightening sequences or nightmare-inducing scenes can be safely discarded upon arrival. While the film is sometimes dark, it is never haunting or indelibly scaring and, I firmly believe, the more films you've seen the more inclined you are to enjoy it. I recall references some early twenties and thirties films and including one famous line uttered from one very famous film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the shy and clumsy Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp), who is preparing for his arranged marriage with Victoria Everglot (Watson) in a Victorian Era Europe. The Van Dorts are a wealthy family, while the Everglots don't have a dime to their name, and marriage will hopefully buy them a better spot on the social class level. When Victor ruins the potential wedding, he is sent off to better prepare himself where he practices his vows in the woods, placing his ring on a curled stick only to have it come alive as the ""Corpse Bride."" The bride is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter, in a beautifully fitting role, as she believes Victor sincerely meant to marry her. Things become conflicted, but thankfully, never resemble a shouting match like an episode of Maury.<br/><br/>The stop-motion animation is absolutely wonderful. An artful and divine masterpiece. Characters are created in true Tim Burton fashion; tall and lanky, as if their arms are black-coated toothpicks and their heads small mounds of clay with a touch of fantasy. What is even more amazing is what Burton can do with such tiny characters. There is a scene early in the film where Victor plays a lovely song on the piano, as Emily waltzes down the stairs quietly so as not to disturb him. The scene is complimented by utter silence and simplicity, not to mention beautifully crafted romance before the subjects even meet each other. Not to mention, Danny Elfman's score, like always, is ravishing and perfectly concatenates the vibrant experience that is awaiting the viewer.<br/><br/>At a mere seventy-three minutes without credits, Corpse Bride has the look and feel of a potential Television program for the unique viewer. It races past, and with a basic yet imaginative idea, its possibilities never feel gridlocked to the ordinary. It's hard to believe it took four writers (one of them the late Pixar voice actor Joe Ranft) to write such a concise work for the eyes and the mind. If there's one petty complaint, it's that even at a slender seventy-three minutes the film starts to become much of a muchness and the drab look does wear on the eyes. What could've been a tedious exercise is still worked fittingly into a stop-motion film from a director that has proved in the past he can deliver a brilliant one.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, and Albert Finney. Directed by: Tim Burton."

","""Corpse Bride"" is the kind of movie that makes me proud that I've never gotten too old for fairy tales. And as long as Tim Burton manages to keep his head in the clouds, I doubt I ever will. This movie is so soothing, so heart-warming, but at the same time it's also very dark. Take that literally in fact, black is the primary color. The animation is absolutely wonderful, but the movie never tries to sell that as an achievement of its own. Mastering the effects is only useful when you combine it with good writing, and Tim Burton seems to be one of the few great directors that actually seems to remember this. What a beautiful story this is, in some ways ""Corpse Bride"" is the kind of movie Disney keeps failing to make. Purely for the sake of nitpicking however, I would like to point that a) the movie seems really short to me (not even 80 minutes) and b) the ending is somewhat disappointing. Apart from that, this thing is pure magic."

","Tim Burton is a director who manages to bring across something much darker in a cheerful fancifully way. This film is no exception.<br/><br/>The plot is an adaptation of an old Jewish story when a dead bride come to claim her still alive accidental spouse. Of course its plays out much more like a horror accept when they come to terms with it.<br/><br/>In the classic Tim Burton fashion however the scenes which should be icky and grotesque end up on the fun side. Indeed the dead are shown partying well in the afterlife. New arrivals for the most part receive a musical number with the ghosts and ghouls literally playing each other. Whilst the land above is filled with character who are really about living their own lives. The land above is always shown in the eternal night under constant moonlinght.<br/><br/>In fact the over top is where everything certainly feels creepy and for good reason. The villains in this movie are never the supposedly evil dead. Although they acre treated with full fear once they surface.<br/><br/>The characters include two young soon to be betrothed victor and victoire. They are often subject to the demands of all the peripheral characters and it seem they are never in their element or at least in a comfortable position. Victoire's parents are played up to the arrogant stereotypes whereas Victor's are much more humble. The cast of dead fellows includes many but the most prominent is an elder who is nothing but bones. Of course the corpse bride is the title character who manages to prove very endearing.<br/><br/>Make no mistake this movie is played out in full pantomime fashion. Expect music numbers of the dark and dastardly kind you'd expect from a Disney movie. Those jazzy tunes and brass beats are all for interpretation i guess, but go the way to explaining the characters.<br/><br/>The relationship between Victor his betrothed and his was to be betrothed is the main draw. Victor is meant to be with Victoire and yet the corpse bride Emily has certainly more draws except for the rotting and decaying part.<br/><br/>In classic Burton style the forbidden romance is played out but its also more about the characters coming to understand one another. Victor might well be trying to marry Emily out of pity, or maybe she makes him feel more at ease.<br/><br/>The problems this film faces are I guess similarities between the nightmare before Christmas. The setting of the film to feel quite remote and confining but I guess that gives the movie are short story feel. However Tim Burton should have tried for a much more artistic extravagance that we know he is capable of rather than playing it so timidly. The film feels much shorter than it is and the musicals do feel like they steal the spotlight from when characters really do progress when they are more intimate.<br/><br/>So this film is much like a short story. It can fill the short slot of an evening and you may get a short chuckle. But it feels as if it doesn't realise its a movie. The art style is still different from most but it still isn't evolved from the original. This is more I dare say straight to DVD but in a good way, at the very least a rental."

","Victor Van Dort is a young man with many problems. He is arranged to be married to Victoria Everglot, whom he has never met. Then he accidentally manages to get married to Emily, who unfortunately is dead. Then to complicate things he falls in love with Victoria, but feels bound to honour his commitment to Emily. What's a poor guy to do ?<br/><br/>This beautiful stop-motion animation film is yet another macabre delight from the fertile imagination of Tim Burton featuring the utterly charming music of Danny Elfman. Like its twelve-years-older companion piece The Nightmare Before Christmas, it weaves an astonishingly rich and beautiful fairy-tale world out of paper and ink, silicone and paint, shadows and spirals. The detail of the drawings and the elegant motion of the camera are sublime, while the music swells through every scene; gentle piano rolls one minute, foot-stomping jazz trombones the next. The central song in The Land Of The Dead, the amusingly named Remains Of The Day, is sung by a deliriously lively skeleton called Bonejangles (Elfman) and is one of the best musical numbers in years. What I love so much about Burton's material is his ability to create these crazy stories with wild potential for creative mayhem, but at the same time write characters we really care about. When Victor initially rejects Emily, she is simply heartbroken and her reaction is both comic and beautifully tender (""I know that I am dead; yet it seems that I still have some tears to shed.""). The top-notch voice cast shout and sing with great abandon, and everyone is terrific, whether it be Depp's mild-mannered fop, Horrocks' good-natured six-eyed spider, Grant's deliciously slimy heel or Lee's gruff parson. Burton has amassed a fabulous Stock Theatre of regular players (Depp, Bonham Carter, Lee, Finney, Roy, Whitehouse, Gough) and they clearly love working with him. Dedicated to the late Joe Ranft, the Pixar animator, this is a beautifully creepy little happy fable, with a lovely atmosphere and wonderful music from start to finish."

The voice acting is spot on, and the facial expressions of the characters is very well done- the characters do not have to say anything, yet you can tell what their emotions are. The ending is by far one of the greatest endings I've seen in any movie. It leaves the viewer to imagine what happens next, and gave Emily the happily-ever-after she deserved. The only problem I had with this film is chemistry between Victor and Victoria felt cold and bland. They didn't appeal to be the type of couple that could really explain their true feelings to one another. Of course, that's simply because we do not get to see enough scenes between them. Overall, this is a great movie that was beautifully in which I feel is underrated."

Meanwhile in the world of the living Victoria's parents are less than impressed at Victor's disappearance so when eminently more suitable Lord Barkis says that he finds Victoria delightful and he'd never treat her the way Victor has they quickly decide that he should marry her instead. Of course there is more but I wouldn't want to spoil it.<br/><br/>This film is a lot of fun and I'm sure most people will really enjoy it, it is suitable for all but the most timid of children.

The wedding rehearsal goes awry, when Victor stutters with his weddings vows, as he's not fully certain if he really wants to marry, and he's sent to memorise his part of the ceremony. In the woods he tries to get his lines in order and he slips his ring on a tree branch, which turns out to be a bony finger of a corpse bride (Helena Bonham Carter), who is delighted to accept his accidental proposal. Now Victor, who has realised he does want to marry Victoria, has to wiggle himself out of his new ghastly marriage.<br/><br/>As I said everything clicks together very nicely in this little musical horror comedy.

","Timid young Victor Van Dort (the always fine and personable Johnny Depp) is engaged to be married to the sweet and equally mousy Victoria Everglost (Emily Watson in peak charming form). Complications ensue when Victor accidentally weds the nice, lovely and radiant, but very much deceased corpse bride Emily (beautifully voiced with exquisite passion by Helena Bonham Carter). Directors Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, working from a bright and witty script by John August, Caroline Thompson and Pamela Pettler, concoct a deliciously quirky and inspired cinematic meditation on life, death, love, kindness, sacrifice, and mortality. Depp, Watson, and especially Carter all do sterling work as the appealing main characters; they get excellent support from Albert Finney as the grouchy Finis Everglot, Joanna Lumley as his similarly sour spouse Maudeline, Tracy Ullman as overbearing shrew Nell Van Dort, Paul Whitehouse as her meek husband William, and Richard E. Grant as smarmy, wicked nobleman Barkis Bittern. It's an immense pleasure to hear legendary Hammer horror veterans Christopher Lee as the mean, fearsome Pastor Galswells and Michael Gough as the wise Elder Gutknecht. The film further benefits from several wonderfully macabre touches like the groovy skeleton jazz band and a lovably grotesque Peter Lorreish maggot (a sublimely slimy Enn Reitel). The stop-motion animation is remarkably fluid and lifelike; Emily in particular has a genuine touching grace and sadness to her. A nice bit of irony can be discerned from how the living take being alive for granted while the dead enjoy an extremely merry afterlife. Danny Elfman's lush, melodic score, the divinely rich and vivid 19th century Gothic atmosphere, the incredibly catchy and funny songs, and Pete Kozachik's often stunning cinematography are all terrific as well. Despite the ghoulish premise, this picture proves to be strangely moving and even life-affirming. A total one-of-a-kind offbeat and uplifting treat."

","Corpse Bride, a great film, not as good as Nightmare Before Christmas, but still entertaining. You can tell it must've been a painstaking process to have made it, but it shows. I've always been a fan of the Ray Harryhausen classic adventure stories brought to the big screen during the 1950's and 60's, so its refreshing to still see these types of animated film being made. However, its such a shame there's not enough stop-motion movies out there these days, but its good it hasn't died out completely, i think we need films made with a variety of animations, not just CG.<br/><br/>Look up 'RetroActivation - Hansel & Gretel' on YouTube.... would love to hear what you think of our own short animatic film, based around Burton's unique Gothic style used in Corpse Bride...

","Tim Burtons work is something worth watching 1000 times over. the corpse bride certainly doesn't brake the chain. this has to be the greatest stop motion I have ever seen. It clearly deserves its awards. and Tim Burton films are something always worth looking forward to. the corpse bride has an interesting storyline which is comedic at times, and its dark romanticism is one of its greatest qualities. it truly lives up to the Tim Burton legacy, and in my opinion it is a great competitor to the famous Nightmare before Christmas. This stop motion classic is also something worth watching, if you're one of the few people who haven't yet seen it."

Spending time alone in the forest, Victor decides to practice on his own. Everything seems to go well, until he accidentally puts the ring upon the hand of a corpse. Before he knows it, Victor is in the land of dead and now has a corpse bride. Whilst everyones worries about who Victoria will marry in the land of the living, Victor desperately finds a way to get back.<br/><br/>One of the joys in the film world today, is having Tim Burton creating films. The are not just entertaining because of the script or the acting, but because of the amazing visuals he brings us. This film is no different, as the colours are chosen well. Whilst the land of the living is very dull and dark, the land of the dead is a world of vibrant colours. There is a very small amount of stop motion used these days, which is a shame, as it's amazing to see. The level of detail in them is outstanding and there is so many possibilities of models to be created. This voice artists in this film are well chosen. There is the usual Burton choices such as Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Christopher Lee, who like always brings to life such marvellous characters. The music in it is catchy with some lovely tunes, and there's lots of fun here for all ages.<br/><br/>""Just remember, when you want to come back, say ""Hopscotch."""" - Elder Gutknecht (Michael Gough)"

","When Maggot says: ""You don't know me, but I used to live in your dead mother."", you really cannot miss the man behind these lines. It is obvious that dark knight Tim Burton got something to do with it and his ""Corpse Bride"" is real winner. Visual masterpiece and I'm very unhappy that Academy didn't award this genius because his animated movie is so different from all others. But that day will come when Burton is going to get an Oscar. I'm sure of that.<br/><br/>The story is about Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) who has to marry a woman named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson). The marriage is set up by their parents before Victor and Victoria even get to know each other. Victor jumbles his vows so he goes into the woods to practice. When he finally gets it right, he says his vows correctly and places the ring on a weird looking twig in the ground. That happens to be a hand of Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter), so Victor is now married and he is taken to the Land of the Dead to join his new wife.<br/><br/>Only Burton could direct this bizarre but brilliant story (with help of Mike Johnson) and this is movie for everyone to watch, with so many dark humor and so many funny situations. All funny moments are coming from the characters that are made perfectly and really every one of them has something special that makes him different from other. Parents (Everglot and Van Dort) are made like their only wish is to get some profit from marriage of their kids. Everglot's get money and Van Dort's get reputation. Barkis Bittern is very negative character and he's a true villain. All other characters are opposite of him. Victor is innocent and good, just like Victoria. Corpse Bride (her eye pops out just like Ragetti's in Pirates) has heart at the end and she's not that ""dead"" as it seemed. Elder Gutknecht, Skeletons, Black Widow Spider, Maggot and other crew are simply brilliant. Actually there are so many emotions in every character that that cannot be described by words.<br/><br/>Burton connected everything with other movies. He assembled his usual cast - Johnny Depp (their fifth collaboration), Helena Bonham Carter (his wife), Christopher Lee, Deep Roy, with few new faces (Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Jane Horrocks, Paul Whitehouse...). I just have to say that all actors made their characters alive. Everyone did excellent job. Some scenes from Pirates can be seen here (eye, hand). Victor (Depp) lets butterfly at the beginning of the movie (in ""Sleepy Hollow"" Depp lets bird out of cage). Have you noticed that main characters have names Victor and Victoria (name of Blake Edwards musical comedy starring Julie Andrews; name comes from German original). Also Burton uses one of the most famous movie lines : ""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn!"" (from ""Gone with the Wind"") when old skeleton sees his alive wife. And there are lots more very funny and innovative scenes to be seen in this one.<br/><br/>Special thing is music. Danny Elfman is great and all his musical numbers are simply outstanding (from first when parents are singing to my personal favorite when skeletons are singing ). Elfman is going to win that Oscar statue, just like Burton and Depp will one day. Oscar is not measure of a great director, actor or songwriter but I'm purposely mentioning Oscar as the higher standard of every person involved in movie. But as long as they keep up doing their job in the way they done it till now they are all winners in my eyes."

","Tim Burton is a mad genius. His movies (with the obvious exception of ""Planet Of The Apes"") are so deliciously dark, funny and even sad that they entangle the viewer into their own unique world. ""Corpse Bride"" is one such example and my personal favorite animated feature. Compared to most contemporary animated movies it's a fairly low budget production but it has more heart and uniqueness then all of them combined. A 76 minute stop-motion animation that looks more lively than some live-action movies.<br/><br/>In a small town, young Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp) and Victoria Everglot (voiced by Emily Watson) have been betrothed by their parents. They meet for the first time the night before their wedding to practice the vows. Victor is a bit nervous and it's no surprise he's experiencing some problems in recalling them correctly. After several failed attempts he is kicked out of the church by the annoyed priest who orders him not to come back until he's learned his lines. Strolling through the dark, creepy forest Victor practices his vow until finally he gets them right, he perfectly reenacts the whole ritual and anxiously completes it by putting the ring on a tree branch imagining it was Victoria's hand. Unluckly for Victor that branch turns out to be the hand of Emilie (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter) a young woman who was killed by her groom whom until this moment has rested on this ground, waiting for her true love to set her free. Now awoken, Emilie claims that they are husband and wife and drags Victor with her to the Land Of The Dead. While Victoria anxiously awaits him.<br/><br/>The world of ""Corpse Bride"" is a small and cozy place full with Gothic imagery. In it, death is just another phase of existence. And interesting enough it seemed to be the happier part. Where as the world of the living is portrayed as a dull, nearly boring place where characters live a monotonous life full of daily chores and concerns about money. The Land Of The Dead is a cheerful, jolly realm, it's denizens are free from the concerns that bother the living and just spent their time in...well... living. It's like Burton switched the roles of these two conditions, Death is living and Life is death, a beautifully morbid look on existence. Characters helped to reinforce that idea, with great designs and equally great voice acting, they are memorable and funny, even the tiniest role was not forgettable. Johnny Depp pulls a great performance as the nervously edgy Victor, while Helena Bohnan Carter spins a life-full take as the Corpse Bride. <br/><br/>But it was not just the characters that were detailed, the entire world of ""Corpse Bride"" had been turned into a moving work of art. It's an incredible visual experience watching the story unfold. All the movements are flawless it doesn't really feel like you're seeing stop-motion animation, because it lacks that choppiness in the action found in most films of the genre. The camera work is also surprising, because it doesn't use static positioned cameras. Instead it moves around freely, zooming in and out, rotating around characters. And of course as any Tim Burton movie, Danny Elfman provides the thematic score which as usual is a perfect fit, to the creepishly dreadful, joyous tone of the film.<br/><br/>The sheer amount of work poured into ""Corpse Bride"" while at the same time not depending on a 80 plus million dollar budget is a commendable achievement. More than that, Tim Burton and crew made one of the most watchable animated movies ever, accessible to both children and adults. And this dark, funny, beautiful Gothic fairy tale deserves all the respect it gets, and more."

","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride/2005/***1/2<br/><br/>Main Stars: Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter Albert Finney Joanna Lumley Emily Watson Christopher Lee<br/><br/>Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is a delightful story about a young man named Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) who is living and a young woman named Emily, the corpse bride (Helena Bonham Carter) who is dead. You are probably thinking this movie is about these two and no one else. But actually there are quite a few other characters involved. There is Victor's ""living"" fiancé he was originally going to marry (you'll find out what happens to those two toward the end). Then there are the sets of parents for Victor and his ""living"" fiancé; the butler; the maid; the priest; etcetera. All the characters (except for a few) have either weird looking faces, bodies, hairstyles or walks. The story is definitely original but had one problem most movies have: it was too short! I can see why the movie was too short though; it was made with frames (like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""). What I mean is it was made by taking a picture of a character, moving them slightly, taking another picture of them, moving them and a few people in the background again, and then taking another picture. This way of making films is very time consuming but worth it because it is entertaining to watch. This movie is involving a real life situation and a fantastic situation (the living world and the nonliving world). Victor is in love with a ""living"" woman named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) and is at a rehearsal wedding and can't get his vows right. The priest (Christopher Lee) becomes very impatient and tells him the wedding is off if he can't get his vows right in time. The strict parents of Victoria, who are named Finnis and Maudeline Everglot (Albert Finney and Joanna Lumley), are not to fond of Victor and think Victoria should marry someone a bit more wealthy like Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) and you'll soon find out what happens to him! HAHAHAHAHAHH! Victor goes into a forest and practices his vows (still getting them wrong). He then finds objects in the forest to practice with. He uses a tree branch as a hand to put the ring on and that's how Emily, the corpse bride and Victor meet. The tree branch cracks and out comes a skeletal hand out of the snow. Emily had thought all this time that he was talking to her but really he was practicing the vows with a tree branch. When you do watch this movie and you better, you'll be heading in the direction of adventure. Movie directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson."

","Being a big fan of Burton, I've been looking forward to seeing this one for quite awhile. To be honest it was a bit disappointing, but still a good film. First off, I love Burton's style. Thought it was interesting how the world of the living was dark and drab, while the world of the dead was brightly coloured. Great contrast. The songs weren't bad, but very derivative of much of Elfman's older work, not only Nightmare Before Christmas. The plot was pretty interesting though, and there were quite a few funny parts, so it wasn't all bad.

I felt this movie began slowly (not surprisingly, since the animation style of the ""living"" world is less vibrant than the animation style of the ""dead"" world), but it was very enjoyable once the main character Victor transitioned to the world of the dead, and I was surprised when the movie came to an end because I would have liked it to go on longer.

","The second ""animated"" feature-length offering from Tim Burton (after 1993's THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas which he only produced and co-wrote) is a delight: jaunty, funny and macabre in equal doses with impeccable vocal characterizations by the usual coterie of Burton regulars (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough) and a couple of welcome new inductions (Joanna Lumley, Emily Watson and Richard E. Grant).<br/><br/>The musical numbers, courtesy of perennial Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, are quite sprightly and give a cheerful boost to the ostensibly grim goings-on. The story is the stuff of fairy-tales with the usual assortment of shady relatives, and villainous suitors, so what ultimately sticks in the mind is the quirky supporting characters, particularly the maggot's perfectly-etched Peter Lorre impersonation (Enn Reitley).<br/><br/>Although, at this remove, I'd say that I enjoyed THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas slightly more than CORPSE BRIDE, it doesn't lessen in any way the latter's remarkable technical achievements, its boundless inventiveness and undoubted entertainment value."

","After some shorts from his early days, after ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Nightmare before Christmas"", Tim Burton strikes back with his own universe skulls and characters that look like they've been created by a Gothic Dali. ""The Corpse Bride"" contains a simple story: a fairy tale in which Snow White has her cranium inhabited by a talking worm (sort of a Jimmy Cricket from the afterlife), and lives surrounded by coffin-shaped furniture... The musical acts are played by black widows and skeletons instead of dwarfs and teapots... Walt Disney having fun in the Ghost Train, that's what ""The corpse bride"" looks like... There's no doubt that Burton really enjoys this kind of projects: he doesn't have to deal with actors, or with the pressure of the big studios...<br/><br/>Humor and romance delightfully macabre, for the eldest and for the young ones.

","I was a bit disappointed, only because of the publicity this little film received. I was expecting something better. But taken as it is, this is a pleasant, rather short animated fable. In the ""extras"" we see that small sets and puppets are used for the animation, and it is done very well. It therefore has more of a ""3-D"" look than we see in computer animation like Shrek or Monsters Inc. Another interesting feature is the coloration. In the ""alive"" world the colors are very muted and dark, almost black and white. But in the ""dead"" world things are very colorful and bright. It makes an interesting way to contrast the two, so that death doesn't seem depressing at all.<br/><br/>The story is very simple. A marriage is arranged, the intended meet for the first time the day before their wedding. The groom is very shy, and is having trouble saying his lines, which MUST be recited just so for the marriage to be valid. So he goes off by himself into the woods to practice. This environment is suitable, he says the lines perfectly, and slips the ring on a twig as practice. But the ""twig"" turns out to be the protruding skeletal hand of a young woman who was killed on the eve of her wedding, and was still dressed in wedding garb. So, the movie deals with the complications of this young man accidentally gaining a ""corpse bride."" <br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. The dead world considers his marriage to the corpse legitimate and there he meets lots of other dead people, plus his old pet puppy. But he longs for his real intended bride, so they find someone who cooks up a potion to get them back to the alive world. Complications arise but at the climax the young man is about to drink poison so that he can become dead to make the marriage to the corpse legitimate. But the corpse realizes that he really belongs with his alive intended bride, she stops him, and all ends well."

","I thought Corpse Bride was visually stunning and really funny--I really liked the overall feel, and I think I fell in love with Emily, despite the maggot and all. But, and I feel horrible saying this, I felt that the story had some unforgivable holes. Why, for instance, does Victor care that much about Victoria in the first place? OK, let's accept that he does immediately fall totally in love with her, then why does he suddenly decide to sacrifice his life to marry Emily forever? Then why does she suddenly decide not to marry Victor? How did he free her? I feel like Burton got a little caught up in crafting the ""experience"" of Corpse Bride (which was superb) and forgot to pay attention to the story line. Perhaps one might argue that he should be forgiven since it's ""just an animated movie for kids"" but I think that writing for young audiences is no free pass--you still have to take care of the writing first, the oohs and ahs second (unless you're building a roller coaster)."

","CORPSE BRIDE <br/><br/>Though I was very excited to see it, I was unsure of what to expect when I watched CORPSE BRIDE because I've been somewhat underwhelmed by most of Tim Burton's current films. BIG FISH was merely okay for me, and CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY was visually stunning and had some great elements, but was marred by some terrible creative decisions.<br/><br/>However, CORPSE BRIDE proves to be Tim Burton's best film in years as it combines an outlandish visual style, a crazed storyline, blatant caricatures, and a very genuine emotional storyline to make a highly entertaining film. In my honest opinion, CORPSE BRIDE would be the most worthy winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar this year.<br/><br/>CORPSE BRIDE has a lot in common with it's biggest rival, WALLACE & GROMIT. Both films embrace outlandish stylizations and wring every last bit of humor out of the possible visual imagery. However, where W&G had a lackadaisical wit about it that pretty much left an emotional story on the sidelines in exchange for endlessly entertaining stupid humor... CORPSE BRIDE manages to also involve an emotionally involving story and characters with a good deal of depth.<br/><br/>In CORPSE BRIDE, the physical characteristics embody the voice over work beautifully and the film is always incredible to behold visually. But the best quality of the film is that it does not simply rely on the visuals and humor. The film takes time to explore the longings and desires of these unrealistic characters in a very realistic way... and as a result of Burton's direction, we are able to both care very much for the characters, but also laugh at how ridiculous they are.<br/><br/>The voice-work in this film is spot on all around. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Emily Watson all add fully realized portrayals to the 3 leading characters... while Tracy Ullman, Albert Finney, and Johanna Lumley provide brilliantly overcharacterized comedic voice work for their supporting characters. In my opinion, CORPSE BRIDE has taken the energetic visual spunk of the common recent animated films... but it has also added a more creatively and fully developed screenplay than most others.

","As a big fan of Tim Burton, it has been pleasing for me to see his work go from strength to strength in recent years, especially after the much-criticised ""re-imagining"" of ""Planet Of The Apes"". What's also pleasing is how much he can change his focus on when it comes to particular audiences. In the case of, say, ""Ed Wood"", we have a mature adult audience against the family-based ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory."" ""Corpse Bride"" fits into the latter category like a well-fitting glove. Like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" before it, ""Corpse Bride"" is a wonderful stop-motion gem filled with Burton's typical grotesque characters and Gothic, dark and often very funny humour.<br/><br/>The tale is fairly simple - Victor Van Dort is arranged to be married to Victoria, whose parents are grudgingly setting up for marriage because they are broke. Victor, being a quiet, timid sort of guy, is made worse by the fact that he falls in love with Victoria almost straight away, and so can't say his vows properly during the rehearsal. Practising with a few twigs in the woods, he inadvertently marries the Corpse Bride, who whisks him away to where she lives in the Land Of The Dead. Now not only does Victor have to try and escape, he also has to try to stop the villainous intentions of Barkis Bittern, whose ideas of marrying Victoria are not all that innocent...<br/><br/>The animation is superb, no question about that. In fact it's refreshing to see, along with ""Wallace And Gromitt: Curse Of The Were-Rabbit"", the return of stop-motion after a lengthy wait after the last masterpiece of this type of animation, ""Chicken Run"", and before that ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the ""Wallace And Gromitt"" shorts. In fact, it's nice to see Burton taking a risk with an art that is certainly considered dated in this modern-day age of Pixar and Dreamworks CGI films.<br/><br/>The voice cast is outstanding - Johnny Depp as Victor gives his usual brilliant Johnny Depp best with an English accent that sounds like a quieter version of Ichabod Crane from ""Sleepy Hollow"", another Burton film. Burton's other regulars are all here: Christopher Lee and Helena Bonham Carter, who gives a magnificent performance as the Corpse Bride with genuine feeling and emotion. The rest of the British cast - Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney as Victoria's parents, Tracy Ullman and Paul Whitehouse as Victor's, and Emily Watson as Victoria - all are wonderful. As is Richard E Grant as Bittern, though I do feel we don't see enough of him.<br/><br/>The music is typical Danny Elfman - spell-bindingly beautiful and haunting. Like Tim Burton and animation, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman just connect so well. What I do feel was lacking was a few more songs, especially after the triumph of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which was, to a large extent, sung. Still the songs here are fairly good, though none are as catchy as the ones in ""Nightmare"". It's actually nice to hear both Paul Whitehouse and Helena Bonham Carter singing!<br/><br/>In fact, and this is my real moan, I actually thought that the film was a little too short at 74 minutes. Although Burton was obviously going for the family audience, there are some Disney films which are longer than this. It left me wanting more, and where that is generally a good thing, I felt it rather negative for this film. There are also parts of the story which some little children won't understand exactly - they may find it a little scary as well, though Burton's dark humour is enough to make this fear diminish quickly.<br/><br/>""Corpse Bride"", despite it's length, is a wonderful film. Along with Aardman, Tim Burton has breathed new life into stop-motion animation. It didn't win the Oscar, but I knew it wouldn't - the flaw for the film was that it was released around the same time as ""Wallace And Gromitt"", and as both were up for the Best Animation Oscar at the 2006 awards, I had a feeling that ""Wallace And Gromitt"" will clinch it. A pity, because I do believe that this film would have very much been an Oscar winner.<br/><br/>7/10"

Fans of all ages will surely enjoy it.<br/><br/>It has been over fifteen years since the release of Burton's first macabre but amusing animated film, A Nightmare Before Christmas. Both of these whimsical Gothic fairy tales were made in the near antiquated art of stop action animation. Each and every character puppet, prop, and piece of scenery was crafted or sculpted by an artisan. The pieces are set up in a scene, much like a still life painting, and photographed. Each frame of the movie is a single shot with subtle changes such as the movement of an eyebrow or slight turning of the head. All of these progressions and facial expressions are done by hand, not computer, which is the norm in animation today. The puppet actor's lips and emotions must match what the live actors are saying. The work is tedious, time consuming and the end result may not be as streamlined as CGI, but every nuance and attention to detail, such as the subtle movements of fabric in the bride's veil, is ethereal and beautiful.<br/><br/>Like most directors, Burton routinely collaborates with the same amazing talents in his films. The Corpse Bride is no exception, even though this was a relatively low budget project. The actors lent their skill just for the sake of art itself. Johnny Depp has worked with Burton on a number of films, including Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hallow. Other famous voices include Helena Bonham Carter (Big Fish), Joanna Lumley (James and the Giant Peach), Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Tracey Ullman. Danny Elfman wrote the musical score elegantly. Elfman's style is similar in all of Burton's movies, but this time Victorian harpsichord music washes you into the creepy world of German Expressionism with cold cavernous foyers, slanty pointy imagery and demands an emotional response. Sometimes jazzy and vibrant, sometimes contradictory, the words of the songs tell parts of the story, perhaps not as well as in Nightmare, though. Elfman himself is the voice of Bonejangles, jazz-man and underworld storyteller. The song he sings detailing the demise of the title character is based on a Cab Callaway song. One must also appreciate the bride's maggot friend, a nice if somewhat obscure tribute to horror character actor Peter Lorre.<br/><br/>In The Corpse Bride, a story of unrequited love is true to Burton form. He brings together clashing worlds, the natural and the supernatural. Victor, a man from the ""upstairs"" land of the living, accidentally marries the corpse of a dead bride from ""downstairs"" or the land of the dead. As soon as he unknowingly puts the ring on her bony finger, the tragic angel rises from the dead and claims her groom. Right away viewers will notice the vastly opposite and topsy-turvy reversal of worlds. ""Upstairs"", where Victor (Johnny Depp) and his intended bride Victoria (Emily Watson) live is a repressed and rigid world of arranged marriages, formality, and greedy aristocratic parents. Life is more dead than alive, and Burton has shaded this world in frigid shadows and drabness. ""Downstairs"" on the other hand, is a world of blessed freedom, festivity, and vibrant color, more alive than dead. It is a welcomed departure from the horror of the mundane.<br/><br/>A Corpse Bride is bittersweet and sentimental from beginning to end, a seemingly silly love triangle with a bit of necromancy. As Bonejangles says, ""What a story it is. A tragic tale of passion, romance, and murder most foul."" Victor must choose his one true love between the lovely, shy, living, breathing Victoria or the giggly, but melancholy dead girl whose parts keep falling off. Does everything go according to plan? Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. This movie, like life (or death), is not perfect, and as most fairy tales go it is a bit predictable. All in all, one can forgive its flaws; enjoy its accomplishments and just delight in Burton's vision."

","In this excellent and well done movie, a shy groom recites his vows but accidentally marries a corpse in a wedding gown in this funny and well done feature.<br/><br/>Victor is the son of a wealthy fish merchant who is arranged to marry Victoria, a woman he's never met before. Victor has never been involved with anyone and is painfully shy around others and when his parents arrange for him to be married, they're thrilled. Victoria is the daughter of a duke and lady who arranged for her to marry Victor so they can get out of their bankruptcy.<br/><br/>At the rehearsal, Victor has trouble reciting and remembering his vows and the priest throws him out so he can go memorize them. In the forest, Victor recites them perfectly and places the ring on a twig, but then all of a sudden, the twig becomes a skeleton hand and grabs hold of Victor's wrist. When Victor breaks free, the hand comes off and he watches in horror as a figure rises slowly from the ground and takes Victor away.<br/><br/>When Victor awakes, he finds himself in a colorful and lively world full of dead corpses and bony skeletons. He then learns that he is now married to the Corpse Bride, who is thrilled over the marriage. The bride's name is Emily, who's story is one of sadness tragedy and betrayal. Some years ago, Emily was a beautiful lady who fell hard for a mysterious stranger who asked for her hand in marriage. Her father, however, disapproved of the union but the two made a plan to meet and elope. So, Emily went to the oak tree to meet him wearing her mother's wedding gown and carrying the family jewels and a sack of gold but then was murdered by her love who took her riches. But Emily made a vow while lying there dead, a vow that she'd be set free by her true love who is apparently Victor. Although Victor feels sad for what happened to Emily, he longs to go home and marry Victoria, whom he realizes he cares for very much.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Victoria worries for Victor and realizes how she feels for him. However, her parents are desperate to marry her to someone wealthy. Lord Barkis Bittern offers to marry her and her parents agree without hesitation, much to Vicoria's dismay. Unbeknown to everyone, Barkis holds a dark secret and plans on doing something awful. But how can Victor help and marry Victoria when he is married to Emily and can't go up to the land of the living? <br/><br/>This movie is hilariously funny and charming. A beautiful adaption to a movie that will become a classic. Although I figured out who it was that murdered Emily early on, it is still a movie with watching and one I throughly enjoyed. Johnny Depp voices the shy Victor well and Helena Bonham Carter makes you feel sympathetic towards Emily. A movie worth seeing."

It is up there with The Nightmare Before Christmas(1992) as a technical masterpiece. The major standpoint is Burton's return to stop motion, only this time around, there are a few minor computer effects. Great musical numbers from such characters as the Corpse Bride, Bonejangles, and the Widow and Maggot. Interesting storyline and lively characters make the grim and strict atmosphere more enjoyable and loose. Good voice acting and transition throughout. Very few gray areas, and a few laughs as well. Overall, a good picture from Burton. 10/10."

","You have to experience this to get a direct look at Burton's vision of the world, and a line into how Elfman hears it.<br/><br/>I believe that Burton really does see our world as ""Beetle Juice""-- ""Bride"" has more or less the same narrative and story arc -- To Burton, there are no real people, just *puppets* manipulated by minds. The ""Bride"" characters are fully formed sight gags; they don't need a 'story', or to 'do' anything...their mere existence says it all. His world is gray, monochrome, metronomic in form and motion: Victorian England. Deep inside, he yearns for...<br/><br/>...the alternate Elfman world (""Harlem is Heaven""), a tribute to Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson. In that other world, the narrative is musical: splashy, dazzling, free form.<br/><br/>Burton doesn't know how to exist among the colors of that world, so he co-opts the music. Elfman's music has to reside in a movie world. So we have a compromise: a happy wedding."

"Rob_Taylor","7","0","0","20 January 2006"," It's different...
","Tim Burton has made a whole career out of doing out-of-the-ordinary films so it's no surprise that he extends this weirdness to animated features. Of course, we've already had Nightmare before Christmas and this is more of the same.<br/><br/>That said, the distinctive animation style can only hold interest for a short while before you start looking for more substance, like a plot. Luckily, Corpse Bride has a plot - albeit a very simple one. Young man wants to marry young girl, but instead accidentally marries a dead girl. Actually it's more fun than I've made it sound.<br/><br/>If the movie has a problem it's with the opening fifteen to twenty minutes. These set the scene but are rather humourless and dry. Fortunately, just as you're starting to wonder whether you've made a horrible mistake in sitting down to watch this movie, it takes off. The young man's descent into the ""underworld"" and the ensuing hijinks, though not side-splittingly funny, certainly entertain with (mostly) sight gags and ""dead"" humour. If you think along the lines of the undead visual gags from Pirates of the Caribbean you won't go far wrong in your expectations from Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>I don't think it'll win any prizes, but it is fair entertainment and at about 1hr and 20 mins doesn't last TOO long - a fault of some films.<br/><br/>Certainly worth a look."

","I expect this movie very closely since I saw the trailer, and just like I thought from a movie directed by Tim Burton, resembles a lot from his previous films, say for example the dark mood, colors but a really nice history and characters that make you come back for a second or more viewings.<br/><br/>What can i say from the movie, mmm, you have to see it, just kidding. The history is about love from finding the right one, and luckily for Victor (the main character, a little shy and insecure) he don't make any efforts because his coming marriage was arranged, and although his doubts about this kind of things can work, his fiancée (Victoria) is really nice. But by the other side and after a little bit of problems that occurred during the marriage attempt, Victor finds himself married by mistake with the corpse bride (that although dead, is really pretty and kind).<br/><br/>At the end, you don't know if Victoria or the corpse bride should marry with Victor (personally I prefer the corpse bride, but Victoria comes first, so...), but whatever is a nice ending...a great movie for enjoy, with a weird but simple great history, great voice acting and more."

It's a generally pleasant little story with pleasant characters and events that have all gone wrong to bring them all together. (Right, so it is a little bit predictable in places, but it has enough to be thoroughly enjoyable.)

","I enjoyed this movie for the entertainment it was and therefore gave it a relatively high rating. Beyond mere entertainment, however, this movie just can't stack up to the expectations that go along with a Burton film, let alone a film from anyone who spent so long laboring on such a project. Little issues I have with the film are its errors in consistency, so to speak. When in the land of the dead Victor and his Bride are unable to get back to the surface and have to seek out the elder for a solution. Now, aside from the magic of love, this leaves unexplained how she managed to chase victor through the town after he put the ring on her finger. Now, my biggest complaint is that I feel the best part of the story was virtually left out. When telling the story of the Corpse Bride in song, and how she came to be, I was taken back by the beautiful possibilities this could have presented. As soon as the song was done I found myself asking why we didn't get to WATCH that part of the story instead of just hearing about it. I couldn't help but thing that her story was far more intriguing--as fairy tails go--then Victor's and I was left wishing that HIS story was left as the side plot. Most anything else I have to say, praises included, have already been said. Though I will leave with one last comment which I admit is entirely subjective on my part. I liked the songs, but didn't love the songs. I feel the movie, even as it was, would have been more fun for me had it been a non-musical.<br/><br/>OH Lord Burton, please forgive my blasphemy. <br/><br/>PHIL"

","TIM BURTON'S ""A CORPSE BRIDE"" By Tim Burton and Mike Johnson<br/><br/>A tiny, blue butterfly flutters about after being set free from the clasp of two frail, pale hands. It flies aimlessly up the streets and down the alleys of the fictitious British city of yore that is the setting of ""Tim Burton's 'A Corpse Bride'"". It is a tiny burst of colour in an otherwise dark and gloomy (read: typical for Burton) city and consequently dark and gloomy life of Victor, who has just set this creature free after having immortalized it with paint and paper. Victor, voiced effetely by Johnny Depp, is to be married to a woman he's never met the very next day in order to increase the stature of his family; A fate equivalent to keeping the beautiful butterfly under glass until it's inevitable death.<br/><br/>These nuptials must go according to plan as much is at stake for both families involved. What fun would all this be if that's what actually happened? While trying to get a grip on his pre-wedding anxiety in the forest just outside of town, Victor meets Emily, The Corpse Bride. Emily's story is the stuff fairy tales are made of. Once in a love with a rich, handsome type that her parents did not approve of, she made the decision to elope. Only her fiancé had other plans. To be more specific, he killed her and ran off with her dowry. Not one to be deterred from her quest for true love, Emily decided to stick around the forest until a gentleman came along who would love her the way she deserved and for the rest of her afterlife.<br/><br/>Who hasn't been there before, more or less? Jilted by love one too many times, we wait for the perfect someone to come along and find us sitting there, sweeping us away with promises of forever. Like Emily, we might end up waiting a while. Are we as good as dead if we just sit and wait for love to find us? I know we're tired and broken but we're certainly not proactive if that's our approach.<br/><br/>Being dead isn't so bad in this town though. In fact, the underworld is a hell of a lot more swinging than the one up on the ground. Skeletal folk living it up, singing of love, in vivid, wild colour while the living focus on their bank balances and inappropriate behaviour at the dinner table. This contrast could have ended up being terribly blatant but Burton and Johnson aren't satisfied with leaving it so black and white. Victor and his intended bride-to- be are actually in love. Thus there is something worth fighting for, something worth living for, something ripe with possibility that grows amidst the drab, dark despair of this supposed life. <br/><br/>to both push this story forward and kill some time, Burton and Johnson rely heavily on misplaced musical numbers, The opening song is promising but so much time goes by without another song popping up that you forget you're even watching a musical. And despite my reluctance to make obvious comparisons, I can't help but miss the jubilant and disturbing soundtrack to Burton's previous, more cohesive stop-motion film, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". Thankfully, the characters are both animated and voiced so symbiotically that the visual feast is more than enough to keep your stomach from growling with discontent. In fact, it was mostly during scenes where no one was singing that I was hungry for more.<br/><br/>Hope always manages to make its presence known in the demented world of Burton films and, in the case of ""The Corpse Bride"", it carries you through to the end believing in love and the sacrifices one must make to let that love grow. One character asks, ""Can a heart still break once it's stopped beating?"" The answer is found in the awesomely lively eyes of the already decaying Corpse Bride herself, a woman subjected to understand that if you try to keep life locked under glass, be that yours or someone else's, death is the only inevitability."

The songs are one thing. Elfman, a great composer and long-time collaborator, seems to just kind of sleep walk through this one. Nothing really catchy in the way of songs, which was a big part of Nightmare. The other thing, the story just kind of left the whole sub-plot of the bride and the duke.

"bigben5","7","0","0","8 October 2005"," Great animation, razor thin plot
","Tim Burton has to be one of my favorite directors of all time. It's not just his talent but his sick and twisted imagination that makes things interesting to watch. Things don't just come to life , they are elaborate and pop out at you, dragging you into the world he creates. Such is the case with Corpse Bride. It's a delight to watch but unfortunately, is only able to hold itself together with a razor thin plot that keeps the mess from falling apart - just like a real corpse.<br/><br/>The plot holes in the movie are many and its only fair to list a few. For one, all the characters in the film are one-dimensional and its very difficult to sympathize or know any of them. Why is Emily so desperate to wed? Why is Victor such a wimp? What is his background? The characters might as well have been labeled character A and B, for the film never bothers to answer them. Then again, the film was too short anyway.<br/><br/>Another big plot point that ruins the film is the love between Victor and Victoria. Funny how their names are similar isn't it? Both characters suffer from what I call the Titanic syndrome. I remember when the Titanic first came out in theaters, everyone cried when Leonardo Dicaprio's character died. I thought it was stupid because the two hadn't met for more than 3 days and nobody in the real world ever falls in love that quickly. It's the same thing with Victor and Victoria, both characters have NEVER met and yet in their first encounter they swear eternal love for each other. I don't know about you but I don't find prearranged marriages very romantic, nor can I understand why Victor falls for Victoria when he spends all of his screen time with Emily, the Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>Still another point to be considered is the world of the dead which Emily comes from. For one, how is it that Victor is able to live for several days down there without food and water? I also don't get how Emily knows everyone down there, when she says she spent all of her time lying under a dead tree, waiting for her love to free her. So which is it? Is it her spirit that inhabits the underworld or her actual physical body? She can't be in two places at the same time!<br/><br/>Now for some good points.<br/><br/>The animation itself is probably the best I've seen for a stop-motion picture to date. It flows much more fluidly and natural than anything I've ever seen before. Even the colors are good. There are also a lot of heart-warming and funny moments, all carefully crafted, which make it an enjoyable movie. Even the musical scores by Danny Elfman are good (well, not all of them). For the most part it seemed like a convenient way to explain things that should have been part of the plot. ""So why are you dead Emily?"", ""Good question Victor, let's sing about it!""<br/><br/>All in all, I do recommend this movie and DID enjoy it despite it's flaw. It makes for a great flick for kids and adults for all ages. Just make sure to park your brain at the door when you watch it.<br/><br/>B"

","Like many of those who have already commented, I am no stranger to Tim Burton's work. I grew up watching Beetljeuice and the spin off cartoon that followed, along with Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Sleepy Hollow and of course, the masterpiece Nightmare Before Christmas.<br/><br/>When I walked into the theater, I already knew not to expect anything like Nightmare Before Christmas and it seems most people have. This is unfair to compare two different films, though they are made in the same manner. And this is where the movie starts to fail, as people come out of the theater and proclaim ""It was okay, but it was no Nightmare"".<br/><br/>Corpse Bride delivers exactly as it says. However, it was lacking so much character development that once the end arrives, you know the movie is too short. Who are these people? Who is Victor? Why does he like butterflies? Who is Victoria and why does she fall for Victor so easily? What about the Corpse Bride? They give us a measly explanation but there is still so much missing from these main characters that it is criminal. What about the villain? Great villains need background and development too. The plot seemed a bit rushed which was tragic and probably led to the lack of characterization. And as for the people who complain about wanting more about the Underworld...what more do you want to see? It's full of dead people. There isn't much more you can explore there.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, Corpse Bride is a cherished Tim Burton movie. He brings all the essentials in this package, delighting the fans of his work with familiar faces like Depp and Elfman, along with the key theme to most of his movies; the Outsider. Don't see this film because you want to see a great story -it is a predictable one. Instead, go and see it because of its beautiful animation and its homage to those who enjoy the taste of the morbid."

Even the naming of the lead characters, (Victor and Victoria) shows a disarming disregard for or lack of imagination. The songs are utterly forgettable and thankfully few and far between. It would seem that given the cash cow that The Nightmare Before Christmas merchandising has become, the powers that be would make sure that this film contained enough highly recognizable characters to plaster on t-shirts, lunch pails, etc., but other than the three leads, the dog and an annoying worm, one would be hard pressed to distinguish one character from another, in fact most of the characters seemed like bland Nightmare Before Xmas rejects. The villain, whose evil plot and purpose is revealed and dismissed in three lines, should have been a memorable, darkly drawn character that young goth chicks would want emblazoned on everything from their backpacks to pantyhose, but instead is like a smarmy Saturday morning cartoon scoundrel. I counted four times when the audience seemed to genuinely laugh out loud, which sort of disqualifies this from being a comedy.

","Tim Burton's second stop-motion animation movie (following ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""). Meek, mild and VERY thin Victor Van Dort (voice of Johnny Depp) is going to marry beautiful Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson)...but he's not sure if he's ready for marriage. He (accidentally) puts his wedding ring on the finger of a skeleton's hand. This reanimates the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) who assumes he wants to marry her! And it's a musical too! As you can see this is pretty silly--but stories are never very strong in Tim Burton movies. The visuals are the first concern and they ARE incredible. The animation is flawless--the characters move fluidly and some of the sets are really incredible. There's also tons of visual gags (my favorite is when Victor tells the skeleton dog to roll over...and play dead) and the songs are actually not bad--the score from Danny Elfman is great and there's a skeleton song and dance that stops the movie. But I didn't really like it.<br/><br/>I found it slow...even at 75 minutes (I dozed off at one point!) and all the sets are (purposely) very gloomy in dark colors--the film looks like it was shot in black & white at times. It fit the story but started to wear down on me--I was getting depressed! The jokes really don't work--some do but most just sit there. The total lack of logic in the plot began to annoy me--there was a twist at the end that I thought was particularly contrived. However the voices DID fit the characters and it was interesting to look at. But I need more than visuals to keep me interested. If you're a Tim Burton fan you'll probably love this--but I can only truthfully give it a 6."

","""Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice - wherefore art thou, Beetlejuice?"" That's actually a line from the Saturday morning cartoon show spun off from the original Beetlejuice movie - which is among one of the hippest cartoon shows ever made. As an ongoing series, it was able to develop the Land of the Dead, which could only appear as a back-drop in the original film, as a complete alternate universe. And it took chances - Beetlejuice ate bugs and vomited and even farted a couple times, while his Goth Earthling friend expressed her contempt for the boringly routine lives of her parents. It was an exercise in bad-taste-as-comic-gestalt, and it was targeted to young people mature enough to get in on the joke.<br/><br/>All of this is exactly what is lacking in ""The Corpse Bride"". Given an opportunity to recreate the Land of the dead as a completely realized world unto itself, one would expect Burton to really give us a world we should like to visit (even if we also want to sure to leave anytime we wanted). Instead, Deadland here is again treated as a back-drop. And the story that unfolds before it is harmlessly sentimentalized and neither scary nor funny.<br/><br/>Two definitive moments: Johnny Depp's character, supposedly a chief protagonist in the film, is not very smart, not hip at all, and incredibly wishy-washy - a complete waste of the vocal talents of Mr Depp. Second, the film's villain - a lame, predictable stereotype - if you have seen a couple Disney cartoons made after WWII, you could probably write all of his lines without seeing this film.<br/><br/>What a waste! And stop-motion being as difficult as it is, it's entirely incomprehensible why Burton would throw it all away on such a wholly mediocre story with such dull, unattractive characters.<br/><br/>The really sad thing is, this is aimed at children - but not the young hipsters who enjoyed the Beetlejuice cartoon show, but the great unwashed of Middle America, where people still think evolution is a dangerous idea.<br/><br/>I suppose that, for children, this is harmless enough - but who wants a harmless movie about the Land of the Dead from Tim Burton? What a waste!"

","In these times, 3-D animation has practically killed off 2-D. All-CGI movies flood the cinemas. But even the most realistic CGI just feels fake to me. Corpse Bride offers an alternativestop-motion animation, where hand-made puppets are photographed one frame at a time.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride centers on Victor (Depp), on the night before his arranged marriage to a woman named Victoria. After blowing the wedding rehearsal, Victor flies to the woods to practice by himself. He puts the ring on a twig, pretending it is Victoria's finger. The twig turns out to be the decaying finger of Emily, the corpse bride (Carter), a woman who waited until her death for her fiancée.<br/><br/>Thus, Victor accidentally marries Emily. The movie goes downhill from there, though it is boring from beginning to end. I did not give Corpse Bride this rating because I thought Nightmare was better, like I see many do. I gave the rating because the movie just plain sucks. Recently, Nightmare became popular with Hot Topic shoppers and others who only pretend their lives are miserable. Corpse Bride seems like an attempt to cash in on that demographic. Either that, or Tim Burton has forgotten how to make a movie without Gothic visuals, dark humor, and haunting music from Danny Elfman. Someone should tell Tim that he directed Pee-Wee's Big Adventure twenty years ago. Then, maybe he'll stop giving us garbage like Corpse Bride and Michael Jackson and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>Pros: -At least Johnny Depp fakes a British accent well.<br/><br/>-Making a stop-motion animated film takes a while. Burton gets an A for effort.<br/><br/>Cons: -Corpse Bride has a pretty bad script. At different points, Victor seems to fall in love with both brides for no reason. And in another scene, Victor inexplicably climbs up a wall just like Spider-Man.<br/><br/>-The filmmakers fail to make Victor a protagonist I cared about, let alone like. In fact, I'll cover all the characters in this section. I saw nothing new. The filmmakers bothered not to flesh out the characters and make them interesting.<br/><br/>-Only one running gag uses the 3-D animation well, a corpse who often splits in half vertically. That one gag does not justify the use of these puppets. It all just feels like an attempt to cash in on Nightmare fans.<br/><br/>-Some guy sitting in front of me actually laughed at some of the other gags. I didn't laugh at all.<br/><br/>-The aforementioned Spider-Man scene also gives Danny Elfman an excuse to recycle his music from Spider-Man. Overall, Corpse Bride seemed to recycle music from Elfman's resumé.<br/><br/>-Same goes for the use of Nightmare's Gothic visuals. Same goes for this movie in general. Everyone just did it for the money."

","Even it's my 2nd Tim Burton's of the year, proving that he is one of the finest director, Corpse's Bride is a major disappointment.<br/><br/>Its flaws are its very dark mood and the lack of funny moments. Unlike ""Nightmare before Christmas"", which is its unavoidable reference, nothing here to balance the Gothic: a lavished town, greedy characters, a cold forest in the night, a chilly church, a sad love story... If the hope of the world of after life could bring more light, I don't find it poetic but ridiculous, tidy and boring (i don't like big band jazz). The exceptional fairy spirit of Jack Skelllington is dead, as well as the humor of the Bettlegeuse, Joker or martians....<br/><br/>Well, except for a great score of the little Mozart (as always, and this time with a simple piano theme...), my only memory is all this sadness. As i am not depressive or Gothic, I don't think I will see it again....."

","Tim Burton is an exceptional auteur. Few directors have made such a stylistic mark on the viewing public as he has. He creates wonderful visuals in all of his films, but his talent for directing is another matter. His films, unfortunately, are largely hit or miss. He is mostly able to create deep connections between his off-beat characters and the audience, but this is not the case in the Corpse Bride. <br/><br/>None of the characters are inherently sympathetic, and the film is not nearly long enough to understand their emotions or motives on anything but the most superficial level. (I hate to make the Nightmare Before Christmas comparison, but at 76 minutes, it's actually exactly as long as tNBC. Dir. Henry Selick utilized his short time to a greater emotional level, plus the songs in that film told decisive parts of the story, which they don't in the Corpse Bride.)<br/><br/>The style is quite appealing, but the angles, spirals, and dark alleys of Halloween Town were that much more effective because of the far more intriguing characters that inhabited it. <br/><br/>The music and songs felt mostly forced, and I left the theater not having any of the tunes left lingering in my head. <br/><br/>All-in-all though, the film is fine. The plot is dull, the characters are dull, the music is dull, but it is mostly captivating in the theater, simply due to the visuals. See it for the animation. And hope that Burton takes his time, and next chooses a project that relies less on looking ""spooky"", and more on simple, quality characterization."
"GoddessArtemis85","6","3","8","14 October 2005"," Don't expect NBC...
","Yes, I judged this one harshly. And, may I say, Tim Burton, I'm disappointed in you. Then again, perhaps it's my own fault for walking into what could be considered a kids' movie and expecting the plot not to be transparent. I had everything except for the finest details pegged within about 15 or 20 minutes. Yes, the resolution to the love triangle was nice, but I wish there'd been a little more mystery on who it would be. Some of the death puns were a little overbearing, but the spoof sequences were quite enjoyable. (I'll admit, the Gone with the Wind one got applause from this fan.) The music was quite good, but the songs were a little lacking. Overall though, I majorly *heart* Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>In sum, my suggestion is don't walk into Corpse Bride expecting to see glory and creativity that is Nightmare Before Christmas...or even anything very close to it. While charming, The Corpse Bride is not the fine work of art it could have been. Nice try, Tim, but I expect better next time."

And the plot was an interesting premise, but it didn't seem to really take off. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed it, but like Nightmare before Christmas, I just didn't agree with all the hype.

"qball_82","5","8","34","16 September 2005"," What's that smell?
","No, I didn't like this film. I really wanted to. I was so looking forward to it. It looked wonderful. It stank.<br/><br/>The Corpse Bride marks Burton's 2nd foray into the world of stop motion animation, a technique that produced the amazing Nightmare Before Christmas. A cult classic, if I may say so myself. One of my all time favorite movies.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the role of a bumbling fool (sound familiar?) in Victorian times, about to enter into an arranged marriage of social status and wealth. After a disastrous wedding rehearsal, Depp's Victor is stumbling through the forest where he unwittingly weds himself to the titular character of the film, the Corpse Bride (played by a sassy Helena Bonham Carter). Macabre, animated mayhem ensues...yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>So what went wrong for the Bride? This film suffers from that fatal flaw that so many animated films these days fall victim to. The story, the characters, the heart, they all take a backseat to the whizz bang visuals on screen. Burton has no restraint as he dazzles us with breathtaking imagery that rival today's ubiquitous 3D fare for beauty and awe. The problem is, it gets old real fast. With no story to feast on, no characters to care about, it got boring. The chuckles and giggles that came from the predictable sight gags and puns petered out to silence halfway through.<br/><br/>A classic case of all style and no substance. Slap in a number of forgettable musical numbers that merely seem to be an excuse to create even more on screen silliness and you have a bona-fide yawn fest.<br/><br/>I know this all sounds harsh, but it was Burton himself who set the bar so high his first time around.

","To Hell with Tim Burton. To Hell with him and his Gothic garbage. It's old, it's tired, and I, for one, am sick of it.<br/><br/>These were the thoughts coursing through my head after watching Tim Burton's ""The Corpse Bride."" Now, please understand that I like Tim Burton - I admire his unique visual style, loving ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Big Fish,"" ""Mars Attacks!"" (quite underrated, I believe), ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and ""Beetle Juice,"" but unlike all those Hot Topic idiots out there, I won't enjoy a film just because he had a hand in it.<br/><br/>I found that ""Corpse Bride"" featured wonderful animation and great voice casting...and, well, that's about it. Even the music, once again by Burton-favorite Danny Elfman, was hardly worthwhile. The movie had four songs in it, and only one was actually worth listening to (""Remains of the Day""?). I believe the great composer is capable of much more, though it's hard to tell because the production quality of the songs in this and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was awful - the vocals in the songs was drowned out significantly by the music, rendering the words almost indecipherable.<br/><br/>The movie had a pincushion of a plot, hardly flowing at all. Victor (Johnny Depp) jumped from Victoria (Emily Watson) to Emily, the film's title character (Helena Bonham Carter) and back again so many times in the 77 minute-long film, it was almost laughable by the end.<br/><br/>It was almost as if the writers gave the animators a draft of the script, and then when it came time to finish, the animators asked for the final draft, and the writers collectively shrugged, saying, ""Eh, no one will notice."" (Granted, perhaps the humorously short runtime was the only real saving grace of this ""film""...still, 77 minutes is still painfully long for a bad joke.)<br/><br/>Oh, and the end: utterly ridiculous and completely nonsensical; it wasn't ""magical""...it was just plain bad writing. This God-awful attempt at a fairytale-like ending made me question just when ""rebelling against Hollywood"" became synonymous with bad movie-making.<br/><br/>While I do enjoy most Tim Burton's films, he is definitely not the omnipotent film-making powerhouse Hot Topic wants me to believe he is, wowing everyone with each and every movie he helps to create; he can cure cancer for all I care, but I will still never forgive him for ""Planet of the Apes."""
"imaginarytruths","5","3","9","24 September 2005"," disappointing, derivative, diminutively daring, deserves derision
","They should have gone with the Some Kind of Wonderful ending rather than the Pretty in Pink ending, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Much of the visual wit and even a couple of the songs were largely lifted from Nightmare Before Christmas. (When they're preparing the wedding cake, I dare you not to sing to yourself, ""Making Christmas, making Christmas, it's ours this time."") MANY of the characters have analogues in NBC, and in just about every case the NBC character was more interesting.<br/><br/>The villain is obvious. Painfully obvious. Makes the Shrek villains seem elegant and mysterious by comparison kind of obvious. The most uninspired creation of Burton's career.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Victor and Victoria is non-existent, and honestly neither one of them develops very much or does anything particularly interesting. If you're going to try to sell ""love at first sight"", they need more of a connection than a shared feeling of being put upon by their parents. It would have made a great starting scene if they were going to develop a relationship gradually or if they were going to become best friends, but not ""love at first sight."" Corpse Bride is the only remotely well developed character, but even in her case the pathos is a little lacking. (Remember in Toy Story 2 when the cowgirl is relating the story of becoming unwanted- Corpse Bride's story should have been that kind of sorrowful, but with a jazzier score). Helena Bonham Carter voices her perfectly, though, and she has a few nice scenes here and there.<br/><br/>Overall, disappointing and strangely conventional, premise and visuals notwithstanding."

","I too was intrigued by the idea of a Tim Burton movie with Johnny Depp, Helena Bonam Carter, and Christopher Lee. In fact, the movie is technically excellent. But, the music is so-so, and at the end I could only wonder why they bothered.<br/><br/>Everything about the movie says that it is better to be dead than alive. The Land of The Dead is colorful, the dead are cheerful and sincere while the living are greedy, deceitful, and colorless (lifeless?). What on earth does this mean? Does Burton want to say that only good people die? Or that bad people become good when they die? Although that last does not seem to be the case when Barkiss joins them, at the end. Perhaps there is another level of dead, because it seems the dead were going to do something terrible to the shade of Barkiss.<br/><br/>Even a fantasy has to make some kind of sense. Not this one. Sadly. ""Corpse Bride"" is not an awful movie, but the music is not good enough and the jokes are not funny enough, so you could do better things with your time than watch this movie."
"Coventry","9","2","5","14 November 2005"," The most enchanting film of 2005!
","No matter how pretty ""Finding Nemo"" looked, regardless how original the modeling clay of ""Chicken Run"" was or no matter how overwhelming ""Final Fantasy"" felt...the absolute best animation films come from the mind of cinema-genius Tim Burton. His new masterwork ""Corpse Bride"", as well as his older classic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", uses the delicate stop-motion technique, by which handicraft puppets are carefully moved by the millimeter. This modus operandi is quite time-consuming and fragile, but the result looks utterly beautiful and ""Corpse Bride"" is a lot more elegant and enchanting than the most advanced computer animation movie! Aside from being visually impressive, Tim Burton's newest film is also extremely funny, well-scripted and very swinging! The story is set in typical Burton-world with grim forests, morbid characters and  of course  politically incorrect jokes about death and decomposition. Whilst rehearsing his wedding vows in the nearby forest, the timid Victor van Dort accidentally resurrects (and weds!!) the corpse bride who has been waiting on that same spot since she was brutally murdered on her own wedding night. Despite the fact that he feels sorry for her and wishes to help, Victor urgently needs to get back to the living before his arranged bride is given to another man. The subject matter all seems very depressing and tragic but  knowing Burton's style  it's an often cheerful and energetic film. Instead of portraying the world of the deceased as a sad place, it's a colorful party palace where skeletons and rotting corpses drink and sing all night long. Heck, their world is a lot more fun than the world of the living and you almost feel sorry for the living because their existence is so black & white. The voices for all the terrific characters are splendidly cast. Tim Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter do great and our director honors horror veterans Christopher Lee and Michael Gough with outstanding guest appearances. Danny Elfman's music is flawless as always and the marvelous end-sequence is the most touching moment in animation cinema ever. My only regret was that this movie is way too short  only 75 minutes  and I wished it went on forever."

","Although a few of us have married corpse-like spouses, and those unions were doomed to hell from the start, Tim Burton in Corpse Bride depicts Victor (voice of Johnny Depp), a shy, awkward, introverted pianist actually marrying a corpse (Helena Bonham Carter), by error. Because this is stop-motion animation, even better visually than Burton's Nightmare before Christmas (1993), the expressions are artful and sweet, macabre and eccentric, all the while depicting with icy hilarity the pitfalls of arranged marriages and passive attitudes. <br/><br/>Along with the recent Just Like Heaven, Corpse Bride's dependence on love in its Platonic, non-corporeal form is entering the imaginations of contemporary writers in more than one film.<br/><br/>If you like your Edgar Allen Poe visual, this animation is for you. The characters from hell, such as Mr. Bonejangles, a Peter Lorre maggot knockoff, and a headwaiter with just a head, are Halloween scary and funny while the more normal living beings, such as Victor's social-climbing parents and fiancé Victoria's poor aristocrat parents, are already in their own pre-grave version of hell.<br/><br/>How Victor inadvertently weds a skeleton (albeit a curvey one) and gets dragged to hell is yours to find out. Meanwhile, sit back and enjoy the brilliance of a director whose imagination is scary.<br/><br/>From Shakespeare's ""Measure for Measure"":<br/><br/>"". . .

","It seems like basic Hollywood math. Tim Burton stop-motion animation the voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, and Christopher Lee = film-making at its finest. Still, Corpse Bride simply doesn't add up to much of anything.<br/><br/>If you've seen the previews for this films, you know the story already. Guy's marriage is arranged for him, he freaks out, goes into the woods, and accidentally marries a dead woman. Sounds Ashton Kutcher-esquire to me.<br/><br/>And the previews also show some of the wonderfully lush and imaginative visuals that Tim Burton provides. Really, the detail and polish of the animation here puts Nightmare Before Christmas to shame. The opening shot of a butterfly flying around a European village was one of the most beautiful shots I've seen in an animated film since the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast. Still, interesting visuals are not enough to carry a film.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Corpse Bride comes from one of Tim Burton's common film-making partners: Danny Elfman. While Elfman's songs for Nightmare Before Christmas were charming, well written, and integral to the story, the songs in corpse bride are uninteresting and unmemorable. It's hard for yours truly--the self proclaimed musical theater whore--to say that the worst part of this film was its songs and it would have been much better without them, but it's the truth. While listening to the songs of Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time inspires you to go out and buy the soundtrack (which by the way is a great addition to one's CD collection), listening to the songs of Corpse Bride for the first time inspired me to vomit and to write to Tim Burton asking him to urge his wife, Ms. Bonham Carter, to stick to acting instead of singing.<br/><br/>And then there are the problems with the plot and characters. The ending of the movie was more abrupt than Rene Zelwegger's breakup with Kenny Chessney, and certain characters that initially are introduced simply for the sake of a gag, such as the maggot that pops out of the bride's eye in those previews, keep coming back unnecessarily. In all honesty, though animation was a perfect medium for this story, the filmmakers should have considered ditching the family friendly feel of the movie. If this was done as a film for adults--minus the hideous songs--it would have been hysterical. Honestly, there need to be more films with jokes about necrophilia or getting a stiff one over a stiff one, and this could have been one of them.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Tim Burton, do yourself a favor. Take your $10 that you were planning to spend on a ticket to Corpse Bride, go to Blockbuster and rent Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, and Sleepy Hollow. You'll have a much more enjoyable time."
"StevePaget","5","2","6","19 November 2005"," A slightly stiff movie
","Tim Burton's previous big animation offering, The Nightmare before Christmas, was a pleasant enough offering. I never really fell for it as much as some of his devotees did, but I enjoyed its gloomy charm and the songs were fun. I was expecting more of the same sort of thing with Corspe Bride, and it seems that I wasn't far off.<br/><br/>The story is about a young man, the son of a wealthy fishmonger, who is due to marry the daughter of an aristocratic, but poor, family. The wedding rehearsals are a disaster and, one thing leading to another as they often do in films, the poor chap ends up being married to a corpse. I know, it doesn't seem to make sense, but it does at the time, trust me. So, instead of spending his honeymoon relaxing with his new bride, planning their future together (and, presumably, trying to remove the smell of fish from the rental tuxedo), he is instead dragged into the netherworld. With hilarious consequences.<br/><br/>Except there aren't really any hilarious consequences at all. To be honest, it felt a little (if you pardon the pun) lifeless. Johnny Depp is fine, not to mention barely recognisable, as the English-accented groom, Victor. Helena Bohnam-Carter (who assures us she had to audition for her husband, Tim Burton. Yeah right) is perfectly acceptable as the zombie newlywed. But, weird premise aside, the film is a bit predictable. There are some nice songs (though not up to Nightmare Before Christmas standards) and some decent jokes involving body parts and decomposition, but the story pretty much follows the path you might expect from a standard ""I married a dead chick"" movie.<br/><br/>Wait for video."
"TheNorthernMonkee","6","2","6","24 October 2005"," Easily forgettable disappointing muddle with weak songs
","SPOILERS For dark and twisted humour, is there anyone better than Tim Burton? The director of so many amazing films over the years, Burton chose 2005 to release two big films. Directing Johnny Depp in both ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Corpse Bride"" at the same time, Burton has attempted to create two superb films simultaneously. Sadly however, it feels like he has failed on both fronts. Whilst 'Charlie' was a dire affair with a complete lack of magic, ""Corpse Bride"" is a much more dark and lively effort. At the same time though, 'Bride' is mediocre and muddled with some instantly forgettable songs and a lack of real passion for any of the characters involved.<br/><br/>After messing up a wedding rehearsal to his new love, Victor Van Dort (Depp) heads off into the woods to practise his vows. Finally completing them, Victor's life takes an unexpected turn when he inadvertently marries himself to the long since deceased Emily (Helena Bonham Carter in the title role). Dragged down to the afterlife, where every day is a party, Victor finds himself caught in a love triangle which literally crosses the mortal divide.<br/><br/>Badly disorganised and possessing an ironic spiritless soul, ""Corpse Bride"" is just one massive disappointment. While it starts alright and develops from there, the story never really feels like it is waking up. This of course is no doubt Burton's intention. When in the living world, the story is dull, dark and monotonous. In the afterlife by contrast, everything is coloured, lively, and one long party. It's an obscure feeling, but it works well. Unfortunately, this works so well that during the living world, we get tired and bored. It's a shame that sometimes Burton is too good.<br/><br/>The story itself is not helped by what can only be the worst work of Danny Elfman's career. A legend when it comes to lyrics and tunes, Elfman can perform admirably. So it is with personal regret that he screws up so badly here. Yes we can appreciate his skill, but the songs are just too forgettable. You come out of the film and you want to hum along as you walk home. Yet you can't because you can't remember any. Gone are the days of ""What's This"" and other songs from the magical ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", and ultimately this film suffers for it.<br/><br/>Burton is a genius at what he does. Sometimes though, by being arrogant and dividing his time, and then simultaneously trying to get a process right, he can inadvertently mess up his own work. That is what has happened here. Succeeding in creating a living world without passion or ironically life, Burton has managed to convert half of his films screen time into a turgid monotonous affair. He isn't helped either by the failure of his friend Danny Elfman to come up with decent songs. All in all ""Corpse Bride"" is one big disappointment. It's an awkward error in judgement and sadly not the first one that Burton has done this year."
"aidanratesmovies","6","1","2","16 April 2020"," Interesting concepts bogged down by a dull script and story
","Although at times it can be sweet and amusing, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is ultimately robbed of its potential, by relying on tedious and often formulaic storytelling- and its vast dull nature to carry it. The film stars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter as Victor and the Corpse Bride herself. Both of them give rather decent voice performances, but unfortunately their work in the film is ultimately undermined by the film itself. Simply said, the film is rather a bore, and its dull nature and grim color pallet does nothing to help that fact. The film lacks much excitement at all, and at times, it just feels dead (pun intended). The film can be a bit amusing at times, and even romantic too, but it squanders the potential of all these interesting concepts, plotlines, and ideas by such a boring story and such tedious situations. In the end, Corpse Bride has some decent moments, but ultimately fails to stay together.

","Corpse Bride is a charming enough movie but it lacks flair. It's all very lukewarm. None of the songs really jumped out at me. The story is good, not great. The visuals are wonderful and the voice acting is impressive but that's not enough to drag it too high out of mediocrity for me."
"www-jats","9","1","2","23 January 2010"," This Movie is lovely. I a Dead Way
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride was one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. My mother and I are so happy that he made another beautiful and original animated film since The Nightmare Beofre Christmas because we waited for it for 10 years. I'm glad to say that the wait was worth it. The Corpse Bride is a wonderful emotional yet fun story with heart. We had a wonderful time watching it in the theaters and we can't wait to go see it again this weekend. The visuals are so amazing that you'd have to go see the movie with your own eyes for its impossible to explain there perfection. The characters all look stunning and there are so many wonderful new characters in this movie that will keep your eyes glued on the screen. The voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson are packed with fantastic emotion and acting. The score goes very well to the movie and the four songs that are performed sound wonderful. My favorites were ""Remains of the Day"" made me feel like dancing: it was such a jazzy fun song with the cool voice of Danny Elfmen. And my other favorite was ""Tears To Shed"" it broke my heart. Helena Bonham Carter sang that song with such heartbreak I loved it! The story is very entertaining and it has so much heart in it and Gothic like background. I loved the dialog some of my favorite lines were ""Why Go Up There When People Are Dying To Get Down Here"" and ""Can A Heart Still Break Once It's Stopped Beating."" But the most important thing is that this movie makes you feel less frightened about death. Death in this movie is a lot funner than living and the dead are always having a good time and partying that you feel like dying is not so bad. You should take anyone to see this movie if their paranoid about death it will soften their fears, Overall I strongly encourage anyone to go see this movie. I hope Tim Burten wins the Oscar for best animated movie this year. He truly deserves it! Thank you Mr. Burten for the Corpse Bride, Nightmare Before Christmas and years worth of your great films."

","One word for the movie: Beautiful! Corpse bride is the best animation I ever seen. When I watched it, I didn't feel like I was watching an animation because It's too great! All movie is covered by Tim Burton's style, and ,of course Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter were brilliant like they always do. I think their voices are perfect for Corpse Bride. Every time I watch the movie again and again, I still have the same feeling like the first time. Yep, I was really haunted. It became one of my favorite movies and will never be replaced. About the movie,It only lasts 76 minutes but I could feel all in it. It opened by a very beautiful scene: a butterfly fly away and it ended by a butterfly fly away too. It's so meaningful! My favorite scene have to be the moment when a boy came closer a skeleton, everybody( and me)thought that the boy was so scare and the skeleton would harm the boy but suddenly, the boy shout: Grandfather! That's was a touching moment! And I like The Piano Duet scene too cuz it's so romantic,it maybe the most romantic scene I've ever seen. The ending, it's just beautiful and no word can describe it. Just see it yourself and you will find out what I'm talking about.. About the soundtrack, It's awesome! Danny Elfman did a good job again like he did with The nightmare before Christmas. My favorite songs are Remains of the day, Tears to shed, The wedding song. I was really surprises when I know Danny Elfman sing on Remains of the day and Helena really sing on Tears to shed. They're all awesome!!(But why Johnny Depp doesn't sing on it? I really want to hear his voice, maybe I 'll wait for Sweeney Todd) My favorite instruments are The Piano Duet, Victor's Piano solo, moon dance, main titles (Danny Elfman- King of Main Titles), Ball & soccer lounge (It's fun!), Into the forest (start slowly..then suddenly move), the Finale (perfect for movie's ending)...I have to say that I love all the soundtrack but I wish The piano Duet could last longer and have a truly ending. If you haven't watch it yet , you should go find a DVD immediately and you will not regret, cuz, like I said, It's a piece of genius!"
"jzappa","7","1","2","10 September 2007"," An Atmospheric Parody of Tim Burton's Most Detailed Perceptions of People and Things
","Tim Burton's films are cultivated by the same halfway goth preteens that melt over Johnny Depp, and the feeling of the multiplex theater crowded with them on a late Friday or Saturday night with your own dynamic yet passive group of friends is felt through Corpse Bride even while one sits at home and watches it on a DVD rented from the public library. If Burton has fallen off in recent years with Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you must admit that there is still an atmosphere such as the one above mentioned in his more recent and continuing films. Whatever he does to carve and style his work for each generation's wave of odd but commercially compelling target audience is a great talent for subtlety.<br/><br/>While it isn't something very special that will stay with me much later, Corpse Bride is a film of Burton's I've truly liked after awhile not having made movies on the same wavelength as Ed Wood, which I adore. In Corpse Bride, the virtuously atmospheric clay animation is the outcome of Burton's very specific, meticulous, and imaginatively analytical ideas and artistic demands. The animation is able to depict parodies of his most detailed perceptions of people and things, and the clay element gives the film a very Gothic look which is his trademark. I was also surprised by the wonderful impact of the emotional finale."
"RiffRaffMcKinley","9","1","2","8 September 2007"," Tim Burton As Crazed Genius
","Ah, yes, Tim Burton: the Dr. Frankenstein of the movie industry. While his career has been mostly hit-and-miss (hit: this, ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Beetlejuice""; miss: ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Frankenweenie""), that doesn't make his ability to work any less phenomenal. And while he's a far cry from the best director ever, ""Corpse Bride"" puts him somewhere up there.<br/><br/>This amazing story is a very darkly comic musical about a man who unwittingly gets sucked into the abode of the dead... and a shocking contract with the tragic Corpse Bride! Oddly enough, Johnny Depp does his best work ever as a voice-only performance. Helena Bonham Carter, on the other hand, simply delivers a great quality to the Bride. What's great about this film is that it is just so like Burton, with its astounding Walt-Disney-meets-Edgar-Allen-Poe ingenuity. And to be completely honest, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is better, but ""Corpse Bride"" is much like Burton himself: not the best, but getting very near. I look forward to more of the director's stop-motion in the future."
"commandercool88","10","1","2","30 March 2007"," Animated Macabre
","It's difficult to find someone who hasn't heard of or seen a film that's come from the mind of Tim Burton. In a few short years, he's become a fixture of Hollywood with films like 'Sleepy Hollow', 'Big Fish', and this year's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' (all are fantastic, by the way). But for the first time, Burton pays homage to the style that put him on the map over ten years ago. He creates a tale that matches his definitive masterpiece, 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' (while he did not direct the film, he's credited with writing and producing roles in the pioneering production).<br/><br/>Based on a 19th century European folklore, 'Corpse Bride' takes place in - you guessed it - a dreary 19th century European village. Victor (Johnny Depp) is a timid young man who has been arranged to marry Victoria (Emily Watson), and neither have met each other prior to the rehearsal taking place a day before the ceremony is to happen. With pressure from both sides of the family, Victor escapes the confines of the village and seeks a refuge in the dark and chilling forest nearby. While he practices his vows, he ends up marrying a corpse bride (Helena Bonham-Carter) after mistakingly placing the ring on a (seemingly) tree root (the scene of resurrection is authentically creepy). Victor finds himself mixed up with the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead, where he must make a difficult and hard decision. It's a sweet tale of love lost, told in the classic Tim Burton style.<br/><br/>Complete with an all-star cast, many of whom have already appeared in one or more prior Burton films, 'Bride' is led by Johnny Depp and real-life wife Helena Bonham-Carter. For Depp, it's his fifth time delving into a Burton piece ('Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Sleepy Hollow', 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'), and his first time landing himself in a role where only his voice is required - not a bad start I'd say. For Bonham-Carter, it's her fourth time with her hubby ('Planet of the Apes', 'Big Fish', 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'), and her contributions give her the standout performance. The supporting cast is just as good, with contributions from the likes of Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Tracey Ullman, and Christopher Lee.<br/><br/>It's been five years since the last stop-animation feature ('Chicken Run'), and 'Corpse Bride' may just be the perfect rebuke to a growing industry of computer-animated films. It was a surprising move by Warner Bros. to entrust $40 million to Burton for the production, but it's clear that Burton is right at home in this disarmingly stunning film. He not only succeeds, he takes this 77-minute dramedy and spins it into a wildly entertaining macabre musical that's nothing short of genius. It's amazing that the most simplest of shots can be turned into a masterpiece, but Burton does just that. He once again proves his unique style, and it's undeniable, Tim's done it again.<br/><br/>The bittersweet fairy tale exceeds on every level. Visually and atmospherically, it's another masterpiece. Burton paints death more colorfully than living, and the variations between the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead are clearly visible, it may make one wish they were dead and could visit such a lively neighborhood where it feels like Halloween each and every day. Both the story and characters are rich, and the film progresses with such ease that the slim movie is, unfortunately, over nearly as soon as it begins. But worth noting is Danny Elfman, who has scored almost all of Burton's productions. He's had a busy year, what with 'Charlie' and now this, but Elfman finds himself with his most challenging job since 'A Nightmare Before Christmas'. Like 'Nightmare', Elfman not only scores the film, but writes a multitude of catchy and musically vibrant songs that enrich the film.<br/><br/>It's a wholly Burtonesque feature that'll be sure to delight die-hard fans everywhere (myself included). It's stunningly beautiful and fun, but it also has a heart that's very much alive. It's a balancing mix of horror, humor, and love that'll win over the hearts of its viewers. The whimsical and eerie atmosphere is truly like nothing else at the movies today. At the hands of now-veteran Tim Burton, it soars into flight and never looks back. Sure to become an instant cult classic, it's a touching portrait of tragedy that just demands to be seen. Burton has rarely been in such top-notch form, and his 'Corpse Bride' is not only the best film of 2005, but it's the best film to come around in some time. It's not good, nor is it great. It reaches a level of pure brilliance and genius that few have ever even attempted. I haven't looked forward to dying this much in a long time."
"leeho730","9","1","2","29 March 2007"," Beautifully animated film
","Kudos to Tim Burton for creating this excellent animated films-this is his recreation of Andersen's The Little Mermaid. Amid many light-themed animated films, Tim Burton created the Gothic, gory world of the dead so convincingly attractive that the real world (the ""upstairs"") felt rather lifeless.<br/><br/>His cliché use of colours and musics, to contrast the living world and the dead world, not to mention the subtle difference in animations of characters themselves, is very effective. Even Victoria looks and acts monotonous. Voice acting and animation themselves were top-notch, 'nuff said.<br/><br/>I believe the true heroine of this film is Emily, the Corpse Bride. Despite being dead, she is full of... vibes, colourful. She's also virtuous, compassionate, talented... what more do you want from a heroine? All the other dead people were also very attractively positive, sociable, original, and humorous.<br/><br/>The only problem I have regarding this movie, that prevented me from giving it 10, is that firstly, this is too short IMHO for such a great movie, and secondly, Tim Burton is never going to release The Corpse Bride 2.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. Should have watched in a theatre, not in DVD."
"andres_canella","6","1","2","12 February 2007"," A Good Second Attempt
","The setting is a 19th century cobblestone town, and the story begins with a hateful couple living in a ghastly mansion, once luxurious, but decrepit from years of dwindling funds. They intend to marry off their daughter Victoria (Emily Watson) to a rich family and restore their family's former glory. Thus, Victor (Johnny Depp) meets Victoria and love blooms. Clumsy with his vows, Victor wanders off into the forest only to accidentally marry a corpse (Helena Bonham Carter). Great fun ensues. A co-directorial effort by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, The Corpse Bride draws various similarities to 1993's The Nightmare Before Christmas due to the use of stop-motion animation and Burton's involvement in the creative process. These comparisons are unfortunate, as The Corpse Bride is a much different film altogether. The story and content is much more accessible to a wide audience, but it may be argued that the art and music lags slightly behind its spiritual predecessor.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is no newcomer to the stop-motion animated forum. Whilst Nightmare was directed by Henry Selick, Burton has had a long history of interest in this realm of animated film. As such, The Corpse Bride is the most perfected of the genre; a little piece of trivia floating around has indicated it took animators twenty-eight shots to make the character's blink. The careful attention to detail and intensity of the work of the animator's pays off in a big way; Corpse Bride is a fully immersive world where character's move smoothly and colors expertly blend together. Some of the character designs, especially in the world of the dead, are comedic: one such being General Bonesapart (Deep Roy), a skeletal image of the historic figure with a blade through his chest. Characters in the real world have accentuated features, such as a depressed face or baggy eyes, portraying the town as a tired place suffering from boredom.<br/><br/>Perhaps an error made with The Corpse Bride was in making it partly a musical as well. The combination worked expertly for Nightmare Before Christmas, which boasts some of the finest examples of animated themes in history. However, apart from a melodic and haunting tune from the Corpse Bride, the music never really engages in the film. Even the singing seemed muddled at parts, making it hard to follow along with the seemingly clever words. Having omitted the musical portions, the feature may have benefited from a few more scenes in the land of the dead, which never came to life quite as convincingly as Halloweentown. What is left are wonderfully composed piano pieces by Danny Elfman, and a hauntingly beautiful story that only Tim Burton could craft on screen. When viewers can feel pity for a rotting corpse with an eye that falls and uncovers a green maggot who talks, then that is quite a feat in itself. (7/10 Good)"

","Ever since Tim Burton created the exceptional Nightmare Before Christmas, I've been eagerly awaiting a follow-up. And with the Corpse Bride, we have one of sorts. Not a sequel in the strictest sense of the word, but it has the same energy and spirit, and with a much more substantial story, Corpse Bride emerges as one of the finest stop-motion animated films ever made.<br/><br/>If you've ever seen Beetlejuice, then you'll remember that scene towards the end when Geena Davis starts turning into a skeleton while wearing her wedding dress. That one scene may have been the inspiration for Corpse Bride. In fact many elements of Beetlejuice crop up in this film, but where that film was an assemblage of madcap sight gags, here we have a much more tightly focused story to toe the line.<br/><br/>In a story that alternates between the land of the living and the dead, the meek Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp) is the son of parents who have just come into a lot of money. While the horrible Everglots (voiced by Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney) are snobbish aristocrats fallen on hard times. They plan to marry off their daughter, Victoria to Victor so they can get their hands on the money.<br/><br/>Victor is not so sure about marriage, and makes a complete mess of the wedding rehearsal. He runs off into the woods to practise his vows, and places the wedding ring on a twig that looks like a finger. And is instantly betrothed to Emily, the Corpse Bride!<br/><br/>Emily (a lovely performance from Helena Bonham Carter) takes her new husband down to the underworld that is her home, delighted that she's fulfilled her (un)life long dream of marriage. Victor on the other hand is less than thrilled, and only wants to return home. But Emily is not prepared to let him go that easily. And the Everglots have plans for Victoria, now that Victor is out of the picture. They intend to marry her off to the dastardly (but wealthy!) Barkis Bittern (Richard E Grant).<br/><br/>Corpse Bride really is a fantastic film. Lots of great characters, flawless animation and a touching story too. What more could anyone ask? The animation portrays the people above ground in a permanent monotone world of greyish gloom, similar to Burton's Sleepy Hollow. These people are horrible, selfish and motivated only by personal gain. But Burton makes their character flaws witty to behold, especially the way they look with bulging bug eyes, wafer thin arms, legs and necks, and colourless skin.<br/><br/>The living dead on the other hand is where Burton has the most fun. A colourful, vibrant world where every nook and cranny is populated by characters so oddball they wouldn't have looked out of place in HalloweenTown.<br/><br/>It's with these characters where Burton's sympathies lie. In the case of Emily, she is portrayed as a lonely figure, jilted at the altar when she was alive, and died before she got the chance to walk down the aisle. Helena Bonham Carter transforms Emily from what could very easily have been a maudlin, unbearable character into a moving, sympathetic person. Her loneliness is affecting, never false. And her current dilemma touching instead of mawkish. But she balances it with enough light humour to make Emily not only a warm individual, but also one of Tim Burton's most memorable female creations.<br/><br/>Although the songs from Danny Elfman are nowhere near as toe-tapping as the ones from TNBC, they do provide one very catchy number with a group of skeletons doing a jazzy, blues number that use their bodies as musical instruments.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has also amassed an impressive voice cast, some comprising his favourites. Although Johnny Depp plays pretty much the same person he did in Sleepy Hollow, he makes Victor an amusing hero with a passable English accent. His relationship with Emily is nice to watch, and the scenes where they play the piano together are really quite charming.<br/><br/>Also present and correct are Burton faves Christopher Lee and Michael Gough, who gives a wonderfully dignified performance as one of the undead elders. Also look out for a maggot that lives in Emily's eye socket, that looks and sounds suspiciously like Peter Lorre.<br/><br/>The grand finale is quite moving, and especially the final scene is a moment that will stay with you long after the film is over. I can't remember the last time I felt so moved at the end of a film. A shame, that like The Nightmare Before Christmas the Corpse Bride performed poorly at the box office. Especially when so much time and effort went into making these dazzling films. Still, TNBC gathered a cult following over the years, and hopefully, time will be just as kind to Corpse Bride. I think it will."

","It's funny, it's raving, it's dark, it's filled with dark humor. It's a Tim Burton movie! It was exiting to see an animation feature from Burton because his storytelling is very dreamy and so vibrant. He had produced ""The Night Before Christmas"" which was something extraordinary and howling funny. Another animation feature he produced was ""Jim and the Giant Peach"". Now Burton was sitting on the thrown of director.<br/><br/>Another exiting point was the fact that he had so interesting and talented cast to work with. His favorites Johnny Depp, wife Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney and frightening, legendary Christopher Lee joined comedians like Joanna Lumley and Tracey Ullman was worth of seeing. All of them put their heart and soul doing voices and every character sounded and somewhat even looked like their flesh and blood figures.<br/><br/>Burton's most longterm collaborator, composer Danny Elfman made just incredible job by composing another great fitting music to the film. Lively lyrics of Underworld to the dark and deeply melancholy tunes of Upperworld it was like the carnival of likable creeps. Elfman himself even performed some of the songs.<br/><br/>An interesting point of view was to rumble the two worlds around. Down under the dead were lively and colorful when at same time on earth people were depressingly gray. Maybe at six feet under life's not as bad as you could think.<br/><br/>With seen the behind the scenes material you're starting to respect the slow process of animators. So huge applauds to all the animators in the business! With animate characters and all their expressions is even more slow than regular drawing animation (Repects also to them).<br/><br/>Despite the little too guessable ending ""Corpse Bride"" is strong story of love beyond the grave. It is more mightier you could have ever imagine.<br/><br/>Gothic era is not over! Yieh!"
"MrGrundle","7","1","2","8 June 2006"," Where there's an light that burns brighter...
","Life is dull and oppressive, cast in washed out grays and blues by Tim Burton in THE CORPSE BRIDE. Reminiscent of Burton's BEETLEJUICE, the life of the living pales (literally and figuratively) in comparison to the land of the dead.<br/><br/>Victor (Depp) is thrust into the latter by serendipitous calamity, where bebop skeletons jive among eclectic backgrounds painted in vibrant colors. It is these lush visuals that carry the weight of the film, filling the screen from corner to corner. Also outstanding is the voice acting. Albert Finney's gruff voice is wonderfully befitting of the stout, scowling character it is attached to, and Emily Watson is a good choice to convey wholesome daintiness (notice that her cheeks are the only thing in the living world with color, a cheesy but cute allusion to the 'thing that makes life worth living'). I wonder if Richard E. Grant was cast because of the script's homage to HOW TO GET A HEAD IN ADVERTISING (1986). There are certainly similarities between the Peter Lorre worm rambling in the eponymous character's skull and the talking boil that drives Mr. Grant mad in How To Get A Head.<br/><br/>The basic plot is clever and endearing, and the characters are all solid, if somewhat limited at times. The primary fault I found with this film is that it doesn't approach the glory of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISMAS, a true classic. The bebop skeleton number is great, but on the whole the songs aren't as good as in The Nightmare. Neither are the characters, the story, the pace or the animation for that matter, perhaps only the voice acting here surpasses its predecessor. That doesn't make this a substandard film though, THE CORPSE BRIDE is very entertaining, and a must see for fans of NIGHTMARE, BEETLEJUICE and Burton in general, but do not expect it to eclipse those prior works.<br/><br/>7/10* RECOMMENDED...Very entertaining, missing something though"
"Two_Pieces_of_Christina","7","1","2","28 May 2006"," Depp and his stiffy.
","The plot here is definitely secondary to the stylistic value of this animated film, but I'll give an explanation anyway. Johnny Depp's Victor Van Dort is a hapless, affable though well-intentioned young man who is being co-erced into an arranged marriage by his parents to Emily Watson's Victoria Everglot. Victor and Victoria meet accidentally and it's a joining of kindred spirits (pardon the pun) so they are keen for the marriage to go ahead despite the bullying from their respective parents.<br/><br/>The marriage rehearsal does not go well, however, and Victor is forced to promise to get his vows perfect before the big day. And, as all good plans in spooky films go, a late night stroll through the woods is in order. The climax of Victor's finally perfect speech sees him place the wedding ring jubilantly on a twig - a twig that's shaped strangely like a skeletal human hand.<br/><br/>The earth shakes and up rises Helena Bonham Carter's Corpse Bride: she's blue, she's half skeleton, she died in mysterious circumstances, and she also believes Victor's vows to be sincere. A curse made in her grave takes effect... Victor and the Corpse Bride are man and wife. This is when the fun starts.<br/><br/>Burton's films are so striking in their visuality that there's never any doubt you're watching one of his films. Corpse Bride is no exception; the whole film is a feast for the eyes and the senses. The set pieces during the musical numbers are outstanding and some of the characters' body shapes are mildly disturbing (in a good way). Depp and Bonham Carter are endearing in their roles, particularly Depp - you'd be hard pressed to guess the shy, bumbling Victor is voiced by a movie legend, and Bonham Carter even gets to sing a little. I wonder, did they record their dialogue, along with Deep Roy (who played the Oompa Loompas in Charlie...) during a lunch break whilst filming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? <br/><br/>Of course, as with most films, there are some minor disappointments in Corpse Bride. The plot is somewhat clichéd and predictable. It also finishes rather abruptly. There are some extremely child-friendly characters, namely the Maggot and the Black Widow Spider which seem only to be there for mild amusement (extremely mild from where I was sitting). And whilst the set pieces leave nothing to be desired, the songs and lyrics leave a lot.<br/><br/>As for whether Corpse Bride matches Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton's other full-length animation, I'd say it falls fairly short. Corpse Bride is more mainstream and less likely to attract a cult status due to its child-friendly aspects and missed opportunities for spookiness. I felt Burton et al could have got away with a lot more with its PG rating; for a Halloween film the spook-meter is very low.<br/><br/>Overall, Corpse Bride is a must-see for existing fans of Burton. For new fans, it's more of a gentle introduction to his style of spooky animation than his previous works. Watch it if you fancy something a little different."

","Tim Burton's Nightmare Before x-mass wan an awesome work in stop motion animation, making me and countless others, watch it again and again. I thought , it couldn't be out-done. but he did it with Corps Bride for sure. it premiered at out campus at the university of new Mexico, and we all waited some three hrs to get to see it!.the movie is full of deep life's sentiment and philosophical messages with an end result that it brings you dropping tears at the end, though, with a perfect feel of resolution. in bringing the dead and living together, you're really not sure which way the story is taking you, an art of keeping it in suspense as this movie does so skilfully to the end. and when it's least expected, the resolution comes with a very sentimental act and comment by the murdered bride. it certainly touched my heart and soul, more than one way. I am brave to admit that this movie became another one of Tim Burton's works that I watch repeatedly, I'm not gonna say how many times!! the music, in particular, the piano piece, comes in at a very perfect time where groom is awaiting his living bride, while sitting at the piano. a beautiful , yet , simple piece on piano, puts you at a perfect moment and harmony with what's happening as the story unfolds in front of your eyes"
"Artistic_Differences","10","1","2","12 April 2006"," Beautiful and Dreamy yet Simple at Heart
","To put it simply, this movie is a jewel: After being in love with it for quite the time, I have decided to settle down and write a review for it, because no matter how much praise it gets, this short animation film deserves more.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie which will not leave you unhappy; there's a little bit for everyone in this masterpiece. Are you one for emotional, expressive characters? Then you'll like it: not only are the characters, even those more minor, cutely designed and each with unique, sweet strands of quirky personality in themselves, but the clay models' expressivity is sometimes more than that of some bland actors and actresses. The voices are wonderfully implemented too, with Johnny Depp taking into the role of the main focus, dreamy Victor van Dort, and Emily Watson voicing Victoria, his sweet and naïve 'human' fiancée. But the true star is unequivocally Helena Bonham-Carter as the alluring Corpse Bride herself, the bubbly and sexy Emily, whose emotions switch swiftly from happy to sad to angry  and you really won't want to mess with this Bride! Of course, the rest of the cast is placed just as aces, with Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse as the Van Dorts, Victor's status-hungry parents, Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney as the stuck-up and aristocratic Everglots (and, in the best possible way, these were *perfectly* voiced), and Richard E. Grant as the dark, refined and depraved Lord Barkis Bittern.<br/><br/>The score? Striking, simply, a perfect ten. You really couldn't get anybody better than Danny Elfman to do this job, and even with him, I don't doubt it must cost a painful amount of time and effort to compose such a perfectly fit soundtrack, but as it is? In my opinion, it couldn't be better. This man just seems to hit the spot every time, and although nobody would miss a few songs more (comparing this to Nightmare Before Christmas, the result is rather less quantitative), you can tell the songs are a definite improvement, from the repetitive tunes of NMBC to the full songs, complete with lyrics which tell portions of the story as opposed to simply describing situations.<br/><br/>Another of this movie's strong points is the humour. Whether you're one for sophisticated and adult wit, or darkly jokey slapstick and in-context plays with words, there's bound to be a little wink at the audience you'll at the very least smirk at. While the dry comedy is reserved for the grey Land of the Living, wildness is unleashed in the colourful and spazzy Land of the Dead.<br/><br/>So take your pick, but whether you're already a fan of Burton's or a newcomer to his wonderful and crazy world, this dreamy piece is something notable out of his filmography. Personally, I think just the effort and hours put behind the animation, especially with it being so detailed and dynamic in the final result, are worth respecting. Couple that with a wonderfully told, beautiful storyline which, although many found simple and linear, I thought it really couldn't give more out of itself, and you have Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, a movie with quite simple ambitions which easily becomes one of this director's liveliest  no pun intended."

","Another excellent film by Tim Burton more than making up for his Planet Of The Apes fiasco! So many signature Burton moments, Victoria's striped dress which looked like it was made from the same cloth as Beetlejuice's suit. The standard Danny Elfman musical set pieces.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is himself and his puppet looks like a cross between him and Burton himself. Burton has obviously only ever seen Joanna Lumley in Ab Fab or James & The Giant Peach as this is how her puppet looks. Nothing like the stunning beauty Joanna actually is.<br/><br/>The plot is sadly thin in lots of places. The whole ""Til death us do part"" thing. Victor only needs to say ""I was practicing my vows and there was no priest there so we're not married"" as a simple explanation and he's out of trouble.<br/><br/>The old skeletons loft looks a lot like The Scientists house in Edward Scissorhands, and I think the reference to Vincent is more likely to be to Vincent Price in Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>I love the look of the film and will no doubt watch it again to spot things I previously missed. The whole Alfred Hitchcock homage to The Birds (or it's possibly a homage to The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe).<br/><br/>A few of the musical numbers went on too long, some of them felt too tacked on as after thoughts, but the movie was lovely to watch. A little too long, I'd have chopped about 15 mins from the running time, it's not for kids as they'd start to fidget very quickly as the film takes it's time getting to certain places.<br/><br/>All in all, Tim Burton has redeemed himself."

","I had this movie figured out from almost the beginning. I know this wasn't meant to be Nightmare Before Christmas Part 2 or anything, but at least Nightmare was original and gave kids some credit. This one I guess just assumes the kids are too dumb to pick up on subtle hints. They had to make it blatant and easy to figure out.<br/><br/>I did like the score, and it was an original idea. Danny Elfman had been on my sh*t list for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's score, but he redeemed himself with this one. I love the overabundance of harpsichord. I also think the voice casting worked.<br/><br/>I wish there could've gone into the Underworld a little more. The characters there were the only thing saving the movie.<br/><br/>All in all it seemed a little rushed, like Hot Topic was edging him on so they could sell more shirts."

"MrGKB","7","1","2","2 December 2005"," Clever enough, but...
","...nowhere near as clever as ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" though I'm not sure I can put my finger on why. Still, I'm not surprised that it polls well here on the IMDb, and especially with the female contingent; the ""good"" girl got her simple but goodhearted man, while the ""bad"" girl gave up what she wasn't intended to have, yet still got revenge on the party who betrayed her. Hard to argue with ""all's well that ends well."" I'm also not surprised to see that the 45+ cohort gave it the lowest marks, much lower than they gave ""Nightmare Before Christmas""---this one just isn't as clever by half (although it has its moments), which I will ascribe to Burton meddling with the directing of it, along with Elfman's average (for him) score and songs. Despite the improved stop-motion animation, which I loved, the imagery and story left a strong feeling of retreading of older material. In fact, the story itself reminded me of some old European folktale, whatever it may have been.<br/><br/>Still, ""Corpse Bride"" has a lot going for it. The animation is exquisite and expressive, a joy to behold. The voice work is spot on, from the upper tier names like Depp and Watson right straight through to Enn Reitel's Maggot/Town Crier. Children under 12 might be a bit lost, but anyone with a love of animation will be pleased. The only reason I gave it a 7 instead of an 8 is its apparent lack of repeat viewability; that may change in the future when I catch it again on DVD."
"nobbytatoes","8","1","2","21 November 2005"," a strange love triangle
","Victor has been arranged by his parents to marry Victoria; who also is forced by her parents. Victoria's parents though have an agenda to this arranged marriage. They are falling from their aristocratic status and are verging upon being beggars; hoping to gain money from the marriage. Victor isn't in any rush to be married, but he does hold feelings for Victoria. During the rehearsal Victor forgets his vowels and makes a fool of himself. While walking through the forest he practices his vowels and while placing his ring on what he thought was a stick; he becomes married to the corpse bride; Emily. Victor is then pulled into the underworld; which surprisingly is more colourful than the realm of the living. Victor trys to run away from Emily but she is a relentless bride, stopping him from getting to the living and marrying Victoria.<br/><br/>The Corpse Bride is a great yet strangle film on finding love in the strangest of places. Ending up being married to a cadaver is a great twist on the usual love story. Just like The Nightmare Before Christman, the stop motion animation is great, yet is more refined here and flows better and has much more detail to it. The blend of computer animation adds those touches that makes the animation flawless; its just astounding.<br/><br/>All the character are wonderfully made. All the characters have been made to the extent that they basically become caricatures, bar from the three main leads who have been made more humanised; being that their characters are more innocent while everyone else is more jilted and two faced. The bleak, gray Victorian setting suits the story perfectly; suiting that rigid and conforming way of the Victorian life. The underworld is so bright and colourful; juxtaposing that notion there is more fun in the after life than in the living.<br/><br/>The voice cast of Corpse Bride is great and perfectly casted. Johnny Deep is perfect as the timid Victor; he does have believable English voice. Helena Bonham Carter also is great as the Corpse Bride; making her so lively and a wonderful character. Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Richard E. Grant and the great Christopher Lee all flourish in their roles and really make them their own.<br/><br/>Though this is a short film, its a great film."
"Victor Field","7","1","2","15 November 2005"," The best family movie about necrophilia ever...
","""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" isn't as good as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" but in its defence it isn't a retread. Apart from the whole Rankin/Bass special on acid thing, which is in no way a criticism.<br/><br/>This quasi-musical-comedy-horror tale of a betrothed man accidentally married to a corpse gets off to a somewhat stodgy start as it gets its somewhat slim story underway - it might have been suited more for a short story than a movie - and although leaving most of its cast for the movie's credits rather than the posters, even in Britain, is a welcome move (because it gives the movie itself the centre stage, not the cast), it has to be said that Johnny Depp is almost bland as the voice of Victor; maybe it might have helped if he sang. Also, the visual trick of having the world of the living be just one tone away from being black and white and the world of the dead in full, vibrant colour wears thin before the end, although that's just about the only thing about the visuals that doesn't.<br/><br/>But as the tale moves along it gets both funnier and more involving, with Danny Elfman's variable songs (as the voice of Bonejangles, he gets the best one) made up for by his own familiar but still effective score; the movie might not have much story, but it also doesn't overstay its welcome... which, given that the ultimate revelation about Barkis (an excellent Richard E. Grant) isn't much of a revelation at all, is probably just as well. With terrific stop-motion animation throughout to boot and a great wedding finale (though I won't give away who gets hitched), this movie may not be for everyone, but it's ultimately a delight.<br/><br/>Ironically for a movie where nearly everyone is dead, this is full of life."
"psi_fla","7","1","2","30 October 2005"," The ghost of Jack Skellington hangs over this
","Am I the only one who's beginning to think that even though Tim Burton is still churning out solid entertainment, his magic touch deserted him ages ago.<br/><br/>To be honest, I don't think he's been involved in a really spectacular film for over a decade. And this ""really spectacular film"" comes to mind when watching his latest, Corpse Bride. Because both that film and his latest are stop-motion animations.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm talking about The Nightmare Before Christmas, that near masterwork which had some remarkable elements, including a wickedly original sense of humour, interesting characters, a well-played romance, and songs that weren't brilliant but grew on you.<br/><br/>Barring the songs (which are unmemorable and difficult to make out) Corpse Bride has got all of those. But the storyline is less coherent. That, and the film seems more trite and sentimental. Is this because we're getting a little too used to Tim Burton's style of film-making? Or is he just becoming too methodical? Victor (Johnny Depp) is getting cold feet before his arranged marriage to Victoria (Emily Watson). Somehow, he can't even remember the vows before the big day. So he goes for a wander in the nearby forest, where he can rehearse and hopefully put things right. But just as everything seems to come together for him, a venture into the forest unearths the sinister Corpse Bride, Emily (Helena Bonham Carter).<br/><br/>The story is told competently enough to keep you involved, and the animation is superb. At least Burton's visual gift hasn't been diminished; the production design and the faces of some of Corpse Bride's characters, especially the title character, prove that. These stop-motion figurines are voiced by a wide array of talent. Although truthfully, that means little these days; Charlie And The Chocolate Factory's gifted cast couldn't lift it above the mediocre. Fortunately, Corpse Bride is certainly more than ""mediocre""; it's guaranteed satisfaction on all levels.<br/><br/>My problem with it is that I was personally looking for more than just mere ""satisfaction."" Perhaps I'm drawing too many comparisons to The Nightmare Before Christmas? I know this review may sound negative to you, but don't get me wrong. I did like Corpse Bride and I think you will enjoy it. I just expected more. Now, if only Burton could truly rediscover his magic touch once and for all...<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","Starting off in the bleak world of the living, The Corpse Bride introduces us to Victor (Johnny Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson), the couple soon to be wed and just about meet. Both shy and anxious about marrying someone they do not love, they meet and thankfully DO love each other. Phew! But then....<br/><br/>Whilst practising his admittedly very difficult wedding vows, Victor places the ring on what appears to be a hand-shaped branch in the spooky forest/cemetry. The hand-shaped branch turns out to be the actual hand of a corpse bride (Helena Bonham-Carter) and now Victor and Corpsey are married. Oops.<br/><br/>Burton's animation is incredible. Quirky and Gothic, he's cleverly depicted the land of the living in near monotone and the land of the dead in vibrant, almost electrifying colour. Skeletons dance and maggots pop out of eye-sockets in some truly gorgeous song-and-dances. Victor tries to escape his gruesome but oddly fetching wife and return to save his True Love from the evil Lord Barkis, but he then learns that even though his wife hasn't got a pulse, she's still got feelings.<br/><br/>The Corpse Bride can be safely assured of a spot in the canon of clever, funny and entertaining animated movies, although it probably won't get any further than that. Its short run-time and simple, although sweet, story makes it a kiddy classic with some appeal for adults. But despite its advanced visual effects, The Corpse Bride is not as wacky as other Burton ventures like Big Fish and it seems to fall just a tiny bit short of being spectacular."

Get ready for music, wit, charm but ... and it's a big but, be also prepared for spiders, maggots and a serious storyline that might leave people scratching their heads at the end.<br/><br/>A musical opens the movie explaining the son of a rich merchant family and the daughter of high class paupers are arranging to marry off their kids to save themselves. Victor and Victoria seem fine with each other, but after a botched rehearsal the groom to be practices his vows to a tree stump, only for it to accept them in the form of a corpse in a wedding gown.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the characters in Corpse Bride. There is a kind of realism on how Emily and Victoria relate to Victor, and each other, that keep the movie going. That's not to dismiss the dead, all of whom own the movie, which I guess is the dramatic irony throughout the Corpse Bride: the afterlife is bursting with more liveliness than the living! Burton however, takes the Corpse Bride much more seriously than I would have expected, reminding us that Emily's ending was, and would, as bittersweet as the movie itself. I was thoroughly entertained, but aside from those determined to see the movie anyway, I would not know who to recommend the movie to."

It's also very predictable, and contains the usual Tim Burton cheap-shots at family and religion (you'd swear he'd been injured rather than pampered as a child).<br/><br/>I will neglect to give away any element of the film (singing worm excluded), but I should say this...once a certain point is reached, some things go awry, and not for our hero, Vincent. The script begins to love itself too much, and a fantastic idea begins to waver. The songs seem to turn a little sappy, and with the exception that the dead are involved, you'd almost think you were watching the Hallmark Channel. One cannot say there is no spark in the production's second half, but it feels a bit forced; almost mechanical. The ending, I shall only say, left me a little flat. I was looking for a bigger ""kaboom,"" as Marvin the Martian might say. For most directors, I would have hardly noticed, but Burton's creative genius is usually matched by a certain level of punch. That panache comes and goes in ""Corpse Bride,"" whispering in and out like a wind.<br/><br/>But let me not denigrate this to an extreme; the film is playful, colorful and all-over an enjoyable second-helping to ""Nightmare"" fans, even if it falls short of its predecessor."

While the world of the living is surely one of conformity and drudgery the underworld is populated with colorful and emotionally rich creatures. I very much enjoyed the concept and the artwork. I also enjoyed the hauntingly beautiful piano pieces. I'm not so sure the other musical numbers work all that well in the context of the story.<br/><br/>I liked the story idea. I don't think that the Victor and Victoria characters are fleshed out enough so that their fate has much emotional resonance. Emily was by far the most interesting and compelling creature.

","Tim Burton seems to be at his best with the slightly quirky, strange worlds he creates in film.

The parents seek status and money from the marriage, as are the parents of Victoria Everglot, his bride-to-be. While preparing for the wedding, he accidentally comes upon the ""Corpse Bride"", and his entire world is turned upside down! I really enjoyed the story here, the characters of Victor and Victoria are easy to identify with, the parents are easy to loathe but also to have sympathy for, and the comic relief is found everywhere to keep the dark background from overtaking the story. The animation and world created are superb, somewhat in the vein of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", but still different enough to not be a copycat. Burton has added a masterpiece to his collection and will continue forward from here."

","I had high expectations for Corpse Bride, and it fulfilled nearly all of them. Going into the movie, I was aware of its short running length, and to be honest, this did hurt the film overall. Events happen very rapidly, and as a result, don't seem to be very fleshed out. The songs in the movie had great tunes and instrumentals, but more than once, I felt like I couldn't ""hear"" the words, because they came too quickly and too loud.<br/><br/>The movie may have been billed slightly wrong, too, because it's much much more of a love story than a horror tale. I wouldn't see the movie unless you're okay with romantic comedies, because that is a big part of what Corpse Bride is. Some of the dead jokes get irritating after a while (there's so many of them) but overall they help keep the tone light and funny throughout.<br/><br/>A major redeeming feature of the movie was the visuals. The stop-motion photography the film uses makes literally every scene a spectacle by itself. The Corpse Bride is oddly compelling, because she's deadly beautiful and moves with a strange grace throughout. She's a rotting corpse, but somehow Tim Burton made her lovely.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend Corpse Bride, perhaps not for children (it isn't a kids fairy tale), but definitely for someone who enjoys the visual style as well as dark romantic comedies in general. Corpse Bride is just fun to watch, and the tunes (even though too loud at times) will keep you tapping. A very good movie and well worth seeing."

Then when I heard it was animated I was like, ""This sounds a little weird but okay."" Then the trailer came out and I was really impressed with the way this film will be animated. It uses the same technique of The Nightmare Before Christmas and the characters look unique and superlative. The day finally came when I saw the film for myself and I was blown away. The story of Victor Van Dort's marriage to a corpse is truly an original tale of macabre and matrimony. Helena Bonham Carter entranced my senses with her soft and beautiful voice and the music genius of Danny Elfman caught me by the ear once again with his mix of Edward Scissorhands, Batman and The Nightmare before Christmas. This film will most definitely win the award for best animated film this year at the Oscars. Good night and have a spooky evening."
"loismustdie1982","9","1","2","25 September 2005"," The only real problem is it's too short
","Tim Burton delivers another visual marvel through stop-motion animation with ""Corpse Bride."" More than ten years after ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" Burton revisits this painstaking animation technique, and delivers a sweeter story, with funnier characters, and even more stunning visuals.<br/><br/>The story centers around a young fishmonger's son named Victor Von Dort, who bears a decent resemblance to his voice, Johnny Depp. Before an arranged marriage to the young Victoria, voiced by Emily Watson (Julie Andrews fans may cringe now), Victor gets cold feet, bungles the rehearsal, and goes off into the night. While practicing his wedding vows, he places his wedding band on what he believes is a branch, but in reality is the decayed hand of the cursed Corpse Bride, Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). Emily rises from her grave, and claims to be legally married to the terrified Victor. A comedy of errors ensues.<br/><br/>The film has problems, like any other. There are continuity errors (watch the placement of the general's sword in the first bar scene), but they're easily ignored. The music is an odd addition, mostly because there are only four songs, only two of which have any relevance to the plot. But when you boil it down, the only real problem is that the film goes too fast. It clocks at 76 minutes, which is standard for a straight-to-video cartoon. There were a lot of things that could be done to extend the story, or develop the characters more. Trust me, the characters are so compelling, and the writing so crisp, the audience would not have minded sitting there another hour.<br/><br/>What sells the film is the visual marvel of the stop-motion animation. For those that don't know, miniature 3-D models are created of each character, and moved slightly in between frames, which are photographed one by one. The crew would be lucky to get 5 minutes filmed in the span of a week. But it produces such a lovely effect on the screen. You can have 3-D characters that aren't CGI, but still look semi-real, despite their odd shapes and body figures. In fact, in a bit of design irony, the most human looking character, in terms of body dimensions, is Emily. Sure she has decaying flesh and some exposed bones, but she has realistic body features, proportionate length and width with her arms and legs, and has proper posture. The only part of her body that's unrealistic is her long, pointy neck.<br/><br/>The only item of confusion is the ending, which I won't reveal, but it leaves questions as to Burton's universe of the afterlife, which could have been explained away with one more page of dialogue, and a 77th minute of film. But nothing is perfect, and the film does very well, bringing back a visual style we haven't seen in years. Any debates about next year's Oscar winner for Animated Feature must begin and end with this film."
"Homsar11","8","1","2","25 September 2005"," Beautiful, but Just a Little Dead
","3 Stars (out of 4)<br/><br/>Tim Burton's newest film, The Corpse Bride, is all style. And it's a very inviting style at that. But like most Burton films, it lacks a little in the narrative. The film stars Johnny Depp as Victor, a young man betrothed to Victoria (Emily Watson). On the day of the wedding rehearsal when they both first meet they fall in love with one another, but Victor, being the clumsy person that he is, angers the priest who is trying to wed them because he just can't get his vows right (and accidentally sets Victorias mother on fire), and in distress after failing to impress Victoria he takes a walk. On this walk he practices his vows, and on the one time he gets it right he places the ring on the finger of what he thinks is a branch of a tree, but in reality its the hand of the Corpre Bride (Helena Bohnam Carter). Thus he is now married to a dead woman.<br/><br/>Its generally difficult to comment on the acting in an animated film, but all the acting is fairly good, none of them stand out much though aside from Bohnam Carter, who shines as the unhinged, and falling apart Emily. The film is filled with some toe tapping songs, especially the number performed in the tavern in the world of the dead, telling the story of Emily the Corpse Bride, but for the most part the songs are not nearly as memorable as those of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The Corpse Bride, however, excels in comedy and visual style. Namely any scenes involving the members of the underworld are the most entertaining, with some of the dead characterized by how they died (chopped in half, shot through stomach, stabbed, decapitated, etc.). <br/><br/>But the films weakness is its story. The setup is the strongest point, but shortly after we learn the legend of the Corpse Bride the movie gets stuck in a rut, and doesn't really seem to go anywhere. The characters mostly just walk around and do nothing to further the story at all, and the little movement that the story does go in is fairly secondhand. The biggest problem though is that the villain of the movie almost seems tacked on, and there is so little confrontation with him that he hardly even seems necessary at any point of the story. The good news is that the lack of story hard to notice because the movie does a good job of distracting us with such visual richness.<br/><br/>Overall The Corpse Bride is a beautifully rich film, but just misses out on excellence because the story just doesn't really go anywhere. But for those waiting for another clay animation film they don't have to wait long, Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the WereRabbit comes out in two weeks..."

","Victor Van Dort(Johnny Depp) is to be wed to the prestigious Victoria Everglot due to almost certain bankruptcy of the once rich Everglots. After having been ridiculed for forgetting his vows, Victor panics and accidentally be weds a corpse who's finger was thought to be a twig. A confused Victor falls in love with both women and has to decide against the two.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has never made a movie I did not find entertaining and this is no exception. It was quite entertaining and moderately funny for a kids movie although it was the animation that astounded me. Using the same type of animation used in The Nightmare Before Christmas was absolutely brilliant on Burton's part. Overall, the movie was an above average comedy that can be admired for its great animation.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie."
"scottlukaswilliams","7","1","2","25 September 2005"," A Giant Leap
","Tim Burton is a master. The direction in this film is brilliant. Some of the shots he achieved are just unbelievable and the character design is remarkable! There were moments when I had to force myself to remember that I wasn't watching actors. The stop-motion processes have become so much more fluid and human than they were in ""Nightmare Before Christmas."" I'm still puzzled over how they managed to get those puppets to do some of the things they did. This film represents a giant leap for stop-motion. I'm incredibly excited to see what Burton does next with the medium.<br/><br/>Story-wise, there wasn't too much new ground made. Burton's fascination with ""the outsider"" is further explored here but there's not a lot in the way of new insights.<br/><br/>Some people have complained that the film is too short. I think that feeling arises because the film is so visually amazing that you can't help but want to see more. 90 minutes is still the average length of a film. I guess we've been spoiled by some really excellent films that are a bit longer in the past few years.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's music is excellent again, but it's not his best work. The songs are not going become as unforgettable as those from ""Nightmare"" which, I think, will probably always be Burton's stop-motion masterpiece."
"caldarello1","7","1","2","25 September 2005"," it was okay
","I thought it was really good. But it needed more singing and more catchy songs like in nightmare before Xmas. There were a couple of songs. Only a couple of the songs were catchy. But i thought the piano songs were great! I really likes the piano parts. I liked the characters too. Their voices matched their personalities. Johnny Depp had an excellent voice for Victor. The plot of the story was alright and there were a couple of funny parts in the movie. To spoil it for the others he winds up with Victoria. I think Victor should of been with the corpse bride. She sings, dances and plays the piano. She was much more liver than Victoria."

","Why does everyone rate Tim Burton, clearly this film, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is testament to his lack of talent. why do we forget that this is the man who destroyed Planet of The Apes? anyway, my point is Tim Burton is not alternative or artistic to any degree that deserves the amount of recognition he is receiving. merely all he does with his films, is take a mainstream idea, an already conceived paradigm and subvert it slightly in order to give it an alternative edge in order for it sell better. he is the Good Charlotte of the cinematic industry. he is not a good film maker, merely good at marketing. i disagree profusely with the praise he receives for his (supposed) forward thinking artistic eye. Corpse Bride a cesspit of mediocrity that relied on a script driven by inane and poorly executed puns, and a visual style that clearly shows Burton to be plagiarizing himself. it is a sad day for the world when he is considered a master film maker and doesn't show the receptive powers of the general masses in a very good light. simply put, Mr Tim Burton is the ignorant man's Terry Gilliam."

They put together a cheesy film, that was the exact opposite of ""spectacular"" and I invited my parents over to watch it, because I heard it was really spectacular. But they left the house 15 mins into the movie. And it did not get much better. I got bored and it was the most dragged out film I have seen in a really long time. And it is SO not original. I mean, Shrek, Shrek 2, Titanic, they all have the same LOVE plot. The man and woman fall in a forbidden love.

"blueboyblunder3000","1","4","19","30 October 2005"," It's a rehashed piece of (feces)
","People this is no where near as good as the nightmare before Christmas. I know you can't really compare the two movies as we all knew it wouldn't be as good as Nightmare but Christ he coulda tried harder. The voice casting,music and Danny Elfman are what make this movie really bad. The animation looks as if it has strong influence from cgi. It follows the basic Disney plot with slight hints of Burton holding the whole messy production together. Now to be honest the design and Victorian Tim Burton aspect are pretty cool even if it's just to flog crappy merchandise to a bunch of Goths. That was all that was good about that movie though which just proves as does Planet of the Apes that not everything that Tim Burton spews out for the public is actually going to be a masterpiece. Long live Edward scissor hands and Nightmare."
"puddleducktoys","5","2","7","30 October 2006"," Mediocre
","Anything to which Tim Burton puts an effort immediately piques my interest, however I found myself quite disappointed with this animated endeavor. The story is slow moving while the characters do not particularly garner your sympathy. The plot is a tired one - of a fumbling British guy who could simply solve the hardly-believable predicament in which he finds himself, with a sentence or two. As a musical piece with the talented Danny Elfman, I found one song to be likable, whereas the rest are easily forgettable. A decent family film for a rental, but would not hold the interest of little ones. Parents should realize, especially from the title of the film, that death, dying and decay are prominent subjects and be prepared for such."
"sashamalchik","4","2","7","13 January 2006"," Very weak
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride proves that a bad movie cannot ride out on the nice visuals or unusual filming techniques alone. A poor, poor rehash with tricks taken out of the same hat as his magnificent, stunning stop-motion puppet animation Nightmare Before Christmas - with nothing more or fresh to add.<br/><br/>The story is this film's main weakness - it is so utterly primitive, rehashed, and flat, they didn't even bother adding a single twist along the way to make it interesting (for adults, anyway.) Seeing this movie adds nothing new to the Nightmare. A disappointment of big-screen proportions."
"nowonmai42","5","2","7","22 October 2005"," The Nightmare After the Nightmare Before Christmas
","Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is a Gothic tale of a sensitive young man who chafes at the distinctions between living and dead. Considering that pretty accurately describes Burton's previous ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and that ""Corpse Bride"" is animated in the same stop-motion style, the gloomy director seems to be creating a sub-sub genre all his own. It's too bad he didn't take the time to flesh out (no pun intended. Seriously) ""Corpse Bride"" a bit.<br/><br/>There's a lot of visual invention in this film  not surprising in a Burton effort  but Tim and team seem to have spent all their energy on the visuals of ""Corpse Bride,"" not noticing that their story is patchy and scatter shot. Young Victor and Victoria are introduced by their domineering parents just one day before their arranged marriage. Surprisingly enough, they quite like each other, making it all the more tragic when Victor takes a walk in the Dark Scary Woods to practice the vows he keeps flubbing in rehearsal. The film then settles into a standard ""Boy Practices Vows, Boy Unwittingly Marries Rotting Girl Cadaver, Boy Tries to Escape from Land of Dead and Anthropomorphic-Maggot-Infested Girl"" story. It's here the film gets all muddled. It takes a while to establish that Victor is trapped in what we're belatedly told is the land of the dead. Except he and his late honey can cast a spell that allows them to go back to the land of the living. And the entire population of the underworld later decides to pop upstairs because, um, they feel like it. We find out that poor bride to be Emily was killed  somehow, for some reason  while waiting for her intended in the very wooded spot where Victor makes his ill-conceived marital declaration. Although fated to lie in wait for her betrothed to declare his love, she also apparently lives in the bustling world below, which appears to be a pretty hip place to spend eternity, with its be-bopping jazz cat skeletons and party-on atmosphere. Meanwhile, on the surface, poor Victoria is about to be forced into marrying wealthy, and likely homicidal, Lord Barkis.<br/><br/>This stuff seems not very well thought out. ""Corpse Bride"" has flashes of inspiration, and some moments of sharp wit. Victoria's mother, breathlessly told by her daughter that Victor and a dead girl climbed through her window, scolds ""he was in your ROOM?!"" And Victor's own harried mother can't imagine ""what corpse would want to marry our Victor."" Yet for the most part, ""Corpse Bride"" seems to be making things up as it goes along. Being animated, it feels obligated to sprinkle in a few entirely forgettable songs, as well, interrupting what little narrative flow it establishes.<br/><br/>A lot of work and care goes into a film like this. Unfortunately, the only thing of which ""Corpse Bride"" seems sure is how it wants to look. It's easy to admire the craftsmanship behind the film, but no amount of technical expertise can make up for a movie that's just largely so unclear and uninteresting."
"craigman","5","2","7","11 October 2005"," Tim Burton Just Doing the Same Old Thing Again
","I saw this movie in the theater with my wife. There were at least 2 other movies I would have rather seen. She loved it, but me, well, I didn't hate it, but I didn't exactly like it either. It just seemed like a conglomeration of most of Burton's earlier works. People call Tim Burton a genius. He is talented at repackaging the same thing over and over, and getting lots of money for it, I guess. He's definitely NOT a genius. People keep comparing this to Nightmare, and rightly so. It came from Tim Burton, was claymation, and was about animated dead people. It did remind me a lot of BeetleJuice also. Dancing skeletons seem to be a popular motif in his movies. I guess what bugged me the most were the characters. They completely lacked depth, except for maybe the main character, yet her back story was sorely underdeveloped. WAS she killed by her groom to be, or a stranger? WHY was she killed? Was the bad guy who tried to wed Victoria the groom to be of the corpse bride AND her killer? Why did he want to kill Victoria so badly? It doesn't really matter. Another reviewer was nitpicking the plot of this movie, saying things like ""How does the corpse bride know all of the dead people if she was under a tree all of the time?"" I started to wonder, then thought, ""The movie is about animated DEAD people! It's fantasy! On a good note, the animation was well done, but in 2005 that's no big feat."
"camachoborracho","5","2","7","2 October 2005"," Walks a fine line between well paced and dragging
","If there is one word to describe this film it is ""cute."" Corpse Bride is a movie that tries to appeal to everyone perhaps due to its bizarre subject matter. In fact it goes out of its way not to offend anyone (particularly Christian conservatives) as you may notice no crosses in the church (which would offend all religions in some way), marriage in itself is not necessarily mocked and neither is the idea of death. It's not quite a kids film nor an adult film so I was wondering who would this appeal to? The fact that such major talent is attached is probably the main reason this film has done well so far.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad film but the musical numbers seem a bit forced and were extremely tough to hear (it could have been my theater but the most important story of how the girl died was unclear as a result), not to mention nothing was particularly memorable in terms of lyrics. Also a lot of the scenes came close to dragging or stretching out as much as possible, despite an extremely short runtime for a feature.<br/><br/>But aside from all of this there were 2 major things I disliked: the very abrupt ending in which the corpse bride ""completes her purpose"" (a very Catholic notion of limbo thus my above comments for Christian conservatives) and the two living lovers watch as she dissipates up to heaven and then THAT'S IT?! I think this film needed just one more scene of resolution - mainly to show their parents' reactions since they never return to the picture and figure in pretty heavily throughout otherwise. (Unless this is one of those films that has a ""secret scene"" to reward those for watching the credits). Also my other issue was why did the Lord who married Victoria wanted to kill her? After all she had explained her family was penniless and it's not like he could gain anything from her death. Was he just a crazy murderer of brides? (In that case I wasn't quite clear if he was the one who killed the corpse bride as well, hence see my comments on lack of clarity in song).<br/><br/>Well it's not a bad film, I wouldn't pay to see it in theaters again but wouldn't not recommend it either. If I had kids I'd think they have to be at least 8 or 9 to see it since some of the subjects are dark and could be scary. I guess I had higher hopes after seeing Nightmare before Christmas. Not a bad Burton/Elfman/Depp picture but not the best either.<br/><br/>5/10 Meh."
"IamtheRegalTreatment","5","2","7","25 September 2005"," Not what It was Sought Out to Be...
","Whenever you thought of Corpse Bride, you thought of Tim Burton. Whenever you thought of Tim Burton, you thought of The Nightmare Before Christmas. When you think of Corpse Bride, you shouldn't think of The Nightmare Before Christmas, but for some reason everyone does.<br/><br/>I can understand how people think these two movies are alike, because they're basically the only animated films by Tim Burton, besides James and the Giant Peach. However, Corpse Bride is the first to be Directed by Tim Burton. Nonetheless, these movies can't be considered ""as good"" as each other. Nightmare Before Christmas is a film that you will remember and watch for the rest of your life. Corpse Bride is a movie that you see because it looks like The Nightmare Before Christmas. Corpse Bride is a bad movie being compared to Nightmare Before Christmas so often.<br/><br/>The story is a little more complex than a normal children's (Disney) movie would be, however it has a simple outlook. A man is being wed beyond his will to a bride who, likewise, is against her will. Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) reveals his nervousness during the rehearsal, and later travels through the woods practicing his vows. At a particular moment, he suddenly gets his vows perfect, and recites them aloud. When he announces that he will ""give her this ring"", he places it on what he believes is a small tree branch resembling her ring finger, in which turns out to be a dead woman's ring finger who is buried. She comes alive and cries out ""I do"" to Victor, and now he is wed to a deceased woman, hence, Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>Victor is now contemplating what he must do to fix this mis-marriage, and find his wanted bride, Victoria (voiced by Emily Watson). Seeing as this is a children's movie, or just a movie nonetheless, it won't be as easy as thought. Seems like a typical quest for the plot of a movie.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride was short, only 76 minutes. This prevents the movie from having less twists in plot and gets to the finale quicker. Having a short movie may keep the children interested through a longer majority of the movie, this is a positive outcome. To me, it made it less interesting. 5/10."
"bregund","3","2","8","6 November 2006"," The nightmare after Christmas
","There's something so sad and wistful about this gray-colored film, as it plods along wishing that something exciting would happen to it. It's bad enough that all the characters look like they belong in some crappy 1960s stop-animation movie for kids, but they stylistically resemble that time, with exaggerated hair and body types. At least the nightmare before Christmas had more than three colors, which is all you'll see in this film, and your favorite color better be gray.<br/><br/>Among the film's many faults is its lack of characterization. If you're going to feature a worm, why not make it cute, instead of the literally ugly little thing that crawls about talking like Peter Lorre. There's nothing even remotely lovable about it. And why not name the main characters Victor/Victoria, just to showcase a lack of imagination. Scariest of all is the pastor, an elongated horror gifted with Christopher Lee's voice. It's all very ugly and disturbing, as cold and heartless as an Ingmar Berman film.<br/><br/>There is a particularly stupid scene where everyone runs around the burning pastor without the slightest idea of how to extinguish a fire; this knowledge is beyond even the pastor himself. The hosts calmly look on as the terrified pastor's clothes burn cheerily, the only spot of color in the entire film.<br/><br/>The dialogue is inspid and stilted, without an ounce of emotion or surprise, as whomever wrote the script was apparently raised in front of the television. The stiff, Victorian drawing-room conversations hold no surprises whatsoever and you see every word coming. This is the most unchallenging, nonthreatening film of all time. The ""living"" people are so sedate that they are indistinguishable from the dead people. Victor's blue face and Johnny Depp eyes at first glance appear to be soulful, but there is no identifiable character behind the figure.<br/><br/>For some reason the dead rejoin the living at the end of the movie, and old friends and family are reunited, even couples. Don't think about this last part too hard, if you know what I mean. Yuck.<br/><br/>All in all, if you watch this movie, then like old folks in a nursing home you'll just be waiting for something to happen, and it never does. It has a boring ending that totally doesn't make any sense, like Burton's ""Planet of the Aches""."

I'm personally tired of short, crooked figurines singing around and black and white curly touch-ups, also I'm through with his common places and the gloomy, goth-like atmosphere.<br/><br/>I can name at least three of his films with a similar graphic style and look-alike characters.<br/><br/>I thing he tried to pull off a collage of his best movie making techniques and added up new visual breakthroughs, like realistic fire blazes and seamless CGI, but the movie as a whole is like a Burton's buff's wildest dream.

","1993's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was a milestone in cinematic history: the first full-length claymation film. And oh, what a glorious film it was! Bursting at the seems with twisted, beautiful, and vividly imaginative imagery thanks to creator Tim Burton and wonderfully catchy and quirky musical numbers thanks to composer Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Needless to say, Tim Burton's return to claymation was long awaited for me and many others. In 2005, it finally happened with ""Corpse Bride"". Everything I had seen in the previews looked absolutely fantastic, and I had some very high hopes for the film.<br/><br/>The plot is as follows: Victor (Depp) is a very shy but very spirited young man living in a dreary city populated by stuck-up rich snobs who care about nothing other than money, rules, and manners. He is set up by his parents to marry a young girl named Victoria (Watson), who is, of course, the one other free spirit in the city. Due to an unfortunate series of events, Victor accidentally marries a dead bride (Bonham Carter) and is consequently sucked into the land of the dead. He then attempts to sort out this misunderstanding and get back to the world of the living.<br/><br/>The potential is vast, but the film does little to utilize it. On top of the storyline being crazily predictable, the characters, as you can probably already tell, are paper thin and horribly clichéd. The story has some great opportunities for hilarious macabre gags, which the film obviously tries to harness, but unfortunately, they all end up being painfully corny. Also, the musical numbers, unlike in ""Nightmare"", feel forced and unnecessary, as if Burton threw them in just because he felt he had to. There is just no energy or passion in them. But the biggest problem with the film is that it should clearly be a heavily aesthetic experience, and the visuals are, quite frankly, underwhelming, unlike most of Burton's previous films, which contain more than their fair share of bravura images.<br/><br/>Also, the film seemed very short and ended very abruptly, even though it seemed to drag for the majority of the running time.<br/><br/>The major redeeming feature of the film, however, is Burton's very interesting contrast between the land of the dead and the world of the living. The dead inhabit a fun, friendly, colorful place where song and dance are encouraged, as apposed to the living, whose world is cold, dreary, desolate, dull, and, ironically, dead. Who are the ones that are truly alive in this situation? 6/10"

","Corpse Bride is one of those almost classic movies you should watch on Halloween considering you're not too into horror movies. That's kind of the specialty of Tim Burton: he makes dark movies emo or goth teens are way too invested in. I don't know if it has to do with the plots or the aesthetic.<br/><br/>But the aesthetic of Corpse Bride is amazing: almost colourless land of the living, the colourful and fun land of the dead. The characters look amazing, everyone looks different and has different shapes of their faces and body. It's a nice change from typical animations, but of course the main characters are tall and skinny with the typical Burton styled faces: pale skin, huge eyes with dark circles around them. Still, every little detail in the animation is amazing. I could talk about stop-motion animation all day long, but perhaps not.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's music is pretty but generic. It's been heard over and over again. Sure, Victor's Piano Solo may give the viewer goose bumps, but other than that, every song feels like it's been done so many times before. The soundtrack is alright, but could be way better.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and well-written. It's short, and many things are left unexplained, but it's better that way. It's good that it ends quite suddenly without anything like ""FEW WEEKS LATER"" because that would kind of ruin the moment. The movie is about what it is about, it doesn't need anything else. The structure of the story is very similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas. No, it's not entirely the same, it's not ""copied"", but it has some sort of parallels and symmetry.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride is a good movie to watch around Halloween, but that's about it. I can't imagine watching it during the summer or anything. Corpse Bride has charisma, unique aesthetic and astonishing setting."
"lewiskendell","6","1","3","26 June 2010"," Burton returns to what he does best.
","""Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse would marry our Victor?""<br/><br/>The story of the Corpse Bride is very simple. A young man accidentally practices his vows on the eve of his wedding in the presence of a woman who died a tragic death, and finds himself in the land of the dead, married to her in truth. Does he return to the land above to marry his betrothed, or does he remain with his corpse bride?<br/><br/>I'd be perfectly content if Tim Burton would stick to his original creations, and stopped adapting other people's work.  Especially if it lead to more stop-motion movies like this one. Burton's obsession with deathly pale characters with sunken eyes and Victorian clothing is much more charming in animation, than it is in his live-action movies.<br/><br/>I know that making a movie of any kind is labor-intensive and time-consuming, but it's rarely as evident as it is in stop-motion movies. The obvious comparison to Corpse Bride is The Nightmare before Christmas. The former isn't quite as clever as the latter, but it's nearly as artistically pleasant. The character designs are good, the sets are impressive, and the painstaking attention to detail is astounding. <br/><br/>Other than some underwhelming songs, I enjoyed every bit of Corpse Bride. It's a dark, fantasy tale that has all the humor, star power, and whimsy that a child or adult could want from an animated movie."
"paste_eater","5","1","3","27 February 2006"," Disappointing. I was really looking forward to this
","Tim Burton's career as a filmmaker has been almost bizarre as the subject matter of his movies. He's created some absolute masterpieces that will be remembered as some of cinemas greatest achievements, Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman. But after he made Ed Wood in 1994, something happened to his style. Gone was the mystical, otherworldly glow you got after watching one of his films, which was replaced by a feeling of either short lived glee (Mars Attacks) or utter confusion (Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes) This summers movie season was one everyone eagerly anticipated. We got not one, but TWO Burton movies, both starring Johnny Depp (a winning combination to be sure), and one was a stop motion animated film. Seeing as Nightmare Before Christmas is my favorite movie of all time, i was so excited i nearly wet myself (too much?)but alas, Charlie &TCF came and my friends (all avid Burton fans) and i were thoroughly disappointed at the way Burton just threw bizarreness at us in order to cover up the fact that the story was a travesty to everything Roahl Dahl set out to establish. making Wonka into a big weirdo doesn't add to his charm and mystery, neither does giving him a back story.<br/><br/>but this is a review for corpse bride, isn't it? the movie tries, but unfortunately, its kinda like watching a movie where the director tried to copy Tim Burton's style, except this IS a Tim Burton movie. the plot itself is fine, but there needs to be more character development. were given all these amazing, funny characters and then nothing is ever done with them. their'ye either dropped entirely (what happened to victor's parents""?) or given such terrible lines their role is completely unnecessary (victorias father/ the priest). things only get worse when we descend into the afterlife. part of what made nightmare so great was the townsfolk of Halloween town, who were all given unique personalities, and they all had moments in the film where they got to steal the show. in CB, we get a couple of interesting characters (the best being ""Paul,ze Head Waiter!) and then a bunch of wise-cracking skeletons. the only character you ever really feel attached too is Emily, who is a sweet, endearing girl who naiveness and charm makes up for the fact that she is constantly rotting.<br/><br/>The voice work is done well, Johnny Depp isn't given much to work with, but he does well at making Victor into a lovable Wet noodle. Helena Bonham Carter is sweet like a little girl and Albert Finneys voice is so outrageously sour, you wish he had more lines to say. The music is standard Elfman stuff, but the songs!!! MY GOD, WHAT WAS HE THINKING. CB has possibly the most forgettable and unpleasant score in a movie i think i have seen since those strait to video Aladdin movies. I'm sure Albert Finney and Joanna Lumley can hold notes, but why they weren't allowed to is beyond me. the opening song in a musical is supposed to set the mood for the whole movie, ""According to Plan"" does not accomplish this in the least. The song where Danny Elfman was the skeleton got irritating before it even started. What i want to know is, why does Johnny Depp not get a song, but that *bleeping maggot does! Overall, Corspe Bride really let me down. It was supposed to be Burton return to form, but instead its a tired retread of everything he did in his earlier movies. Yes, we get it. The afterlife is funny and creepy, gross thing intrigue you. We know that now. Give us something new, we know we have it in you Kazz's Rating 5 out of 10 Upon watching this movie, my girlfriend asked me ""Is their something wrong with Tim Burton? Like is he sick or something? In the head?"" I leave the answer to that question up to you!"

"mark_wallace","10","1","3","31 October 2005"," Brilliant, funny, visually glorious, Tim Burton is a genius
","Its been 12 years since the director of this piece ventured into the world of stop motion animation with the delightful Nightmare before Christmas. Here again Tim Burton has returned to the subject of the dead and the living with an altogether more Gothic feel and a far more English flavour to the proceedings. I was strongly reminded of the work of Gerald Scarfe rendered in 3D, with wonderfully dramatic sets and great voice actors, adding plenty of depth and humour to the story. A tale of Victor Van Dort who is to marry Victoria Everglot (a sly and selfish arrangement by her wicket parents to save themselves from the poorhouse) but through a mishap while rehearsing his vows ends up betrothed to the lady of the title. Though dark in tone the film is riddled with superb black humour, and a delightful twist with the underworld in glorious colour and the living world cold and grey as are the characters that inhabit it  reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz. Excellent fun."
"ljuladet","9","1","3","30 October 2005"," Worth paying for!
","When seeing 'Corpse Bride', it is hard indeed to not think of Tim Burton's previous animation, 'Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas', in terms of comparison. My friend said to me before I bought a ticket that she had seen both and preferred the latter to the former so far but, in her mind, they all were equally enjoyable. <br/><br/>Once finish watching, I cannot not resist comparing the two, as she did. Nevertheless, I do it with a different sense. Instead of considering which one is better, I rather think that both present us what is missing in one another. 'Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas' is undeniably visualized about the complicated world of Tim Burton himself of which many people  if not his fans - think as abnormal. To me, it becomes outstanding and appealing despite full of darkness. I can see from the elaborate production how much idea and energy all the crews have put down in order to approach such level of expression. However, its content (story, plot, theme) is less attention-grabbing compare to this latest 'Corpse Bride'. In 'Corpse Bride', the content makes the film closed to the traditional drama which I would have planed to produce with human's acting if I had been the director. But the director(s) chose to deal with the stop-motion technique. Interestingly, the way the characters were animated immensely contributes to the illustration of the content. That is beyond marvellous! Instead of the pure form (colourful stop motion), it is the content - strengthened by this cooperative form - that captured my attention from the start to the end. It makes me want to know how that seemingly irresolvable conflict will end.<br/><br/>Yet again, this piece has guaranteed the attractiveness of stop motion. It will never fail to stun, fascinate, and grab our attentions as long as the filmmakers know how to make use of its useful and imaginative value, like Tim Burton and, his co-director, Mike Johnson have done with the film. Worth paying for!"
"agmoldham","6","1","3","30 October 2005"," Animation for adults
","I'm sure there will be some children that enjoy this movie, but unlike W&G which will suit both adults and children, this is going to appeal mostly to the adults. It is unmistakeably a Burton movie with the usual Gothic overtones, but fairytale feel.<br/><br/>Victor (Depp) fluffs his trial run marriage vows to Victoria (Emily Watson) and goes away to the woods to practise. He accidentally marries Emily (Bonham-Carter) a Corpse Bride. The remainder of the film focuses on whether he can undo this and indeed whether he wants to undo it.<br/><br/>The films visuals are great, there's plenty of gags and the script and story are both nicely played. I always tend to find Burton's films strangely uplifting considering the raw story lines and this is no exception."
"friedfysh","6","1","3","22 October 2005"," Visually stunning, entertaining but not perfect.
","I am a big Tim Burton fan. I have watched all of his films and have even written academic essays about him so I had a fair idea of what to expect from this latest offering. The Animation is an absolute joy to behold. Visually stunning in all respects and there are some good visual jokes, my favourite being a characters jaw literally dropping off when he is surprised by some news. The lighting is fantastic and thoroughly realistic too. Storywise this film has Burton's ""unique"" edge. A young man, Victor (unrecognisably voiced by Depp) is set to marry Victoria although the pair have never met. At first both are a bit wary of the idea but warm to it after they meet. Problems soon arise as Victor accidentally marries Emily, a corpse (it will become clear when you see it). I did enjoy this strange set up and there are some good jokes that play on common figures of speech, my favourite one being ""I'll keep an eye on him"". Throughout the film you do wonder how they are going to manage to comfortably tie up the story and in fairness it doesn't do too bad a job. Its good to see (or hear at least) Burton regular Michael Gough back in the cinema playing an elder among the dead.<br/><br/>There are songs that aren't immediate classics like some from ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" but I'm sure they may grow on me with repeat viewing. There is also some beautiful piano music. Danny Elfman fully deserves the credit he gets for writing good scores.<br/><br/>I have given a lot of praise to the film so far and I did enjoy the movie a lot but it seems a little bit empty somehow. I'm not entirely sure why perhaps other reviews may help to explain that. Overall then, the movie is definitely worth a watch though perhaps there's no need to rush to the cinema to see it now."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Tim Burton reminds me of a ""Seinfeld"" episode when Kramer tells Jerry he is going to a fantasy camp and Jerry says ""Kramer's whole life is a fantasy camp"". Burton has earned his place in Hollywood and is now in a position to create what he wants, when he wants it. Best known for his films such as ""Batman"", ""Beetlejuice"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Big Fish"" and this year's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", Burton never fails to deliver a creative piece of film-making that brings something new to the screen.<br/><br/>""Corpse Bride"" is no exception with its stunning artistry and animation accompanied by a solid story line, terrific music and star power voice acting from the likes of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson and Albert Finney. Check out some of the details of the animation - wood rot on the Bride's casket and intricacy in the costumes. The great Danny Elfman shines once again with amazing music and work as Bonejangles. The entire saloon musical fantasy is unlike anything ever seen on film.<br/><br/>All the voice acting is excellent, but special notice goes to Helena Bonham Carter as the Corpse Bride, Jane Horracks as the Black Widow and the legend, Christopher Lee as the Pastor. Probably not for very small kids, but otherwise most kids, teens and adults should enjoy and appreciate this excellent, though short film. One cool bit of nostalgia is that the brand of piano in the mansion is Harryhausen, a Burton tip of the cap to the original master of stop action special effects seen in the old dinosaur and Sinbad movies."

","After getting hooked on Tim Burton's stop-motion animation after The Nightmare Before Christmas I couldn't wait until his next SMA picture. Anyone who is thinking about seeing this gem shouldn't wait. Just go see it! Whether you're a fan of Tim Burton or the SMA process this movie will deliver. If you're looking for NBC cameos you'll be disappointed although people have made connections between characters in Corpse Bride and NBC. I thought the story was very touching and emotional. Emily is so easy to connect with--who hasn't gotten their heart broken more than once? Poor Victor doesn't know what to do with himself with the approach of his marriage to a woman he's never met, but once he gets into the Land of the Dead his life seems to perk up a bit (pun intended). :). The animation was superb, fluid and clean and the voices were perfectly cast (who remembers Jane Horrocks from ""Little Voice""?). Danny Elfman yet again delivers a memorable and beautiful score that will live with his fans for many years to come. And the Oscar goes to...? Who knows? Hopefully fans of this movie (and Danny Elfman for that matter) will be rewarded."

Some of the parts of this movie were very good though. And some parts were actually quite emotional. A lot of the time these emotions were ones of sadness.

","Wouldn't you think having the word 'Corpse' in the title would clue you in that this is not a cutesy cartoon movie? Luckily it isn't too gruesome. What violence there is is more hinted at than shown and the undead are actually a lot more fun than the living. There were quite a few children at the showing I went to and there were only a few times when the younger ones became frightened. If you think hard enough there is a message about how true love means letting go and you can't move forward if you are holding tight to the past, but it's better to just sit back and enjoy the artistry of stop-motion animation and Tim Butron's warped view of love and life....and death."

The comic relief was in there without this character. Now for the things I liked I loved the story and most of the music. I let my son watch it and he loved the part where the skeletons were dancing and singing. This is where you find out that Emily-The Corpse Bride was murdered for her dowry. I loved the part where Emily was singing about why he can't love her. I liked the ending where Emily gets justice for her murder & it has a surprising ending.

","""Corpse Bride"" wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. I am usually a big fan of Tim Burton's work (and Danny Elfman's music) but ""Corpse Bride"" just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>Maybe it's that I didn't realize it was a musical, but the music caught me completely off guard. I had not expected that at all. The score was nice, but the songs were rather painful to listen to with less than stellar singers and extremely repetitive lyrics. In short, I have no plans to rush to the store and purchase the soundtrack.<br/><br/>I've never seen ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" so I have no clue what it's like but I really, really hated the animation. It was awkward and took away from the plot (and not in a good way). I suppose that it was all done on purpose but still... It's full of the quirkiness that defines Tim Burton's work. Which can be a good thing depending on whether or not you enjoy that quirkiness. But I did really like how the Corpse Bride turned out. Very pretty. (If you can say that about a corpse...) =P For the first 20 minutes or so of the movie were really painful for me. The first song almost made me turn it off and the distracting animations were beginning to give me a headache. But I stuck with it long enough for the plot to begin (which in my opinion, took to long). The only reason that I kept watching was because I really couldn't predict the ending. Who would Victor choose? The Corpse Bride or Victoria? Victoria is his love, but he is also attracted to the Corpse Bride, making her the one he *should* marry according to Hollywood standards. (No I did not just give the ending away) in case you were wondering. The ""twist"" at the end concerning the Corpse Bride's murder didn't surprise me at all - I saw it coming from a mile away.<br/><br/>""Corpse Bride"" wasn't all that bad - but it definitely wasn't as good as I thought it would. Tim Burton really let me down on this one. ""Corpse Bride"" earns itself a 5/10."

I realize that a lot of you may come to that conclusion when seeing the models he uses and the colour schemes, but it's not just that.<br/><br/>The story once again just follows people who are dead messing with people who are living. Don't get me wrong, there were many good moments, and parts where I was laughing out loud, but for the most part I was just plain bored. When you see this you will realize that you have actually seen this movie before, and it's just Nightmare with new characters.<br/><br/>I realize that this is Tim Burton's style of making movies, but come on, he is just beating a dead horse now.

Thinking that he's like some sort of modern day Gilbert & Sullivan, commenting on the foibles and subtle nuances of the modern day society, Tim Burton litters his movie with a series of show stopping songs (in the negative connotation of that phrase), and it takes just soooo very long to restart the movie after each one that it just kills the momentum of the movie. <br/><br/>So many reviews I've read have had a much higher opinion of the movie that just isn't justified by the product on the screen.<br/><br/>Cute story, but many of the other dead characters cried out to be played up.

With a running time of 75 minutes though there isn't any room for substantial development which is unfortunate.<br/><br/>The character Emily had so much heart and her one contribution musically had some nice lyrics, though overall I found the songs lacking other then the piano piece which was terrific but doled out in too few increments. <br/><br/>CB lacked the cuteness, the wit, the humor and charisma of Nightmare Before Christmas, and the potential in glimpses we get here and there are merely teases in a movie that ends up feeling like a mismanaged script, rushed out the door with too little clothes on.<br/><br/>The ending was also rushed and the butterfly sequence not as strong as it could have been if we were given more time to fall in love with Emily. She had potential and we do get those glimpses like I said, but too few and far between.<br/><br/>The beginning starts off rather cliché, but at midpoint picks up in a story twist that is fantastic if you didn't know it was coming, worth watching but I felt more tantalized then gratified."

The living characters acted wooden and dull, while the dead characters seemed alive and active. (Purposefully?) I like the look and feel of the movie however. It was definitely a Tim Burton film. The direction was top notch as always, but the score left a bitter taste in my mouth. The songs weren't very enjoyable. In The Nightmare Before Christmas, every single song was very memorable. I am sad to say, Corpse Bride songs are just forgettable.<br/><br/>In fact, I want to forget this movie was made right now. Tim Burton did a fabulous job on the direction and I applaud him for that. It was Elfmans score (and I'm a fan), and the story (or lack thereof?) that made this a disappointment. Please don't kill me NBC fan boys. I was hoping for exactly what you were."
"GizleHobbit","5","1","5","24 December 2006"," Visually pleasing, but lacks.
","When I went out to see the Corpse Bride, I had medium expectations to prevent any kind of disappointment. But, alas, this movie still was short of something. Visually, it is very creative, but I was upset that Burton didn't stick to the same animation method that he had used for Nightmare Before Christmas. Everything looks too pretty (not as in pink and fluffy, but too airbrushed, I guess), and doesn't have that kind of tangible look that Nightmare Before Christmas or Vincent had.<br/><br/>The story in itself is very lacking. There is no arc, so there is never any sense of excitement or peril. Everything goes by so quickly, and there isn't any kind of leading up to the ending. The ending also is not satisfying at all, in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you're a REAL Tim Burton fan, not some Hot Topic teenager, then I recommend that for a Tim Burton fix you watch Big Fish, and just avoid this movie altogether."

","PRE Oscars REVIEW: Okay, I'm not with consensus and I will say that Corpse Bride was not the great masterpiece I expected. Although I will say this.If Danny Elfman does not get an Oscar this year I will be boycotting the Oscars for five minutes. Those might be the worst five minutes of my life but it will be all about principle. Elfman's score and songs are mind blowing and save the film from being a bad Burton film.<br/><br/>The thing that killed the film for me was the script. The dialogue was just a bit bland and boring. It couldn't keep my attention. My attention was restored when the clay-mation characters would break out into a song and dance. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Emily Watson give their characters life respectively but the screenplay is just not fresh enough. Tim Burton's last effort at clay-animation was the no less than masterful ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" but sorry to let you down folks that this is no where near it. More than likely in March you will find ""Corpse Bride"" in the Animated Feature category but not too sure what will happen after that. But I am almost positive that this will not follow the path of ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles"" and grab a screenplay nod along with it.<br/><br/>I still love Tim Burton with his eye and quirkiness of film but this might be near the bottom of his list of work. Sound Editing, Sound, Original Score, Original Song, and Best Animated Feature are the film's chances. Better luck next time Burton."

","The Corpse Bride, Tim Burton's second venture to share the magic of stop motion animation to a new generation, is a film I wanted to love. I really wanted to love it. But unlike Victor's piano playing in the movie, it seemed to be a note or two off. Technically the film was superior than his first venture, The Nightmare Before Christmas. In all honesty, the script and music were as good if not better than Nightmare also. But it seemed to lack that emotional tug and enthusiasm that Nightmare has. But before I go further, I leave the disclaimer that Nightmare is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The Corpse Bride may suffer another flaw with me that is unfair to it- deferred love and praise from a cult classic. Just like that actor or actress who receives an Oscar nomination for a lesser role because last years phenomenal performance was overlooked, The Corpse Bride might have acquired a little extra unearned hype from Burton's first venture that went initially unnoticed by the mass audience. I think that if you were to have seen this film before Nightmare, it would definitely impress. And it did even to me. I watched the whole film and enjoyed myself. The scene where Bonejangles leads his skeleton band is fun to watch. The end actually maintained a solid level of suspense and closed the story on a great note. But ultimately the simple characters, arguably no more complex than in Nightmare, never really stuck to memory for me. And as enjoyable as the cinematic ride was, I guess I would prefer to ride down the cult cinema of Nightmare, not The Corpse Bride, any time."

The visuals are stunning and are reminiscent of Monty Python and Nightmare Before Christmas, but you're still left wanting more. The problem that I see it is that there are not enough of the dead parts. The land of the dead in both Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride are great fun, beautiful and show the macabre talents of Tim Burton off at his best. Unfortunately in Corpse Bride the story is hardly there and suffers for it. If Tim and Johnny weren't the people they are you could excuse this as a way of making a it of quick cash, however it just ends up as a nice idea that just doesn't come off. Perhaps the problem was that I loved Nightmare Before Christmas and expected too much from this film.

","The Nightmare Before Christmas was a fantastic stop-motion animation film, and this second one from director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) was one I looked forward to, and I'm glad I gave it another chance. Basically shy and nervous Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is getting married to the woman he has never met, Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), but he is not confident to recite his vows before his parents Nell (Tracey Ullman) and William (Paul Whitehouse), her parents Finnis (Albert Finney) and Maudeline (Joanna Lumley), or Pastor Galswells (Sir Christopher Lee). So he wanders into the forest to get some practise, and he manages to remember the lines correctly, placing the ring on what he thinks is a stick, but is in fact a corpse bride. This is Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) believes that Victor was genuinely reciting the lines to her, because when she died was waiting for her groom to-be to return, but he never did, and she has waiting in her after-life ever since. Victor sees this misunderstanding first as a way to get out of his arranged marriage, but it takes him quite a while to try and genuinely develop any true feeling towards his dead ""wife"". When it looks like he may actually go through a real marriage with Emily, by killing himself, it is Victoria who brings him ""back to life"" and he realises his true feelings. In the end, Emily gets revenge on the groom who left her for dead, Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant), and she goes back to her ""life"" in the world of the dead. Also starring Michael Gough as Elder Gutknecht, Jane Horrocks as Black Widow Spider and Mrs. Plum, and composer Danny Elfman as Bonejangles. The voice casting is very good, the animation is splendid, there are some alright songs, and the dark atmosphere is still very much poignant, it may not be as inspired as Nightmare, but it is certainly one worth watching. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Very good!"

","While I am not among the nodding legions who hail every work of Master Burton ""an artistic masterpiece,"" I will acknowledge his talent for visual flair, which is in abundance in ""Corpse Bride."" Unfortunately, the dazzling eye candy falls flat in the wake of a blandly conventional story (boy is arranged to marry girl; meets dead girl; boy then finds his commitment in question) that simply isn't ""fresh"" enough to merit the painstaking craft of stop-motion animation. The ghoulish undead underworld looks like a tamed version of Clive Barker's Midian (from ""Nightbreed""), the song lyrics are mostly indecipherable (but that might be a good thing), and the gags revolve around painfully obvious puns and dangling/popped-out eyeballs. And, once again, Burton hammers home the importance of ""accepting people for what they are...even if they ARE dead,"" as he's done in seemingly all of his films. The presence of veteran actors Michael Gough (voicing one of the wise undead) and Christopher Lee (as a wonderfully cantankerous priest) provide some bright spots, but cannot elevate ""Corpse Bride"" above its glaring superficialness."

Tim Burton had a little success with nightmare before Christmas, could be because he didn't direct it. so he thought he might do the exact same thing, but throw johnny deep into the mix, and it will be twice as good right?...wrong. it was absolutely awful. the one thing i got out of seeing this movie is that i learned that the hands on my watch glow in the dark, cause i was counting the seconds till i got to leave. my suggestion is that Tim Burton should crawl back into the crack pipe that he came out of."

He's very shy and though he's never met her, he likes her, and this makes him bumbling and nervous. While practicing his lines for the ceremony, he slips a ring on a corpse's finger and she comes to life and takes him to the world of the dead, where he is seemingly trapped.<br/><br/>The corpse bride herself is a character of so much personality that she totally destroys the plot. She's insane and is keeping the man from his true love... which would make her a good villain. She's also been wronged and is innocent and is attractive, which make her a good love interest. This is where things really get screwed up: the whole idea for a movie this careless with plot is to stick to a formula. Unfortunately, it's the formula these days to deviate from ""the formula"" so the whole love interest part of the story gets completely screwed up and makes you kind of hate the main character.<br/><br/>The songs are dull, obviously meant to stretch the movie to be an acceptable length.<br/><br/>But most of all, there's nothing very impressive about the visuals in the movie that wasn't vastly better in The Nightmare Before Christmas. The land of the dead, frankly, isn't that appealing. Everything moves way too much, it's jarring.

"elicopperman","6","0","1","6 June 2018"," Beautiful Albeit Simple Gothic Tale
","Despite Tim Burton being mistaken for making The Nightmare Before Christmas, it was actually his friend Henry Selick who directed the whole movie during its entire production. In reality, Burton has only directed two stop-motion animated films as of late, and one of which is Corpse Bride, based on a 19th century Russian folklore. Given it's critical praise and decent box office revenue, I think Burton managed to pull together a quite unique and gothic movie that holds up for the most part. <br/><br/>For starters, the actual story is pretty simple and even kind of predictable, as it centers around the nervous Victor Van Dort who is soon to be married to Victoria Everglot through an arranged family marriage. While practicing his lines for the wedding, he accidentally puts the ring on a branch that drags him to the land of the dead. The branch is really the hand of a corpse named Emily, who was murdered after eloping with her love. Now Victor must set things right before Victoria marries the villainous Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant). While the story line is pretty routine and easy to follow, the heart of the movie is what makes it shine, as the emotions drive the movie by showing and even answering what it means to marry the dead. There are even some neat concepts about entering the land of the living that showcase the film's occasional creativity. While not high in substance, the story's dark atmosphere and harmonious tone make it a breath of fresh air for anyone into mysterious romance.<br/><br/>Character-wise, most of them are rather one-dimensional but by no means horrible. Although Victor doesn't have much personality outside of his gawkiness, the things he goes through by ending up with a risen corpse of a bride does make him somewhat endearing and it makes one feel sorry for him as he just wants to make things right with his fake and real fiance. As for Emily, she has a rather tragic yet beautiful story-arc that anyone can find touching and heart-breaking, and whenever she sings about her remorseful state, she really gives the movie some much needed heart. Even Victor's fiance, Victoria, is worth giving some sympathy for considering the financial crisis her family is in. The rest of the cast range from bland like Victor's family, to weak and petty like the antagonistic Barkis Bittern, to even rather annoying like the comical reliefs. <br/><br/>Next, the animation is just beautiful, as it goes for a very gothic and Burtonesque visual style that perfectly emulates the macabre setting of 19th century Victorian London. Although not quite as expressive as the characters in Nightmare, or even the Aardman and Laika films, the characters stay true to their simple albeit exaggerated graphic designs and faces. One notable highlight of visual splendor has to be the Land of the Living, as it features the most imaginative looking creatures and most amount of sickly colors to bring the world to life, complete with numerous somber and enticing effects.<br/><br/>As for the songs, Remains of the Day is quite entertaining and upbeat while serving as a backstory to how Emily became the way she is. Otherwise, despite serving the story, none of the songs really stand out to much. They are well thought out and perfectly timed, but they don't have that certain pizazz that makes them memorable enough like Nightmare. Although Danny Elfman's music score is appropriately haunting and poetic, fully embracing the bleak and lovely setting of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, despite being rather straight forward in its story and not being perfect in terms of character or even songs, Corpse Bride works well enough as an touching and haunting macabre tale that will make any fan of gothic stories, Tim Burton, or even animation go nuts over. I recommend this movie enough to say that it's worth a watch, even if it's not quite up there with other stop-motion films in terms of story or character, but at least the visuals are gorgeous. Not sure if Tim Burton is still planning on making more stop-motion animated films, but here's to a bright future if he's still interested in doing so."

"Dar_Sargent","1","0","2","4 November 2017"," A frustrating waste
","I went into this movie with very low expectations, and I was still let down. ""Corpse Bride"" is a frustrating experience because it takes a lot of skilled and talented people, then wastes their talents on a lazy, uninspired production.<br/><br/>The script feels like a first draft, where someone threw in a bunch of half-baked ideas and meant to turn them into something good later, but he just never got around to it. For example: We first meet our hero, Victor, in a room with scientific gear, studying a butterfly. His interest in science never shows up again, even though it would be so much fun to see a scientist react to all the magic in the film. Later the spirit of Victor's dead dog comes back; Victor is delighted at first, then he just ignores his dog for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Victor's parents are earnest, decently-interesting characters who have a huge role for the whole first half of the film... then, suddenly, they're written out of the movie in the most random and stupid manner possible, never to be mentioned again.<br/><br/>We visit the Land of the Dead, where some spirits party all the time, but other spirits work crappy jobs sweeping the streets for no clear reason. Are these spirits just stuck in this afterlife forever? If so, why are there only like 15 people in the Land of the Dead? The very end of the film suggests that they move on to eternal rest (or reincarnation? it's vague) after they find peace, but nothing else in the film ever even hints at this idea, so it comes out of nowhere in the last few seconds.<br/><br/>This is a problem when Emily, The Corpse Bride herself, is a major character, but we never learn what she can or can't do. She can apparently talk to animals and do some other magic. It sure would be fun to see more of her magical abilities, but this movie just can't bother to use that much imagination.<br/><br/>But I must give special attention to the biggest ""screw you"" to the audience: Victoria's subplot. To sum it up: She sees that Victor is in trouble; she wants to go help him, but her parents tell her to calm down and lock her in her room. So she makes a tense and daring escape! We root for her character and want to see her succeed! But instead, the first person she asks for help just brings her back home, and she's locked in again. The entire scene was a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>This would be disappointing enough. But THEN, her parents tell her they will marry her to a sleazy new suitor. Victoria has been totally dynamic up to this point, and now she has more reason than ever to go find Victor and set things right... but she just gives up instead. The screenwriter got so lazy that he just made her clam up & obey her parents, even though this goes against everything we've learned about her character. For a short time, Victoria is the most likable, proactive character, and then she suddenly turns into a complete wimp.<br/><br/>Unless you have very, very low standards, stuff like the above subplot will leave you feeling cheated, betrayed, and even a little disgusted with the laziness and shoddiness of the story.<br/><br/>My heart bled for all the hard-working animators who put countless hours of work and effort into this film, only to create an embarrassing, ridiculous waste of time because the writing-directing team was so shamefully lazy. The same goes for the voice actors: most of the puppets are so sorely limited, it would be way more fun just to watch the actors saying their lines in a recording booth. (Christopher Lee especially suffers, as he ranges from bombastic to subtle, while his puppet character is stiff & listless.) It's a horrible waste of talent."

Corpse Bride is a far more contained story than his previous effort, Big Fish, but it does have some adventurous moments. In fact, it's kind of like a cross between Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice. But to me, there was just something missing.<br/><br/>The voice talent is strong here with frequent Burton collaborators Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter tackling the groom and the ""corpse bride"" respectively. But I didn't find either character to be all that compelling. Victor Van Dort (Depp) is a shy groom with a lack of confidence, and he doesn't have the charisma to get me to root hard for him. On the other-hand, the corpse bride has an intriguingly tragic backstory, but also falls victim to bland dialogue. To me, the most interesting characters are the ones in the background who come and go with eccentric scenery.<br/><br/>A film is only as good as its leads, and although it's impressively animated by Laika, the characters end up taking second fiddle to a Gothic underbelly of strange characters feasting on the inexperience of the bride and the groom. I like the attempt of Burton and crew, and there certainly is some joy to be had here, but the execution just isn't there. Style over substance. To put it bluntly, the film itself is more dead than it is alive.<br/><br/>+Eccentric side characters<br/><br/>-Imaginative but lacks thought out characters<br/><br/>-Incomplete execution<br/><br/>5.3/10"

","Victor Van Dort and Victoria Everglot are arranged to be married. The Van Dorts need the social status. The Everglots are broke and need the new money even if it smells like fish. The regimented rehearsal wedding goes terribly wrong. Victor goes off to practice his vows. When he places his ring on the finger of a corpse, he finds himself married to the deceased Emily, and he is transported to the world of the dead.<br/><br/>The Tim Burton stop-motion animation is impeccable. The real world is very grey, and the dead world is colorful. It starts off in a horribly stuffy ugly world that looks very tired. The lead is a meek guy. It looks interesting but the story isn't that compelling.<br/><br/>The dead world looks much more imaginative. It's definitely much more colorful. I didn't particular care for any of the songs. They all sound like Broadway rejects. I didn't like any of the characters, but I didn't find them that compelling to hate either. I certainly wouldn't want to stay in the dead world. It wasn't even a close call since Victoria seems to be such a sweetheart.<br/><br/>However I've got to give it credit for it's great Tim Burton style.

","Believe me, I really wanted to like Corpse Bride a whole lot, but I only liked it just a little.<br/><br/>Almost right off the bat I realized just how bored and, yes, tired I've grown of Tim Burton's dark, dank visions and all of their prevailing morbidity. I'd say that it's definitely time for Burton to take off those frickin' morticians spectacles (or whatever it is that he wears to view the world) and turn his gaze away from what's grave and gloomy, to look up towards the sunlight for a change of pace.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride's story was supposed to be set in 19th Century Europe, but, naturally, with Danny Elfman's predictably recyclable musical score (I swear I heard strains of the Spiderman theme, and others, weaving their way through the soundtrack), a ridiculous American-style, pop/jazz finger-snapper (that included an elaborate dance routine) was carelessly thrown into the musical mix for good measure.<br/><br/>What struck me as really quite odd about Corpse Bride's story was the exaggerated emphasis that was put on all of the ""liveliness"" that takes place down in the Land of the Dead. Yeah. Things down below the earth were definitely about 100 times more ""lively"" than anything that was taking place in the Land of the Living.<br/><br/>And, I asked myself - Like, was this supposed to be some sort of a screwy message, telling me that when it comes to ""living-it-up"" we're all better off dead? - 'Cause, hey, folks, death is when the real partying starts.<br/><br/>And if things weren't disappointing enough as it is, there was no denying that Corpse Bride's whole storyline was terribly wonky and disjointed, like you wouldn't believe. And, what's more, the entire effect of the stop-motion animation was so dazzlingly slick and seamless that it looked identical to CGI, which, in a way, defeated the whole idea of stop-motion.<br/><br/>Yep. As far as I'm concerned, Corpse Bride was better off dead than alive.<br/><br/>And, that's that!"

","I did enjoy Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. For all of its' flaws, it was good solid fun. The Corpse Bride could have been great and could have been one of the greats of clay-mation. Tim Burton, who helped work on The Nightmare Before Christmas one of my favorite films of all time, has an idea how to make a good stop-motion film. The Corpse Bride is a passable movie that has TONS of problems that are constantly overlooked by fans of this movie. The Corpse Bride is only an OK effort. The story centers around Victor. A shy groom who practices his wedding vows in the presence of a dead woman, she rises from the grave assuming he has married her. The story is just silly even compared to other Burton work. There is also a side story about a murder but that isn't even worth mentioning as it is pretty obvious what the twist is. Again this is very character driven. an average story. The good things are good in a sense of that it has to be good. Good music, amazing character designs, nice animation, and cool sets. Then again, ALL Burton movies do all of these so what do I do about it here? The problems are obvious. dumb story, bad characters and predictable plot. I can tell you exactly every way this movie will go from point to point throughout. The characters are lame and the main character is just a wuss. I wasn't rooting for him at all and I just did not care about him. This movie has problems and tie with the good. Overall, the movie is satisfactory. It may look like I bashed this film but that is only because it is so disappointing. The Corpse Bride could have been so much more, but it stands as an average effort of a movie that I was just disappointed in. <br/><br/>Next up, Tim Burton goes down the rabbit hole and everyone scrambles to get back up in his first bad movie."

","The first thing is that am not a fan of musicals at all and I was not aware till I saw it. Tim Burton has made a good attempt in creating a dark fantasy in 3d animation. But still it feels as if the things are rushed a lot and a lot is happening quickly without creating an impression in our mind. The only character I can remember is of the bride which is crafted beautifully. Being a musical it had to have some fine score and songs but to a big disappointed I can't even recall anything.  Now coming to technical aspects, the visuals are stunning and the screenplay is designed to be a little scary in some places. Therefore am sure kids won't like it. The theme is nice but script don't hold to it and I don't know but there is some problem that it failed to gain my applause. There is no character development which is very disappointing as it ends suggesting nothing. For me its overly rated may be due to Tim Burton but its not more than an average movie which will serve for a limited audience only."

With all the singing and the gloomy colors and etc. But after Emily brought Victor down to their world, I lost interest. I stopped watching. It seemed boring to me.<br/><br/>I didn't watch it for several days (2? 3?) until tonight. I forced myself to go through the remaining scenes and I found that I could actually tolerate it. It wasn't captivating, but it was adequate enough. Okay entertainment for a night.<br/><br/>I found this movie dull, bland and boring. I always thought Tim Burton was a genius, but after re-watching this, I found that I didn't really like his style. I understand the appeal his movies have to certain audiences, but it wasn't to my liking at all. Sorry.<br/><br/>However, to be fair, I did like the piano scene between Emily and Victor and all the other songs, though.

He has to choose between these two tender, caring women, without breaking either of their hearts--even if one of their hearts isn't beating. He has to live up to the obligations and promises he makes, no matter how clumsily, 'til death do they part--even if they're already dead. Yeah, yeah, I can come up with them all day, and really that's the basic gist of 90% of the humor in this thing.<br/><br/>It looks pretty, though the ""Downstairs"" neon lighting is a change from expectations. There are some really stunning moments of animation in here, but some of it is really flat, especially in the non-lead character design (is that a scrotum on her head?). I actually really like the lead characters for the most part, Johnny Depp's voice work is better than expected, but the movie doesn't get going until the ""She's a corpse bride!"" song and a lot of the minor characters seem to merely stretch out screen-time. Plus, the evil Lord Barkis is... well, not really all that stand-out-ish, as characters are concerned. He feels almost obligatory.<br/><br/>Fans of movies Burton's a fan of will get excited by those little asides (Victor and Victoria, really?), and fans of Burton get exactly what they want from him. This movie isn't bad but it's certainly not great, and for some reasons seems to miss some of the magical excitement of a lot of Burton's other works, animated and live-action--much like, unfortunately, a good part of his later career, which seems to spare no expense of the visuals but only seems half-hearted in the execution.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

Depp and Bonham-Carter make for a lovely duo in spite of the origins and alignments of their characters, proving once again that Tim Burton knows what he's doing.<br/><br/>This is one brave film maker. He exhibits no fear in conquering an ages-old story, a well-loved franchise, or in introducing something never seen before. He is fearless and uniquely creative, and everything (so far) with his name on it has been creatively different in its execution, with or without a slick production style, including this, the Corpse Bride.

Skills that seem to go amiss, when he's shooting Sci-Fi movies, but that's another story.<br/><br/>Let's concentrate on this movie, a fairy tale starring his favorite actor Johnny Depp. But since it's an animated movie, it's his voice you'll get to hear. And since it's animated, Mr. Burton can again relish in big faces and big eyes. Something he is very fond of (maybe from the time he worked at Disney?

","Having been eagerly anticipating the release of this movie, I found it a tad disappointing, primarily because it is so irritatingly similar to Nightmare Before Christmas.<br/><br/>The real problem is that it doesn't seem to be sure whether it's aimed at kids or adults, and it consequently fails on both counts.<br/><br/>It looks gorgeous (albeit exactly the same as Nightmare Before Christmas), and has some fantastic ideas very cleverly realised, but the story drags and ultimately bores, and Danny Elfman's songs - as fantastic, if somewhat generic, his scores are - do not have the strength of those by, say, the Sherman Brothers or Alan Menkin, to keep us sufficiently engaged.<br/><br/>One also has to wonder why they bothered getting Johnny Depp in to voice the main character (beside its obvious financial implications) as his voice is unidentifiable. On the whole, a lot of the supporting voices are very satisfying if you know who they are.

Something that gave me a good laugh was a very small and nearly unnoticeable line in the movie - in which Mr. Everglot calls Victor (the hero) ""Vincent"" by mistake... This, as I believe, is somewhat of an ""Inside"" joke of Tim Burton's... since one of his early movies (short claymation movie) is called ""Vincent"", which is a real gem (should be a classic and taught in film-schools, in my humble opinion). In ""Vincent"" - the main character looks like an earlier version of Victor, something I noticed right away - just by looking at the ""corpse bride"" movie poster.

I hadn't seen many films in stop-motion before, so this was definitely a treat for me.<br/><br/>The sound in the theaters was not very clear, so I couldn't hear some of the things that the characters were saying/singing. It helped a lot better when I bought the DVD the day it came out. I really enjoy the songs by Danny Elfman, especially ""Remains of the Day"" preformed in the movie by Bonejangles and his ""bone boys"" in the colorful club down in the Land of the Dead, which is also the home of many enjoyable characters such as Bonejangles, Miss Plum and the rest of the kitchen staff, and who could forget, the Corpse Bride, beautifully voiced by Helena Bonham Carter. In my opinion, she was perfect for the part, and no one could do it better. Johnny Depp's performance as Victor Van Dort, was definitely my favorite. Victor is such an incredible adorable, innocent character that you'll learn to love.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride is the story of Victor, son of Nell and William Van Dort, fish merchants in a colorless Victorian town. Victor is pledged to be married to Victoria Everglot, who's parents are Maudiline and Finis. While at the wedding rehearsal, Victor just cannot get his vows right, and goes into the forrest to practice. It just so happens, that when he finally get's his vows right, he places the ring on a twig, which is actually the finger of Emily, the Corpse Bride, who was obviously murdered by her lover (Bonejangles tells this story in the song I mentioned, ""Remains of the Day""), who eventually almost married Victoria, and was going to murder HER for her parent's money (which they didn't have any to begin with, he later finds out), until towards the end, when he drinks the ""Wine of Ages"", a type of ""poison"" that Victor was to drink when he was about to marry Emily (he finds out Victoria was pledged to be married to Barkis, while still traped in the Land of the Dead).<br/><br/>The story, characters, animation, and music are the things that make the movie so great.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up for Tim Burton!

The Bride takes him with her, and so he gets lost in her world, the world of the dead.<br/><br/>One of the most extraordinary things, that make this movie so special, is that Burton succeeded something special: he managed to make the wold of the dead more alive than the world of the living themselves. But, even in the living world of the dead, Victor feels unwanted, and asks to return back, for he loves Victoria.<br/><br/>Things get a little messy, but I am not going to give away anything else.

","Corpse bride is an interesting and beautiful story. In this movie, Tim presents Death as something different than how we know it to be, and he tries to give us another perspective on death. As we know, everyone is afraid of death, but in this movie, Tim describes death as another world that is totally different than the living world. I think Tim wants us to realize that after death, the next life is very simple, without complications or hassles, and can even be fun! Not like the land of the living where there is a lot of spite and discrimination. In the world of the dead, the souls are one hand, they have the same feelings and concern and worry. However, in the land of the living no one cares about one another. In the afterlife, the souls live in peace, without guilt and without double- dealing. In conclusion, death as we know it is really dark and frightening and to imagine it in a positive light is very hard.

","Much like his ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" uses state-of-the-art, stop-motion animation to tell a cheerily morbid story - this one showcasing bodies in various stages of decomposition larking it up in a musical comedy underworld. Think of it as a role-reversal version of the myth about the god Hades and his reluctant bride Persephone, kidnapped from the land of the living.<br/><br/>Victor is a painfully shy and awkward young man who is about to enter into an arranged marriage with an equally shy young woman, coincidentally named Victoria (even more ""coincidentally,"" the movie takes place in the Victorian Era). However, on the eve of the wedding, Victor finds himself ""married"" to a dead woman whose frozen corpse he stumbles upon in a nearby forest. Victor is immediately whisked away to the Land of the Dead, where skeletons sing and dance, and where maggots and black widow spiders offer words of advice for the benighted newlywed couple. Much of the story involves Victor's desperate attempts to flee the scene and Victoria's concomitant efforts to bring him back to the land of the living.<br/><br/>The talented animators have had a bit of ironic fun with the visual palette, bathing the scenes set in the real world in a ghostly-blue pallor, while bringing the Land of the Dead to life with vibrant, splashy colors. In both foreground and background, the animation has a clean, uncluttered look, with the exaggerated, severely angular features of the characters providing amusing commentary on their personalities. The dialogue is clever, sharp and witty, and the musical numbers have a buoyancy and bounce to them that help keep the morbid subject matter palatable for all but the very youngest audience members. The film is also blessed with fine voice-over work from the likes of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Albert Finney, and horror movie veteran Christopher Lee.<br/><br/>""Corpse Bride"" is a relaxing, unfrenetic treat for those on all points of the life/death continuum."

","You can only love this film. It's all perfect: the characters, the story, the soundtrack, the cinematography, the dubbing. My mum also, who doesn't like Tim Burton, loved this film very much. Victor (dubbed by Johnny Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean  Dead man's chest) and Victoria (dubbed by Emily Watson, Separate lies) are an engaged couple. Victor can't remember the wedding wording, and, trying it in a wood, he puts the wedding ring in a branch emerging from the ground. But the branch is a corpse bride's finger, so Victor finds himself married to a dead girl. The Corpse bride is dubbed by Helena Bonham Carter, who does a great job. Each frame emits sweet romance and dark romanticism, but it's never sugary and mawkish. It's Tim Burton to cube, you can perceive the same atmosphere as Edward scissorhands. The faithful Danny Elfman signs the splendid soundtrack and the funny songs. My favourite sequence is when Victor and the Corpse Bride play the piano, but also when Mr. Bonejangles and his skeletal jazz band sing to Victor the story of Corpse bride's sad end. The characters of the parents and the Archbishop Galswell (dubbed by Christopher Lee) are really funny. It's magnificent the comparison between the Alive ones' world and Dead ones' world. Dead ones live in a colourful and happy downstairs; upstairs, alive ones live among conventions and dullness. It's really unfair Tim Burton's Corpse bride didn't win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature: it was worth, in every way."

","I've just watched CB and I can honestly say it's enchanted.OK,the plot and the characters are pretty clichéd(in basic means of course,it's not that you see a corpse bride living underground with skeletons and interesting insects everyday!),but the power of this sadly-short picture is not it's great scenario or exciting storyline.It's proved over and over again that you don't always need a genius plot to give an artistic performance(Johnny Depp of all people knows it best I think.Exhibit A:Pirates of the Caribbean.)And if we don't call CB artistic,I don't know which animation deserves this title. It's so sweet with little,well-placed details,I'm still smiling.It's not one of my immortal movies,I admit(that's why it receives 7,not full marks from me)but I'll always remember it with a smile. I liked it although I sadly watched it dubbed in Turkish(I always prefer original and I'm really curious about the characters singing voices)and the sound was so low because of a problem in my PC.

","Tim Burton is a very weird and interesting individual. With movies like Ed Wood, Mars Attacks!, Edward Scissorhands, and Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, he creates movies that are visually stunning, weird, funny, touching and heartwarming. Here, he takes an old folk legend about a nervous groom and turns it into an animated film. Here, we are introduced to Victor Von Dort (Johnny Depp), whose parents are making him get married to the wealthy Victoria Everglot so they can inherit her family's fortunes (Emily Watson) whose parents are making her get married to him to inherit his family's fortunes. Victor is very nervous on his wedding day and goes into the woods to practice his vows. He tries it on what looks like a stick, but turns out to be the hand of The Corpse Bride (Helena Bonam Carter) and he has just proposed to her! She takes him down to the Land of the Dead and prepares to marry him all the while, he is pining for Victoria and planning to return to her. The voice actors did very well here and changed their voices so that you couldn't even recognize them and the visual effect were astounding. All in all, a good little animated musical family film. <br/><br/>3 out of 4 stars"

As I said before, the voices are great, especially Depp, he turns in a very convincing performance with the shy and humble Victor. Every scene in the movie looks amazing, every little detail, just fantastic. The only thing I found wrong with the film was its length, too short =(. Highly recommended for everyone!"

","The Corpse bride is so detailed, you must watch this movie over & over. The living are so depressing, judgmental and full of deceit. The dead were so hospitable, full of life and feeling. The wealthy were poorer than the poor. The poor had more wealth than those in High Society. Society's standards killed the lives of the living. While death awakened the happiness in the dead.<br/><br/>After watching ""The Nightmare before Christmas"". I realized both movies were about how life and death may not be what they seem, and may be closer than you think or want to accept. Plus It takes a lot of talent to make mutilated and decayed bodies to be the life of the party, entertaining to children without being scary and not a curse word in either movie. More family movies should be like this. Song, dance, and an odd concept that is genius once you get it. Also loved the butterfly opening and closing the movie. Very Nice.It's an awesome movie."

","I didn't see this at the cinema, so maybe I have lost something in the translation to DVD/TV.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, this is a great piece of cinema - great characterisation, clever story, lovely to look at - but it seems a bit soulless (no pun intended!). It seems that the new technology used to create the effects detracted from the flow of the story - this is not unusual, though. It lacks the life of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", somehow (again, no pun intended). NBC left me with a feeling of warmth and vitality that is curiously lacking from this one. Still, I would recommend anyone to see ""Corpse Bride"" - it is worth an hour-and-a-half of anyone's time!"
"ScooterKSU","8","0","1","30 July 2006"," Why Go Up There When People Are Dying to Get Down Here?
","As a child, one of the many reasons I loved Christmas was the many stop-motion animated specials that were shown at the time. But with the advent of CGI and other special effects of the like, the stop-motion art has nearly died. But luckily the genre has a savior in director Tim Burton who created A Nightmare before Christmas back in 1993. Over a decade later he Burton put out his second full length stop-motion animation feature film The Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>And since this is Tim Burton, the story is macabre and somehow sweet at the same time. The story takes place in Victorian times focusing on the arranged marriage of Victor, Johnny Depp in his sheepish Edward Scissorhands mode, and Victoria, voiced by Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love), yet somehow a joke was never made at this similarity. Unlike many arranged marriages, the two are smitten wit each other but this makes Victor a little too nervous as he messes up rehearsal. So he heads off to the woods to practice his vows only to unknowingly put the wedding ring on the finger of the undead who becomes, naturally, his corpse bride, as voiced by Helena Bonham Carter (Planet of the Apes, the Marky Mark version) and hilarity ensues. To all the dues that had to explain the stripper at your bachelor party, try explaining to you fiancée how you ended up married to the undead the night before your wedding.<br/><br/>The puppets themselves were brilliantly crafted and very similar to those seen in Nightmare with a lot of very tall, very skinny or very short and very obese characters. Each and every puppet that shows up on screen is so entertaining and detailed in their own way they each could have warranted their own movie. The motions of the puppets are very slick and are not at all choppy like the old Christmas specials. There are plenty of plot twists to keep you guessing who Victor end up with and even if you are like me and are able to guess the big twist early, it still doesn't take away from the story.<br/><br/>The only problem with the movie is the stop-motion animation does get a little old as the film progresses. Maybe the Christmas specials had the right time frame with a half an hour runtime. But that is totally made up for in the DVD extras as there are seven mini-documentaries that run about five to ten minutes that show the behind the scenes on how the movie got made. Those alone make the DVD alone worth watching."

However, as I was bored one day I decided to slide in the disc just to satisfy my curiosity. The result: I was swept off my feet...<br/><br/>The story and music was so moving and the film has one of the most touching endings I've ever seen in an animated film. It was sad in fact for me, as personally I saw such true love coming from a dead soul that is so rare indeed and exists mostly in fairy tales but such love was so beautifully portrayed in this movie. I give it 9/10, missing the 1 because I found it too short, but otherwise, it's a must-see.<br/><br/>As for Victor, YOU IDIOT! Emily was truly an angel, to be able to do what she did..."

This movie's problem is that it will forever be compared to ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which is now a cult classic. This will never be a cult classic for many reasons. The music by Danny Elfman and the songs were good, but they weren't great. Nightmare's music was better. The writing in this is just as good, but it just isn't very showey. The character designs weren't as flashy as Nightmare, and it seems that would be a big merchandizing problem. Also, we don't see enough into Johnny Depp's character. He doesn't sing any songs, yet he's the star. <br/><br/>However with all that aside, Tim Burton made a wonderful movie that I enjoyed, only second to Nightmare.<br/><br/>My rating: 3 1/4 out of 4 stars. 74 mins.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","1","28 June 2006"," Hilarious black comedy with stunning visuals, perfect for any Burton fan
","Watching this for the first time so soon after (re-)watching The Nightmare Before Christmas, I can definitely recognize Burton's style. The slightly slap-stick-y humor, the strong contrasts between the worlds featured, and the focus being firmly placed upon the scary, eery and creepy characters and setting. The plot is well-written(if somewhat predictable) and thoroughly interesting. It moves along very nicely, as well... the pacing is just about flawless. The acting is excellent. The characters are well-written, diverse and colorful. The humor is marvelous. I doubt more than a few minutes passed at any time during the film without me laughing. It's become somewhat more... daring, though, with at least some subtext in just a single joke or two. One can't help but love how Tim presents the world of the living as this dark, dull, and, yes, dead, place, and the land of the dead as so jazzy, vibrant... living. The music is amazing all-round, once again a great job by Danny Elfman. The dialog is well-written. The production values are incredibly high. The animation is (obviously, with more than a decade having passed and technology advancing throughout that time) prettier than that of ""Nightmare"", though you can definitely see the connection. The tone is more grown-up than that of aforementioned animation classic... that movie was about the search for something else, something different... this is about love. I hadn't expected this to be so... adult. Evoking strong emotion(with puppets, no less, and stop-motion... that takes skill), this turned out to be a far more beautiful love story than I had ever imagined. Anyone not into Gothic visuals, please try to look past this aspect of the film. A very moving, cute, funny tale of love, brought to you by the very master of the beautiful Gothic imagery with the help of some excellent actors and a talented crew. I recommend this to any fan of Tim Burton, romance stories and black comedy. 8/10"

","The last time I watched ""Corpse Bride"", I noticed something strange. I kept seeing red flashes. I also noticed that characters in the foreground have soft outlines. I remembered that 3-D movies have these traits. So, I put on my 3-D glasses and, I think the entire movie is 3-D. I know at least parts of it are. Like the chase scene after the corpse bride rises from the grave. Also, the end when she turns into butterflies. The lack of color helps a lot with the effect. I don't know if anyone else has noticed this. Try it out, it makes for a good time. I really love this film. Almost every thing Burton has made in his career is excellent."
"Denden667","10","0","1","9 May 2006"," One of Tim Burton's greatest masterpieces!
","I waited for so long that I couldn't even believe anymore that my expectations would be met by it. Thankfully, Corpse Bride didn't disappoint me. On the contrary, it's every bit as good as Burton's finest work. It has got the typical Burton-style, atmosphere and humour. How could I not enjoy it? The intro was beautiful, with the butterfly flying through the streets of a grim city, being just about the only living thing around there with some colour to it. What a beautiful art-style this movie has. I couldn't believe my eyes, it was breathtaking. Tim Burton certainly hasn't lost his touch. The first song didn't really sound that good to me(unlike other songs in the movie), but I watched it at night so I couldn't turn up the sound that high. The second time I watched it, it became clear to me how the sometimes odd lyrics(that didn't seem to fit the music at times when I first watched it), actually fit the music very well. It was just that these are kinds of songs I never heard before, so I guess I had to get used to it. The songs are constantly playing in my head now, they are truly great. The voice acting is top-notch. Johnny Depp does a fantastic job as Viktor van Dort, a nervous chap who is thrown from one unwanted situation into the next. Poor guy...Helena Bonham Carter as the Corpse Bride does a fantastic job as well, as she really gives life to the dead character. The parents are voiced by actors unknown to me, but they sound really good. Especially Viktors future mother-in-law sounded terrifying. Just like Christopher Lee as the priest, but he never fails to impress me anyway.<br/><br/>Going back to the art style, that's really something in the world of the living, but it really impresses when you are introduced to the colourful world of the Land of the Dead. With the awesome mister Bonejangles singing a really cool song. The dead are a colourful bunch of characters too, so it's actually a bit depressing if a scene goes back to the world of the living again. But this has to be said: once the Corpse Bride gets into the picture, you are completely sucked into this modern fairy tale and when it ends you will say ""Wow, I have never seen something so amazing before, I want more!"" Before I end this review, I just want to say that Danny Elfman once again proves that he hasn't lost his touch. To me anyway, as I read a lot of people whine about his latest soundtracks. I think he gets better and better every time. His score and songs for Corpse Bride were amazing and sounded just as magical as his score for Edward Scissorhands was. What is a Tim Burton movie without a Danny Elfman score, anyway?"
"jhn_morton","9","0","1","7 May 2006"," Charming and Beguiling
","Beautifully animated and voiced by talented actors like Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter the Corpse Bride is without doubt one of the most enjoyable films I've seen all year. The film like all Burtons best works hovers on the borderline between sentimental and Gothic and is much the better for it. Where Disney might have overloaded on the sentiment to the point where it would be mawkish and saccharine (perhaps with Phil Collins or Elton John yodelling away on the soundtrack) the Corpse Bride contains enough gently macabre touches and black humour to ensure that the romantic elements remain genuinely affecting. The songs work well, being entertaining while still remaining part of the story rather than having the plot stop for a big musical number and at 1 and 1/4 hours the film never outstays its welcome. All in all brilliant."

","""Corpse Bride"" is a typical dark Tim Burton movie, that does not disappoint-, with lots of crazy characters and an unusual dark Gothic atmosphere. It's a movie that amuses and entertains, despite the fact that the movie does have its obvious flaws.<br/><br/>The story itself for the movie is pretty simple but it serves it purpose. After all, it's not the story that makes this movie, it are its characters and the unusual settings of the movie. This movie is definitely a case of style over substance but what a style this movie has. Visually the movie looks really impresses and it's amazing to see how much the stop-motion effects have improved even more, since ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". What really is the best about this movie are the looks of the characters. First of all they all look crazy and weird and they are all beautifully crafted and created. <br/><br/>The movie can perhaps best be described as a mix between ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"". It has the settings and atmosphere of ""Sleepy Hollow"" and the crazy silly characters from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". Fans of those other two previous Tim Burton movie will therefor not be disappointed by this movie. In my opinion this movie is even better than those two other earlier Burton movies.<br/><br/>The characters do not only look great and weird but they also are perfectly voiced by its actors. This time Burton uses lot's of well known actors to voice the characters of the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is perfect and Albert Finney and Christopher Lee are also perfectly cast. Especially Lee is hilarious due to the seriousness he voices his character with. Other well known actors who provided their voices for this movie are Johnny Depp, Emily Watson, Michael Gough, the fantastic Deep Roy and Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>The movie has some good music, that might not be that good on its own but it suites the movie its story and atmosphere well. So good job Danny Elfman!<br/><br/>The movie entertains well and it has some great and hilarious sequences in it. The humor is quite morbid and black, after all the movie features lots of corpses and other death related elements. Leave it up to Tim Burton to create some good dark humor without ever really going over-the-top with it. The story might have some holes in it and it all is terribly simple and the ending might feel rushed and abrupt but it all in no way does make the movie any less enjoyable or entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>This movie does not disappoint and it entertains well!<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","A marriage of convenience goes bad and has the hero wind up in a very different place. Victor Van Dort is the hero, and he's a shy kind of guy, a little moody looking -- you wouldn't call him the life of the party. His parents are little more than annoying types, but they're not nearly as nasty as the Everglotts, who are the kind of people who would kill anyone's happiness with one glance. The mother, especially, barks about like a militant Mrs. Danvers, and considers her daughter Victoria little more than a sad otter. If that's tender, motherly love, I can only wonder what mild disdain might feel like.<br/><br/>Anyway, the parents, Victor, and Victoria get together to rehearse their wedding vows. Both fall for each other, but Victor gets so nervous during his rehearsal that the priest cannot but postpone the event until he is ""ready"" to marry. Victor decides to practice by himself in an open stretch of land, and places the ring on what seems to be a root or twig sticking out from the ground. No later than he ring is on the supposed twig that it begins to twitch and out of the ground comes a spectral figure -- a woman, dressed in her wedding gown, dead but alive. Eyeballing the ring on her finger she believes she has gotten married to Victor and carries him to the land of the dead who introduce Victor to her people. At the same time, the Everglotts plan on having hapless Victoria marry another suitor who has plans and motives of his own and they don't quite include the words, ""happily ever after"" but do give new meaning to ""to death us do part."" <br/><br/>CORPSE BRIDE looks and feels very Gothic and cold throughout except when scenes over the ground shift to scenes in the Underworld. For a place that is about the dead, they sure have life: there are musical numbers speckled with life, bouncing creatures that in usual circumstances would be repugnant but under the animatronics reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen come across as lovable. The Corpse Bride herself, also known to the real world as Emily, is a woman who while dead and looking blue and on the verge of decomposition harbors great emotion and even when she desires to be married, can't bring herself to have Victor, a man who has his life before him, to the ultimate sacrifice for her. But because she is a ghost, and has unresolved issues that must be fulfilled, chance has given her this door to get back at the person who trumped her in the prime of life and may strike again.<br/><br/>It's a gorgeous movie, in any case. Short, concise, but rich in character development even when the depiction of the less sympathetic ones is a little broad. Children will be its core audience, and this is less dark a movie (despite the presence of death all around) than TIM BURTON'S NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas but as always by Burton, sure entertainment."

In fact, it was exactly as I expected it to be -- which is good and bad.<br/><br/>I like Tim Burton and I like Johnny Depp, but I'm getting a little tired of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, together forever, true love always, etc. This time we have a Johnny Depp puppet. He is great, don't get me wrong, and I deeply understand the fixation, but... enough already. Note to Johnny Depp: More Finding Neverlands. More Pirates. Fewer deranged chocolate magnates. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a magnificent disaster.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride is neither a disaster nor a mess. In fact, it is lovely and charming, in exactly the way you would expect it to be -- no more and no less. The soundtrack is spot on, the visuals are haunting and exquisite, and the storyline is sweet. It did not blow me into next week like Nightmare Before Christmas did. However, this time I felt like I was in familiar territory, and when I saw ""Nightmare"" for the first time, I'd never seen anything like that before. Maybe if I'd seen this one first, I would have felt the same about it.<br/><br/>As for the love triangle between Emily Watson, Helena Boneham Carter, and Johnny Depp, I was definitely rooting for the Corpse Bride to win. The ending was tidy. The whole movie, in fact, was a little tidy. After the ""Ahhhh cool!"" moment of seeing how the real world was faded and the afterworld was saturated with color, I didn't see anything else in the movie to really charm me, apart from the usual Burton visuals.<br/><br/>I think that with the Legend of Sleep Hollow, Burton just lifted the bar so high that even he has trouble climbing over it any more. The one thing that did completely enthrall me was the fact that this is stop-motion animation. At the beginning of the film, I said to my husband, ""It almost looks like stop-motion animation, but it couldn't possibly be. They must have used computers to kind of simulate it, for nostalgia purposes."" No, it is really the genuine article. Which is stunning and beautiful. If you watch the ""making of"" featurette on the DVD, your teeth will fall out of your head with admiration for the effort that goes into this stuff. It is truly amazing."

Burton's characters are much more dimensional than those you find in most other animation films. Victor Van Glot must marry Victoria(yes, I love the Victor/Victoria thing)so his parents can become part of the old rich and her parents can remain in that club as they are broke. Victor has some issues; however, which make him run into the woods and accidentally propose to a branch that happens to have a corpse bride underneath that accepts his hand in marriage. What follows is a dark, beautiful trip to another world where the dead live after they have lived out their ""fleshy"" existences. Lots of eccentric characters abound with Burton having fun with the idea of how some died. We have a gentleman that splits in two, a ""head"" waiter which is nothing more than a head, a little Bonaparte-looking soldier, a cast of skeletons that sing and dance no less, and the corpse bride herself - a character that is so beautiful despite her outward appearance. Burton gives these characters more heart and life than any of the ""living"" characters. In fact I find it very interesting that the living are presented in cold, austere surroundings devoid of any real emotion while the dead are happy and content with what fate has befallen them, The animation process is amazing as figures are used rather than cells. Kudos to directors Burton and Mike Johnson for bringing both worlds alive. At the very heart of this film is a love story between a frightened young boy and an unhappy girl who have both come into contact with a soul full of longing and desire for something she was cheated out of in life. Johnny Depp does Victor's voice superbly and Emily Watson is Victoria. Helena Bonham Carter does an extremely good job ""breathing"" life into the vanquished bride. As with many of Burton's films, a host of older stars of generations past are given jobs. Christopher Lee, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, and Michael Gough all have prominent roles - all doing very good jobs. The music of Danny Elfman is right on the mark in this one creating another fantasy world as well through sound. Buron uses lots of humour in dialog and makes the viewer think about much of it. I thought the maggot with the Peter Lorre accent was so funny and many of his jokes were darkly humorous. The film runs a little over an hour but doesn't cheat the story in any way. Fantastical subjects, dark yet inviting, compassionate visions, lyrical music all help make this film fan the very essence of what a Burton fantasy is all about. If you know what that entails, than you will undoubtedly find the Corpse Bride very Burtonesque!"

","I give this a 10/10 because it not only displayed excellent stop motion animation but the voice talents were incredible as with the score provided by Danny Elfman (Sleepy Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) Okay, so the movie is basically what the plot summaries say it is, a timid young man accidentally is wed to a corpse bride who claims that they are to be together forever. Johnny Depp is superb in his role as Victor Van Dort and he does indeed create a voice for the character that sounds nervous and shy.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter is excellent in her role as the Corpse Bride/Emily. While I'm not that familiar with her acting, I was easily enticed to see how well she acted using only her voice. The other actors and actresses are all awesome (Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee, etc) Danny Elfman's music won me over because the variety of different tunes and kinds of instruments he had used in this including that ""keyboard thing"" he plays around with to make the real unusual sounds. Without the music, this film wouldn't be twice as good as it is now because the score flows with the events and finds appropriate timing to be a quick waltz or even a jazzy tune like Remains of the Day.<br/><br/>So see this film (if you haven't already) for the contrast of black and white color, the voice talents, the music and anything else that is superb about it.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I am a big fan of Tim Burton's movies, but this one is missing something. You can try to put your finger on what is wrong, but there is too much things. First, and the biggest is this is not stop motion animation, it is 3D. If it is, eventually, stop motion, than its stupid. Is there any reason to for using one of the hardest ways to animate? He didn't get the Oscar for it, but Walas and Gromit did, with animation that is not so perfectly done. Second, plot is trivial. Third, Tim Burton is having such fun madding it just for himself, it looks to me that he wanted to this movie before ""Nightmer"" but he didn't have computers that good, like today. So if you like animated movies, this one is for you, and if you like crappy ghoulish skeleton cliché than hurry up to see it, but don't be scared. I am big fan and I give 6,5."
"blueapplejack","8","0","1","30 March 2006"," ""Corpse Bride"" awakens art of stop-motion animation
","Tim Burton's visually stunning debut into the world of stop-motion animation (otherwise known as ""claymation"") was 1993's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", a meticulously crafted masterpiece that re-invigorated the genre.<br/><br/>Burton's latest foray in claymation, ""Corpse Bride"", is as darkly funny, and as visually appealing, as it predecessor. The plot is simple, if overly so: timid Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp), one day shy from marrying his fiancée, the equally demure Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), accidentally weds a dead woman upon practicing his vows in a forest. Placing a wedding ring on what he believes to be a twig, a horrified Victor watches as a beautiful, blue-tinged, wedding gown-clad corpse emerges from the ground. ""You may now kiss the bride!"" she proclaims with glee. Complications of a mistaken marriage ensue, with Victor's frantic attempts to return to his beloved.<br/><br/>As the voice of the film's title character, actress Helena Bonham Carter makes the most of her playful delivery and impish giggle. Johnny Depp and Emily Watson portray their characters with a hint of yearning, and as the Maggot, Scottish actor Enn Reitel jokingly pays tribute to actor Peter Lorre of ""Casablanca"" fame.<br/><br/>In addition to the Lorre reference, the film provides an abundance of homage to films of present and yesteryear. Among the spoofed are ""Gone with the Wind"", Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""and Victor/Victoria"".<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's original score is as whimsical as it is sinister, perfectly enhancing the chaos amid the characters' surroundings. The musical numbers, at times incoherent, still give the viewer a good jolt of toe-tapping energy. <br/><br/>As a feature film, ""Corpse Bride's"" 76-minute run-time should be acknowledged as an amazing feat, considering the painstaking efforts put forth by Burton and his team of animators. A 12-hour workday produced just two seconds of footage for the film, and the completed animation for ""Corpse Bride"" took nearly three years to finish. The result is a brief but altogether satisfying movie experience."

","Wow, I gotta tell you. It seems Tim Burton has truly created an animated masterpiece. I would say that this movie will become a classic for all ages. Corpse Bride is a tale of love with a little dark twist. The plot is great, the animation is amazing and Tim Burton has a truly powerful arsenal of actors young and old including Johnny Depp,Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee, and Michael Gough to name a few, most of which he's worked with several times before.<br/><br/>The story follows a Victor Van Dort a timid pianist, who is betrothed to Victoria Everglot. But while practicing his vows he accidentally marries Emily the Corpse Bride. Now Victor must chose between his two brides.<br/><br/>The movie has great music which I think is Danny Elfman's best piece with orchestral music. The lyrical music was good, but not quite as memorable as The Nightmare Before Christmas. And the ending of this movie is incredibly emotional and definitely the perfect way to end this spectacular movie.<br/><br/>If you enjoy movies that are whimsical yet dark or a Tim Burton fan, this is a movie for you"

","Tim Burton's work will probably never be described as banal or ordinary; rather, he is merely the poster child of inventive, creative cinematic storytelling. Corpse Bride is told using stop-action animation, but using more-advanced methods than those in Burton's legendary The Nightmare before Christmas.<br/><br/>Victor (Johnny Depp) is a shy, clumsy groom to be who has trouble saying his vows during the wedding rehearsal. After flubbing his lines once too many times, he dashes into the Victorian night and practices them while walking along an icy, moonlit path. After Victor places the wedding ring on a nearby branch and recites his vows, a figure rises from the frozen ground - a corpse bride! The Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) thinks she's found her true love in Victor, and she spirits him to the Land of the Dead, populated by myriad dancing and talking skeletons. But Victor doesn't love The Bride and pines for his own lost bride, Victoria (Emily Watson). Complicating matters further is that their marriage was to be one of convenience, as Victoria's family needs the money that Victor's family might bring.<br/><br/>The movie has many eye-popping (ha!) visuals, including the Bride's own eyeball, which seems to pop out every so often, and the sheathing and unsheathing of a long sword buried in the back of a skeleton made to resemble Napoleon Bonaparte (known as Bonesaparte in the credits). Wonderful musical numbers abound as well, featuring the beautiful voice of Danny Elfman - especially a complex jazz/scat number.<br/><br/>It's really tough to find fault with any of the voices, which feature a number of former Burton collaborators, such as Depp, Elfman, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, and even Deep Roy, who played the Oompa Loompahs in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>Although this film was up for a Best Animated Feature Oscar, don't think for a moment that your three-year-old is going to like it, musical numbers or not. The tone isn't as dark as Nightmare before Christmas, but the settings sure are. I mean, the movie takes place mostly at night, either in a dark forest, inside a dark, stark mansion, or the Land of the Dead. Not exactly the place you might find pastels and a lava lamp.<br/><br/>Watching Corpse Bride, it's easy to forget it's not animated in the traditional way, or even the nouveau-artiste, computer way. Fourteen puppets of the Bride and of Victor were used in the making of this movie, and some 109,000 individual frames were filmed. The attention to detail is preposterously exquisite and should leave the average viewer properly dumbfounded."

","This film is excellent. That much I say without thinking on the matter twice. The film is well animated as well as being well written and well orchestrated in the sense that the music is so crisp and perfect for the film's setting. The film's setting takes place in Edwardian Europe (possibly England) where a young man named Victor Van Dort is to be married to a young woman by the name of Victoria Everglot. The two do not know each other and are sent to a wedding rehearsal where Victor, afraid of the marriage (and the Pastor's cane on his head), messes up his lines and goes out to say them properly, but mistakenly places the ring on a branch in the ground which he thought was a branch. It turns out that the branch is actually the Corpse Bride, who thinks that Victor has married her. It seems he is in an impasse and doesn't quite understand what to do...

","Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is the son of wealthy fishmongers and he's had an arranged marriage set up for him. His wife to be, Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) is the daughter of Victorian-style royalty who are having financial difficulties. Marrying Victoria off is seen solely as a ""plan (score music here)"" to pull her parents out of their money-rut.<br/><br/>All seems to be going well until Victor fouls up his vows during the wedding rehearsal and runs off into the nearby forest. He continues to practice the vows as he stumbles through the trees, finally getting the words right and then ceremoniously placing the ring on a nearby twig ...at least that's what he thought it was. The twig turns out to be the dead finger of the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter). She and Victor are now husband and wife, and she emerges from the grave to tell him so. Running away from her and plowing into a tree, Victor falls unconscious, only to awaken in the underworld of the dead.<br/><br/>Confusion reigns as Victor tries to tell the Corpse Bride that they cannot be married ...because he is still alive and she is dead. Well, there certainly is an easy way to fix that. But what of his living bride-to-be, Victoria? How will she take the news? The Corpse Bride has a lot going for it, but also a few issues. The positives far outweigh the negatives, however. Most enjoyable (from my perspective) were the miniatures and the way the ""claymation"" flowed. The clay characters were smooth and outlandishly featured; Victoria's mother (Joanna Lumley) has hair that looks like two large breasts pinned high above her head, the Corpse Bride is disturbingly sexy, and the pastor (a perfect Christopher Lee) appears as an evil Vicar.<br/><br/>Similar to WALLACE AND GROMIT IN THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT, the claymation is smooth and even. Although Wallace and Gromit has a more children's feel to it, Corpse Bride makes no such claim. Necrophilia, frightening death sequences, bodily decay, and several other possibly unappetizing ideas pop-up during the film. But they are usually infused with sprinklings of comedy, which made these items less morbid.<br/><br/>The biggest ""hole"" in the movie was its script. Clocking in at just 75 minutes, there's very little time to get acquainted with the characters and even less time spent on making sense of the movie's ending (I'll only comment that when the Corpse Bride said, ""You have set me free."" I said, ""Huh?"").<br/><br/>But the claymation, beautifully crafted caricatures, and mini-sets can't be denied. Nor can most of the musical numbers that added a certain garish quality to it (although some of the songs seemed forced to me, while several others were spot-on).<br/><br/>I wouldn't let a child under 12 years old watch it, though. Adults will laugh at the humor thrown down at death's door, but the youngsters might not get it."

I liked the Nightmare before Christmas a lot more...I believe I was expecting too much out of this movie. The most interesting thing about this movie, though, is how it looks.

This would have worked beautifully as a short film.<br/><br/>The plot moves along fairly predictable turns. I never was once surprised or intrigued with what was happening in the story. It's pretty standard fair. The songs by the usually flawless Danny Elfman are unmemorable and somewhat annoying. They seem shoehorned into the movie as filler to stretch the length. This really did not need to be a musical. I didn't like the villain much either, and not in the way you're supposed to dislike a villain either, I just thought he was tedious and once again, annoying. Most of the jokes were juvenille and just plain not funny.<br/><br/>There is some wonderful animation in this film though.

This film (as demonstrated by the music in the trailers seen on television) was banking completely on the success of it's predecessor ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", instead of on it's own merit. All the elements were there to make a truly great film, but somehow it got mangled.

","Visually stunning and suffused with Tim Burton's trademarked comedy-Gothic feel, this is not a bad movie  but had the unrealised potential to be so much better.<br/><br/>It doesn't favour favourably in comparison with Burton's other necromantic animation, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. Both films feature the musical talents of the director's regular composer, Danny Elfman. In 'Nightmare' Elfman voiced the hero, Jack Skellington, and the movie benefited greatly from his superb light-operatic vocalisations. He produced a superb score for that film. The music in 'Corpse Bride' isn't bad, but it's performed, for the most part, by actors  Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Albert Finney and Joanna Lumley  who clearly don't have a musical bone in their bodies. Elfman is featured, as a scat-singing 'Mr Bonejangles', and his 'Skeleton Crew' sequence is the most energetic and tuneful portion of the picture.<br/><br/>Depp's English accent is faultless, and he  along with the rest of the cast  resist the temptation to engage in 'cartoon acting'. There are few 'silly voices' and the animated figures are subtly matched with their dramatic vocalisations. Paul Whitehouse's elastic larynx is used to good effect, as he voices half-a-dozen supporting characters.<br/><br/>It looks moody and lush, and probably deserves a second viewing just to relish the expressive subtleties of design and characterisation. It's good. It's also much better than Burton and Depp's other offering this year, the overrated and saccharine-sweetened contrivance that was 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. I liked it. It just deserves to be a much better film than it actually is."
"sweetleaf1189","Null","0","1","14 December 2005"," Doesn't compare to Nightmare
","For me, comparing director/producer Tim Burton's blockbuster, The Corpse Bride, to his 1993 movie, Nightmare Before Christmas, does nothing but highlight its mistakes. The style and animation is basically the same, making some technological advances toward the process. Even the music score is very similar, again having well written lyrics and entertaining beats. The two movies both have the same whimsical feel, and The Corpse Bride definitely owns up to Nightmare's charms. The characters are also once again incredibly creative and full of personality. The music is one big contributor to why the movie doesn't satisfy the craving for a sequel to Nightmare Before Christmas. The songs aren't nearly as memorable as Nightmare's ""What's This?"" and ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws."" The characters are full of dimension and life. Each one is nicely developed, has a unique personality, and is brought to life amazingly by the voice cast. However, the movie does not have a strong plot line. Instead, it relies on the brilliant animation that immediately captures your attention...yet eventually wears out. One of the main characters, Barkis Bittern, plays the villain in Corpse Bride. He schemes and plots against Victor Van Dort, who has an arranged engagement to marry Victoria Everglott, whom he also has sinister plans for. But the script never really makes clear the details of his attacks, or even the reasons behind them. Corpse Bride is more of a romantic story, than a comedy, although there are the occasional humorous parts. It, however, lacks the sense of dread that you expect from a Tim Burton movie. It is lighter than most of his movies, and not nearly as bizarre as his other movies like Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare. But the end is well drawn out and not overly dramatic. The Corpse Bride doesn't nearly live up to Nightmare, which people expected because of the similar looks and moods of the previews. It is not nearly as bizarre as any of his other movies, which is one of the qualities that Burton fans adore. Another factor that made the movie a little more pushed was that it was a mere seventy-five minutes. That just means that there was no time for extra materials or details. In all, I would say that The Corpse Bride is a little bit of a disappointment after seeing any of Tim Burton's other movies, yet Burton comes through, and the movie is still entertaining with all of the imagination and creativity put forward. I really did enjoy it, but like I said, compared to Nightmare, it doesn't quite do it for me."

I really like the fact he is still working with Michael Gough (the beloved Alfred he worked with in the original Batman and its sequel), the animation was just as good as in the aforementioned The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Danny Elfman's music was again much appreciated (since Tim Burton and Danny Elfman are one of the ultimate film-making dynamic duos).

After some disappointment concerning the Danny Elfman score in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (should I list this one as a third favorite?), I am glad to say that this time he delivers a soundtrack that can easily compete with his Nightmare tunes.

","Only Tim Burton can make the world of the dead seem like a fun place to be! Which is why I think the movie is titled ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"", rather than just ""Corpse Bride"", which might be mistaken for a schlocky gory flick.<br/><br/>The Corpse Bride is about the misadventures of the shy son of a wealthy fishmonger, Victor, as he is accidentally married to a corpse bride. The corpse bride, although dead and blue, is not cold, unlike some of the living (who have grey skins). Rather, she is passionate but bears a heavy heart.<br/><br/>The movie also features dancing skeletons, and a worm who tries to pass off as the Corpse Bride's conscience.<br/><br/>The combined efforts of Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and the other talented voice actors make this a highly enjoyable movie. Also being filmed in stop motion greatly benefits the film as it gives it more depth and texture than one that relies heavily on CGI. The narrative is also good, and the characters are livelier and more believable than some movies with real actors."
"lazenbaby","8","0","1","21 November 2005"," carefully crafted Tim Burton storytelling - but its been done before
","Tim Burton's the Corpse Bride is the latest in a revival of stop motion animation. Beautifully crafted figurines are matched perfectly with the voice actors. Stand out performances include Joanna Lumley (Mrs. Everglott), Tracey Ullman (Mrs. Van Dort and others), Albert Finney (Mr. Everglott and others) and Johnny Depp (Victor Van Dort).<br/><br/>The story itself is very creative and the locations and scenes are classic Tim Burton. My problems with the movie were very few and were more then overshadowed by the beauty of the simple story and the richness of the characters, but the movie was not without its flaws.<br/><br/>Chief of all was the very cheesy songs that were in the movie. I have no idea why they were included but they just served to rip me out of my illusion and remind me, I was in a cinema. They weren't even catchy! The second, was the feeling I'd seen all of this before, which i had a few years ago when Tim Burton releases his other much loved stop motion feature, The Nightmare Before Christmas. Same goulish black humour, same lovingly crafted settings, same elegant and slender characters and those same annoying songs were in that movie also.<br/><br/>However, be that as it may, I still enjoyed that movie, and if you take the kids to see this one then chances are they were too young for TNBC. There are some rather frightening scenes in this one that may scare little kids (like when we first meet Emily-the Corpse Bride) but nothing so sinister as to keep them awake at night.<br/><br/>Definitely one for everyone this Christmas and expect to see the merchandise under trees very soon."

","I personally loved ""Corpse Bride"", it had a very ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" appeal. Not only did it include great songs like ""Nightmare"", the voice talents are amazing. I got to hand it to Johnny Depp, he's a great actor and he definitely shows it in all his movies, well....the ones i've seen. I loved Helena in ""The Craft"" I thought she was very....freaky looking. She was excellent in this movie, brilliant work for the both of them. Also, I love Tim Burton movies, and this one has got to be his best, yes that includes the whole ""Batman"" series. When I went to see it in theater's, I didn't really quite know what to expect, but let me tell you, it's a great movie, filled with great songs, excellent voice work, and a terrific story. I love the story because it's unusual, never in the history of movies has a man been married to a female corpse before or vice-versa. Also I loved Michael Gough's character in the movie, who played Alfred in the ""Batman"" series. It was really nice seeing him, hearing him, in a movie again. I'm giving ""Corpse Bride"" a 9, because it's a great movie for the whole family to enjoy, it would've gotten a 10, but it wasn't the best movie that i've seen, but definitely up there with the best of them. Therefore, I suggest you see ""Corpse Bride"" because it's a wedding that you/I won't forget."

I have to say that it's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It really is a masterpiece. Of course, I'm not even trying to compare it with NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas, they are different. Anyway, I liked it very very very much. I like almost all of Berton's works, but cartoons - most of all. He should make them more often! So, everybody should watch it - children and grownups. It's not scary at all - well, I didn't notice anything scary there - it's amazing. Everything is interesting - the idea (something about Russian and Jewish folk tales) and the kind of animation. It's the greatest thing - animation with dolls, not with computer characters. It's that kind of art that you can touch and feel. So, altogether these components make a very lovely picture. I'm sure all the fans of Tim Berton's works should like it."

","My apologizes to Tim Burton fans but this movie is a pale successor to Nightmare Before Christmas (one of my all time favorites). The music and lyrics aren't even close to the beautiful tunes and rhymes of Nightmare and the plot is thin. What I found most disappointing was the absence of interesting side characters. Nightmare was chock full of hilarious characters from the Mayor to Dr. Finkelstein to the wonderfully varied children. After leaving the theatre I was hard pressed to come up with a single memorable side character from Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>I'd probably have a better opinion of this flick if I did not have Nightmare to compare it to. I'm reminded of the many times a new band has released a master piece 1st album and struggled to follow it with a comparable second. It could be that Nightmare set the bar so high as to jade my opinion of Burton's further adventures in stop motion musicals. I do however, hope he continues to try."

","I found Tim Burton's _Corpse Bride_ more accessible than _The Nightmare Before Christmas_. This film is beautifully rendered, wonderfully voice-acted, and full of eye-catching visuals that will keep both adults and children entranced for the entire movie. Johnny Depp is perfectly unassuming as the ill-fated groom of two brides. Helena Bonham Carter gives the title character a wonderful sense of wonder. And Emily Watson is delightful as the original bride who must come to terms with what is happening around her. Burton has also gathered an amazing group of veteran British actors to bring the supporting characters to life. Danny Elfman's music fits the proceedings like a glove. The skeleton song brings to mind his old Oingo Boingo days, and the underscoring music soars and floats as needed."

Now this, this took a regular plot (boy torn between two women) and made it something else entirely, something so unique, that I can honestly say that i loved it. The animation, blew my mind! It must have been 70 frames per min. The way that they designed all the character was so breath taking amazing that I think I can say i liked Victor's look better than Jack's from TNBC.

","Tim Burton's 'Nightmare Before Christmas' was first class film-making, it was Burton after all. Corpse Bride, could it have been better? True, it's not for children, but how many Tim Burton films are? With a soundtrack by Danny Elfman, you can't go wrong, with a director like Burton, you're guaranteed a hit and Johnny Depp in the lead, which of their films has ever failed, need I say more? This year, it seems neither Burton nor Depp can do no wrong. The fact that the top cast of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Emily Watson, Joanna Lumley, Richard E Grant, Christopher Lee, Albert Finney and others are no more than voices, does not disguise their incredible acting or the natural appeal they bring to their characters. Johnny Depp for example, can you tell it's him? I advise everyone to go and see it, True it's not to everyone's taste, but even people who don't usually like this sort of thing, should find it a thrill. Burton and Depp you can't lose. If Mr Depp doesn't get an Oscar this time round, nothing is sacred!"

","Alright I admit it; I'm a Tim Burton whore. I'm also a whore for Johnny depp in that masculine hug way..*ahem* but this in no way reflects my opinion of this movie; it stands alone as a work of art, and should in no way be compared to a nightmare before Christmas or indeed any other work Tim has been responsible for before hand; this EVEN makes me forgive him for planet of the apes...THAT'S how good this movie is. The musical composition that Danny elfman has provided for the movie (the second collaboration with Burton this year) is fantastic; melodic, whimsical, melancholy comical and soulful, displaying the diversity of Elfman in all his glory, and just how well he understands Burtons direction and thinking at the time; I have to say, most of all I like the fact that save a few, most of the compositions use the piano and nothing else; it adds to the storyline and has a subtle hint of Russian undertones (of which the movie is based from a short folk tale of the same title).<br/><br/>The movie itself speaks very valid points of view in this day and age; in a subtle way it leads you to the moral that marriage should only be entered into when two people are in love, and never lightly; Johnny depp is perfect is victor, as is Helena Bonham carter in the role of Emily, the corpse bride. Very touching, Very enjoyable and I would be very surprised if this weren't remembered as one of those animation classics in years to come that you sit kids down to watch.<br/><br/>People, this movie is short but ten thousand universes above anything you've seen before; the animation methods are groundbreaking, and blows the combination that presents itself in the form of a yorkshireman and his dog far, far away."

Only problem is that, in doing so, he manages to marry a dead woman; the Corpse Bride.

The stop-motion figures look fantastic, the bride in particular. The songs I wasn't overly impressed with, but they did the job. What I did love was the Victorian attitude of Mrs (Lady?) Everglot, with her constant disapproval of her daughter and her impropriety.

","I have been looking forward to seeing this film for some time, what with all the teasers, etc, and I'm a great fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. But this film fails to deliver anything near as entertaining or witty as NBC. The music is almost instantly forgettable and I'd be more willing to believe that Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the songs rather than Danny Elfman (and that is not a compliment). Frequently, the words were difficult to make out and what I could hear sounded like lazy lyrics. And this was in a high quality cinema, not off a pirate DVD.<br/><br/>I went with my wife, my 8-year old son and a friend of his. The two boys were very good, although I was worried about them getting restless because of the pace of the plot, which I felt was very slow. My wife and I agreed that it had very little substance. And nowhere near as much humour as NBC.<br/><br/>The animation was as beautiful as ever, especially the Corpse Bride herself, but I found the almost monochromatic style in the living world irritating after a while. It was too dark or flat.<br/><br/>With such a fantastic line-up of actors it was a shame that their talents were not used to the best. The characters were too clichéd in my opinion.<br/><br/>I suppose in a way you are kept in suspense about what's going to happen in the end, but not that much.

"Thespin","6","0","3","22 October 2005"," Highly average
","Animated Death never looked so good, but felt so dull. After over a decade of waiting for something as glorious and fun as The Nightmare Before Christmas I walked out of the theater last night feeling like a kid at Christmas who got a new bike with no tires. I'm left thinking either my expectations could have been too high or this movie just fell short of its intended mark.<br/><br/>The movie and the animation are gorgeous, though it looks far too much like Nightmare to avoid comparisons and invoke expectations. The story is fairly basic and gets going pretty fast. Victor (Depp) is set to marry Victoria (Watson) in an arranged marriage. Victor is a nervous wreck about it and is a very jittery fellow. He doesn't have cold feet so much as nervous hands. Victoria is a flower in a family of poisonous weeds. She knows her duty and after meeting Victor seems very much taken with him. Its Victors nervous hands that set things in motion; while practicing his vows he mistaken places the ring on the finger of a murdered bride. From there the movie heads off into regular Tim Burton territory with fun creepy characters and imagery as Victor is pulled into the after life. Much like the world of Beetlejuice the dead walk, talk, sing, dance and are examples of how they died.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie Victor is trying to get out of this world and back to his living girlfriend above ground. Meanwhile Victoria's parents find another suitor to replace the clumsy Victor. Once Victor learns of her new brothel he surrenders to something that's been right in front of him; He's got a wife and despite her being dead is really quite charming. He promises his love and consents to a ceremony to finalize their vows (and his beating heart). This is where the movie really shines. The dead return to the land of the living for this wedding of the afterlife. As the dead run amok and revisit old loved ones we get the only glimpse into the charm and fun Nightmare had.<br/><br/>While the movie is actually pretty good and it is entertaining I think aside from letting expectations get in the way this movie suffers from two glaring faults; The songs and the lack of charm. The songs are like dead finger nails on a chalkboard none of them are as witty are fun as they should be to lighten such a dark movie. The lack of charm is something you wouldn't expect in a movie with Johnny Depp and Emily Watson, to say nothing of the rest of this great cast.<br/><br/>I wanted this movie to succeed in so many ways, I love stop animation, I enjoy it even more when it's not all cutesy and has a plot. I want to see more studios pulling away from CGI animated movies and investing in such craft-work as films like Nightmare showed it could be again."
"WheelerClown","8","0","1","21 October 2005"," Not The Nightmare before Christmas, but not bad either
","This show is not up to the standard of Tim Burton's Nightmare before Christmas in terms of storyline, songs, or visual effects. That notwithstanding, it is a very entertaining movie with several very funny lines and situations. The voice talent is wonderful, the character development (especially the Corpse Bride herself) is excellent. <br/><br/>If I have any complaints at all it would be animation and an unsatisfying ending. Victor has a pallor throughout that makes him appear as dead as the corpse bride. The overweight characters in the film look quite good but the skinny ones (Victor and the Pastor come to mind) look like stick figures. And unlike Nightmare, the characters walk in an obvious marionette on strings manner. As for the end, it is too unsatisfying. What the dead do to the villain after he dies is totally off-screen. And it would have been a much better story if it had ended in a happily ever after ""live"" wedding. And what finally happens to the corpse bride makes no sense at all given the concept of the world of the dead already created in the film.<br/><br/>These shortcomings notwithstanding, I recommend that anyone who enjoys a Tim Burton film should definitely see this one. Not an excellent film, but a very good one."

","It is lovely to be back in the ""animated"" world of Tim Burton again. His vision are so much more vibrant, unique and Burtonesque. I love all his feature film as well, but this is just something only he could envision and create. The backdrop of the story is set in the Victorian age (hence both the character names) and the story focuses on the quite inept Victor that is to be married to Victoria. It's a fixed marriage and the aristocratic families think that this will make them take the climb into the hierarchy of high society. Neither Victor of Victoria are ready to be married but when they meet their feelings are redeemed. As mentioned Victor is quite a clumsy guy and messes up everything that is possible to mess up during the wedding rehearsals so he is sent away to rehearse his vows until he knows them. He goes into the woods and recites them over and over. Problem is that when he places the ring on a branch (that turns out to be the hand of the dead Emily) he is married to her and brought to the land of the dead. So starts the predicament. The film uses black and white to show the cold shallow real world, and colors to envision the very lively and honest land of the dead. This works well and it's a beautiful movie in all regards. A great story and flawless presentation of it with all the moods one would suspect from a Tim Burton title. A tad short but that OK with such a great viewing pleasure. NOT to be missed."

","Victor messed up his vows during a wedding rehearsal, and is traveling through the woods, reciting his vows. He stops to rest in the woods,and while practicing, he gets them right and puts his wedding ring on a finger-shaped stick in the ground and says his wedding vows. The stick turns out to be a rotted finger belonging to a murdered girl, who returns as a zombie and insists that she is now Victor's lawfully wedded wife.<br/><br/>When seeing this film, one will make the connection to The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is unfair in the sense that they are two totally different films, only similar in the animation. Leave it to Tim Burton to take us inside his ""cooky-artist"" head to bring us the beautiful Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>Technically, Corpse Bride is ahead of the race in every sense of the word. Lightyears ahead of NBC in terms of style, with quirky characters bug eyes and legs as thin as toothpicks. Stop-motion animation is a form that should be more explored in film. Corpse Bride unfortunately relies too heavily on it's animation and strays away from it's story.<br/><br/>It seems the motivation of the main character, to fall in love with this corpse is a little hard to follow. At first, he's terrified of her, then wants to run and hide from her, then falls in love with her and will die for her...but loves someone else in the end. Corpse Bride takes all these emotions throws them into a blender and hits the ultra mix button. This leaves the viewer with an awkward feeling at the end towards our so called hero.<br/><br/>Okay, so it is a kids movie, so harping on the emotional value could be unfair. But Depp as the lead offers nothing to the movie, which his character always looking shocked, we get Depp voicing it all whimpy. It's good to see the other cast members giving their voices more range, I mean when you hear Christopher Lee's voice as the towns Pastor it's so deep and recognizable that anyone can notice. Helena Bonham Carter does the best with her incredible singing talent and voiced with a lot of depth and emotion.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score, along with everyother Burton movie, takes the film to another level. With surprise musical numbers, which aren't too apparent in films these days. It takes you back to those old Disney films.<br/><br/>Seeing the underworld, so vibrant and alive, and seeing the living world, so dreadful and dead, it makes you wonder who's really who in this world. Seeing the two at opposite ends is a feast for the eyes, which is what many people will see this movie for. If you're looking for great animation and musical numbers, then Corpse Bride is the film for you, other-wise the story is kinda of dead."
"FMACDONALD","8","0","1","11 October 2005"," Another Animated Classic From Tim Burton
","Tim Burton is a genius at animation. While all major studio's such as Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks thrive on computer generated animation Tim Burton goes back to a style that Hollywood has forgotten about. Stop Motion. Stop motion animation is great. I grew up as a child watching ninety percent of Christmas specials being filmed in stop motion. The first stop motion film I ever saw on the big screen was Tim Burton's The Nightmare before Christmas. I remember being blown away by it. Years later Tim Burton (The director responsible for Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow, Planet Of The Apes, Big Fish, and this summers hit Charlie and the Chocolate Factory remake) decides to make another animated film and Burton fans rejoiced. Corpse Bride is very similar to Nightmare with the animation as well as the songs. Yes it is a musical, although Burton doesn't go overboard the way Disney used to in making eighty percent of the film all song and dance. Corpse Bride has about five songs in it that are all about the afterlife. The plot is interesting. Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp, making this 5 Burton films he's been in now) is arranged to marry Victoria Everglot (voiced by Emily Watson). The two fall in love after they meet at their dinner rehearsal. The Van Dort's are rich beyond people's wildest imagination. The Everglot's however are broke and are arranging their daughter Victoria to marry Victor so her parents Maudeline Everglot (Joanna Lumley) and Finnis Everglot (Albert Finney) can get their hands on The Van Dort fortune. Victor is a bumbling idiot who is so nervous at their wedding rehearsal that he can't get his vows right. This angers the minister (voiced by the legend Christopher Lee)and he calls off their rehearsal. Victor so upset, goes for a stroll in the woods and places his wedding ring for his bride on a tree limb as he practices his vows. The problem was it was no tree branch but a finger of a rotted corpse that was sticking out of the ground. Enter Emily (voiced by Helena Bonham-Carter, Burton's real life bride to be)who falls in love with Victor at first sight. Now that Emily has the ring on her finger she is considered to be the wife of Victor. There is only one problem. Victor is alive and well, while Emily is dead. Victor is dragged to the underworld where people are having the time of their lives, always having one hell of a party in the taverns, while in the world of the living things are dreary and depressing. Victor longs to get back to his bride to be, Victoria however Emily will stop at nothing to stay married. Corpse Bride is a fun movie that is typical Tim Burton. The man knows eye candy like no other director. He has the best looking sets in all of Hollywood right now. If you don't believe me just watch Beetlejuice, Sleepy Hollow, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, or his first animated classic The Nightmare Before Christmas. Corpse Bride ranks up there with those films. As I said before the world of the living in the film is dark and depressing. It's literally shown in shades of gray, while the world of the dead is all happy go lucky. Everything is all bright and it's one big party. That's Tim Burton for you. Burton has created another Halloween classic, like Nightmare that will surely develop a cult following just like Nightmare. After ten years that film is considered an animated classic and most likely will continue it's reign. Corpse Bride will definitely follow in it's footsteps. Granted I am biased about Burton. I've loved all his films including his Planet Of The Apes remake (yes I'm the one). Corpse Bride is a great film that is fun from beginning to end. If you're in the mood for a good Halloween themed film then I highly recommend it. If not, then their is plenty of great slasher flicks out there for you to watch again and again till you fall asleep. On a scale of 10 I give Tim Burton's Corpse Bride an 8. Again a great time at the movies."

Once I realized this everything started to unravel.

"SammyK","7","0","1","7 October 2005"," Exquisitely crafted. But don't look for substance.
","I'm continually disappointed with Tim Burton. In my opinion, his best work is behind him. After a promising slew of films in the late '80s and early '90s, from Pee Wee's Big Adventure to Edward Scissorhands (and, to a lesser extent, The Nightmare Before Christmas - which he didn't direct), it's all been downhill from there. Granted, ""Ed Wood"" was an interesting, if slow-moving pet project which boasted knockout performances from Johnny Depp and Martin Landau. But fast-forward to 2005. It's been a busy year for Burton, with two films released within a period of less than 4 months. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was a visually impressive (that becomes a given with all of Burton's films), but ultimately unsatisfying experience. With the promise of a stop-motion follow up to The Nightmare Before Christmas, the disappointment of ""Charlie"" could be overlooked. However, ""Corpse Bride"" is another brilliant exercise in style, that falls short in the substance category. The story is far from engaging, the pace is slow, and Danny Elfman's musical infusions fall flat. As an aside, Danny Elfman has paralleled Burton in his downward spiral - when was the last great Danny Elfman score you heard? For me, it would inevitably be the memorable score and songs from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" And that is where ""Corpse Bride"" disappoints the most. It pales in comparison to the former. The characterizations are dull, the plot is nonexistent, and the music is derivative (again on Danny Elfman's case -he's recycled an Oompa Loompa tune here, as if we wouldn't notice!). That isn't to say that the film isn't watchable, or well-crafted (the animation is painstakingly realized through the analog magic of stop-motion). But from Burton, we've come to expect more. Mr. Burton - it's time to turn off the auto pilot, and deliver something you promised us over a decade ago."

","This film definitely has Tim Burton's visual style behind it and the animation work is some of the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's all that stands out. The plot is thin and has no real depth. The songs prolong the movie but don't really add or explain anything and aren't particularly interesting musically. The movie would have honestly been better off without them.<br/><br/>The voices were well done in for all of the characters and the singing was done well. I thought that Johnny Depp did particularly well as I never heard his voice stand out throughout the entire movie. He was playing his part and the character felt like a new character and not just another version of Depp.<br/><br/>Despite the good voice acting, I didn't care especially about any of the characters either way. The protagonist(s) have very little real motivation or dilemmas and the antagonist(s) are laughable. The characters are shallow and I don't feel like they or the world they live in exists for anything more than this movie.<br/><br/>If this movie had been presented as a 30 minute short about, say, an old fable, then it would have been much better. As it is, it's not really worth seeing in the theater or even seeing more than once unless you really love claymation. Well, not even then. Just buy a Wallace and Gromit DVD or The Nightmare Before Christmas. You'll be much happier."
"faggish","6","0","5","2 October 2005"," A Visually Stunning Disappointment
","I was looking forward to Corpse Bride for the longest time. Since I am a huge Nightmare Before Christmas fan, I was expecting Bride to be another Burton classic. Unfortunately, it was anything but.<br/><br/>Corpse Bride ranks with Planet of the Apes, in my own opinion. There was no emotional value, and the entire film felt empty and underwhelming.<br/><br/>The music by Danny Elfman was always less than wonderful. Especially the lyrics during the musical numbers, were hard to understand, and just went on and on without any catchy beats or haunting melodies.<br/><br/>Character development was also lacking throughout. We only get the basics for each of the characters, and everything else we have to figure out for ourselves. It is almost as if Burton and Elfman thought they could just explain everything with one song, and then just move on.<br/><br/>Visually, though, is where I give it credit. However, that is no surprise coming from Burton. The living world is Gothic and colorless, with a cold and lifeless tone. In fact, a lot of it reminded me of Sleepy Hollow. The dead world is filled with color and life, happy characters who get along with each other, and where much of the dark humor sits in. The character design was also quite unique. All of them always caused me to laugh once or twice.<br/><br/>If this had come from any other director, I would probably give it a higher rating. But Burton always mixes sentimentality and heart with his sometimes dark vision. This time he left out the heart, and only cared about the vision. That is why I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I would watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over this, any day.<br/><br/>6/10"
"draiochtfilms","7","0","3","1 October 2005"," Beautiful but Predictable
","While the design was spectacular, the script was altogether predictable. There are many elements of Tim Burton's former films here, from Vincent to Frankenweenie to Nightmare. It's a bit of a conglomeration of them all. Even some of the characters seem to be reincarnations of others we've seen before. All of that would have been forgiven if the script and characters weren't so stereotypical, like Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, etc. Caroline Thompson's script is simply thin and transparent. The only thing that kept me guessing was how Vincent (Johnny Depp) would ""get the girl"" in the end. Danny Elfman delivers a great score and good songs, but it isn't enough to lift this film to just above average. It was entertaining, but again, predictable."
"metromm","6","0","4","30 September 2005"," It would have been so easy to be better
","Tim Burton has been quoted as saying that the budget of ""Corpse Bride"" was about ""two-thirds less than any computer film,"" which can cost in excess of $100 million, but that ""story, not cost, should determine how a film is be made."" Bunk. Burton's puppets never came to life for me - not even the ""live"" ones. The look and feel of this movie is one of a cheap, creepy comic book rediscovered in a damp basement. The color palate was dismally and needlessly dull. Put it alongside Triplets of Belleville and it pales by comparison - literally. Infusion of some sepia tones for the ""upstairs"" characters might have provided the exciting transition we loved in the Wizard of Oz's fade from black (and white). The soundtrack was forgettable, save for an all-too- brief piano duet. The story suffered as so many characters were introduced and very few were allowed to develop. And I felt cheated knowing that Johnny Depp was a star of this film but was being held prisoner by a 2-dimensional stop-action puppet. The best part of this film was a corpse dog and as cute as he was, I'm not sure he covered the price of admission."
"mangalord","8","0","1","24 September 2005"," A great movie with not as great songs
","Tim Burton has always created imaginative movies, many starring Johnny Depp, and this certainly is one of them. The story takes place in Victorian era England, where Victor VanDort(Johnny Depp) is forced to marry Victoria Everglot. Victor however is a clumsy young man, so he has to go out to the forest and practice his vows, where he uses a ""stick"" for Victorias finger. But truth behold, ti's was the finger of the CORPSE BRIDE!! <br/><br/>As a character says in the movie, its a tale of romance, passion, and a murder most foul! And all of this is shown through the most amazing stop motion techniques yet seen to tread the silver screen. Having these amazing armatures covered with the beautiful silicon skin give the puppets realistic shadows. The main characters have very skinny bodies, showing how fragile they are, but many have just the most outrageous designs you could think of!<br/><br/>But now comes the part that I was most disappointed about... The songs! The music itself was amazing as usual, coming from Danny Elfman, but his songs were not as topnotch. They were few and far apart, and only one was really good. The rest was mostly approximate rhyming and in a hard to understand beat, which is a pity too, since because of that I missed a lot of story in the beginning.<br/><br/>But this is a great movie none the less. Great animation, music, cast, and overall, a great story. You will simply leave the cinema with an urge to see it again!"
"rust300341","9","0","2","23 September 2005"," best movie of the year so far
","I had much anticipation and excitement going in to see this movie given that Tim Burton was the director but also that it reminded me a lot of Nightmare Before Christmas (one of the best movies ever made). And as usual Tim Burton lived up to our expectations and put out a fantastic movie. One that i'm sure most of you will go out and see more than once. If you think this years movie selection has stunk, wait till you see this movie and it will definitely change your mind. If your a Nightmare Before Christmas whore, like myself you will love this movie. I do wish the movie could have been slightly longer, i believe the movie was only around 80 min or so but with all the time and effort it took into making the movie they did a hell of a job. The movie is pure Tim Burton style with great music by non other than Danny Elfman. After seeing this movie you will definitely not walk out the theater wanting your money back."
