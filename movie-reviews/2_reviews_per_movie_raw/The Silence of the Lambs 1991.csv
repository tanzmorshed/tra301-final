","The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.
It's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10"

","Sweeping all five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.<br/><br/>`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre.  It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.<br/><br/>Do not miss this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see."

","The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.<br/><br/>Best watched with a nice Chianti...<br/><br/>P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?"
"tfrizzell","Null","235","326","21 July 2000"," In a Class by Itself
","Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5."

","I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.<br/><br/>I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.<br/><br/>Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.<br/><br/>Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.<br/><br/>""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things."

","This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore to have a good suspense film.

","The Silence of the Lambs, having accomplished the rare feat of winning all five of the major Academy Award categories, is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.  Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicated participants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failed in the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece.  Taut direction and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's power, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances of Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a handful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting."
"crisp_morning_2004","10","81","124","11 August 2006"," A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars
","It is a creepy and taken-by-storm experience with the film, background music is darker than the film itself and too ominous, plot is brilliantly constructed, conversations are thought-provocative, to crown the whole, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkin are the cream. They take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them into the most unforgettable screen images.<br/><br/>The psychological path of Hannibal is hard to trace. He is so odd a mixture of intelligence, cruelty, insanity, grace and charisma. In the depth, fledgling FBI trainee Clarice is no match of him. She is still naive yet very ambitious. On the trail of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, she's sent to interview him, a psychiatrist-turned-cannibal. Hannibal is willing to provide clues to finding the killer but only in return for personal information about Clarice herself. He calls it Quid Pro Quo. In those mind games, the two dance backward and forward between cannibal and FBI agent, mentor and student, psychiatrist and patient, father and daughter. It is Clarice who breathes life into the multidimensional sophisticated psychopath and Hannibal who nudges the aspiring student FBI agent and helps her achieve her first success in a world of Y chromosome where her guru Crawford uses her, embarrasses her, excludes her; Doctor Chilton regards her no more than a simple-minded woman and tries to flirt with her. Frankly speaking, though no lack of other impressive scenes, it's really the nerves fights between Hannibal and Clarice that carries the film.<br/><br/>Some of the horrible scenes involve Buffalo Bill who, a transvestite, skins his victims, especially woman victims. But the most terrifying one is Clarice's single-handed trace in Buffalo Bill's gruesome den, which also has become another irony to the self-important testosterone-dominated world. Crawford's misjudgment and stubbornness makes him out of the right track, a special anti-terror deployment resulting in vain. But Clarice, though excluded from the business which she should be on, still holds onto her intuition and through on-the-spot investigation finds the serial killer at last. She has to take on him herself. (Demme uses ""deceptive cutting"" there to enhance the tension.) It is definitely a life-or-death fight, especially when Clarice is in the dark, groping her way in absolute terror. I have no doubt everyone holds the breath when the film rolls to that part.<br/><br/>A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars"
"notoriousCASK","10","62","93","1 August 2017"," One of the Greatest Thrillers of all Time.
","The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.<br/><br/>The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover, the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.<br/><br/>The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspense and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see."

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>Rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...<br/><br/>The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.<br/><br/>Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.<br/><br/>It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly remarkable. *****"

","With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all aspects!"

"nickpal1983","10","63","103","17 July 2005"," It's a classic!
","There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)"

This was my first film I saw on VHS as a teenager and I absolutely loved it. Right after seeing this flick, I heard about Hannibal (2001) Ridley Scot film a sequel to this psychological thriller flick, I rushed buying it right away. Saddly I was disappointed with Ridley Scott Hannibal.<br/><br/>""Silence of the Lambs "" is a classic and I think people would agree. It is my number 1 favorite thriller ever made, mostly I have enjoyed Jodie Foster as FBI recruit Clarice Starling's. Jodie did a brilliant acting performance I have seen. I love this film to death I absolutely love everything about this film. Since the first time I saw her in Silence I went to seeing her in a movie theater 2002 Panic Room, it was her first film I saw in movie theater since than I love Jodie Foster but Silence will be her best film she ever made. I was disappointed with the sequel Hannibal, no Jodie Foster in it, no brilliant masterful Clarice. Julianne Moore was incompetent for me, she couldn't catch Hannibal. Clarice Starling character was based on Gillian Anderson's FBI Agent Dana Scully and I think The X-Files inspired this film. I am even convinced that The Lone Gunman three geeks were also based on this film. You have a nice shootout on the end with Clarice and Buffalo Bill and Clarice get's her man, spoils her plans saves the hostage and saves the day.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is the 1991 thriller that was the feature film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and marked the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) Dr.Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste (you can interpret that as you like). He is scary and his the same time awesome including brilliant, you can't out smart him. Director Jonathan Demme is masterful directing this flick you have to be brilliant you have to keep thinking to solve the murder mystery. Scott Glenn acts beautiful as Jack Crawford. This flick got five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is no wonder why.<br/><br/>Plot: FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is asked by the Bureau to elicit Lecter's help in tracking down a notorious serial killer who has kidnapped a US Senator's daughter. Directed by Jonathan Demme (The Manchurian Candidate), the film would receive five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hopkins and Best Actress for Foster and Best Screenplay. Hopkins would reprise his role as Lecter in two more films: Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002).<br/><br/>Real life killer Ed Gein was the inspiration for Buffalo Bill as well as the inspiration for Norman Bates from Psycho and Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. And the director Jonathan Demme was a film student of Roger Corman who makes a cameo in the movie. Roger Corman taught not only him, but I think other filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Joe Dante, Francis Ford Coppola, and many others. Ted Levine did a pretty solid job as a serial killer Buffalo Bill. This film is fun, intense, very well fast paced goes quickly around for those two hours.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American horror-thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn.

"jtkrings","9","6","8","22 February 2016"," Silence of the Lambs
","Silence of the Lambs (1991) follows the story of the young and ambitious Clarice Starling in her attempt to apprehend the serial killer named ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine). Starling goes to the infamous Hannibal Lecter (nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal for his exotic tastes). Clarice relies on Lecter for his expertise and knowledge about the mind of a serial killer. Whereas Hannibal toys with Clarice in order to amuse himself. Clarice and her fellow agents are forced to rely on the help of a killer in order to catch another.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster does an excellent job playing the young and eager Clarice. She portrays her Southern accent as often painfully obvious, which Lecter pounces upon as an insecurity. Foster speaks with a wavering voice at times, showing Clarice's inexperience and disgust with the crimes committed by Buffalo Bill. Hopkins is completely absorbed into the role of Hannibal Lecter. To create his creepy and psychotic persona he stares unblinkingly, forcing both the audience and Clarice to return his cold gaze. Hopkins keeps as still as possible while acting, looking like a snake poised to pounce upon less intelligent prey, and in comparison to Lecter everyone is less intelligent, and is therefore potential prey. Hopkins keeps a soft smirk on his lips throughout the film as if to say he knows something no one else does. The film's soundtrack is absolutely haunting and mysterious. It works well with the film to create tension and anxiety in the audience. However, the director (Jonathan Demme) knows when silence is just as powerful. In a tense scene in complete darkness we are left with no sound save for the heavy breathing of Buffalo Bill. The cinematography is excellent for this film. The colors of the film are gray and lifeless, which complement the film's dark subject matter. At pivotal moments the camera angle switches to first person. This view works perfectly when Clarice rounds the corner and sees Lecter for the first time. We are able to truly appreciate Lecter's piercing gaze, because we see it first hand through Clarice's eyes. The performances of Hopkins and Foster would have been flat if it were not for the well written script. The small anecdotal stories about Lecter help to build his character even before we meet him. Lecter's lines are meant to sound sophisticated and cultured in order to create his paradoxical character as a gentleman-psychopath. Buffalo Bill refers to his victims as ""it"" in an attempt to destroy their humanity in another example of brilliant writing. <br/><br/>A key strength in this film is its character development. Not just Lecter or Clarice's development, but their relationship itself. The audience watches as Lecter and Clarice grow closer and closer in a bizarre exchange not unlike two friends sharing secrets. As Clarice learns more from Lecter, so too does Lecter learn more about Clarice. The audience can see that Lecter values this relationship because he does not hunt her down for as Clarice puts it, ""He would consider that rude"". <br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs is a gripping and disturbing film, filled with fascinating characters. It remains a timeless horror film that draws from the darkest and foulest corner of humanity's existence. It is a terrifying movie because it reminds us that the monsters in our world are not imaginary, but could pass us on the street any day."
"Theo Robertson","8","65","132","30 October 2005"," Very Effective Thriller But Ultimately Overrated
","It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice <br/><br/>Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins <br/><br/>I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it"

","It is really difficult for me to understand what it is about this film that everyone loves. I have seen many thrillers and I can honestly say that this one is not even in my Top 20. Although I think Hopkins did a terrific job in Lecter's shoes, his 30 minutes on screen just were not enough. This was supposed to be a horror film but I think it barely managed to create the suspense atmosphere and it certainly did not scare me or made me feel uncomfortable at all. Perhaps I expected more since I have been hearing all the fuzz about this movie since I was a little kid. So I watched this film several times and I am still not enjoying it that much."

It is a slow-paced film but it gets intense after a while so patience is key and the acting in this movie made it far more interesting, especially Anthony Hopkins' and Jodie Foster's.

","Agent Clarice Starling is a training FBI agent, hope to work in behavioral sciences with Jack Crawford. Crawford though sends Starling on an assignment, to psychologically exam the insanely intelligent criminal Hannibal Lecter. Crawford had another agenda, to see if Starling can press information out of Lecter to help with the current case of Buffalo Bill. Bill has already killed five girls, skinning off sections of their bodies. Lecter is intrigue by Starling and helps her with the investigation; they start to form a strange friendship.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best psychological thrillers. Thomas Harris's best selling book is faithfully transfered to the screen. It's one dark twisted disturbing ride. The mood is heighten by Demme's great direction, with such detail in all the sets and locations. Demme has used reflective surfaces wonderfully, during one of Starling's and Lecter's talks it used to great extent. One of the final sequences of Clarice walking through the basement of Bill's house is one of the most suspense full scenes i have ever seen.<br/><br/>All the performances are knock outs. Jodie Foster as always brings the goods and makes Starling the most interesting to watch. At times she makes Starling so fragile, then a second later she's strong as steel. Anthony Hopkins is so disturbing as Lecter. From the first second you see Lecter standing in his cell; just waiting for Starling to show, you can see Hopkins was perfect casting. You cant keep your eyes off Lecter, he's so disturbing and can make your skin crawl every time he speaks. Ted Levine makes the perfect serial killer, you can see from Levine's performance what a torn and damaged soul the killer is; you feel somewhat sympathetic for him.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a must see, one of the best thrillers you'll ever see."

","This review contains spoilers, for a spoiler-free version of what I think of this movie, please read the conclusion only. <br/><br/>The idea? Pretty good. The acting performances? Definetively great. But, *SPOILER ALERT* am I supposed to ignore that all of a sudden everybody changes their mind about having Lecter under maximum security at the moment he escapes? Hannibal Lecter's escape is one of the most ridiculously unrealistic and stupid things that I've ever seen in a movie as acclaimed as this one. Let's ignore all the stupid things that happen after he kills the two cops and let's just focus on the situation that makes everything ""possible"", in the first place. Just two cops were watching over Lecter. No camera camera surveillance, they didn't even have a radio to immediately inform the rest of the officers if something goes wrong, that or, for some reason, they didn't used such radio when things eventually went wrong. The rest of the officers, ten or more, were just hanging out in the lobby of the building. That's already very stupid and inconsistent with the way the authorities had been treating Lecter all the rest of the movie until that point. But things get even more ridiculous, both officers, totally unconcerned, enter the cell at the same time to give Lecter his meal. The following sequence is so immensely stupid I can't express it correctly with words. If you are of the popular opinion that this movie is one of the greatest thrillers of all time, please, re-watch this scene. After Lecter easily opens his handcuffs with a pen, he proceeds handcuff one of the officers and attack the other with a very effective attack (please note the sarcasm), he bites his face. Yeah, no way to defend against that, especially if you are an armed and trained police officer. The rest of the escape, including the idea of ripping off one of the officer's face and using it as a mask, is, again, immensely stupid, and would obviously never work in real life. <br/><br/>This movie is full of ridiculous plot holes that insult the intelligence of the viewer and everything regarding Lecter's escape is beyond stupid and unrealistic. <br/><br/>CONCLUSION (spoiler free): Great performances by the leading actors, well directed, and plenty of good, high-tension, entertaining scenes, but if you care about plot consistency and you need this type of films to have a minimum level of realism, this movie isn't for you, and it certainly wasn't for me. 4/10 not worth it. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading and sorry for bad English."

","Silence of the Lambs is a quintessence of a profound character study and a rare and vivid demonstration of an actor's subtle brilliance and his improvisation in manifestation of a nebulous entity (Lecter), almost single-handedly immortalizing it and in the process elevating himself to a position of unqualified envy and ubiquitous acclaim. In fact, one is likely to suffer, either from inarticulacy or verbosity while describing Anthony Hopkins portrayal of sadistically sophisticated Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's trademark, his wide open glacial eyes, devoid of any emotion, not only makes him deviously equanimous, but also egregiously peculiar. The fast, slurping-type sound invented by Hopkins that Lecter does, is as fascinating as it is chilling and Lecter's infamous ""Good evening, Clarice"", is as enthralling as it is vicious. Anthony Hopkins's performance is the shortest ever and the most memorable to win an Oscar in the leading category. <br/><br/>Hopkins as Lecter, is incontrovertibly and incredibly at the top of his game and it is his brilliance that gets the best out of the other actors, especially Jodie Foster. In fact, it won't be a hyperbole, that Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs and more so in its sequel, Hannibal (which is my favorite of the series, as the story completely revolves around Lecter, giving him more exposure), is one of the best, the world of cinema has ever seen or offered. In spite of having some of the most gruesomely disturbing and viciously graphic sequences, Silence of the Lambs, is one of the most decorated and enthralling movies of all time.

"Brian-268","1","83","216","20 May 2000"," An overrated but sporadically very good suspense thriller
","That the film has its moments cannot be denied. Hopkins is slightly over-the-top as the diabolical yet urbane Lecter, but it's an enjoyable performance all the same. Lecter's finest moment is when, bound, straightjacketed, and face-masked, he is brought before Senator Martin and, after relentlessly goading her about the fate of her daughter, blurts out the identity of Buffalo Bill and adds, ""Love your suit.""<br/><br/>Beyond the superficial appeal of a character who can interject such misanthropic witticisms, Lecter embodies the repulsive seduction of this thoroughly erudite monster, utterly free of societal constraints in spirit if not in body. His intelligence is, if remorseless and amoral, open and searching and methodical. We are time and again shown his superiority to the FBI, who rush hither and yon after clues they don't begin to understand, and to the pettiness of his jailor, Dr. Chilton, who subjects Lecter to televangelist broadcasts as punishment for brutal misbehavior.<br/><br/>Yet Lecter is poorly contrasted throughout the film, and his intelligence is falsely elevated by comparison to the unimaginative mediocrities he is up against. Starling is a dreary feminist with a white trash inferiority complex, Dr. Chilton is a preposterously snide asshole, and none of the other characters rise above their status as plot devices. There is something particularly prim and humorless and unlikeable about Starling, and it is impossible to determine why Lecter would take an interest in her childhood trauma about lambs.<br/><br/>Several points regarding Lecter's escape make no sense at all, and at crucial stages the total incompetence of his captors is required to pull it off. That Hopkins manages to keep the suspense going is a testament to the actor's ability to rise above the script. Regarding the ultimate capture of Buffalo Bill, it is too much to swallow that Starling's success hinges upon uncovering photographs in the victim's abandoned bedroom years after it had been scoured for evidence by FBI agents. This twist hangs one ridiculous premise on another and is a sorry attempt to justify Starling's centrality to the story.<br/><br/>The cinematography and direction do contribute something interesting to the tumultuous descent to Lecter's asylum cell, but are otherwise unremarkable. Buffalo Bill is more bizarre than chilling, and the final confrontation between him and Starling is contrived. The film ends on a note that suggests it could have been alot better.<br/><br/>Warning: If you purchase the DVD of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, resist the urge to listen to Jodie Foster's commentary. While the lambs may be silent, it is next to impossible to get her to shut up. Her grating, man-hating (and totally outdated) style of feminist rhetoric comes close to self-parody, although not often enough to be truly entertaining. Conclusion: this über-bitch is a gaseous windbag. But if you don't believe me, listen for yourself. You'll be saying ""Pass the Chianti"" before you make it through the first reel."

","This film has a silly premise, a lousy script, an implausibility factor of about +100 and a dreadful performance by Anthony Hopkins.  It's the last point that I'll mention about first:  has a more pretentious, breathy performance ever been seen on film before (outside of the Richard Burton oeuvre)?  As for plausibility:  can you imagine the FBI sending a trainee to interview a serial killer, seeking information about another serial killer on the loose?  That was a major flaw in the (also overrated) novel.  I guess it's easier to write about, or make a movie with, a younger woman who's still apt to get all scared-ified and emotional and who doesn't have those annoying crows-feet.  The script is terrible, too--it tries to present Hannibal Lecter as being some kind of 'psychic vampire'.  Witness Hopkins' expression after Jodie Foster tells him her tale of lamb-napping woe--like a famished person who's just been given a good meal.  Give me a break!  And don't tell me that the FBI couldn't have made a connection between the missing skin pieces on the dead girls' bodies and figured out what the loony-tunes they were chasing was doing.  It takes Jodie Foster's character seeing a dress pattern with darts on it to make the connection.  What a group of dim bulbs.  And they wait until HOW MANY young women are killed before they scratch their heads and say, ""Hmmmm, maybe the killer knew one of the victims!""  How did this stupid waste of celluloid ever garner any critical praise?  I mean, I know the Oscars annually bestow 'Best Motion Picture' awards on undeserving titles, so I don't care that this movie won so many--but what were the nation's film critics thinking when this made so many 'Top 10' lists?"

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" deserves its recognition as a classic and one of only three movies in history to win the ""big 5"" Oscars. The protagonists were brilliantly portrayed. Hopkins very much adds to the story through his creepy performance. His articulate speech and refined southern English accent were jarring as he rarely blinked and calmly expressed his cannibalism. The way Lecter masterfully picked at Starling's insecurities while she tried to get his assistance in finding Buffalo Bill made the character all the more terrifying. Foster, unsurprisingly, is extremely believable as a young woman who wants to prove her worth for her future occupation by tackling the ambitious case. The directing flows smoothly. Great use of extreme close-ups are used to see the actors' emotions and connect with them. The flashbacks were introduced before they seamlessly illustrated the effects Lecter's prodding conversations has on Clarice, making these scenes easy to follow and making Foster's character more of a protagonist. On a side note, I appreciated the conscientious effort made to include a diverse cast in the film, with African- Americans featured prominently in important secondary roles. With that being said, I did feel that the movie was not perfect. The way Clarice finds a lead as to where Buffalo Bill is hiding seemed far- fetched to me. I felt the case could have been further developed before Starling reached the conclusion she arrived to. Moreover, I felt that Buffalo Bill could have used more of a back-story than what is given in order to increase the depth of his character. While some insight is given by Lecter, it is not enough to understand what caused the gender/identity issues that drive Bill to kill. This made his character seem a bit two- dimensional as the antagonist of the film. In contrast, I found Lecter's character rich in depth, as he would be considered a bad guy unless he was helping to find another mentally ill murderer. His character does not hold back his psychopathic ways or complete, self-centered disregard for the well- being of others if it doesn't suit his needs. All in all, this was an incredibly well done film that could probably only be improved if not for time restraints."

"slayerholmes","5","17","42","8 August 2006"," One of the most overrated movies ever
","First problem: this could have been quite shocking and groundbreaking movie in the 1970's, not after the decade of splatter, gore, mad slashers and all kinds of overwhelming violence, the 80's. And of course especially not after the first film-version of the Thomas Harris' book ""Red Dragon"", aka ""Manhunter"" by Michael Mann, which intensity and credibility is in a whole different level. So there was nothing exceptional happening on the screen to me when I saw this even back in 1991, being of course much more dated now. Sure, the majority of moviegoers bought this whole, at least partly due to being the one serial killer- horror-movie that also women could understand and relate to through the main character.<br/><br/>Second problem: I've had this little rule of my own how one can quickly define a director's talent while watching a film. I'll do it by close-ups, especially of the faces. The more close-ups the worse as they lose their effect. Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, Steven Spielberg, Sam Peckinpah, Stanley Kubrick... they all use them only temporarily, on the right occasion as they should be. Then there are these guys who cherish those facial close-ups in almost EVERY scene like Tony Scott or Renny Harlin, which is, annoyingly, Demme's way of depicting major confrontations in ""The Lambs"" too. When Hopkins' or Foster's face fill the screen, either delivering or receiving, there's nothing frightening or emotional to me. It's manipulative and ridiculous, destined to be followed by all kinds of mockery spoofs and rightly so. It's soap opera. In the last resort, and to make the problem worse, the interplay between characters just isn't that intelligent and challenging as everybody and his sister seems to think.<br/><br/>Third problem: Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are widely regarded as one of the best actors in (movie) history. I don't agree. While they're no hams either I still find them to be on top only in the category of ""mannerism"". Which is a little odd because judging by many many interviews I've seen over the years they are clearly quite intelligent persons. Particularly in this movie, they're are SO self-conscious in every scene. They are not talking to each other, they are talking to that scary middle-aged lady in the aisles. And what really is so special in Jodie Foster's performance? She behaves all the time perfectly normally and logically (why in the first place someone even WANTS to see a 'vulnerable' woman as an FBI-agent is beyond me), so how come Lecter-Hopkins has that unusual interest in her? And being a true female police, she almost screws up busting that serial-killer by making wrong decisions in every turn in the climax... Many actions are too unbelievable compared to reaching for realism in many other levels.<br/><br/>I don't mind that much about this movie's success in the box office and not even it's undeserved but ongoing status as sort of phenomenon, but those five main Academy Awards for only the third time in Hollywood history was incomprehensible. Even just considering ""serial killer""-depictions, this is somewhere 6th or 7th best in its genre on my list. But so that leaving you all ""Lambs""-lovers with more positive feelings I have to admit there is one good, clever and truly exciting scene after all: Lecter's escape. Glimmers among the rest of the garbage like a shiny kitchen knife...."

If he's in high security jail .. how the hell would he manage to run away , how is it high secured when there's no cameras watching him 24/7 , it's confusing how some time they show you that they r super carful with how they treat him .. other minute no one is keeping an eye on him , even the cops , why the hell THE TWO of them needed to be in the cell while feeding him .. he's a dangerous criminal, how can the government put these kind of stupid cops to watch him ..
and when the doctor pushed the other uncuffed cop .. the other one who only has one hand cuffed .. didn't pull a gun and shoot the criminal !! Wtf is that ?<br/><br/>Third plot hole :
Why did buffalo bill needed to Load his gun right in front of starling , he had so much time to do it before , why !!

Particularly Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter, soft spoken, analytical and very, very calm. However, always an undercurrent of danger and a mere whisper of insanity.<br/><br/>Now on to ""Silence of the Lambs"" - Hannibal Lecter has gone from being an all too believable real-life monster to a giggling Hollywood psycho - a veritable troll complete with his own dungeon (alas, no smoking torches) and a set of eyes wide enough to make Marty Feldman blink.<br/><br/>Serial murderers such as this, particularly highly intelligent ones, do not prance about revelling in how evil they are, nor do they speak in such ridiculous snidley tones.<br/><br/>They appear quite normal - the reason why they managed to get away with what they did for the length of time they did.

"DrEbert","9","8","17","28 December 2007"," Taut film-making that results in a chilling and influential psychological thriller
","The late Gene Siskel hated ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" thinking of it as being far too gruesome and distasteful and as having zero originality to it. Roger Ebert gave the 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying that he did enjoy the film but that some scenes were lacking, such as the ending.<br/><br/>Siskel missed the point. The chill from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" doesn't come from revolutionary originality, which it doesn't have. The chill of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is in how it maximizes fear and suspense in a plot that one could simply describe as ""police on the hunt for a serial killer."" It is here where ""The Silence of the Lambs"" set the bar; it takes a B-movie concept and raises it to the level of a taut A-level thriller.<br/><br/>The plot has the FBI on the hunt for a serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill"" (played by Ted Levine). Stuck, the lead investigator (played by Scott Glenn) wants to get the perspective of another serial killer, to try and see inside the psychotic mind. He recruits the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) to talk to the brilliant and cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins). Lecter agrees to help Starling, but only if she will grant him the sadistic pleasure of allowing him to see inside her mind.<br/><br/>Even though the plot is about Buffalo Bill, with Lecter only having 16 minutes on screen in a 2-hour movie, Lecter and Starling are way more interesting and end up being the driving force for the film. In many films, an excellent performance by the villain can steal the show away from the hero. (Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" featuring a brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson as The Joker, is a prime example of this.) In ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" we have strong performances by both of the lead actors. Hopkins' Lecter is clearly everybody's favorite character, but Foster's performance as Starling is powerful enough to not get eclipsed by Hopkins.<br/><br/>Not getting eclipsed is something of a theme for this film. Our heroine is not trying to be heroic. Starling is strong and courageous and could kick anyone's butt, and yet she comes across as vulnerable. She is a woman in a man's world and everywhere she goes, there is a sense of being dominated. She is 5'3"" in a film where most other characters are over 6' tall. (The camera often skillfully has Starling occupying only the lower half of the frame; seeing so much space above her head makes her look shorter and more vulnerable.) Her black hair (which is different from Foster's natural light brown) makes her appear paler than she really is. Other characters are always hitting on her. She always whispers and is always giving a nervous smile. Even her slight Southern accent gives her a ""country girl"" appeal that helps the audience identify with her. Starling is an FBI agent-in-training and is clearly quite skilled at handling dangerous situations, but she still shares our vulnerabilities. As a result of this, her fears are our fears. This is the true skill of Jodie Foster's performance; she manages to play Starling as a woman of great strength and vulnerability at once.<br/><br/>Credit should also go to the film-makers. One strong point is their choice to only be selectively gruesome. This is one key difference between ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and garden-variety serial killer movies. The latter often derive their scares by showing incredibly brutal images and portraying utterly disgusting scenarios. Fear is generated by the audience's own horrified reaction to what is being shown on screen. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does not give in to that temptation though. It casually shows us several rather gruesome images to get us nervous, but then keeps some of the most disturbing stuff cleverly off-camera. Of course, this serves to only make them scarier; what could be so gruesome that not even this creepy film is willing to show it on camera? <br/><br/>I do have criticisms. My main complaint is that Buffalo Bill is a lightweight who left me longing for the much more interesting and menacing Hannibal Lecter. Buffalo Bill is sick, twisted, and downright nauseating, but he also is a coward, who has to resort to trickery and gadgetry to make himself formidable. Lecter, on the other hand, has all the tools he needs right there in his brain. He is the smartest character in the film and he knows it and he loves it. He is so charismatic that he can enter the mind of anyone, no matter how hard they resist. This makes Lecter scary even when he is off-camera. Buffalo Bill is not really all that scary even when he's on camera; he's more just plain gross.<br/><br/>The thrill of this movie is psychological. We don't feel thrilled because of cool action sequences or original plot ideas but rather because of the fear that we can relate to and the mind games that Lecter plays. Something of a void is left in scenes in the latter half of the film, where Lecter is absent. (Here, I agree with Ebert.) Nonetheless, Foster's performance makes up for that. Even in the final showdown with Buffalo Bill, the thrill is still there because we feel Starling's fear, even though the audience has not been particularly scared of Buffalo Bill up until now. (Here, I disagree with Ebert, who feels the showdown is lacking.) <br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is thrilling and chilling. The main villain is a lightweight, but the secondary villain is among the most menacing and evil in cinema history. I think that after we walk away from this film, we somehow are left with the feeling that, at least for those 2 hours, Hannibal Lecter managed to get inside our own minds as well."
"fremlejemand","2","14","35","20 December 2007"," Glorification of psychopaths
","This is another movie that glorifies psychopathic behaviour. The bad guy is portrayed as an intelligent, witty, stylish, calculated guy while the investigators are shown as weak-minded, emotional, imprudent persons. One almost feels sorry(or maybe angry) for the FBI guys for being so incompetent. How can the screenplay for such a movie get 5 Oscars? The acting is not that great either, Anthony Hopkins is overplaying his lines while Jodie Foster is barely acting at all. She doesn't seem to change mimic during the whole movie and the whole story with the lambs is just lame. Some psychopaths are known to be good to animals, so saving some lambs doesn't automatically make you a noble and unique person, someone that can make the world a better place."

","Finally, I saw this movie for the first time yesterday. <br/><br/>I bet everyone has already seen it, but just in case: Spoilers Below!<br/><br/>I've always heard and read that SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was a great movie, but I'd never seen it. Now I have, and I've learned that it wasn't all hype.<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs is about an FBI-trainee named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is trying to track down and stop a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who has been killing girls throughout the country. In order to do so, she questions Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins). Dr. Lector is a brilliant physiologist who is a convicted serial killer. He appears polite, but is actually a very dangerous and intelligent psychopath who eats his victims.<br/><br/>I can't express how great I thought this movie was. Just about every scene with Anthony Hopkins was mesmerizing, especially his dialogue with Jodie Foster. The last conversation between the two in this movie was chilling to the bone. Dr. Lector's escape was probably the greatest scene in the movie, while also one of the most disturbing. When he beats a helpless guard to death with a nightstick, it reminds you that he is not the harmless man that he looks like.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins, of course, stole the show. He stole every single scene he was in. Jodie Foster did a very good job also as the young, ambitious FBI trainee trying to put an end to another madman's reign and, in doing so, smother the pains of her past. Ted Levine also did a notable job as another very different madman than Lector. I sincerely hated Levine's character by the end of this movie.<br/><br/>There are many memorable scenes in this movie. The prison break, as I mentioned earlier, is one of the more memorable ones. The most intense scene of the movie, in my opinion, is when Jodie Foster is being stalked in the dark near the end of the film. Anytime that Lector talks, you will probably feel shivers up your spine. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br/><br/>If like me, you have not seen it in all these years, do it today. There is a reason this movie is a favorite of many people and crosses many genres."

","Immeasurably superior to its disappointing sequel ""Hannibal,"" ""Silence of the Lambs"" must surely rank as one of the absolute greatest thrillers of all time. <br/><br/>Given the nature of the movie, there is surprisingly little graphic violence contained in it. The story focuses instead on the complex psychological relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and the imprisoned cannibalistic serial killer and ex-psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins.) Both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. Foster has the larger role, and carries it off well, but Hopkins steals the movie with a frighteningly realistic portrayal of a frightening serial killer. Lecter, approached by the FBI because they believe he might be of assistance in helping identify a current serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill,"" sees in the FBI's interest an opportunity to escape imprisonment, and plays a series of mind games with Starling (and anyone else who wants to speak to him about the case.)<br/><br/>Director Jonathon Demme effectively weaves two stories (the hunt for the serial killer, and the Starling-Lecter relationship) together into a taut thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. And, in the end, has there ever been a better, funnier and more thoroughly chilling line in any movie than Lecter's closing comment to Clarice: ""I have to go now. I'm having an old friend for dinner.""<br/><br/>I can't identify a single weakness in this movie. 10/10."
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","4","7","15","17 January 2017"," Why?
","Look, ""overrated"" doesn't necessarily mean bad. I liked this film when it first came out, and I found it very entertaining. But the extremely high amount of praise that this film gets, makes no sense to me at all. The supposedly menacing and creepy Hannibal Lecter, who ate his victims and is now locked away from society, sounds totally ridiculous with his cheesy one-liners about cannibalism and killing. Jodie Foster, who plays our main protagonist (an elite FBI agent in training) looks and sounds about thirteen years old, and the entire time I was watching, she kept reminding me of an actress from a television after-school special playing dress-up and pretending to be a cop. The pace of this film was rather dull as well, unnecessarily long with hammy characters that seem like they belong in a Troma movie rather than anything highly rated. It still blows my mind that a brilliant film like ""The Killing Fields"" has never been selected for national preservation, but this corny crime thriller was. Honestly I've seen low-budget slashers better than this thing... so why the high reputation and constant fans saying ""oh god, this film is awesome! Hannibal is soooo sexy!"" and all that? To each their own, everybody likes different things, but with this one, which currently has an 8.6/10 overall rating on IMDb, how did that even happen? Was this one of those ""right place at the right time"" kind of things where it hits a generation by doing something innovative for the time, thus becoming popular? Or is there seriously something here I'm missing? I've watched it several times and I don't find it complex or overly intriguing in any way whatsoever. And I really like Foster and Hopkins as actors, from Hopkins' role as the grieving father in Audrey-Rose, to Foster as the dying little girl on a Nova Scotia vacation in Echoes of a Summer, but in this film it tries to put them together in some sort of tragic love story, which really plays out strangely. I kept cringing at Foster's character's pretentiousness and show-off attitude and Hannibal Lecter's pointless riddles and games, which are interesting at first but quickly become boring and stupid."

","Silence of the Lambs was the birthplace of Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter, one of the finest monsters ever screened.

With a serial killer named Buffalo Bill increasing his body count.

","Despite the impressive credentials this so-called thriller is nothing more than quality exploitation with highbrow pretensions, none of which can patch the many plot holes and jarring improbabilities. The script presents an awkward adaptation of what must have been a much fuller (if equally unpleasant) novel, compressing the material with too many transparent narrative gaps and shortcuts, including some amazing FBI deductions worthy of Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>The idea of using one psychopath to help catch another is intriguing, but having two serial killers dilutes the impact of the story, especially when it focuses more on cartoon cannibal Anthony Hopkins, already in custody until his illogical, unlikely escape. Nothing much is learned about the other killer-at-large (an apparent reject from a David Lynch freak-show), and the film ends as a typical damsel-in-distress drama with haunted house shock effects.<br/><br/>The screenplay is overloaded with bogus psychological significance and padded with irrelevant flashbacks, and the film was shot entirely in blunt, video-format close-ups, with director Jonathan Demme apparently trying to get inside the mind of his characters by simply shoving the camera in their faces. The manhunt is also highlighted by a gratuitous excess of explicit gore, but that doesn't stop it from having a happy ending, for everyone involved, including cannibal/killer Hannibal Lecter."

","Oh goody gumdrops. A chance to express my utter hatred of this execrable and immoral film. I burst out laughing when it won oscars in all the film making departments in which I had found it so inept. Hackneyed dialogue, direction-by-numbers, corny music and silly performances make this one to remember. Hopkins gives a diabolical performance but not in the way you want. He was quite preposterous but, being a canny actor, he gave a cartoon turn very appropriate to the ridiculous plot. Take the money and run, eh Tony? The name 'Dr.Lecter' suggests a moriaty type evil genius which is wonderfully silly. The scene where he is wheeled along in restraints at the airport reminds me of an episode of Batman, a series noted at the time for its pantomime villains. I remember an 8 year old on tv saying this was her favourite film. We were supposed to be shocked that she'd even seen it but I thought: 'how appropriate'. That seems to be the mentality it was aimed at. But the real p***er is when Starling is led into a room where lecter is sitting in this ridiculously huge cage. Roll up, folks! Roll Up! Come and see the most dangerous man in the world! Then there's that crass scene where Lecter listens to classical music while murdering his guards. Hey, Mass murderers like Hitler listened to Wagner. Getting the message? Then the corny fifties way the police draw their revolvers and look at the descending lift arrow. ""He's coming down!"" Notice the way the camera wobbles as it pans in. Bad. Then there's the naff B-movie dialogue. Jodie Foster saying the Plan 9-like line: ""who cut off your patient's head, doctor?"" in that portentious southern twang never fails to give me the giggles. And what's the big psychological motivation that Sterling must divulge to Lecter which is susposed to rivet us to our seats with the great drama of it all? Aw shucks, she just wanted to save all those lambys from being slaughtered in her childhood. Blinding! Shakespeare! The way the film tries to make us laugh and side with Lecter at the end as he stalks his captor is sickening and speaks volumes about the moral bankruptcy of America. Hopkins described SOTL as 'that camp little picture' with a smirk. Jonathan Demmie nervously explained how many successful films were B-movies. What can you say about a film whose lead actor and director seem embarrassed by its success? I see a lot of reviewers of this film say it has inspired them to become psychology majors and 'profilers', whatever that means. Have fun, kiddies!"

At the same time I was giving my nervous system a workout, I was sitting there in awe of how well written the film was, how excellently defined and sketched all the characters were, how intellectually challenging the piece was, and how unbelievably good Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins performances were- thank God they both won Oscars. Frankly, I was disappointed to learn that there would be a sequel, as I think this film, and its story, stand so well on their own and need no elaboration. As excellent and terrifying as JAWS, only with people... which is somehow even scarier, once you really start to think about. I worry the sequels will run the way of JAWS 2, 3D, and THE REVENGE."

","I was not impressed with this film, and it's phoney psychiatry. I have some professional experience in working with the criminally insane, in the US and UK. While there are a few staff in the profession who would allow themselves to be manipulated in the way that Clarice Starling does, I cannot conceive any real life situation where so many of her colleagues would allow this situation, known as ""team splitting"", to continue. It is routine behaviour for psychopaths to attempt to team split, as Lekter does, but it is such a standard ploy that it would be recognised in any institution other than the toyland one in the film and quickly dealt with, and I resent the attitude of the storyline in glorifying this behaviour. Trust me people, if you are in this situation, don't allow patients to split you away from your colleagues, you may think they are interested in you but they will get bored with playing with you in the end. When patients are given this power, which they cannot handle, it makes them more scared, and less likely to learn. In his attempt to make Frederick Chilton, the character that should be the good guy, in to the bad guy, either the actor or the director has gone way over the top, to the point where where pathos becomes bathos, and as for Anthony Hopkins, he lost all credibility for me when he announced in a British tabloid that he was sorry for seeming to condone violence in the role he was playing, and then within a few months proceeded to repeat the role in the sequel, ""Hannibal"".

","""The Silence of The Lambs"", simply one of the greatest films ever made. Swept all five major academy awards, only ever done twice before (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, It Happened That Night).<br/><br/>It centres on a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who becomes increasingly obsessed with solving the the murders of a deranged killer known only as ""Buffalo Bill"" thanks to hid trademark of skinning his victims. Starling is mentored by the brilliant intelligent yet atrociously psychopathic Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector.<br/><br/>The two protagonists have a number of exchanges throughout the film which unyielded dark and unsettling personal disturbances that Starling experienced in the past where she witnessed the slaughtering of innocent spring lambs juxtaposed with their terrifying screams. This is an extremely powerful image and connotation in the film as Starling believes that capturing ""Buffalo Bill"" will be silencing the lambs and ultimately silencing the soul-shattering experiences of her orphaned childhood.<br/><br/>There are a variety of effective techniques employed by director Jonathan Demme such as extreme close-ups of Dr. Lector to illuminate the madness in his eyes and the unsettling rhythm of his breathing. These are few of the elements that contribute in Anthony Hopkins delivering the performance of his career as Lector.<br/><br/>The first time Starling visits Lector in his cell is outstandingly effective. Just by the camera gliding slowly past the other institutionalised psycho's, it builds slowly up the true madman, Lecot. He stands still in the centre of his cell, staring at Starling. Spine-chilling and brilliant. One of the most effective techniques I have ever noticed in a film.<br/><br/>The film does have its gory moments, which is fine considering that it deals heavily with serial killers and cannibals so it is nothing that exceeds expectations.<br/><br/>But it's the performances that make this film simply incredible. Hopkins is extraordinarily creepy as Hannibal Lector where as Jodie Foster portrays such vulnerable courage, such fear and determination. Both were well deserved of their Oscars as was the film and Demme for his Best Director Award.<br/><br/>The film's ending is exciting and well wrapped-up which is always a positive in any film and compliments the rest of the film beautifully as every scene comes dripping with intensity, drama and wondrous camera work.<br/><br/>This a genuine cinematic accomplishment that has spawned sequels and prequels that are respectable in their own right but will never match up to the brilliance of Hopkins, Foster and co.<br/><br/>10/10 True masterpiece!"

"StevePulaski","8","3","5","4 May 2014"," Dr. Lecter will see you know...
","The Silence of the Lambs is one of the rare horror films that convinced much of the American public, and even the Academy Awards, that horror doesn't have to always be about gore, excess violence, and extremism. In fact, horror can stem from many different aspects, one of them being psychological, which is the subgenre that the film caters to. Through use of strong acting and an interesting story, the film manages to explain why it etched itself into the list of greatest American films ever made simply by existing and going what nobody thought its own genre could do.<br/><br/>The film stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, who is pulled from her training at an FBI academy by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), who works for a unit in behavioral sciences. Jack grants Clarice the honor of meeting one-on-one with former psychiatrist and serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is also known for cannibalistic crimes. Lecter's knowledge is requested because of a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" currently running rampant in the streets, who is highly-publicized and known to skin the corpses of his female victims.<br/><br/>Upon arriving at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Clarice meets a surprisingly mannered and well-articulate man that is Hannibal Lecter and not the psychotic murderer one would believe. What unravels is a strange relationship between an FBI trainee and an insane mental patient. Starling has to get close to Lecter for his knowledge and insight into the crimes of ""Buffalo Bill,"" but also must refrain from dangerously close connections which could instantly spark something detrimental to her well-being.<br/><br/>The first thing to marvel at with this film is how it utilizes its talent, plunging Foster and Hopkins into a story and set of circumstances that need to be well acted in order to be believable and gripping; both veteran talents do not slump here. Foster gives a very solid performance as Clarice, that is mostly successful at avoided the often alienating tropes that result when we focus on cops or undercover investigators for two hours. Then there's Hopkins, in a role he has become known for for good reason. Hopkins instantly clicks here as Lecter, provoking fright and unsettled nerves with viewers. Rather than over-the-top zaniness, Lecter relies on quiet, mannered acting techniques that are all the more frightening because of how out of the ordinary and unexpected they are from a man of his caliber. This leads the viewer to ping-pong back and forth with the idea that Lecter is really a misunderstood victim or an amazingly talented con-artist.<br/><br/>Then there's the mounting tension on display here, largely thanks to Jonathan Demme's direction and Ted Tally's screenplay. The film plays like a true detective story, utilizing slowburn and patient tension in order to achieve a great, suspenseful result. These kinds of films hold up because they deliver something new each time one sees them. This being my first time viewing The Silence of the Lambs one gets the idea that even after seeing it, watching it again would be a great experience because it would allow you to pay more attention to the serene details of the film and how the end result came to be.<br/><br/>With strong work behind the camera, and equally strong work in front, there's really no shock that The Silence of the Lambs came out the way it did, a strong and capable psychological thriller/horror film that beautifully relies on nuances and mannerisms rather than shock and awe. The fact that the film may have lead some to look at the horror genre with a bit more respect in the short-run would maybe be a stronger statement if horror didn't go south in the long-run. But that's another blog/review for another time.<br/><br/>Starring: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. Directed by: Jonathan Demme."

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie in which a young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) tries to get some information from Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who is a psychopath and used to be a respected psychiatrist, for a psychopathic serial killer who skins his victims. To get these information Clarice Starling has to gain the respect and the trust of Dr.Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie I thought that Anthony Hopkins is really not OK in his minds for real and that's because of his perfect interpretation. I also think that Jodie Foster made an also perfect interpretation. Î¤hese were seen and in the Academy Awards where Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster won the Oscars for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for Best Actress in a Leading Role respectively. Jonathan Demme's work in the direction of this film did not go unnoticed and he also won the Oscar for Best Director.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that you have to see it, it's a really good Thriller and Crime movie with many good scenes and an exceptional screenplay."
"dogancelik17","10","3","5","23 May 2013"," My Reviews about The Silence of the Lambs
","Because of The Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed identification for the horror category. It is a first-rate production all around. It boasts a witty and dramatic script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme. Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home. The two lead actors won Oscars for their performances...each deserved. Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer. Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet forbidden some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation. He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed. The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins. Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well. A quality film in all aspects!"
"werefox08","9","3","5","14 August 2012"," Hopkins creates ......a non vegetarian
","Anthony Hopkins creates a character who is intelligent, calm, calculating, charming and.....he enjoys eating people. (a slight personalty flaw !!). This is a completely compelling man...who loves the ""high arts"", is articulate ...is a Doctor...but beef ,pork , chicken and lamb ..just don't ""do it"" for him. Dr Lecter needs that pure unmistakable taste of homo sapien. The Lecter persona has become as big as any movie ""legendary character"".(we must remember--of course--he IS a monster !!) The movie does have a few flaws here and there , but Silence of the Lambs is a really great psycho thriller. Made in 1991, it remains a landmark motion picture. Hopkins was born to play Lecter....One feels almost hypnotized when those bright eyes are sparkling (or if he appears hungry)."
"axeshredder45","9","3","5","4 August 2012"," A Suspenseful Masterpice
","What separates this movie from other horror movies is, nowadays horror movies have lots of gore and blood. But this one had scary dialog, and real suspense. <br/><br/>Hannibal Lecter really got me! I mean he was described as a psychopath and he looked calm, then he showed us his true colors!<br/><br/>""Buffalo Bill"" was crafty and crazy! The only thing he shows affection for is his poodle ""Precious"" <br/><br/>Clarice Starling proved that she has what it takes to be a professional when she used her skills to track down the sadistic ""Buffalo Bill"".<br/><br/>For these reasons and more this movie will remain a suspenseful masterpiece."

","In simple language the movie is truly remarkable. The direction of the movie is simply awesome and I loved the screenplay as well. The conversations between Starling and Hannibal Lekter are shot so well and dialogs are written so fine that even though the character of Hannibal don't appear much but still its the one that you'll never forget. Even the character of Buffalo Bill is very much creepy but Lekter wins for me. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal has delivered a stunning performance. Jodie Foster has also done a good job. The psycho-thriller theme is well established throughout the movie. Its creepy in a sense. The movie is nearly perfect in every aspect. Even the background score settles well enhancing the environment. Its one of the movie you won't forget. Though the character was introduced first in manhunter, its now that it marks its true nature. I would really recommend it to all."

","The Silence Of The Lambs is one of those movies that you don't ever want to be finished. The story/plot is intriguing, involving, interesting and makes you stay in the edge of your seat. The crazy characters are very believable and I was very afraid when Clarice was going to meet him for the first time.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins did a great job at portraying a nuts psychiatrist and sociopath. He did so well that I find it hard to imagine him as a normal person outside the movie.<br/><br/>Ted Levine was as good as Hopkins at portraying another crazy man. Also, he was very brave to play a ""transsexual"" man back in 1991 when nobody knew what it was about.<br/><br/>The creepy feelings we get throughout this movie are worth a watch in a rainy dawn, I surely recommend this to thriller lovers."

","I had read this book by Thomas Harris and thought it would make a great movie but was concerned when I heard that Jonathan Demme was making it. How wrong I was though and I was overwhelmingly surprised. It was the first film about a serial killer where it did not rely on strong elements of violence and gore but simply left it to the imagination. Obviously Hopkins and Foster get all the plaudits and rightly so but this is one of the only films that has so many superb minor characters such as Barney, Ardelia Mapp and Bill himself. I urge those who like this movie to watch the making of documentary as it is truly fascinating. A roller-coaster ride of emotions and tension which I enjoy every time I watch it."

"KillerLord","10","3","5","5 October 2008"," The Most Brilliant Psychological Thriller
","The Silence of the Lambs is the only Horror genre movie to win the Best Picture Oscar. Both its male and female lead have won the Oscars for their performances. Sir Anthony Hopkins holds the record for the shortest on-screen role to get the Lead Oscar award. He hardly spends 16-18 minutes on screen and produces magic. These factoids and the well deserved high rating on IMDb was what drove me to watch this movie. And at no point of time, I felt that the movie enjoyed more praise that it deserved. It is a brilliantly done movie that deserves all the cheers and applause. <br/><br/>Jodie Foster is one my favorite actresses of all times. Her work in Contact, Flightplan, Anna and the King and other movies was praise worthy. And her role in Silence of the Lambs is perhaps her best role ever. She plays an FBI trainee who has been sent by the FBI to try and talk to Dr. Hannibal Lecter and seek his help in finding a serial killer. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer himself, a brilliant psychiatrist with extremely intellectual insight into the human mind. Agent Starling is scared of her interaction with this madman Lecter. And you are scared of him because she is scared too. One of the very few actors who can show fear so beautifully on her face. She faces situations everyday in her life where is ends up being the only female in a room full of men. This no doubt is a source of discomfort for her and you can see it all over her face. <br/><br/>Dr. Hannibal Lecter is not an average serial killer. He is a brilliant psychiatrist. His understanding of the human mind and his skill to dissect your thoughts by observing your facial expressions and listening to your voice is demonstrated early on in the movie. He is willing to help Agent Starling catch the serial killer but in return wants to diagnose her for he in her past he sees a tragic set of events that have contributed and are still contributing to her life. The game is on! Lecter gives his insights to Starling in exchange for her honest and candid information about her childhood. Every tiny aspect of this interaction is handled so wonderfully. <br/><br/>The director Jonathan Demme does not fail in any aspect. He builds the perfect package. The eventual track down of the serial killer, the suspense and the overall story is so well done. At no point of time does he resort in showing something that makes the movie conventional or unrealistic. The movie grips you with fear and keeps you at the edge of your seat till the very end of it. The movie is not about the serial killer and his mind but it is more about Agent Starling and her peculiar relationship with Dr. Lecter. But that still does not allow Demme to ignore his development and portrayal. The serial killer is believable and complex in his own right.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic. It is destined to be in the list of great movies for a very long time to come. And I am sure that should any actor try to step in the shoes of either of these characters, he or she would be taking a very big risk indeed. The characters are so strong that it is hard to imagine any other Agent Starling other than Foster and any other Dr. Hannibal than Sir Anthony Hopkins. (I'd recommend you see The Manhunter to see another actor try playing Dr. Hannibal and see for yourself.)<br/><br/>A must watch for all movie fans! Cheers!"
"drownnnsoda","10","3","5","23 December 2006"," Genuinely Scary Suspense Upheld With Wonderful Performances.
","""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a genuine suspense thriller that is sure to satisfy anyone who enjoys a good old crime thriller. Jodie Foster brilliantly plays Clarice Starling, a strong willed, ""tough girl type"" FBI trainee, whose job is to track down a notorious serial killer by the name of ""Buffalo Bill"", who is kidnapping and slaying young women in the area. While investigating, in hopes of finding the killer, Clarice meets Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), an incarcerated, blood-thirsty cannibal who holds information as to the whereabouts of Buffalo Bill. Clarice and Hannibal begin to form a strange relationship as she seeks him for help to find the serial killer and stop him before he kills his latest victim.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best and most sophisticated crime thrillers I've seen, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is an excellent movie. To begin, the performances are what really shine here. Both Foster and Hopkins are award-worthy (and I believe Hopkins won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the malevolent Hannibal Lecter). Jodie Foster is completely believable in her role as the intelligent heroine, and really has the audience sympathizing with her. On the other hand is Lecter, wonderfully played by Hopkins - his character is one scary guy, I definitely wouldn't want to be near him. Their chemistry in the film is amazing, and the conversational scenes between them, both of them separated by bars or a glass wall, are tense and brilliantly acted. The performances all around are simply top-notch.<br/><br/>The plot itself is an intriguing one at that, and I liked the relationship that was formed between the FBI agent and the serial killer - it's all really interesting. Then, there's the serial killer that is the sole reason that Clarice has any relation to Lecter - because Lecter has information that could help her. The gender-bending Buffalo Bill is shown throughout the movie, kidnapping women, and the viewers get an insight into his bizarre world, mostly shown in his underground ""chamber"" under his house, where he skins and stores his victims, dead and alive, and wears their skins. The finale in the pitch-black basement/lair between Clarice and Buffalo Bill is genuinely terrifying, and will surely have you on the edge of your seat. Really one of the creepiest scenes that I've seen in a movie.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that you won't want to miss. The performances alone are enough reason to watch this film, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are absolutely amazing. On top of that, it is a truly scary film and one of the most suspense-ridden thrillers out there. A definite must see. 10/10."
"Science_Fantasy_Guy","10","3","5","12 August 2005"," Take notes
","Every once in a while, a film is released which revives its dead genre. In the early '90s, for the horror/thriller genre, The Silence of the Lambs was that film. After a tribe of awful horror flicks (e.g. 1988's Child's Play) with recycled story lines like serial killers hunting dumb teens, The Silence of the Lambs took the serial killer movie to a new level.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs swept the 1991 Academy Awards, becoming only the third film in history - after 1934's It Happened One Night and 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - to win all five major categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), and the first horror movie to win Best Picture. This is a tremendous achievement when it was released more than 12 months before, considering the Academy's notoriously short attention span. Each award was well deserved, with Best Director Jonathan Demme both marvellously pulling off the most gripping scenes and never losing sight of the human element of the picture, Best Actor Anthony Hopkins and Best Actress Jodie Foster both delivering unforgettable performances as the dangerously intelligent cannibal serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter and the less-than-perfect but strong willed rookie FBI Agent Clarice Starling, and Ted Tally's Best Adapted Screenplay both delivering snappy, quotable dialogue (""Oh, and Senator, one more thing: LOVE your suit!"") and perfectly tapping into the mind of a serial killer.<br/><br/>This is the horror film that they all want to be, but almost all of them won't. I've only ever seen one other that is in quite the same league as this, and that is The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shyamalan must have watched TSOTL about 12 times while making that film). This groundbreaking masterpiece of horror is the standard by which all other horror movies are measured, and it is indeed the film that for which Hopkins, Foster and Demme will all be remembered. <br/><br/>10/10."
"mhajs","10","3","5","8 August 2005"," Few movies need few words like The Silence Of The Lambs.
","**** out of ****<br/><br/>Awesome would say it all. This movie is brilliant as it shows two actors in great performances like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. But these two have become so overrated, that we even, sometimes, may forget the others from the great cast, like Ted Levine, Anthony Heald and Brooke Smith, all of them in great performances. I tried to watch this movie for the second time without anything nearby disturbing me like sounds, phone conversations and lights turning on and off. Glad I am as those things didn't happen the first time I watched it, so I could absorb the movie quite well. In conditions like that, I became completely frozen when I saw Hannibal Lecter for the first time, on screen, standing up, still, in that green prisoner outfit, in his prison cell, saying only ""Good Morning"".<br/><br/>Well, Hopkins has proved himself he can deliver quite a good performance, whether he stands still or not, whether he's silence of not. The movie features many brilliant scenes like Lecter's escape from his cell in the police department, his conversations with Agent Clarice Starling and the breathtaking few scenes of Catherine Martin screaming for being held hostage by the never ending sinister psychopath, Buffalo Bill, played by Levine.<br/><br/>The Silence Of The Lambs' plot is one many people might already know. But this review, of course, like all my others, are intended to be read by people who have already watched the movie. Foster goes on an assignment to meet Hannibal Lecter and take from him clues in order to catch the assassin. But Lecter gives Starling the chance for them to perform the ""quid pro quo"", which suggests that whenever he gives her information, she will have to tell him about her life. This makes character developing take place in most of the entire movie.<br/><br/>This won 5 Oscars, as I think it deserved. The only thing I didn't like in it was when Foster withdrew her pistol in order to arrest Buffalo Bill, as she did it very slow, a minus for a winning performance like Foster's. But that's the only bad thing about this movie. What counts is the presence of professional people like Foster, Hopkins, Smith, Levine, and of course, the director Jonathan Demme."
"sandeepjoseph","9","3","5","5 August 2005"," eternally scary, and one for the library, definitely
","I found this film extremely scary and haunting, even though the actual violence wasn't overpowering by today's standards. In some ways, the suspense and the build-up to scenes is quite ""old school"" and proves that this approach still works. There are has been a lot of analysis why this film is so powerful. One talks about how Hannibal Lecter only appears for a very brief time in the movie, yet others talk about him and build him up, how some of the set pieces refer to our deep psychological fears...in the end, it works well, and I would highly recommend it. I have read critics who say that the killer Clarice is pursuing is too stereotypical, or simplistic. I would beg to differ: I find that that character too is quite scary, though doesn't have the three-dimensional nature of Hannibal Lecter. And what of Clarice? she is brave, and even though it was made in the 90s, I think this film is still one of the first I saw with a woman as lead detective. Full marks to the script, and the book of course, because Clarice is quite fallible, not perfect, and this makes the story more real and unsettling. We're fighting in her corner, as it were, but we're not sure if she will win, unlike other male-dominated movies. And one personal quirk: watch out for Tom Petty's song, ""American Girl"", I found the usage interesting, fun and ironic, and the song has stuck in my head post the movie."

Even though Hannibal is incarcerated for most of the movie, you feel that he is in total control. Hannibal gives Clarice clues thru the movie, to solve the ""Buffalo Bill"" case, and to help her advance her career and deal with her psychological problems. In effect he becomes her psychiatrist behind bars, interesting. Watch for their third meeting, where Hannibal's head seems to be floating on the reflective glass, really creepy !

Great Directing by Jonathan Demme and OUTSTANDING Editing by Craig McCay, take you into the world of Starling and Lechter, but will not let you totally escape from their presence, not a safe movie !!! <br/><br/>There are a few flaws, as to how Lechter gets the pen, or how he knows where to phone Clarice, but they are minor.<br/><br/>Ted Levine should have gotten Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, this role could have typecast his career.<br/><br/>This movie should be viewed by Adults ONLY !!!

","The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most frightening yet intense and intelligent films from the early nineties. The casting of Sir Anthony Hopkins as the evil Dr. Hannibal Lector was a perfect choice and he won an Academy Award for his 16 minutes of airtime. Jodie Foster deserved her second Academy Award for Best Leading Actress in this film. Jodie's Clarice Starling is perhaps one of the best female heroine roles of all time. I enjoyed watching this film again on AMC with tidbits of information on the bottom of the screen about the film-making. I would have like to have seen more Diane Baker on screen. I would have like to have known more about Dr. Lector's past too. The film always packs a punch when you least expect it at the end of the film. Besides great acting, directing, and writing, there is something unforgettable about this film. You walk away wondering about why this happens and about the monsters inside of them."
"Silverzero","10","3","5","21 March 2003"," Intense, gruesome and complex but a tad overrated horror/thriller.
","The film that began the world famous Hannibal Lector character is a very good one indeed. But I don't think that it lives up to the full quantity of its hype. The two leads deserved the Oscars they won back in 1991 but I don't think that the film deserved any more than that.<br/><br/>
Nonetheless, the quality of acting from these two leads is outstanding. At 28 she was already an accomplished actress so Jodie Foster perfectly captures the role of hesitantly determined detective Clarice Starling. It's hard to believe that the Hannibal Lector part was offered to so many other actors before Anthony Hopkins was rightfully offered the role. He creates one of the most memorable movie characters of the 20th Century and is brilliant for the part.<br/><br/> It's a shame that the same can't be said about the rest of the performances. Ted Levine, one of the most overlooked actors in the past 20 years, never receives any conviction in his role, offers us no motive, and is just plain dull in his part. No background is offered to his character and is much inferior to Ralph Fiennes character in the recently made prequel, `Red Dragon'. Scott Glenn soon gave up `the method' after he proved to be a dud. Apparently, he sat in a room for hours everyday listening to the sounds of killers torturing their victims, so he could prepare for the role. Too bad that what we see on screen is something less professional.<br/><br/>
One thing that the film does succeed in doing is intensifying scenes so as you don't know what will happen next. It gets gratuitously visceral in some scenes to try and be humane, but just looks gruesome and unattractive. While the story is complex and the film ends so as most people will be satisfied, I didn't see much else of `sheer brilliance' about it.<br/><br/>
Maybe it's just me or maybe this is a needlessly overrated film. But still, `The Silence of the Lambs' is a very good horror/thriller that well outshines its disastrous sequel `Hannibal'. 7.5/10."

"jboothmillard","9","15","43","18 March 2005"," The Silence of the Lambs
","This is often cited and one of the greatest in its genre, more a thriller than a horror, featuring one of the most recognisable villains of all time, based on the book by Thomas Harris, directed by Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, Philadelphia, The Manchurian Candidate). Basically young FBI trainee agent Clarice Starling (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jodie Foster) is assigned by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), of the Behavioral Science Unit, to interview former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, aka Hannibal the Cannibal (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sir Anthony Hopkins). Lecter, being held in Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, has information about serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who skins the corpses of his female victims, Lecter is courteous, but hates Starling trying to dissect him. Lecter does tell Starling to seek out an old patient of his, later a cocoon containing a sphinx moth is found lodged in a victim's throat. Starling returns to Lecter, he agrees to give a physical description of Buffalo Bill, in exchange for him being transferred to a new facility, and away from Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), whom he detests. Crawford authorises a fake deal to be made with Lecter, meanwhile Buffalo Bill has kidnapped Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), daughter of U.S. Senator. Lecter demands a quid pro quo (""something for something"" in Latin) from Starling, in exchange for personal information about herself he will give her clues, so Starling tells him about her childhood and the murder of her father. Lecter is later flown to Memphis, Tennessee, there he verbally torments Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), before giving information about Buffalo Bill, some misleading, including the name ""Louis Friend"", an anagram of ""iron sulfide"", meaning fool's gold. Starling realises Lecter's deceit and asks for the truth from Lecter, now held in a cage-like cell, he tells that all information she needs is in the case file, rather than give a name. Lecter insists they continue quid pro quo, she recounts her traumatic childhood where spring lambs were being slaughtered, Lecter speculates saving Catherine will help her end the nightmares and the ""screaming of the lambs"". Lecter gives Starling back the case files on Buffalo Bill before they are interrupted and she is escorted out by police, later that night Lecter has taken a paper clip, uses it to uncuff himself, kills the guards, escapes from his cell and disappears, in fact using a guard's face and uniform to disguise himself. Starling examines the files and realises Buffalo Bill knew his first victim personally, going to the victim's hometown she discovers Buffalo Bill was a tailor, recognising his dress patterns as identical to his victims skins removed, she calls Crawford to inform him Buffalo Bill is fashioning a ""women suit"" of real skin. Crawford is already en route to make an arrest on a man named Jame Gumb, referenced in Lecter's notes and hospital archives, who once unsuccessfully applied for a sex-change, while Crawford leads an FBI tactical team to Gumb's address in Illinois, Starling interviews friends of Buffalo Bill's first victim in Ohio. The house in Illinois is empty, while Starling finds the house of ""Jack Gordon"", this is in fact Jamie Gumb, she recognises him as Buffalo Bill seeing a sphinx moth, she pursues him through the rooms of the basement, discovers Catherine alive, trapped in a dry well, then Starling is trapped in the dark, Gumb stalks her with night-vision goggles, but cocking his gun Starling instantly reacts and fires at Gumb, killing him. In the end Starling is given an FBI Academy graduation party, she is shocked to receive a phone call from Lecter, calling from an airport, he promises not to pursue her and asks she returns the favour, before hanging up he says he is ""having an old friend for dinner"", and follows newly arrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd. Also starring Candyman's Kasi Lemmons as Ardelia Mapp, Lawrence T. Wrentz as Agent Burroughs, Frankie Faison as Barney Matthews, Charles Napier as Lt. Boyle, singer Chris Isaak as SWAT Commander, Roger Corman as FBI Director Hayden Burke and George A. Romero as FBI Agent in Memphis. Hopkins deserved his Oscar for his brilliantly sinister 24 minutes on screen as the intelligent serial killer; Foster deserved her Oscar as the young agent slowly toughening up following the clues, and Levine is splendidly disturbing as the killer taking skins for his demented pleasure. The relationship between Starling and Lecter is wonderfully twisted, and the mystery element to find the killer works well, this film became a big hit, legendary for many reasons, it is definitely a great psychological thriller. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Film Score for Howard Shore, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Jodie Foster was number 23, and Sir Anthony Hopkins number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor, Clarice Starling was number 6 (Hero) and Hannibal Lecter was number 1 (Villain) on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""A census taker once tried to test me.

"SolNigerWithin333","1","9","23","13 April 2015"," Decent movie but WAY to overrated
","Came into this movie expecting to be scared out of my wits by Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) performance; a pretense resulting from many many top 10 lists of ""Chilling performances"" or ""Best movie Psychopaths "" boy was I let down. For the 90s it may have been unique and freaky, but i really couldn't attain what all the constant hype is about, yes there are some tense moments here and there but Lecters character is really inconsistently acted out for half of his screen time. Don't really believe in being pretentious in this context but if you payed attention to Lecters dialogue you would see one moment he is a to the core amoral being who does not feel one iota of sympathy for humanity and the next he is interested in some rookie FBI agents childhood and not to mention infatuated enough to create art pieces of her, excuse me if i am mistaken but this is a chronic sociopath who eats humans. I don't know if you've watched interviews with psychopaths or insane persons but i can assure you none of them behave the way Lecter does and please spare me the ""but that's what makes him so different and ""good"" "". The writers who came up with Lecters lines got way too artsy by letting their creative exhibition blanket the brutal reality the character was meant to portray. Lecter was intriguing and enigmatic for the first few minutes of his appearance but his mysteriousness and guise got completely obliterated as the writers gave too much away too quickly leaving nothing to further entice the viewer on the central character. Other major detractors regarding Lecter included the scene where he escapes a HIGH SECURITY complex SURROUNDED by ARMED and TRAINED personal which was supposedly ""blocked off for 10 block"" or something along those lines, keep in mind that Lecter had been locked in a cell for 8 years straight, talk about muscle atrophy right? the man suddenly had the strength to scale fences and walls while avoiding only a couple dozen patrols...<br/><br/>Buffalo Bill was just a medium for the movie creators to include shock material: close ups on his nipple ring, full nude frontal shot, dialogue of him saying he wants to copulate with himself and something about putting the lotion in the basket? the effect of that sentence was much more profound in South Park. Buffalo Bill was not even minutely interesting or relevant it just seems they added him their just to fill in some blanks and add in some really ""ewwy"" moments. <br/><br/>The ending scene where Lecter calls Starling is just a redundant and rubbish attempt to further strengthen the absolute awkward bond between relationship they had and also I'm guessing they wanted an excuse to include Lecter again before the credits rolled, I'm not sorry to say this but the only decent thing about the ending was when Lecter commented he was going to have ""dinner"" with his past captor. <br/><br/>The characters in this movie were just very poorly written and implemented, the acting was believable but thats not even 1/4 of what makes a movie ""good"". I know i missed out on Jodie Fosters character oh and could i go on but i really feel likes there are enough negatives here to indicate just how overly high rated this movie is . Lecter could have been portrayed so much more ferociously and searingly through presence and psychologically alone rather than having mens extremities ripped off or them beaten to a pulp. Joker from Christopher Nolans movie is probably the epitome of an antagonist with an unstable mental state (no I'm not a 13 year old emo who's favourite is unquestionably the joker) and i might even mention the main antagonist from I Saw the Devil that is also a very raw representation of how a psychopath might function in real life.<br/><br/>The Buffalo Bill character could have been implemented more naturally as opposed to having it seem like there are two points of focus in the movie (Lecter and Bill). The movie really needed to end on a much more satisfying note and don't get me wrong i have seen plenty of films where the ending is ambiguous but Silence Of The Lambs was just the protagonist receiving a phone call at a party and Lecter walking off into a crowd of people as Sarling sobs i mean come on it would have been better to just end it after Bill was slain. <br/><br/>I would give the movie 1/10 to ever so slightly balance the overall score but 7/10 for having some depth and substance to it despite being majorly overrated and just a mediocre film."

","This movie was amazing. The dialogue was witty, clever and sometimes chilling. The directing was beautiful and the acting was absolutely superb. Jodie Foster was great as the the FBI agent Clarice Starling who is on the trail of a serial killer. Foster was good but the star is of course the magnificent Anthony Hopkins who steels the show with his rolling eyes and taunting voice. Both actors deserved the Oscars awarded to them. So did the director Jonathon Demme. The story was great, the only clique was with the ending that has always bugged me. The movie is an intelligent chilling thriller and there was this great build up to something that didn't meet the audience's expectations. Besides that everything about this movie was perfect.

","Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) an FBI cadet is hired to try to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). He's a cannibal and VERY dangerous. Also there's a psychopath named Buffalo Bill kidnapping girls and skinning them alive. Lecter hints that he knows who Bill is and Clarice tries to find out...but Lecter is playing serious mind games with her. <br/><br/>I caught this back in 1991. I liked it but I thought Foster was just OK and I found the story pretty confusing with glaring lapses in logic. Seeing it now some 17 years later I still feel the same way. The film is somewhat slow and I wasn't that scared or upset by it. Also Foster (who's Southern accent comes and goes at an alarming rate) is just OK. I'm really surprised that she won the Oscar for this. PLOT SPOILER AHEAD!!!! There was also a lot of gay groups who complained that Buffalo Bill was a transsexual. As a gay guy I wasn't offended but other people were just horrified. END SPOILER!!! <br/><br/>Still the movie isn't a total washout. Hopkins is just superb as Lecter. He's downright terrifying at times. He's only on screen about a total of 30 minutes but you always feel his presence. Also his breakout (while completely illogical) is one of the scariest sequences I've ever seen. The whole movie is well-directed especially during the final sequence. Also it's the first horror film since 1932 to win an acting Academy Award. Heck, it won quite a few! Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Hopkins), Best Actress (Foster), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. So, it's a very good thriller worth catching...but Academy Award material? I think it was a little overpraised.<br/><br/>For horror fans there's an extra kick of seeing Roger Corman in a small role!<br/><br/>""...I'm having an old friend for dinner."""
"Leofwine_draca","10","7","17","11 May 2014"," The granddaddy of all serial killer flicks
","THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.<br/><br/>Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.<br/><br/>The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true masterpiece of a movie."

","Movie adaptations of novels, even pop bestsellers with the imagery masticated for us, are a tricky business to cinematically get right. Some find a good translation by falling backward into it, like ""Jaws"". Rare birds like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" transcend previous visual understandings, and overpower the written word. <br/><br/>You can include this movie with ""Presumed Innocent"" or ""...Cuckoo's Nest"": in each case, the wrong path was chosen. <br/><br/>The novel hinges on Lecter's perspective -- here Hopkins plays a mere boogey man. All we get is the cheap device of haunted houses. <br/><br/>In the novel, Lecter moves physically and psychologically wherever he wants: in Harris' words, 'as if he chose the distance' from the protagonist/detective. He occupies his own universe of perception, based mostly on sight and smell -- Demme might have really done something by recreating the world sensed by Lecter. Instead, he spends all of his time lovingly gazing into Foster's face. <br/><br/>If you want a better construction of a world, stay with ""Manhunter""."
"PeterZZ","10","7","17","9 July 2005"," The Lambs Can Never be Silenced
","If you want a movie to watch in the dark, look no further than The Silence of the Lambs. Jonathan Demme's tense thriller combines excellent actors and a wonderfully adapted screenplay to make, what seems to be one of the best, if not the best, thrillers of all time.<br/><br/>The film follows three main stories, those being that of rookie FBI agent, Clarice Starling, the psychopath murderer Buffalo Bill and imprisoned psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, imprisoned for murder and cannibalism. Clarice is sent to Dr. Lecter to attempt to gain information on Buffalo Bill, because he was a former patient of Hannibal, however all Hannibal is interested in is getting inside Clarice's head. As the film goes on Clarice becomes more deeply involved in the case, right up to the dramatic and excellent climax, as well as Hannibal becoming more deeply involved in Clarice's mind. Meanwhile Buffalo Bill continues his murderous spree, killing and skinning women.<br/><br/>This movie is like no other. It combines tenses scenes with a cast like no other. Anthony Hopkins was born to be Hannibal, and why Michelle Pfeiffer was originally suggested for the role of Clarice over Jodie Foster is bizarre, but because Jodie Foster got the role, it doesn't really matter. When it comes to violence this film is very intense. There are some graphically violent scenes, however the worst violence in the film is the mental violence. Hannibal's ability to destroy someone mentally, is incredibly disturbing, and the films motives are pretty full on. However this contributes to the films overall feel of horror, which is why The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most mentally frightening films of all time.<br/><br/>Stars: 10/10"
"jade-howells","9","4","8","1 October 2017"," A thriller that never fails to grip you after multiple watches
","*Very slight spoiler within the second paragraph, and big spoiler in third* Silence of the Lambs is a must watch for thriller fans all around, with a story that will entice you within the chase to catch a serial killer.<br/><br/>The plot involves Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) trying to catch a serial killer with the help of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), another serial killer already captured with insight into the case. The dynamic between Clarice and Hannibal is enthralling, with Clarice working through Hannibal's cryptic clues about the case and witnessing the growing interest Hannibal has in Clarice, especially as more of her personal life gets revealed to him and we have to wonder what he will do with the information he has obtained.<br/><br/>The tension within this film has to be one of the biggest strengths of the film. Every scene with Hannibal and Clarice has you feeling the tension as you become enthralled within every interaction. Special mention also has to go to a scene near the end of the movie, which I will just refer to as the ""night-vision scene"" which manages to make me worry for Clarice every time I see it despite knowing what will happen at the end.<br/><br/>One criticism of the film I have however is with Hannibal's involvement within the movie and how it's presented. The movie presents him as an intelligent and extremely manipulative and dangerous person. However, it seems like he only knows anything about this case because he just so happens to know about the serial killer and details about him already, so rather than him showing his intelligence. If you wanted a film which actually sees him working out who the serial killer is, then Red Dragon is probably the better film within this one instance. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Silence of the Lambs is a fantastic film, and certainly one of the strongest entries within the Hannibal franchise (this and the Hannibal TV show are neck and neck in quality), and the strongest within the movie entries."
"kamna-46423","9","4","8","29 September 2017"," Have the lambs stopped screaming?
","A masterful combination of acting, directing and writing. Storyline is very engaging. Hopkins did a extraordinary job in Dr. Lecter's shoes, who manages to make the ""cannibalistic psychopath"" kind of a hero. Jodie Foster makes Starling the most interesting to watch. The best part was portrayal of Lecter and Starling coming closer and closer in bizarre exchanges by making Starling to unveil her deep secrets, Lecter valued this relationship by not hurting her.

","I can't go beyond the positive reviews on this movie, so I won't try. Normally I'm very wary of pictures that win Picture of the Year, and a bunch of other Oscars. But this film is an exception (Unforgiven? Same year, more or less). I see people giving this movie a one star rating!?! Maybe it's just not their ""cup"", but come on! The quality of this film is off the scale. Some people just want to hate I guess. If this film doesn't hit you over your head like a bag of bricks, I don't know. Every time I see it I become more amazed. My sister would probably say... ""I didn't go to see it because it didn't look interesting to me when I saw the preview at the cinema"". She was so busy arranging her Super Jumbo popcorn, and her triple extra large Orange soda, she didn't pay much attention probably. She was there to see... I don't know... ""Pretty Woman""? Or ""some such crap"". Was that out at that time? Who cares? I once asked her if she had seen ""Pulp Fiction"" yet. Her reply? You guessed it boys and girls.... ""No, because it didn't look interesting to me"". Busy digging into her popcorn during the previews, I guess. You see she's big as a Hippo, with a brain the size of a common garden pea. There's no ""love lose"" there folks. Love her as a sister, but does not get it when it comes to movies. Probably has not missed a Disney animated movie ever. To each his own I guess.

"Sunnyrose1","10","4","8","10 July 2016"," Utterly mesmerizing !
","One of the best films i have ever watched in my life ! I loved Jodie Foster as the young FBI cadet Clarice Starling and found Anthony Hopkins to be the perfect match for the mysterious, intelligent and frightening character of Hannibal ''The Cannibal'' Lecter. Their chemistry is undeniable. I continuously found myself captivated by the never ending chase between Hannibal and Clarice. Through the horror one finds the beauty that has always been of an interest and in my opinion will continue to be, to us poor souls. Yet I wouldn't suggest this movie for someone who although likes a bit of romance, is scared to death and tries to avoid horror films like the plague, as it contains quite scary parts. Hannibal Lecter is a very peculiar character which requires equally brilliant watchers so as to fully appreciate his riveting and compelling beauty, motives and way of thinking.Quid pro quo fans."
"brianberta","9","4","8","9 July 2016"," One of the best horror films
","When hearing about how terrifying Hannibal Lecter is, one would likely be confused after they look up reviews which explain why he works so well. It's really hard to do what Anthony Hopkins did in this film. While most other actors' performances would be likely dismissed as bland and boring, Hopkins nailed his performance so well that he rightfully earned his place amongst the very best movie villains ever put to screen.<br/><br/>A serial killer who goes by the name of ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnaps and kills women to skin them and make them into coats. An F.B.I. cadet named Clarice Starling has to confide in a cannibalistic serial killer locked up in prison to help her locate him before he kills someone who he recently captured, Catherine Martin.<br/><br/>When the viewer is first introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Starling is walking down an ominous hallway. She walks past other criminals locked up. The first few she walk by behave as you would expect. One is smiling and saying ""Hi"" to her, and the last one is jumping up at the prison bars. When she gets to the end of the hall, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is standing up and facing her with a blank expression on his face. He is still and motionless. He says ""Good morning"" to her calmly. He seems harmless. As Starling continues to talk to him, the viewer has a minor sense of relief for what the film could've thrown at us, but Hopkins' voice gives the viewer a feeling of deception which makes that sense of relief vanish. This is the first time we're introduced to him, and Lecter is able to unnerve the viewer so much by conveying so little. The great scripting and great acting made him quite a memorable character.<br/><br/>Seeing his calmer moments on screen are very memorable. However, it leaves you wondering what he's capable of. Eventually, about 2/3 of the way into the film, the viewer gets to see Lecter pop in one of the most horrifying and memorable horror movie scenes of all time. The scene is so unexpected, and the sheer creativity of it is out-and-out disgusting to even think about. Watching the film a second time, it's frightening to find out what could've happened to Clarice Starling if their calm meetings had played out differently. However, it becomes very apparent that he wouldn't harm her as he grows to value her company. He never threatens her, and he always acts helpful and nice to her. Also, after he finds out how they both share similar childhood wounds, the viewer loses suspicion that he'll do something bad to her. Also, it took me a little while to pinpoint how that was a very effective piece of dialogue which got me to actually identify with Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>It's a great accomplishment that the film gets us to like Hannibal Lecter. The reason is because he helps Starling locate Buffalo Bill which would also save Catherin Martin from him in the process, and he proves to be very helpful to her throughout the film. Also, the audience senses that he won't hurt her. On top of that, Hopkins performance brings wit and style to the character. The character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter succeeds on so many different levels.<br/><br/>There are several scenes from the film which work very well at terrifying the viewer. The scene when ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnaps Catherine Martin is a believable technique which seems like it would work in real life. It shows how after you get too close to ""Buffalo Bill"" for too long, you would reach a point of no return, and by the time you realize that something bad is going to happen, it would already be too late.<br/><br/>One of the most memorable kill scenes from horror movies happens near the final 1/3 of the film. I won't spoil it, but it works very well. Earlier in the film, it hinted that something was up after he stole a character's pen. Once you realize what's going to happen, you're left waiting for Lecter to pop as you've waited to see for a long time. The scene is very gory, and the aftermath of it is even more sickening. When you think that the scene's finally over, the film pulls the rug out from under you, and it shows you a creative, yet highly appalling image which likely won't leave your head anytime soon.<br/><br/>The scene at the end in Buffalo Bill's was an amazing idea for a climax. It is so suspenseful, and as soon as it starts, you have minimal hope that it will turn out good. Then, director Jonathan Demme adds in one final aspect into the movie to up the tension so high that it's one of the most suspenseful climax's ever for a film. He makes it seem clear that Starling won't go home unless she either gets a miracle or gets badly injured in the process. This scene is terrifying, because of the film's clever manipulation of the visuals and the fact that we've come to really like Starling, and we don't want anything to happen to her.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is definitely a masterpiece, and it's one of the best horror films of all time. Anthony Hopkins' performance was perfect, and this movie should be looked at and studied off of for years to come. Other horror movie directors should study off of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and many actors should definitely try to do what he did. After the viewer witnesses all of the pros that this movie has to offer, it leaves you a brilliant closing scene which lets you go off on a high note. Anyways, I do wish that I could talk about this film longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner."

","The film ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has changed a lot, above all, our standards. The audience drastically changed their view of the concept of a good thriller. Balanced center of gravity was found on the graphical violence but also the intellectual and psychological rally, where there was essentially what we are already showing what is sketchy, with the potential to happen. With each repeated viewing, we recognize the key elements behind the facade fascinating serial killer in order to discover a whole range of people of different walks of life, crossed in a single unattractive existence. Almost twenty-two years since first screening, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" remains the definition of thriller of our time. Too bad Jonathan Demme did not direct not nearly as good as this that today is undoubtedly a classic."
"mgruebel","9","4","8","13 June 2015"," Superb Psycho-Thriller
","Director Jonathan Demme and author/screenwriter Harris/Tally are all very talented, but they really outdid themselves here. The more I watch this film, the better it gets. Just the close-up shots of Hannibal Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) and Clarisse Starling's (Jodie Foster) faces.<br/><br/>I recently saw it for the 5th time with my daughter, who saw it for the 1st time. She was on the edge of her seat just as I remember, while I enjoyed the deft plotting, the great characterization, even of side-characters (like the self-absorbed psychiatrist Chilton), who were painted with sparse but knowing strokes.<br/><br/>Hopkins and Foster are just perfectly cast, doing the perfect mannerisms, the perfect accents, the perfect everything. The supporting cast is also outstanding, from Starling's boss, who uses her as bait to engage dangerous psychopath Lecter to solve a serial murder case, to the unpleasant psychiatrist Chilton, to the victim held captive in a pit by the serial killer, all the way to the psychopathic serial killer who is sowing himself a female identity out of his victim's skins.<br/><br/>The clues abound, and while obvious in hindsight, are subtle enough to be interesting: Southeast Asian moth = criminal is a Vietnam War veteran. Seamstress patterns in closets to reveal where the perpetrator must have learned the sowing trade.<br/><br/>Although the gore is very sparse in this film, it is really shocking, and built up just right to cause maximum suspense and ""yech"" factor. The director manages to make you wince even when you don't get to see all that much.<br/><br/>So why ""only"" 9/10? After many viewings, I think more and more that the cutting between Starling and her boss at the end, when he enters the wrong house, is too cheap a trick to show that he ended up tracking the wrong person. Likewise, the ""break into the storage"" scene lays on the difficulties with forced entry a bit much. Hitchcock would have stayed away from such low-grade suspense devices. Sometimes less is more. Still, this film is better than a few of the grandmaster's thrillers, and that's saying something coming from a fan who saw his first Hitch while the grandmaster was still filming them!"
"JSValentine","10","4","8","4 March 2015"," Stunning and unforgettable cinema
","Now over twenty years old, Silence of the Lambs is still one of the most intriguing films ever made. Ambitiously blurring the lines between the genres of horror, psychological thriller and crime drama, Silence is intense but not overpowering, and complex without ever losing sight of its grand narrative. <br/><br/>As with all great films, many components come together to create a masterpiece; excellent screenplay, directing, cinematography and musical score to name but a few. However for me, the acting is what makes Silence the unforgettable experience that it is. Jodie Foster's portrayal of the young and inexperienced FBI agent instructed to investigate the actions of a serial killer is as flawless as acting can be, inspiring many later performances from actresses in similar roles, and providing the audience with a first person narrative to stabilise some of the more horror-centred segments of the film. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lecter is equally magnificent. Despite appearing in less than a quarter of the film. his combination of intensity, calculated calmness and slow-burning character development without ever truly revealing the character's true history or even motivations, the audience is presented with, in my opinion, one of the greatest psychopath film characters of all time, breaking stereotypes of violent and out-of-control villains and creating something far more terrifying.<br/><br/>It is the lack of prolonged scenes of graphic violence, blood and torture that give Silence its edge over almost all other horror films. It is unassuming when watched for the first time, and slowly becomes increasingly fascinating, impossible to watch and not become totally immersed into this world which is, after all, the real purpose of fiction. <br/><br/>A timeless classic that will never lose its terrifying yet understated charm or relentless quest to redefine chilling and breathtaking cinema, this is a film that the viewer will dwell on long after the credits roll."
"jb_campo","10","4","8","19 June 2014"," One of the best murder mystery thrillers you will ever see
","I first saw Silence when it came out in late 1991. A friend and I saw it, and left the theater stunned. It was the first time I have ever had trouble sleeping after watching a movie, so impactful was the content.<br/><br/>Silence is flawless in all aspects. Casting, screenplay/plot, direction, cinematography, and editing are superb. By now, we are all familiar with Dr Lector (Anthony Hopkins), the deranged, brilliant psychologist who does battle with the forces of good, here represented by the FBI's Clarice Starling (Jody Foster. Perhaps her last great role). Hopkin's performance is a tour de force of acting. He uses words like knives to stab at Clarice, exposing her checkered past, extracting information that he stores to dig into her later on. And Clarice, a young FBI agent with strong experience in psychology, is clearly overmatched by Dr Lector. They play a back and forth cat and mouse game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.<br/><br/>Excellent casting includes the sanitarium head, Dr Chilton (Anthony Heald) who plays this sleazy Head who covets having Dr Lector as his prize while clumsily trying to snag a date with Clarice. Scott Glenn portrays Dr Crawford, Clarice's boss whom she looks up to. He has his own demons he's dealing with that are never fully revealed, and the father-mentor interaction between him and Clarice is palpable. Finally, there's the other evil force, excellently played by Ted Levine.<br/><br/>There is a significant amount of killing, and some very viscerally evil scenes that are not for the squeamish. You will be moved, so if you are not good with strong physical scenes, you may want to close your eyes a lot. But you must see this film. The final piece is the editing and directing, which weaves every scene together so it all adds up and makes sense at the end, kind of like in Forest Gump, but with evil intent, not kindness.<br/><br/>This film was one of those rare gems that even the Oscars got right by awarding it the triple crown of Oscars - Best picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It also won best screenplay. If you have not seen this movie, it's a must-see that you should put on your list. Make sure you are prepared for the darkness of evil portrayed so brilliantly in the Silence of the Lambs. Enjoy."

I love movies that can scare me and some of the greatest are great because of creepy atmosphere that creeps up on you and grabs you and throws you into a world where everything is mysterious and scary. This is one of those movies. Dr. Clarice Starling's (Jodie Foster) tale of finding the killer Buffalo Bill with the aid of the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is a creepy, well acted, and not for the faint of heart film that has many thrills in store for the viewer. The greatest thing that this film has to offer is the atmosphere. It's engrossing. The dark hallways,and the unblinking eyes of Hannibal Lector shake you to your core. That alone without the well done mystery could make the movie. Oh, but it is a good mystery. Jodie Foster is Clarice Starling a new FBI psychiatrist who is ordered to interview the cannibal Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) for the purpose of finding a killer. Foster's character is optimistic and more upbeat. This is good because of the dark nature of the rest of the film. She's kind of like the balance for the creepy stuff happening, and light in the darkness. That also kind of help her character. See she's optimistic at first, but as time goes on she seems to fall deeper and deeper into this world her character changes to someone more hardened. This is perfect character development. Then there is Anthony Hopkins. This is one of my favorite performances of all time. He is unblinking,scary and smart. It's unsettling. Hopkins said that the way he played Hannibal Lecter was still. I now know why. See people are always moving and doing something. Lecter is completely still and extremely soft spoken. Even more menacing is that Lecter is actually smarter than Clarice. He outsmarts her. This just adds to the fact of how menacing he is. He's not the villain though. The real villain is a creepy transvestite murderer named Buffalo Bill. His story arch is interesting, but it comes to an abrupt close. He is scary none the less and is also a little weird. I mean a transvestite whoÂ… I'd rather not write it. It's messed up and the details will shock you. The actors really do drive the story and everything comes off very shocking and convincing. For better or worse.<br/><br/>The acting is really good,but so is everything else. The production design in this movie is grounded in reality,but still is creepy. The prison set that was built for the film looks very good and the darkness of the whole this adds to the atmosphere and makes everything pop. The camera-work is good, but also nothing special, yet at moments the camera having a staring contest with the wide eyes of Hannibal Lecter add to the sheer unsettling nature of the film.<br/><br/>This is overall an incredible movie. Scary, atmospheric, and chalk full of performances that are Oscar worthy (and won Oscars). I give The Silence of the Lambs a 9.8 out of 10 Seriously though it's really messed up."

"toblessed2001","9","4","8","3 May 2014"," Silence of the Lambs, an emotional ride of disbelief and terror
","The 1991 suspense thriller, Silence of the Lambs, finds Clarice Starling, actress Jodi Foster, as a student at the FBI academy in Virginia. She's been chosen by her instructor, actor Lawrence Bonney, due to her noticeable keen senses, to visit with Dr. Hannibal Lecter, actor Anthony Hopkins, an incarcerated murderer. The intention is that Starling can use Lecter's insight into the mind of a murderer to find Buffalo Bill, actor Ted Levine, a serial killer whose victims are young girls.<br/><br/>The theme of this film is control or power. In the film Clarice Starling is controlled by her drive to succeed as an FBI agent. She also has not found the power to control her memories of her childhood and the screaming of the lambs, which through her dealings with Dr. Lector she realizes. Ironically Dr. Lector himself, through his ability to manipulate minds, is perfectly able to control any and all situations; even through his incarceration has the power to affect others. Buffalo Bill on the other hand believes himself to be a transsexual and had been turned down for sex change surgeries from all major hospitals in the area. Therefore, his only way to express his control was by abducting young girls and murdering them and using their skin to create a woman's body. Ironically enough there is a pattern here. The majority of the power and control struggles are between Clarice and the men throughout her life and the story line, and with Buffalo Bill and his sexuality, and the young girls that he kills. <br/><br/>The lighting and the angles used in the basement scene where Agent Starling was in the home of Buffalo Bill attempting to arrest him also aided to the theme of control. Buffalo Bill had shut off the lighting to the basement, leaving Starling unable to see a thing. Consequently, Buffalo Bill had on night goggles and was able to see every move Starling made. A terrified Starling scrambled around the basement, although blinded, searching for Bill. Finally, the simple sound of the trigger of Bill's gun being pulled back was all it took for Starling to locate bill and shoot the deadly shots that ended his terror (Bloch 1960). The overall lighting of the scenes throughout the film also aided to the theme of control. Early on the scenes tend to be more dark and dismal, but it seemed as though as Clarice gained more control, by having increased confidence, more insight, more acknowledgment from Crawford, and more trust from Lector, and got closer to solving the crime, the lighting itself became brighter throughout. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie is to find a missing girl in West Virginia and to end serial killer Buffalo Bill's rampage. Special agent Jack Crawford, actor Scott Glenn, chose Cadet Clarice Starling for the task of interviewing a psychotic murderer Dr. Hannibal Lector in hopes that he could aid in the arrest of Buffalo Bill. Throughout the film Starling runs into obstacles and snares that seem to stand in her way, however her drive in solving the crime is stronger than those things standing in her way. One such obstacle is Dr. Frederick Chilton, actor Anthony Heald. Dr. Chilton is, to me, a little squeaky, weasel type character. He is out for self gain only and is trying to use Lector and his knowledge for his own benefit. Ultimately, Dr. Chilton met his doom in the end of the film by none other than Dr. Lector himself. After a botched attempt, at the direction of Jack Crawford, to find the most recent missing girl, Crawford and Starling were not permitted to speak to Lecter further. However that did not stop her from attempting to find and speak to him in attempt to find the killer. Although the male FBI agents had their leads, Starling had her own, and she was the one that ultimately solved the case.<br/><br/>I can compare the theme of control and power of this film to that of Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho. This film also has heavy displays of gender and power. The circumstances that stand out to me most are that of mental illness displayed in both films, the way that Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill have similar conflicts and are somewhat trapped in their roles and act out in a sinister way. There is one particular scene that I recall that immediately brought to mind the comparison of the two films. The scene where they were reviewing pictures of some of Buffalo Bill's victims showed a young girl lying face down, naked. Her eyes were wide open (Bloch 1960), and as they showed a close up of that picture I instantly saw the shower scene where Janet Lee lay on the bathroom floor, eyes wide open, and the shower water running (Bloch, 1960).<br/><br/>Overall, I rate this movie very high. The suspense thriller allows the viewer to enter into the minds of Agent Starling, Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill. It exhibits the affects of control and power, be it strong and weak, psychologically stable or unstable, educated or uneducated, male or female. Silence of the Lambs, takes us on an emotional ride of disbelief and terror as we see the story unfold."

I also love Jodie Foster, she's not some kind of barbie girl and I like that. She has a personality. It's one of the best movies ever. It's honestly legendary. It's the best part of the trilogy, really. The others are kind of wanna bes, of course, Hannibal is amazing but it's not the same.<br/><br/>I love all of the actors and actresses.

","Although everybody praises the performance of Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins, this films gets a lot criticism for the same reasons.

I don't know if I'm really the only one but this movie was not about the horror, nor the gross/creepy factor. This movie was yet another movie about life. That's all. This movies is quite an experience. And although some say that Foster's acting was not good... her performance was convincing for me.<br/><br/>This is, in fact, an all around great movie. It has a plot that keeps you not only entertained, but also glued to the screen, seeking answers. It has great acting. It has various lines of moral lessons. It has charming characters, and cliché filled villains (Dr. Chilton is actually a villain, didn't know if you guys... like... you know). This is definitely a must watch for all times.

"patherwill","10","4","8","11 May 2013"," One of my Top Twenty Ever Movies!
","Over 20 years after I first saw this film I have now decided to put 'pen to paper' so to speak and praise what I think is one of the most gripping murder movies made, with a host of actors from Jodie Foster, Scott Glenn,Anthony Heald, Ted Levine - who was a relative newcomer then - and of course Anthony Hopkins firmly at the top of their game. Everyone knows the story by now of how Clarice Starling(Foster) has not yet passed-out of the FBIs famous academy at Quantico when and where she is under the close supervision of one of its chiefs Jack Crawford(Glenn)and they are on the hunt for a serial-killer 'Buffalo Bill'. They or perhaps SHE seeks the assistance of Dr.Hannibal Lekter, a brilliant but disturbed criminal killer himself and she has intimate talks with him in his cell to garner information she hopes will help find 'Bill' before he kills more innocent young women in his most deranged and brutal way mutilating them. The only criticism I saw throughout the film was the plausibility of the situation Foster finds herself in towards the very end and whether that would be possible? I don't know - I 'm NOT in the FBI and having read the 'Trivia' I think this has been explained. Other than that, a brilliant film that just keeps delivering and when I saw it recently on Spanish TV for about the 5th time it was just as good as when I first saw it and there are very few films that you can say THAT about!"
"mrsOGB","10","4","8","31 October 2012"," In like a Lamb out like a Lion
","I was about 12 the first time I saw this movie. I was at home with my older sister and it creeped me out. I remember she had to explain some of the scenes to me as I was only 12 and maybe a little young to watch it (but our parents always let us watch movies that as an adult looking back now, am shocked they did). Love the ""feel"" of this movie - dark, dingy and cold. Anthony Hopkins is amazing. Very chilling, but you can't help but like him. Watching this as an adult still gives me the creeps. Its a way better alternative at this time of year than a horror movie. The sequels are OK-only worth watching because of Hopkins. But this is a classic."
"chums878","10","4","8","21 October 2012"," Thrill Ride
","Anthony Hopkins is just wild in his Academy Award winning performance. I find it amazing that I was getting chills up my spine just from watching him play Lecter. This is the best of his Lecter performances, as the other movies, Hannibal and Red Dragon lack storyline and he needed a strong character like Jodie Foster who is incredible. Clarice is a vulnerable character that pulls off a believable FBI trainee. You believe she has the strength to do the job but are constantly concerned for her safety. Jodie Foster is as always and incredible actor. The scenes with Foster and Hopkins are undeniably the strength of this movie. Hopkins picks away at Foster's inner demons, forcing her to open up her troubling past. In exchange, he reveals more and more information on the identity of a notorious serial killer. Foster's desperation does nothing to budge Hopkins from his request, and her vulnerability is more and more present as their scenes progress. They are both remarkable in this movie. A classic thriller of a movie that never lets up on the suspense."

"Diego_rjc","10","4","8","9 March 2010"," The perfect psychological thriller
","'The Silence of the Lambs'. This movie literally made cinema's history in the evening of March, 30th, 1992. It was Oscar's night, and Jonathan Demme's thriller went home with all the five major awards - Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, becoming only the third movie is history to ever achieve this accomplishment (the other ones are 1934 Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' and 1975 Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'). And the Academy was perfectly right, as 'The Silence of the Lambs' is easily the best movie of 1991 and one of the best thrillers of all-time. It deserved all the awards it got.<br/><br/>'The Silence of the Lambs' is based on one of Thomas Harris' novels about serial-killer Hannibal Lecter. But Lecter only appears in the movie within 13 minutes of runtime. Before that, we are presented to the movie's major plot, that is centered around Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster). Clarice is a young FBI agent that is assigned to the case of Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), a serial killer that skins his victims and then throws them in a river. But in order to gather information for the case, Clarice must talk to Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the most feared and dangerous serial killer in the world. The story here doesn't have a lot of originality, but the way the movie explains it to the audience is simply amazing. The character development is incredible, the dialogs are outstanding and the montages are breath-taking. I couldn't blink not even for one second, which proves how good the writing is. The first of the five major Oscars was certainly very well-deserved. Thumbs up for Thomas Harris for the novel and for Ted Tally for the excellent adaptation.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the acting, and there is only one thing to say about it: it couldn't be any better. The whole supporting cast is outstanding, with the exception of Brooke Smith, as one of Buffalo Bill's victims. She was just average, nothing special to it. But the member of the supporting cast that stands out is certainly Ted Levine. He should have been at least Oscar-nominated for his performance as Buffalo Bill, a quite creepy interpretation. Aside from the supporting cast, also composed by Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald, all the attention here goes for the two leading roles. Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are perfect, specially Hopkins. Even though he has only 27 minutes of screen-time, Hopkins managed to deliver one of the most memorable performances of the 1990's decade. All his gestures, that creepy coolness, the tones his voice reaches... it's all perfect for the character. None other actor could have done a better job, another very well-deserved Oscar. The other leading role here goes to Jodie Foster. Of course she is not as great as Anthony Hopkins, but she also delivers a very memorable performance. Her naiveness, the hidden South accent, her desperate struggle to impress her superiors - Clarice Starling and Jodie Foster are only one. Again, a deserved Oscar award - this time for Best Actress.<br/><br/>The fourth Oscar award this movie received was Best Director for Jonathan Demme. And the guy really impresses you on his directing work. The movie wouldn't be the same nor it would have the same recognition if it wasn't for him. The places Demme puts the camera are excellent, as he did it for the audience to feel in the skin of Clarice Starling. And in order to do this, Demme makes all the characters look straight into the camera, except for Clarice, that never does this, always looking at another direction. There are also a few scenes (most tracking-shots) designed to be like the the eyes of Clarice. And her childhood memories only increases the audience's approach to Jodie Foster's character. Another deserved Oscar-award.<br/><br/>The movie was also Oscar-nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing. The Sound here is nothing out of the ordinary, with nice Sound Effects, but a lousy musical score. Nothing that takes away the movie's accomplishments, tough. As for Best Editing, it should have got the award. Craig McKay's editing work is outstanding, as the audience is fooled to believe in things that turn out to be others. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but you are gonna feel pretty dumb once you find out the tricks McKay used. The cinematography here is also nothing out of the ordinary, such as the other aspects. Nothing that's worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Overral, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is the perfect psychological thriller. The fact it won all the five major awards at the Oscars only proves my point, and they were all extremely well-deserved. The writing is amazing, the acting is perfect, and the directing is outstanding. You put that with one of the most memorable performances of the decade by Anthony Hopkins, join with a great editing work, ferocious dialogs and an impressive directing, and you have the best movie of 1991. From all the five major awards, the last one was the most well-deserved: Best Picture.<br/><br/>10/10"

","'The Silence of The Lambs' is a great example of how powerful a film can be when the director, writer, actors, cinematographers and the rest of the crew put their best into something. No one associated with the movie thought that it would win so many awards. The intention was to bring Thomas Harris's excellent chiller on screen. Ted Tally's screenplay is terrific as it forms a structured outline and sets a gloomy tone. Moreover the dialogues are scintillating. Demme's stupendous direction is what makes this meticulously crafted thriller one of a kind. The suspense is well built and the Demme carefully peels the layer relying on subtle cues and conspicuous symbolism. For example, the prison really manages to create that claustrophobic feel.<br/><br/>'The Silence of The Lambs' is one of the very few thrillers where everything works. The cinematography deserves special mention. The fastidious closeups, long shots and the actors talking to the camera are formidable. The score contributes to the chilling glum atmosphere<br/><br/>The acting by the main cast is splendiferous. In spite of his small screen time, Anthony Hopkins has a very dominating presence and it is no unknown fact that his Hannibal Lecter remains one of the most memorable characters on screen. Jodie Foster is sublime. In a way, her Clarice Starling created the new movie prototype of a female FBI, a trend that was followed by many actresses (notably Gillian Andersen in 'X-Files'). I loved her spontaneous and natural reactions to Hannibal Lecter's remarks in the prison scenes. The eerie sequences between Foster and Hopkins are among the highlights and the conversations in those scenes are morbidly amusing. Ted Levine is frightening. Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald are competent.<br/><br/>'The Silence of The Lambs' is one of the most finely crafted films of its genre. It's definitely stood the test of time and it's one that doesn't get dull with repeated viewing. It's a classic."
"axlrhodes","10","4","8","18 June 2008"," Possibly the best film of the 90's?
","Looking back at the 90's,some of the best films I saw in that era were very dark and sinister films that tapped into our fear factor and while compelling us also terrified us.Silence Of The Lambs and Se7en were both mainstream pictures that held aloft a very bleak vision but managed to garner massive public appeal as well as critical acclaim.Lambs will be best remembered for the scintillating performance provided by Anthony Hopkins but there really is a lot more to it than that.The film is alive with evil,it is a sinister and deeply disturbing film that gets under the skin, quite literally, and keeps the tension wound tight until the final act.Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice Starling displaying vulnerability and balls in equal measure, the follow up film should have never been made without her.Director Jonathan Demme didn't go on to make a film anywhere near as compelling as this,sure the film is driven by Hopkins' performance but Demme also gets the best out of Ted Levine and Foster as well managing to maintain the tension to tremendous effect throughout.In summary Silence Of The Lambs is a brilliant book to film adaptation that encapsulates everything that was great about the book and builds upon it. 10/10"

The characters were brilliant, I read the book and it's prequel and Foster is Clarice and Hopkins is Lecter. Hopkins just emanated evil but in such a classy respectable way.<br/><br/>I wouldn't suggest this movie to someone without a stomach. some of the scenes are fairly gruesome and it has one scene with Dr Chilton where he shows Clarice a picture explaining how Lecter injured someone.

I don't know if my tastes suddenly matured or what but when I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie for the first time I knew that Luke Skywalker and the gang had been trumped.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins was superb as Hannibal Lecter. I have never seen anyone in all the years I have been watching movies seen an actor portray intelligent insanity any better. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Many times when I go to movies I sometimes think of other things that are related to the movie or not. In this film that did not happen and it was due mostly to the performance of Hopkins. I was thrilled that the film won the Academy Award for that year. I thought the rest of the cast was great to. Jodie Foster is good in anything that she chooses to take on and the casting was perfect for Buffalo Bill. Ted Levine really fit that freaky hick part so well.<br/><br/>I thought the pacing of the movie was great to along with the cinematography which added to the suspense a great deal. Awesome direction and execution throughout the whole movie. I would consider this movie to be a must see for everyone interested in the thriller or psychological genres."

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" follows young FBI agent Clarice Starling as she attempts to track a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"". During her investigation, she solicits assistance from a psychotic yet intelligent cannibal named Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster provides a strong performance as the neophyte agent Clarice Starling, who is eager to prove herself yet haunted by her past. Anothony Hopkins gives a nuanced, refined and haunting performance as the unforgettable cannibal Hannibal Lecter. Anthony Heald proves the perfect person to play an imperious minor official as Dr. Frederick Chilton. Scott Glenn is also notable as Starling's superior in the FBI.<br/><br/>The crime story developed is excellent and remains interesting through its various turns as it chronicles the investigative process of agent Starling. One of the keys to this film's success is the well-written dialogue between Starling and Lecter, which is like a game of chess because of Leceter's manipulative tactics. The film is also effective as a thriller, as it builds up a lot of tension throughout its duration."
"matlefebvre20","10","4","8","31 May 2007"," Aaargh!!! It's Hannibal Lecter!!!
","There are characters who make their entrance in the movie world in such a spectacular way that the actor or actress which played that character risks to be associated with him/her for the rest of his/her career. It's notably the case for Clarice Starling, but especially for Hannibal Lecter. From the moment they appeared for the first time, it became evident that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins would forever be remembered for their iconic roles.<br/><br/>I have to say that it's Hannibal Lecter who impressed me the most. And that's not only the case for me. I allow myself to tell you that anecdote which happened to me. My sister is some kind of horror buff and I decided to test her by showing her ""The Silence of the Lambs"". She passed the test successfully but I'll always remember her reaction during the famous ambulance scene when the movie is two-thirds over. When Lecter puts off his mask to reveal his face, my sister instantly gasped. This demonstrates without any doubt the formidable power of Dr. Lecter. His only very presence is frightening. We see him and we are afraid, period.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the first horror movie in history to be rewarded with the Academy Award for Best Picture. And believe me that it deserves that prize. The Oscars for Foster and Hopkins' acting roles also are. We often associate horror films with ghosts, demons, monsters and other creatures which come from the imaginary and the supernatural. But nothing is more horrifying than what appears real and very plausible. Alfred Hitchcock has already shown that in ""Psycho"" and director Jonathan Demme raises the bar with this adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel.<br/><br/>The story involves Clarice Starling (played by Foster), a student at the FBI Academy who is also a specialist in serial killers. One of her superiors, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), asks Clarice to interview the terrifying psychopath Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (immaculately played by Hopkins) who is also a brilliant psychiatrist, so he could deliver clues which would lead to the capture of Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), another serial killer actively searched by the FBI.<br/><br/>Lecter accepts to help Clarice, but only to the condition that she feed Lecter's sordid curiosity by confessing herself about her childhood's worst souvenirs.<br/><br/>Why is Lecter interesting himself to Clarice's worst days? Does he want to weaken her? Does he want the bad guy to win? Or is he only a sadist and a pervert? I would go with the latter affirmation.<br/><br/>I think that it is useless to specify that, of all the characters, Hannibal Lecter is by far the best and the most fascinating. The other characters describe him in such a frightening and horrible way that we fear him well before we see him for the first time. And when we see him for the first time, we instantly remark his cold and menacing eyes, as well as his disturbing grin.<br/><br/>Himself a serial killer, we can consider Lecter as one of the worst (or best, depending on how you read it) villains in the history of cinema, even if we see him killing only once. And precisely, his attack is very stylish. He kills both policemen on the strains of Johann Sebastian Bach's ""The Goldberg Variations"" and once he accomplished his work, we see him stained with blood, just like a painted how has just finished from making a new painting. That scene establishes a shocking parallel between murder and art.<br/><br/>But Lecter is only one side of this story. In fact, he's only a sub-plot. The true story involves Buffalo Bill's actions. Bill, brilliantly played by Levine, acts in nearly the whole Midwest, but his victims always are rather fat young women. Unlike many movies which hide their killer until the very end, we often see Bill in this film, even if we don't know his true identity, nor the frightening motives of his crimes until the end. The only thing we can discover about Bill is his appearing mental problems which push him to kill.<br/><br/>The horrors of the film aren't limited to the killers themselves. The movie is strewn with blood-chilling naturalistic images, especially the images of corpses who got parts of their skin removed. And how could we forget this unbearable image of the dead policeman with an open abdomen posing like an angel who is about to take off? <br/><br/>There's also a good dose of suspense, especially at the end when Clarice is chasing Bill in his labyrinthine basement. The climax of the pitch-black room while Bill is wearing his night goggles to see in the absolute darkness is breathtaking and holds suspense until the conclusion. At this moment, we're totally absorbed in that cat-and-mouse game at the point that we totally forget Lecter's existence.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is an excellent example of the horrors of the criminal acts and of psychological horror aroused by childhood traumas. Overall, the film is an immense metaphor about the horror of modern world and wants to get sure that the viewer leaves weakened and less in security than before he got inside the theater. The sinister soundtrack of Howard Shore adds to the already sordid atmosphere and the Q. Lazzarus song ""Goodbye Horses"" adds even more with its broken notes which resonate and give goosebumps. Personnaly, each time that I hear that song, I start thinking about Buffalo Bill who cross-dresses in front of the camera with that song playing in the background.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a grandiose spooky symphony well-carried by Foster and Hopkins whose roles are already a part of the legend. The numerous references of the movie in the popular culture keep it well alive more than fifteen years after its release. Everybody, at least those who are able to stand horror images, should watch this movie at least once in their life."

","I never really got off on this film until first saw it whilst on holiday in a hotel in New York. I didn't get off on it at first but then my parents bought it on DVD. I saw it again and I just couldn't take my mind off it! <br/><br/>Hopkins is delicious as Hannibal Lector with his amazing acting and brilliantly menacing speeches. You can't help that there is a monster just waiting to appear from Hopkins. I just couldn't help laughing with amazement. However, one of the biggest breakthroughs of the movie is probably Ted Levine as Jame Gumb (Buffalo Bill), playing the main psychotic serial killer. He has a way of playing the part that you is so mad that it is excellent.<br/><br/>Despite this, I don't really understand or believe the stories of people fainting in the cinema at the film's release in 1991.

","In my opinion, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS has excellent performances by Anthony (Hopkins) and Jodie (Foster). I thought that Clarice (Jodie Foster) looked very pretty in all the dressy clothing she wore, especially the dressy outfits she wore when she visited Dr. Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in jail. This film didn't scare me at all. Well, maybe just a little. Dr. Lecter scared me a little when he attacked the two cops in his cell. There was only one thing that really grossed me out, and that was the killer (Ted Levine) shoving an insect down each victim's throat and then skinning them. That was really disgusting in my opinion. Also, when I noticed that Buffalo Bill had a pierced nipple, I got really uncomfortable, but I still enjoyed the movie. To wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Parents, if you have young children, do not let them see THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. They will have nightmares."""

It features Dr. Hannibal Lector, bringing Anthony Hopkins a well deserved Oscar, a pshycotic cannibal behind bars with a brilliant mind. Clarice Starling, a definitive female hero that feeds Lector memories of her chilling childhood, who makes it cool for women to kick butt. And Jack Crawford the FBI Behavioral Sciences Director who encourages Clarice as she investigates the serial murderer Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>Usually when one who doesn't truly appreciate the beauty of a film, sees ""The Silence of the Lambs"" as a crime movie with a nude dance scene, a man eating another man's face, Miggs, the Death Heads Moth, and a the hockey mask of Hannibal Lector. But I truly appreciate the chemistry between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in this film. The performances of these two brings what could be mistaken for a budding relationship. <br/><br/>In their final scene before Dr. Lector's break out, the chemistry is clearly evident there. The close up shots of their faces would be slightly annoying in another movie, but these shots show the anguish and anxiety of Clarice Starling and the cunning and brilliance of Dr. Lector. As Dr. Lector questions Clarice of the lambs, her mental anguish is forced and she must relive memories of the murder of her father, the town marshal, which could help fuel her search of Buffalo Bill. As Lector educates Clarice on coveting, his face transforms into a slightly evil glare that shows the brilliance and evil coinciding in Dr. Lector's mind. This scene is my absolute favorite because of the past of Starling is revealed. In this scene we see the true evil of Dr. Lector begin to form and show in the movie.<br/><br/>The chemistry is brilliant and perfect. The only other on screen chemistry that could even compare to this would be that of Frankie Dunn and Maggie Fitzgerald, portrayed by Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank, in ""Million Dollar Baby."""

","Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)<br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Intense masterpiece about an FBI trainee (Jodie Foster) who is tracking down a perverted serial killer and must receive help from Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Anthony Hopkins). THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a film picking up Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay. It's a very rare thing for any film to do that but once you see this film it's easy to see why it was such a hit back in the day and why it hasn't lost a bit of its impact in the years since. I've always felt that the film was about as close to flawless as any film could get and it's strongest aspect is the brilliant performances mixed in with some of the greatest characters ever written. The film really is a mechanical workshop for how to build up suspense and beat the viewer over the head each step of the way. I've heard many people say they love the film but felt that it was just too intense for its own good, which I think is almost fair to say. Director Jonathan Demme does a masterful job at building all of this tension up and I really love how they pretty much try to make each and every scene something very creepy. This film has rightfully become legendary over the years and many of the best scenes contain some of the greatest suspense. The early scene where we first see Lector looking out at us. A wonderful sequence where Foster must crawl into a garage not knowing what she's going to find. There's a creepy autopsy sequence. Then, there's the famous scene with Lector inside the ""new"" jail cell and of course the perfect ending. The movie certainly doesn't throw in cheap humor to try and break the tension and instead it just continues to assault the viewer. The violence, while graphic at times, never takes away from what you're viewing and the film is so classy that it never falls into some sort of cheap exploitation flick. The performances really bring the characters to life and the way Foster and Hopkins play against one another has rightfully put them as some of the most memorable of all time. The way the two play their little chess match while trying to gather information from the other perfectly adds to the creepy atmosphere and you really do feel as if you're watching something very special. Scott Glenn is also very effective as Foster's mentor. Ted Levine plays the serial killer and I've always felt that he's the one who most often gets overlooked. There's no question that this film belongs to Hopkins and Foster but Levine is just so terrific in his part of Buffalo Bill that I've always been somewhat shocked that he doesn't get more attention. The tense music score, masterful cinematography and wonderful dark look just adds to what really is the perfect thriller. Since the release of this movie there have been many sequels, rip-offs and countless other films inspired by this one but nothing has come close to the perfection which is this movie. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a blockbuster actually delivering the goods and it's clearly not only one of the best films of the decade but also one of the greatest ever made."
"ElMaruecan82","10","6","14","14 August 2011"," A Modern Horror Masterpiece ...
","If there ever was a movie genre that needed constant renovations in order to maintain its appeal, it's certainly Horror, and at this level, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" didn't just reinvent but transcended it.<br/><br/>Fear is based on a simple principle : the 'boo' effect. The less we expect something to happen, the most it scares us. ""Psycho"", by featuring a totally demented boy-next-door villain, terrified an audience used to associate horror with vampires and exotic monsters. ""The Exorcist"" pushed the level of realism to a magnificent artistry while ""Jaws"" suggested a mysterious presence, keeping it even more frightening, a device sublimated by the movies ""Alien"" and ""The Shining"". All these movies shared an iconic significance in the evolution of Thriller and more specifically Horror films and it seemed like nothing could surprise a mature audience anymore <br/><br/>This situation worsened with the consecration of slasher films and their overused cheap-plotted formulas making uncertain recipes out of classic ingredients, notably those introduced by the previous masterpieces : hemoglobin overdose, gruesome over-the-top special effects and various experimentations that pushed the genre down to Z-movies in the worst case, and in the best, B-movies with a cult status. So, a masterpiece built out of a new and fresh material was begging to be made. And cinematic Gods attributed this mission to Jonathan Demme with the classic ""Silence of the Lambs"", the first Horror film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Finally.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of cinema's history. Every single element contributes to create a disturbing and unique atmosphere, and I use very carefully the word 'unique'. I highly doubt anyone was reminded of a villain with the same caliber as Dr. Hannibal -with the chilling rhyming nickname- Lecter, masterfully personified by Anthony Hopkins. I doubt anyone remembers a similar movie where a young, vulnerable and non-Ellen-Ripley looking girl doesn't play the victim, nor the hero's love interest, but the actual heroine. Clarice Starling, as a FBI trainee is played by Jodie Foster, in a performance subtly combining feminine vulnerability and heroic tenacity. And no one would have expected the film to have a binary structure with a classic serial-killer's investigation in one hand, and a subplot involving one of the greatest movie villains of all-time and his interaction with the heroine, on the other.<br/><br/>The script is tightly constructed, patiently leading us to assemble each piece of the puzzle until the series of interactions between Clarice and Hannibal approaches a disturbing truth. The relationship between the two leads is even more fascinating because it deepens their personalities and allows us to get more and more in their background : the wounds in Clarice's past, the mystery around Hannibal Lecter, and the roots of evil that inspired the serial killers' acts. And this is where the freshness of the film relies on : its capability to put everything into perspective and invite our perceptions to go beyond the simple 'good vs. evil' dichotomy. The villain are no sharks, no monsters, no possessing demons, they are everyday men, like some Norman Bates with an extra level of savagery and pervert creativity and we try to understand to better fight them, under the pervert irony that the investigation requires a psychopathic mind to arrest another one.<br/><br/>Talking about psychopath, the way Hannibal is introduced after the first minutes is impressive and gloomy enough to make us expect the worst and when we finally see him, standing, well-dressed, clean cut, the impact is immediate. Demme's meticulous direction introduces Clarice in a very clever way too, she's basically a girl enduring a lot of stress and hardship while trying to overcome a physically handicapping feminine condition in a world of men. There's one scene where she enters an elevator, surrounded by a group of men whose big sizes emphasize her tininess. Another moment shows her trying to handle a group of officers standing in a room, assessing a minimum of authority. Clarice Starling is endearing and engaging as the heroine driven by a desire of justice and accomplishment, and the trust or fondness developed by both the Agent in Charge, Crawford, played by Scott Glenn, and maybe Hannibal Lecter, himself. After all, the many close-ups on his face during his interrogations and the suavity of his voice suggest a disturbing feel of intimacy between him and Clarice. And as the investigations progresses, the extraordinary portrayal of the real villain of the film, by an underrated Ted Levine, keeps us hooked until the final confrontation. <br/><br/>If you noticed, I mentioned every element that generally makes a great movie, writing, acting, directing, the movie was indeed the third, and last to date, to win the five major Academy Awards, after ""It Happened One Night"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". It had this classic feeling from the day it was released because it combined so many new elements that defined the notion of psychological thriller, before it became a trend. And it's no surprise that the film topped many list from the American Film Institute, #5 of AFI's 100 Thrills, #6 heroine, and good ol' Hannibal as number one movie villain, and he wasn't even the main antagonist in the film, which says as much as his winning the Oscar for less than 20 minutes on-screen, to find a character with the same cinematic aura, I guess we would go back to Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" reinvented the horror genre as the kind of movie that would have made Alfred Hitchcock proud : a scary villain, a sympathetic hero, a script respecting our intelligence, top-notch direction and editing, and for one thing, it didn't even need a twist ending"

","I ate 'The Silence of the Lambs' up the first time I saw it and I've gone back for more who knows how many times. I can clean my plate and watch the whole thing, or just snack on certain scenes and be satiated. It is fine dining.<br/><br/>I admit it's a little bizarre, but if I'm in low spirits I sometimes put *this* movie on to cheer myself up, especially if I'm depressed because I've watched some garbage modern movie. The sheer perfection of it never fails to raise me up a little, and the fact that it was made in 1991 gives me hope that the current crop of Hollywood actors and directors isn't unremittingly bad.<br/><br/>The scenes between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are masterful, they're like the cadenzas to a violin concerto. I've watched those scenes by themselves about twice as often as I've seen the full movie. To see them feeding off each others performances is beautiful, a feast in itself, it doesn't even require fava beans or a nice chianti.<br/><br/>But it isn't just Hopkins and Foster. There really isn't a poor performance in the entire film, maybe it's because I'm biased and I've seen it two dozen times but it seems like even the actors in the bit parts are far above average. The bug guys, Miggs, the deputies at the funeral home in Elk River, the chauffeur who ""detests physical labor.""<br/><br/>Jonathan Demme's directing is so brilliantly subtle that it's easy to overlook given the gripping story and the incredible acting, but the last time I watched the entire movie I did indeed, ""feel eyes moving over Clarice's body."" I'd read about this before, and undoubtedly processed it subconsciously, but I'd never seen it so starkly. The fact is that throughout the movie men are staring at Jodie Foster, judging her, ordering her around, lusting after her, and finally trying to kill her. This produces an undercurrent of suspense even in scenes that don't necessarily have any other suspenseful elements.<br/><br/>Finally, that they managed to do all this and still keep it so realistically lurid is, to me, nothing short of amazing. The pictures of the flayed girls, the bloody fingernail stuck in the wall of the pit, whatever that thing is in the bathtub, it's all so marvelously grotesque you get the feeling that certain too-polite elements of society would love to shun it, but the film is so good that it demands to be watched."

","'The Silence Of The Lambs (1991)' balances its two key story-lines remarkably well, allowing them to bounce off and twist around each other until they become one inseparable narrative. The incredibly disciplined way in which the film restrains its two most flamboyant aspects - those being the serial killers Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill - to always maintain the perspective of its rookie FBI protagonist as she navigates her way through her newfound world of silver-tongued devils and elusive monsters is both impressive and necessary in elevating the piece above what could've been simple shock value. The feature is gripping right from its opening moments and always maintains a tight grip on its psychologically complex characters who remain fully rounded no matter on which side of sociopathy - or the law - they sit. Thanks to a mature treatment of its audience, it never feels as though it is pandering or dumbing itself down, rather elevating the viewer to its own level of intelligence. The picture also knows when to pull back on the reigns too, making for an experience far more cerebral than visceral; this is something perhaps unexpected from a thriller where a serial-killing cannibal is, for all intents and purposes, one of the 'good guys.' 8/10"
"tdrish","7","5","11","18 December 2017"," slightly over rated, but great classic thriller
","Silence Of The Lambs is, in my opinion, one of the most emotionally charged thrillers ever filmed. Slightly over rated ( I did not feel it was good enough to win Best Picture at the time), and a bit uneven at times, but it does tell quite a compelling and engrossing story. Foster plays the role of Clarice Starling, a very young trainee at the FBI academy. She is assigned a case that will almost guarentee her a certified license of the FBI, but it won't be easy. It seems the Senators daughter has been kidnapped, and the branch seems to strongly suspect that it is tied in with the Buffalo Bill victims. These victims have been found, all female, and all missing several, various skin patterns from their bodies. All of the information that Starling needs to catch this freak is in the hands of one man, Dr. Hannibal Lechtor. There's only one problem...he won't talk to anybody. When he finally meets Clarice, he seems to melt at the first sight of her, and he does talk to her. He slowly gives her the information that she needs, but it's not for free. Through a bizarre, unique ""pro quo"", the doctor releases her data on one of his patients, who he is even convinced is the killer at large. ( Pro quo is a, ""what's in it for me""? deal in which Foster must reveal something about herself, in order to get what she wants. Here's where it gets tricky. And this is all plays out beautifully: Clarice is warned that Lechtor is slicker then ice, and was strongly advised that ""you do not want this man inside your head."" Unfortunately, that is where Clarice is allowing him to go, at the mercy of him giving her the name of the patient that is going around with the nickname Buffalo Bill. And we learn why. It's not because she wants her FBI badge, she really cares about the victim who may or may not still be alive. She has a glimmer of hope that she is alive, and that she can indeed save her. Out of all victims, she just wants to save one. But can she save her own sanity while doing so? The Silence Of The Lambs is not a perfect movie, and neither was the book. I found a lot of it implasussible, and the over dramatic cinematography prevented me from giving this piece 8 stars. ( The end of the film, when Clarice is holding the phone, and she says the doctors name over and over like a skipping CD, when it is clear that he has hung up the phone, is an excellent example of what I am talking about. ) And it cannot be denied Hopkins stole the show with his performance. Scary and gruesome as hell, I think this still reigns supreme to this very day."

"mrrockey","8","5","11","20 April 2014"," Disturbing yet Entertaining
","When it comes to horror films of the 90's, I can't think of many films as iconic as The Silence of the Lambs. While there were certainly other iconic horror films at the time such as The Sixth Sense and Scream, the one thing The Silence of the Lambs did that those films didn't, was win the Oscar for Best Picture. Not only that, but it also won for Best Actor for Anthony Hopkins, Best Actress for Jodie Foster, Best Adapted Screenplay for Ted Tally, and Best Director for Jonathan Demme. It also became the fourth highest-grossing film of 1991. So with all that, you expect something special, right? Well, is it? Let's take a look, shall we?<br/><br/>The plot follows a young FBI trainee by the name of Clarice Starling who is pulled from her training academy to interview Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer to find another serial killer by the name of Buffalo Bill under the order of Jack Crawford. After some interrogation and investigation, Bill abducts Catherine Martin, one of the U.S. Senator's daughter. Leaving it up to Starling to find Bill by dealing with the darkest of all minds, Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>The appeal of Silence of the Lambs lies in its mix of realistic depictions of police investigation and serial killer antics while retaining a cinematic panache to keep things entertaining. The film depicts its police investigation very realistically with a great attention detail to the dead bodies and the way the main serial killer Buffalo Bill operates is actually pretty realistic. His motives are very opaque, never completely clear to the audience, just like how serial killers are to people in real-life. He's trying to make a dress with a woman's flesh throughout the film because he thinks he's a woman but you never get why he wants to kill people. You have to pay full attention to see what's behind his head. But at the same time, the film doesn't feel TOO realistic to the point where it's boring and dull to sit through, there's still a certain entertainment factor to this film. For one thing, the film is scary. While this isn't exactly the type of horror film you can have a good time with when you call over some friends while having a few beers, it still has plenty of good scares to keep you entertained from beginning to end(especially towards the end).<br/><br/>But I think the main reason why this did so well was because of the characters. While most horror films would feature the serial killer as the most interesting character of the film while the main character is as dull as a rock, this film did something a little different. Clarice Starling in this film is equally interesting as the serial killers themselves because she's not just some girl who just happen to become a target for the killer somehow but instead, she's ASSIGNED to find the serial killer herself and actually has a personality and she actually goes through an arc. She starts out haunted from her childhood memory of seeing lambs being slaughtered so she feels guilty about seeing such a thing happen but not doing anything about it considering her dad was a cop and hears sounds of lambs screaming in her dreams but she overcomes this towards the end when she saves the senator's daughter and kills Buffalo Bill. And thankfully, they got a great actress to play this part, Jodie Foster. Foster has a believable intelligence to her that helps you buy her matching wits with Hannibal Lecter. It's great that the filmmakers chose not to cast the most attractive actress but instead, the one that could act.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are equally good. While Hannibal Lecter is certainly not a realistic portrait of a serial killer, he works well as this great, unstoppable force of evil that Clarice has to match wits with to find Buffalo Bill. Anthony Hopkins gives the performance of a lifetime here with all his creepy stares, sinister line deliveries, and wicked intelligence. Ted Levine is equally creepy and unsettling as Buffalo Bill, but in different ways. He feels a lot more like a realistic serial killer with his strange sexuality and cross-dressing habits. Scott Glenn is also convincing as the authoritative, determined Jack Crawford. Lastly, I want to mention Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin, the girl kidnapped by Buffalo Bill. I love how she starts out extremely terrified when she's captured just like anybody would but I like how her character actually tries to escape by threatening to kill Bill's dog if he doesn't let her out. Smith's fear and determination is very believable throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Overall, The Silence of the Lambs is a chilling, disturbing film that also has some excellent performances to spare. Great film. 10/10"

","""Silence of the lambs"" is one of the masterpieces of the last decade. And does it have its reasons. First of all, it's entirely dependant on the terror that gnaws all the way to the mind of the viewer. The decline of the Human Being is magnificently chiseled with one liners that amusingly depict the killers and psychopaths state of mind and approach us carefully into a nature that is deformed, evil and sick of the Man's putrefaction.<br/><br/>The main spectacle is drawn between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Both entirely relevant to the movie, they produce a bright contrast and with their performances they nail the feelings right and expose one of the best duels on movie history. This duel, although, is not conventional. Clarice Starling (Foster) will use Hannibal Lecter's (Hopkins) profound knowledge of the criminal mind to capture the infamous Buffalo Bill. But Hopkins will play a game in which their personalities will engage in a retroactive combination, in a ""quid pro quo"" mind spar: she will have to expose her most profound, hidden secrets to Lecter, so he can also dispatch on his pleasure of analyzing the suffering of others. Both of them reveal all of their character's whole personality with their eyes: Foster is in constant pressure, scared but facing the natural Hades with courage and Hopkins shows human emptiness in his eyes, windows to what is a world full of depravations.<br/><br/>Ted Levine is truly scary. You get the impression that he is the true Buffalo Bill, twisted and perverse. He shows absolutely no human, recognizable aspect. He is a terrible villain.<br/><br/>The movie will straightly envelop you in an obscure labyrinth where the human mind is retorted and rotten, with a depressing score and settings that are grey, murky and never joyful. One has to see it to get a close approach on the dark side of the mind it or at least, to make their spirit shake and tremble."

","It seems as though there is a serial killer out there who's grabbed the daughter of a United States Senator and this guy has zoomed right to the top of FBI's Most wanted. This man's modus operandi is to keep the victims alive for a while before killing them so they're racing against time to find him. Desperate situations call for desperate measures.<br/><br/>The desperate measure is, you want to catch a serial killer, bring in one as a consultant. That's why FBI trainee Jodie Foster goes to visit Anthony Hopkins in prison. Hopkins is not just a killer who eats his victims, he's a brilliant psychologist himself with insights maybe no one else has.<br/><br/>Of course his price are some cheap insights into Jodie Foster's soul, thrills he probably got when he was in practice.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs in less capable hands could have just been another cheap slasher flick. Instead the leads who walked off with the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress give riveting performances of a sick twisted psycho and a woman who became the biggest feminist icon since Sigourney Weaver by confronting some demons of her own. It's the best work that Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have ever done and let's not forget the Oscars won by Director Jonathan Demme and the Picture itself for being the Best in 1991.<br/><br/>A couple of players who made their marks on television later on also score well here. Anthony Heald who was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's handler plays the psychiatrist in the institute where Hopkins is incarcerated and who Hopkins makes a fool of and says at the end he's far from done with. Also Ted Levine who is Captain Stottlemeyer on Monk plays the serial killer the FBI is trying to catch. Also look for a good performance by Brooke Smith as Levine's potential victim.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs with its taut direction and riveting performances has an appeal far beyond the horror genre. See it and you'll know what I mean."

","I had never seen Silence of the Lambs and decided to pick up the book by Thomas Harris recently. I was thrilled by the book and I read the entire thing in about a week. I then hungered to see the award winning movie that I'd heard so much about. I wasn't disappointed at all. The cinematography is awesome, Foster and Hopkins turn in A+++ performances and the story contains the book's intricacies while moving at a pace fast enough to satisfy. The only detail left out of the movie that was in the book was that of Crawford's wife's death and ongoing sickness. I think this really made Crawford seem rather one dimensional in Silence of the Lambs and takes a lot away from his character in the book. My girlfriend had only seen the movie and she described him as a bit of a sleaze which shocked me because he is such a genuine and honestly good man in the book that is simply in the middle of a massive internal conflict. However, this does not really detract from the movie at all, I simply felt that Crawford was an underdone character but understand the need to simplify him. I suggest reading the book before seeing the movie. Bon appetite."
"ackstasis","10","5","11","4 October 2006"," ""Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?""
","'The Silence of the Lambs (1991)' isn't even about Hannibal Lecter. We're so distracted by cold, probing voice of the suave psychiatrist- turned-serial-killer (played with chilling calculation by Anthony Hopkins) that it's easy to forget that the film is ultimately about Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a rookie FBI agent with a dark past.<br/><br/>Clarice spent her adolescence trying to escape death – the shooting of her father, the slaughter of spring lambs on her neighbour's ranch – and sought to banish these memories by joining the FBI. She's a young woman in what is traditionally a man's world, forced to endure the degradation of constantly having ""eyes all over her body"" (and this disquieting metaphor is reinforced later on as we witness Clarice ogled through the lens of night-vision goggles). The motives of her boss and mentor Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) are somewhat dubious, and their final handshake quivers with sexual awkwardness.<br/><br/>Hannibal Lecter perceives Clarice's dark past and recognises her strengths. He falls in love with her in a platonic sort of way (not dissimilar to how Sherlock Holmes fell in love with Irene Adler, one of the few people to have outwitted him, in ""A Scandal in Bohemia""). The moment that their fingers touch through the bars of Lecter's cell is a chilling sharing of intimacy. <br/><br/>Thomas Harris subsequently elaborated on this relationship in ""Hannibal,"" but that novel (and, to a lesser extent, Ridley Scott's 2001 film adaptation) goes completely off the rails in its final act. Clarice Starling would've been best left alone. (Tellingly, the best parts of 'Hannibal (2001)' were those set in Florence, Italy with Giancarlo Giannini).<br/><br/>Finally, nobody ever mentions Ted Levine's perfect performance as Jame Gumb (a.k.a. Buffalo Bill), probably because he's such an repellent character. Lecter is frequently framed in close-up, emphasising Hopkins' mesmerising, unblinking stare, and he speaks eloquently and intelligently. Jame Gumb, conversely, is kept at a distance, often swathed in poor or garish lighting, or framed in such an extreme close- up that his features appear grotesque."

The acting of Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, and Ted Levine is superb. Howard Shore's music is great, and the cage scene and killing of the 2 officers is one of the best deaths I've ever seen on film. Starling does get Buffalo Bill in a terrifying night-vision scene.

The women represent ""Buffalo Bills"" six victims and Kathren the seventh whom he abducts. When Starling dream of her trying to save a lamb its like way she is trying to save Kathren. The movie title is very unique for a dark creepy film. if you don't have a clue about the film and only heard the title you would wonder what kind of movie it is. would horror,dark, thriller come to mind. You might think its take place on a farm, (in some respect yes) or sweet loving drama? romantic drama? or a comedy? doubtful. Who would suspect it was creepy movie about a young FBI trainee,a brilliant and infamous psychopathic serial killer locked away, and a deadly serial killer on the loose.

I saw it years later in 2005 and still loved it.<br/><br/>The movie's strong point is Jodie Foster and Anthiny Hopkins' acting skills ,again the benchmark against which I measure acting. The two make a great team and that was missing in the sequel ""Hannibal"".<br/><br/>This is a movie of many skins its a thriller, a detective movie, a horror movie an entertainer and it deals with the nature of the human psyche too.

","Hannibal. The very name sparks fear, discomfort, and ultimately recognition. He is one of the most popular screen characters of all time, the incarnation of evil, and yet strangely likable despite his distasteful savoring of human flesh. ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of chianti,"" he tells FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) after she meets him in a prison, metal bars their only means of separation.<br/><br/>Their first conversation and face-to-face interaction is a vital element of the film's narrative; the bars represent Starling's own self-defense; they have wide-open spaces that are easily penetrable. And Hannibal Lecter, a psychologist and cannibal, knows exactly how to reach past her own mental cell bars and crack into her brain, and he does so in the classic scene where she recalls memories from her childhood, of the lamb she tried to save...<br/><br/>Agent Starling is on the case of a bizarre serial killer whose victims tend to be young women. Although they are unaware of his motives, it turns out the infamous ""Buffalo Bill"" is using the skin of these unfortunate victims for his own sick pleasure. He's not the sort of person you'd feel comfortable being stuck next to in an otherwise empty elevator.<br/><br/>Clarice is smart, a feminine icon of the movies. Her brains are what propel her own investigation into the case while her desire to unearth the truth and succeed past the results of her male counterparts stems from a sort of egotistical dominance. Not many people comment upon Sterling's own sexuality, her almost overly excessive efforts at saving the victims (who happen to be females). Buffalo Bill seems to represent her own image of men: cruel creatures who inflict pain and suffering upon helpless women. Her sole friend, the only man she can rely on for help and inside tidbits, is an outcast upon society -- a metaphor for the repressed homosexuals who are abandoned by their own societies, shunned by those who feel they are not ""normal."" Harris's underlying implications of homosexuality and female dominance in the novel are admittedly stronger than in the film, although the presence of the suggestions is clearly evident under close examination.<br/><br/>Or, it could just be about serial killers and FBI agents. You decide.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie is famous, but we must ask ourselves whether or not the film's reputation has given it a better face over the year than it has deserved. It is well directed, but never does the film fascinate us as the bold and daring ""Se7en"" did. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a fine film, but pales in comparison to some of its imitators and fellow genre occupants.<br/><br/>The acting and writing is not at fault. Hopkins and Foster are superb. Hopkins received the most critical acclaim, although in 2001 we all realized that Foster was a key to the series as well, when she was unsuccessfully replaced with Julianne Moore in the sequel, ""Hannibal,"" directed by Ridley Scott, which was a total failure and disappointment for the fans of the original and source material, the novels by Thomas Harris, who has reportedly never seen ""Silence of the Lambs"" for fear that it would influence his writing.<br/><br/>""Lambs,"" more than any other film in the series, is terribly manipulative, complete with tacky flashbacks that are out of place and all too convenient. That's where the film ultimately fails. The direction by Jonathan Demme is, truth be told, rather poor and borderline mediocre; Demme does not use cinematography to his advantage, does not use darker tones to evoke feelings from the prints as Fincher did with ""Se7en."" It's a great movie with convincing performances and a realistic script packaged in the form of a typical Hollywood thriller -- it might have a good reputation, it might be a good movie, but compared to other classics of the genre, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" just doesn't hold up as much as I had hoped it would after all these years. It's revolutionary, but isn't the masterpiece it used to be.<br/><br/>On the plus side there's always that terrific ending to look forward to."

This is a story of a young FBI Trainee, for lack of a better term, brought on board and investigation into the kidnapping and murder of women. Agent Starling, played here flawlessly by Jodi Foster, is a psyche major. She is asked to talk to a notorious serial murderer name Hannibal Lecter, or Hannibal the cannibal, played by the Great Hopkins. It is hoped that Lecter can shed some light on who is perpetrating the murders, as his latest kidnapped victim is a senator's daughter. Foster and Hopkins are excellent together, and the story is solid. It does keep you wondering through the end if Buffalo Bill, the serial killer's nickname, will get caught. But seriously, Hopkins is what made this movie. The man is an acting god."

Jodie Foster plays a FBI agent in search for a serial killer who rips off the skin of his female victims. In order to better understand the way this serial killer thinks, she starts interviewing another notorious serial killer in jail, played by the legendary Anthony Hopkins. The first half of the movie is a cat and mouse game between Jodie Foster and the locked up serial killer Anthony Hopkins to retrieve information from him, that will lead to the capture of the serial killer on the run. Will they find the serial killer before another victim is slashed up?<br/><br/>What makes ""Silence of the Lambs"" so irresistably horrifying yet riveting at the same time, is it's psychological mindgame played by the locked up serial killer Anthony Hopkins. Add to that magnificent acting performance an extremely suspenseful story and you have got a classic. Man oh man, I must have seen it 20 times or more and I still get goosebumps at the end. I know exactly what is gonna happen and STILL I am THRILLED TO THE BONE! It is one of those movies that just wont break.

There is even a special blu ray version released by classics distributor ""Criterion"" of the making of this movie. I wont reveal anything here, about all the ins and outs of the making of this thrilling classic, because during the first viewing it is better you know as little as possible, in order to enhance the shock effects. Because shocked you will be, but in the most pleasant ""hollywood way""!<br/><br/>Personal endnote: I still remember when I saw it first. 30 years ago there was a new cinema in my hometown that featured discounted reruns of popular movies. Only 1 dollar tickets for a movie. The weirdest mix of people flocked to that theatre, who wouldnt normally go to movies: mothers with kids, drunks and drifters and students skipping school. The atmosphere in this theatre was great, packed full every time . ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the perfect example that excellent movies CAN be made for the masses too.<br/><br/>This is nr. 1003 of all the reviews on Imdb for ""Silence of the Lambs"".

"cdjh-81125","10","2","3","14 October 2016"," A Chilling Masterpiece
","The Silence of The Lambs is one of my all time favourite movies which surprises me because I am very much not a horror movie fan but I adore this movie it just does everything right not just in terms of a thriller but as a movie as well. Probably the most iconic thing about this movie is the characters and every character has something interesting about them whether it be an unhinged serial killer that has nothing else to lose or a young FBI agent trying to find her way in the world and the latter is what makes Clarice Starling such an excellent protagonist she gives the audience something to relate to in this film and Jodie Foster is absolutely amazing in this film she perfectly captures her characters wit, innocence and fear and is never anything less than convincing. But in the end it was Anthony Hopkins incredible turn as iconic serial killer Hannibal Lector that truly stole this movie. The film takes its time to build up Lecter as an antagonist so that when he isn't on screen were dying for him to return and makes Hopkins performance all the more terrifying. Make no mistake this movie is not for the faint of heart it has a lot of blood, guts and gore but all the violence serves a purpose it allows us to get sucked into this world and know just how much theses characters mean business. While Hannibal Lector is An Antagonist in this film he isn't the main one the main focus of this film is the Hunt for deranged serial killer Buffalo Bill. Not only is the mystery and hunt for him just incredibly interesting to watch but it makes the film an entertaining one its not just a compilation of death scenes it's what gives this movie it's rewatch value along with the scenes where Starling and Lector just talk. We learn so much about these two people in these scenes not just thought exposition but by the way they act towards one and other revealing both of their insecurities. <br/><br/>I Can't think of a single person who doesn't at least like this movie it's just so lovable with amazing performances and an excellent main mystery. <br/><br/>A+-100%"
"avik-basu1889","9","2","3","14 June 2016"," An iconic thriller !!!
","Directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Ted Tally, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. One of the first themes that one can notice while watching the film is the element of feminism. This film has feminism and feminist ideals written all over it. What makes this work is that Demme in collaboration with Tally conveys these feminist ideas through visual filmmaking and frame compositions instead of blatant verbal delivery. The opening of the film itself is an example of this. This opening credits sequence which apparently was something Jodie Foster came up with starts with the image of barren, dry, leafless trees in a deserted foggy forest. Then Clarice appears out of this fog and we follow her as she runs and overcomes one obstacle after another on her own. This is visual storytelling at its best. The foggy, deserted, barren forest is what society can sometimes look like from a female perspective. Then we see this woman appear and face and overcome hurdles and obstacles alone and showcase her capabilities. Another great frame is that of Clarice getting dwarfed in the elevator by the big burly men standing alongside her. Clarice Sterling is an iconic female hero, but not in the clichéd sense of the word. She is strong, intelligent and idealistic. But she is still given the chance to have a sense of fear and be vulnerable which actually makes her real and very inspirational.<br/><br/>Another theme that I noticed in the film is the feeling of being trapped and the desire of breaking out. This theme actually binds the three characters Clarice, Hannibal and Buffalo Bill together. Clarice feels trapped in an environment which is predominantly numbered by men. But her way of overcoming this feeling is to work hard and make herself someone that the others can't take lightly. Buffalo Bill had been a victim of abuse in his past life and this had led him to hate everything about himself including his body which leads him to believe he is transsexual. So he feels trapped in his male body and wants to become a woman. This theme also applies to Hannibal Lecter, but in a much more literal sense. He is literally trapped in prisons and cages and he wants to break free. <br/><br/>There are two transformations or desired transformations juxtaposed in the narrative of the film. The first desired transformation is Clarice's. We can see in her a determination to transform herself from the sweet, innocent girl seen in the flashback scenes to a hardened strong FBI officer. But she doesn't lose her femininity while trying to transform. Buffalo Bill on the other wants to completely lose his masculinity by using a female armour. The irony is that Bill wants to become a woman even though he treats women as objects and considers them to be fragile, weak and loves to exert his power on them.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly directed. Jonathan Demme uses a lot of filmmaking techniques. There are a number of tracking shots, POV shots and close-ups in the film. Demme manages to keep the film flowing and very tightly paced. But I think the best directorial decision that Demme makes here is the artistic use of close-ups. Time and again in other films, directors have used POV shots of men and especially criminals while they size up their female prey in the creepiest sense like we have seen in Michael Powell's masterpiece 'Peeping Tom'. Demme reverses that by showing us the male gaze from the woman's perspective. The men who talk to Clarice talk straight into the camera and we see what Clarice sees in their eyes. Apart from this theme, the close- ups also help the viewers in assessing the nature of these characters. Cheekily Demme reverses it again in the final set-piece and shows us Buffalo Bill's POV while he watches Clarice struggle in the dark. I would also like to mention Howard Shore's music which I thought also helped maintain the tempo of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty spectacular. Jodie Foster just through her facial expressions lets us in on what she is thinking. She acts a lot with her eyes and her face. She gives a humanity to Clarice's character as well as making her strong and determined. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter has become legendary. His portrayal is not realistic. He is over-the-top and very theatrical in almost a Shakespearean way. Some critics have criticised his portrayal for this very reason. But I think in the context of the film that he is in, a sedate, understated performance wouldn't have worked. The film doesn't restrict itself fully to the boundaries of realism, so some theatricality from Hopkins I feel benefited it and Hopkins is great with his intimidating eyes and distinctive vocal style of speaking. He blends disturbing psychotic antics with refined and classy gestures to make the character of Hannibal Lecter immensely complicated and deranged. The conversational scenes between Hannibal and Clarice are the ones that make the film what it is. During these scenes we see Hannibal give us subtle hints of possible abuse in his past which is why he connects with Clarice who also had to face some childhood trauma. The screenplay tactfully makes use of these conversation scenes to flesh out the character of Clarice by using Hannibal's interest in her as a psychiatrist. Ted Levine is also fantastic as Buffalo Bill. His performance gets undermentioned a lot, but he deserves a lot of credit for giving a truly disturbing performance.<br/><br/>'The Silence of the Lambs' is a near masterpiece. It is not fully realistic, but it brilliantly directed, acted and written. Beneath the disturbing exterior, the filmmaker is working on a number of levels and the introspective viewer will be able to understand how multi- layered the film genuinely is."

","Hi, my name is Adam, and I'm a horror movie addict. God, that felt stupid to say, but it seemed like the right way to start the review. I guess if you took the word horror out, you'd still have the truth. I'm a movie addict. And this is The Perfect Movie. As a matter of fact, this film is the reason I love horror movies, and movies in general. I read the book the summer after my eighth grade year (a little too young, still to really appreciate it.) The novel, let me say, as an aspiring horror writer, is excellent and ranks in my top 10 desert island books. The film changes only minor aspects of the film, and is in itself almost as brilliant, with great writing, great directing and top notch acting from Jodie Foster as FBI agent (in training) Clarice Starling, Scott Glenn as her boss, Jack Crawford. Ted Levine plays a great villain as Jame Gumb. But of course, the crown jewel is Anthony Hopkins as the demonic cannibal madman Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who offers the key to solving the film's over arching serial killer mystery. As far as horror villains go, there are two kinds. The silent embodiment of rage: Jason, Michael Myers, xenomorphs, Leatherface. And then, there are the truly terrifying, intelligent villains: John Doe, John Kramer, the cenobites and of course Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's ego, his monstrous brain, and his constant presence throughout the work are what give him his power, and his ability to remain calm, even when committing unspeakable acts of murder and mutilation are what give the film its true ""horror"" quality."

","This review will finally cover one of my favourite films of all time, Silence of the Lambs. In this film you follow the story of Clarice Starling (Jodie Forster) on her journey to join the FBI. She will do this by doing the tests required; however she is also trying to catch the evil transgender psychopath Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To do this job she has to call in the help of the FBI's most dangerous captive, Dr Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. To find him she allows Dr Lecter to get into her head to allow him to look at the files. The slow pacing mixed with tense scenes allow for a quality which was not scene before and has not really seen since. I love this film so I can be considered bias towards the film, however that bias does have some serious points, the acting is top class from everyone, especially Hopkins, and he adopted the role of a pure psychopath toying with his pray while keeping a civil look about him. Jodie Foster allows for the audience to get behind her and bond with her as a character, allowing for the audience to gain a sense of fear towards the end. The cinematography used throughout the film adds lots of things to the suspense, giving lots of close ups and allowing for the audience to get used to the lighting, music and gives a sense of fear. The lack of music ads to this as well as the music that is used is twisted and makes the listener feel unnerved. Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill works perfectly, he acts weak and fearful however when he is in a scene where he is in control, he is calm and collected, but most of all, cruel. The story is well written coming mostly from the book of the same name by Thomas Harris, winning the Bran Stoker award for best novel. The main point of the film is great, trying to entertain through an air of suspense and with a satisfying payoff. The loyalty to the original source material allows for a built up story with the correct pacing which allows the story to flow. The only flaw I could find is that they changed the ending from the original book; however even that point is asinine as the ending of the film is just as good as the book. My overall opinion? Love the film and the book from cover to cover I rate it a fantastic 5 stars. An all-time classic, definitely worth watching more than once"

"CinematicInceptions","8","2","3","16 October 2015"," Intensely interesting thriller.
","I felt like this was a bit over-hyped, but not overrated. I know those sound like the exact same thing, so I'll explain myself. The overall quality of the movie was about what I'd been led to believe it would be, but it didn't come in the way I had expected. Pretty much everything I'd heard about this movie before seeing it had something to do with Hannibal Lecter. Now, he's definitely a noteworthy and intriguing character, but not as much as his reputation seems to give him credit for. On the other hand, the serial killer plot with Buffalo Bill was more interesting than I thought it would be. Fortunately, this combination made it so that I wasn't disappointed by the hype, but that is something to be conscious of if you have high expectations for this movie, or any for that matter.<br/><br/>I won't go into too much detail with the plot to reduce spoilers. The external plot with Buffalo Bill is the most prominent, and has a good progression that will surprise the audience at times and likely won't confuse them so long as they pay attention. Hannibal Lecter is important to this plot since he gives Clarice information about Buffalo Bill, but his pathological nature takes prevalence whenever he is on screen. If you're somebody who has a hard time following complex plots, I would recommend doing a little preliminary research on the plot beyond watching the trailer. And if you are one of those people but think this will be the movie where you are ""really going to latch on to every detail"", keep working at it, but be honest with yourself and don't be afraid to ask a friend or blogger or FAQ page. It's not necessary to do that, but I think it will improve your experience and it's something I wish I had done.<br/><br/>Our protagonist is an FBI agent-in-training, Clarice Starling. She's confident in her abilities, but also aware of her youth and inexperience in the field. Both of these qualities are brought forward by the probing, vampiric, and insidious Hannibal Lecter, who seems to feed on people's souls as much as he does their bodies. He's got a lot of the qualities we love in our psychological villains in his ability to overcome the authority controlling him and the way he makes people like they are more prisoner than he is. I rather wish we got a closer look at how he deals with people he doesn't respect since Clarice seems to be one of the rare people that interest him. We see Buffalo Bill from a bird's-eye view, much as Clarice does. Most of what we/she know about him are based on second-hand accounts or evidence. Fortunately, the buildup of his off-screen reputation proves not to be disappointing in the few scenes where we see him at work. He seems to be quite as interesting a character as Lecter, though in a less psychological way. The second-tier characters consist of Dr. Chilton and Clarice's superior Jack Crawford. They're developed somewhat impressively for minor characters and have a decent amount of screen time and plot relevance.<br/><br/>I didn't find the acting hugely impressive, though the dialogue ranks among some of the better material I've come across. The directing is pretty good, creating suspense effectively throughout. The couple of action sequences might not have come off well in a strictly action movie, but since this is a thriller it worked just fine.<br/><br/>Regardless of your genre preference, I would recommend that pretty much everyone give this a try, unless you're an extremely casual movie fan that likes to watch movies passively. Otherwise, there aren't many reasons not to watch it. There aren't really any disgustingly disturbing images like you might expect, though it is certainly an intense film. It won't be as appealing to modern audiences, but don't let it's age turn you away. Just be willing to pay attention and you should be able to enjoy it. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."

","This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore to have a good suspense/thriller film.I was never a fan of this kind of movie genre but this movie caught my attention from start to finish. I couldn't look away or sleep well at night. This is a movie based off a few real life killers which makes things even scarier if you ask me. Anthony Hopkins performance as the deranged genius Hannibal Lecter earned him a well deserved Academy Award and the same was true of Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling. This film should go down in history as one of the greatest suspense films in the history of cinema."

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" has been one of my favorite movies for quite a while.<br/><br/>I actually read the book after I watched it the first time and was astounded at the differences! But then again, my vocabulary isn't too advanced and a lot of the story Thomas Harris created was a blur (the same thing happened after I saw True Grit and read the Charles Portis novel after wards.. Maybe its just a thing I have with seeing the movie first). I'm not saying the book wasn't good, but I'm more of a visual person, so watching the movie a second time was all the more interesting and just as suspenseful.<br/><br/>I swear, Anthony Hopkins is the creepiest human being portraying Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter. He isn't exactly the main character, for that spot was taken up by Jodie Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling, but he fascinates just as well. I was more afraid of Hannibal Lecter than the actual problem in the film, Buffalo Bill; that's how fantastic he played his part.<br/><br/>After watching this movie about three or four times, I finally decided to buy it on DVD! My dad and I watch it together whenever we want to, now.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen this 1990's classic, I suggest you do!"

"Red-Barracuda","10","2","3","11 May 2015"," One of the all time definitive serial killer movies
","The Silence of the Lambs surprised everybody by winning all five major Oscars and being only the third film, as well as the last, to achieve this. I say 'surprised' not because it was an unworthy winner, quite the contrary, but because it is only once in a blue moon when the Academy acknowledges any R rated film with any awards such as these.<br/><br/>Based pretty closely on the riveting Thomas Harris novel of the same name, this was the second film to feature his character Hannibal Lecter, the first being the Michael Mann thriller Manhunter (1986). Both movies take differing approaches to their broadly similar material but where the earlier film is almost clinically stylised, Lambs is a little more horror-oriented. This extends to Anthony Hopkins performance of refined malevolence as Lecter, which was one that would propel him to super-stardom. From his first appearance in a cell that looks not unlike a medieval dungeon, Hopkins is in his element playing this extremely interesting character in such a way as to maximise all possibilities. He really steals every scene he is in and this is no disrespect to Jodie Foster who is the definite lead, she also puts in an extremely good turn overall but this will always primarily be remembered as being Hopkins movie. That said, much of the overall credit has to go to director Jonathan Demme for putting together a masterfully paced and edited film, while remaining very faithful to the source novel.<br/><br/>The story has a top FBI student Clarice Starling assigned to a special case where she is to interview incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter as a way to help identify another murderer at large known as Buffalo Bill. In doing so she is forced to let Lecter into her mind, with all the inherent psychological dangers that presents.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs remains a very effective thriller that focuses its attention mostly on the psychological, yet is memorably visceral on occasion too. It's pretty intense in places, with all of the scenes involving Buffalo Bill being extremely creepy indeed. But it's also the various details of the investigation that make a huge impact. Layer upon layer of dark intrigue is slowly and expertly revealed to ultimately construct a dark masterpiece. What gives it its extra level of greatness of course is the script and performances. All-in-all, a justifiably revered and iconic film that still packs a punch."

Foster is a very likable and believable police officer, and Anthony Hopkins completely becomes his character of Hannibal Lecter. It didn't seem like an easy role to do, but he did it so naturally, with no hesitation.<br/><br/>This film won five Academy Awards and is only the third film to win the Big Five, which it completely deserved, it isn't a movie that you would expect to win Best Picture, but I am very happy it did.<br/><br/>Dramatic, terrifying at times and without a doubt film gold, I would recommend Silence of the Lambs to anyone looking for a good thriller or drama.<br/><br/>A young FBI agent must meet with a psychopathic serial killer in order to catch one who is still on the loose.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Anthony Hopkins"

For the next ten or so years, you couldn't move in a cinema for films that hugely relied on this movie, and its original source material.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for this movie,mew wouldn't have Se7en, Kiss The Girls, or even the Saw franchise.<br/><br/>Even though its a blooming scary, the film relies more on the manipulation of the protagonists, and the wonderful cat and mouse games played between key characters. There are so many red herrings going on, that the only genuine relationship in the whole movie is that of Lecter's and Starling's.<br/><br/>And what performances we have from Foster and Hopkins. These are career defining performances, and yes, they were both prolific artists before the movie for years, but ask anyone about either two, and I guarantee they will mention this movie right away.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two is electric, and although they only share a few scenes, its cinematic gold.<br/><br/>The camera-work is cold and stark, and the use of head shots subliminally breaking the fourth wall, adds to the tension, and almost makes you feel like you are in the actual narrative.<br/><br/>Its a solid movie, gripping you from the bleak opening credits, right up to one of the best lines in the film.<br/><br/>But the biggest surprise is the wonderful trick the film throws at you, duping you into thinking that the FBI are at the killers house, when it's just Starling at the door.

I have never felt a rush more powerful and exhilarating than when I watched this movie. I've seen it enough where I can now quote it line by line, but the very first time I saw the movie in its entirety, I was stunned. I was blown away. I continue to get that feeling even now when I watch for the 25th time or so. As a whole, it is such a though provoking movie. Think of the plot of Se7en, the Departed, Pulp Fiction, Inception - they all make you think and really understand the movie. To me, Silence of the Lambs does that better than any other film in history. Not to mention how great Jodie Foster as FBI trainee Clarisse Starling and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lector/Hannibal the Cannibal. When you watch this movie, don't take it for its goryness and horror. You have to take it for its deep meaning. The moth, the biggest symbol of the movie, as Dr. Lector says ""represents change"".

There has never been a more creepy, scary, and at the same time, fascinating character before or since The Silence of the Lambs was released. The closest I've seen is Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>As great as Hopkins is, let's not forget how the great the film is as a whole. Jodie Foster was outstanding as Agent Starling and she even won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her efforts. The film is also beautifully directed by Jonathan Demme, who also won an Oscar. For those counting, The Silence of the Lambs won five of the biggest Oscars, the other two being Best Picture and Best Writing/Screenplay based on the previously published novel of the same title by Thomas Harris.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best films of the last 25 years and it is one of those films that any fan of great films must watch at least once in his or her life."

As with all psychological films, it takes multiple views to absorb the full plot and ingest the actual meaning behind the film. The dynamic between Clarice and Hannibal is possibly one of the best acting duos in history, and if you pay attention you can pick up things between the two of them that you miss during the first viewing. Each character has layers and layers to them, they are complex and difficult to understand, which is what makes this movie so incredible.

"classicalsteve","10","2","3","25 May 2011"," The Darker Side of Human Nature Explored Through a Very High-Quality Yet Disturbing Film
","The Silence of the Lambs, based on the Thomas Harris book of the same name, is one of the most disturbing films based on fictional material to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Director. When you consider that films like ""My Fair Lady"", ""the Sound of Music"", ""Gandhi"", ""the Hurt Locker"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Rain Man"", and ""Forrest Gump"" have also earned the Best Picture prize, Lambs stands alone; similarly disturbing films are predominantly historical dramas. The only other Best Picture winners equaling the horror of ""Lambs"" are ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Platoon"", and ""Unforgiven"". But none of these movies ever dealt with not one but two serial-killer sociopaths in a suburban-rural setting.<br/><br/>An outstanding horror-suspense film, ""Lambs"" is not for the feint of heart. ""Lambs"" centers around three characters dealing with intense psychological dysfunction. Each character in turn not only reacts to their dysfunction in their own style but is in very different circumstances. Two of the three engage in horrific behavior of extreme violence, succumbing to the darkest side of human behavior as a result of their mental illness and dysfunctional pathology. At the story's beginning, one of them is in an institution for the criminally insane, having had a history of violent and sadistic behavior. The second is on the loose, dispatching young women for reasons yet unknown. The third character deals with her psychological issues by joining the FBI, and her reason d'etre becomes a mission to stop such behavior and rescue potential victims at the hands of psychological killers. <br/><br/>If a ""story"" is about the growth and change of a character, then Lambs' narrative is really about Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who is majoring in the Behavioral Science division which does psychological profiling of criminals, particularly serial killers. Her first real task, or test in a sense, is to psychologically profile the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, nicknamed ""the Cannibal"", played with such a believable yet sadistic sensibility by Anthony Hopkins that make Dracula and Frankenstein's monster seem more like Saturday morning cartoon villains by comparison. Lecter is possibly one of the most fascinating and simultaneously repulsive characters in fiction and film. He is a fusion of an Ivy League liberal arts professor who easily quotes ancient philosophers and the Monster of Venice, an Italian serial killer who dispatched victims, usually women, without a shred of empathy. But Lecter also has a fondness for high culture, displayed by his drawing of the Duomo in Milan. Italy. <br/><br/>We learn Lecter had been a university professor of psychology who made it a habit of eating human victims. At story's beginning, he resides at a prison of mentally disturbed criminals where Starling first meets him in person. Also, we learn the FBI is hot on the trail of a strange woman-killer, the second character nicknamed Buffalo Bill by the press. Starling and Lecter form a strange yet compelling bond, not quite true friendship but something more meaningful than mere acquaintance. Part of the story is the evolution of Starling's and Lecter's relationship. A very subtle undertone of sexual flirting is hinted at in some scenes and yet we know that these two worlds could never permanently mesh.<br/><br/>Eventually, Starling begins to solicit the help of Lecter to arrest the perpetrator of the horrid acts . We believe it's an accidental interaction at first, but then we learn that the solicitation is the brainchild of the head of the FBI's criminal behavioral division, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). Other agents had tried and failed to convince Lecter to assist, so he tries another tact: send a green trainee to Lector without telling her Crawford's real intentions. Buffalo Bill has dispatched five women, but no one at the agency can figure out his motive. With Lecter's help, Starling begins to unravel who Buffalo Bill is from a psychological standpoint as a means of finding out his identity and where he lives. Part of the narrative involves the revealing of both Starling and her target Buffalo Bill, although the most interesting and colorful character, Hannibal Lecter, remains completely enigmatic. The story then pushes into a new direction when a young woman from a prominent family is kidnapped and it is believed she has been abducted by Buffalo Bill. Can Starling extract enough information from Lecter to save the young woman before Buffalo Bill dispatches another innocent victim?<br/><br/>One of the first elements that strikes you about Lambs is its foreboding atmosphere with some scenes having a quasi-medieval flavor. When Starling first visits the corridor inside the mental prison which houses Lecter, you feel like you're walking into a medieval dungeon. The stone brick is dirty and damp, and the inmates seem like something right out of Dante's Inferno (Hell). The same is true for Buffalo Bill's hideout, a maze of dark corridors filled with strange objects, like mannequins and costumes. The place where he imprisons his victims rings of something out of the Spanish Inquisition. Themes of raw sexuality permeate the entire story, although there is no love affair between any of the characters. Simultaneously, there are also overtones of objectifying human beings. Dr Chilton, the doctor in charge of Lecter at the hospital, boasts of having his sociopath patient, ""So rare to capture one alive. From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset,"" as if Lecter is a rare object rather than a person. Also, the serial killers objectify their victims as a means of rationalizing their behavior. <br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the best horror-suspense films of its type with absolutely first-rate acting by the leads and the supports. And one of the most disturbing. But if you're looking for escapist innocent fun, Lambs will have you running under the covers, or at least switching to ""My Fair Lady"". Lecter and Buffalo Bill are the stuff nightmares are made of."

","Silence of the Lambs is probably the best movie of its kind. Its sheer intensity is unmatched. It is a superbly well-written story that involves multiple very dangerous characters, most notorious of which is Dr. Lecter (Hannibal). An FBI agent, Clarice Starling (wonderfully portrayed by Jodie Foster) needs to extract information from a dangerous psychopath Hannibal Lecter (amazingly brought to life by Anthony Hopkins) about a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).<br/><br/>There are so many elements that make Silence Of The Lambs chillingly scary. Buffalo Bill chooses young female victims and skins them. He kidnaps the daughter of a senator which quickly prompts an FBI hunt. Agent Clarice visits Dr. Lecter who is held in a maximum security prison to ask him questions about Buffalo Bill's psychological profile because he was Dr. Lecter's patient many years ago....when Dr. Lecter was a normal human being (if you can call it that).<br/><br/>I have always found the idea of a psychologist going insane and becoming a human eating monster very scary. I mean he is supposed to be the expert about human behavior to cure psychological disturbances and he is the most disturbed of all. However, he is equally brilliant. Dr. Lecter's brilliant mind brings depth to his character. Clarice's difficult task of understanding and deciphering the mind of -not one but- two psychopaths creates multi-dimensions.<br/><br/>I don't want to say too much about the story and what happens next. But let me say that the movie is full of suspense and literally breath-taking moments. After 20 years, I have not seen any other similar type of movie that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs. This movie completely changes the serial killer characters in movies and adds depth to them in an unprecedented fashion. Killers in movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Halloween (the major horror franchises) gave us faceless monsters with no character depth. They wouldn't say a word or even make a sound (this was probably done to disassociate them from regular human beings). Even though this seemed to have worked, Silence of the Lambs' depiction of killer monsters in more elaborate fashion works even better."

""The Silence of the Lambs"" is most famous for Anthony Hopkin's memorable chilling performance as the clever, charming, cultured, well mannered serial killer Dr.Hannibal Lecter. Hannibal Lecter's character is a composite based on several real life serial killers, including Ted Bundy. Jody Foster gives a powerful, intelligent complementary acting performance as the FBI agent trainee recruited to help catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill, with the help of Lecter.<br/><br/>What's most impressive about the film is the pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. They both bring intelligence, believability and a strong minded directness. They play exceptionally well off each other: Lecter is intelligent, but obviously crazy, while Starling is very sane, determined and intelligent enough to match wits and will against the evil, charming, well mannered and clever Lecter.<br/><br/>Not having seen the film in several years, with a fresh perspective, it came across to me as an unusually creepy, strange psychological film. That's a compliment. We have a rare portrayal of a transvestite serial killer, Buffalo Bill. The film contains two scenes I've never seen before, ever, in any film. The first involves Clairice Starling at the beginning of the film, shortly after she first meets Hannibal Lecter in the insane asylum dungeon. The second scene is near the end of the film and involves a very bizarre disguise used by Hannibal Lecter. <br/><br/>Hopkins performance in this film, is my all time movie villain favorite. As a thriller, it works well most of the time, narrative wise. There are a few factual errors. The film is best when both Hopkins and Foster are on screen together. Then it's quite a powerful and gripping psychological drama."

","""Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head."" – Jack Crawford.<br/><br/>No truer words have been written about the monster, Hannibal Lecter in what I call my FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME: The Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>I used to work for AMC Gateway on 59th Avenue and Bell Road in Glendale, AZ way back in 1991. I was 16, and one of the perks, was, if you were able to, watching movies at late night prior to movies being released the following day. So, I would say this was February 13th 1991. They did this to make sure the film ran correctly, audio, picture, etc. But, the employees were invited. And it was like a party: only about 10 or so inhabited their biggest theatre. It was a fantastic experience with my peers, as was the movie.<br/><br/>Jonathan Demme's masterpiece of sound and visuals rests on many factors: acting, screenplay, sound, mood, surprises, pace, dialogue, suspense, originality, opening, middle and end, comedy, character development, believability, music, score, editing and literal bite. Honestly, I could write an entire hardback on all of these aspects and still have enough for a follow-up publication. In short, this movie worked on all angles. No other movie have I ever seen, in the 1000's I have seen, hit the nail on the head on every single right move on how a movie is supposed to be made upon.<br/><br/>In what most people don't know (but it has become more common knowledge in recent years) is the follow-up/sequel to 1986's Manhunter, The Silence of the Lambs begins with Clarice Starling (Foster,) a definitive over-achiever FBI trainee. Immediately into the film, she's summoned by her mentor/soon-to-be boss (she hopes,) Crawford (Glenn) to merely interview the imprisoned ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" (Hopkins.) She suspects it's concerning on-the-loose serial killer ""Buffalo Bill"" but takes the assignment anyways.<br/><br/>Upon meeting, he doesn't just call her out; he sniffs her previous lotion and dissects her innermost fears. Undeterred, the trainee follows the leads Hannibal presents, while previously bad memories resurface and the status of a Senator's Daughter's life is at stake while in the hands of Buffalo Bill. Frankly, she's juggling a lot.<br/><br/>All the while, Crawford's actually (and surprisingly to him) impressed and Hannibal continues to taunt – whether to teach, learn, relieve boredom or use Starling, all for his own amusement. Despite his previous free existence's knowledge, before being caught as a serial cannibal/murderer, he's giving her all she needs to ""advance,"" or, in turn, catch the killer, Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb.<br/><br/>The movie is only the third (at the time) in history to ""Sweep"" the Oscars, meaning: it took all five top awards: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and (adapted) Screenplay. (For the record, I've read all the Hannibal Lecter books by Thomas Harris (all but Hannibal Rising) and I'm definitely in agreeance with that last one. No one could've translated the mood, theme or scene-by-scene as well as screenplay writer Ted Tally did.) Despite the 5 Oscars it did win, it deserved more.<br/><br/>Score! Or, the musical background music was amazing and in my top list of all time best scores. Creepy, moody and the perfect sound to match the theme/atmosphere of the film. The soundtrack, or music tracks, such as American Girl by Tom Petty and especially Goodbye Horses by Q. Lazzarus were both not only excellent choices for the film (and scenes) but, personally, they shot to my ""best of"" movie music lists. Also, it should've won for editing. This movie was beautifully cut and carefully spliced together. In addition, another award for cinematography was justified, as the movie's photography was eerie, colorful – when called for and truly put you in the character's shoes.<br/><br/>You must see this movie. Everything works. It is gory at times, really gory. And I wouldn't like a movie if that's all they gave me. It must contain a story, character depth/growth and true to the story acting. Obviously, I'm going to say this does, and I'd be right.<br/><br/>And finally it truly invented my number one favorite villain, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Sure, Brian Cox already played him in Manhunter and as good as Cox is as an actor, no one could touch Hopkins powerful performance. Apparently he did a lot of the stances, movements, creation of the monster all by himself and it paid off. Thanks to Demme for allowing him to create such an icon. He was scary, smart, deadly and had charisma all in a single breath on screen. This kind of acting job comes but once, generally, to any great actor.<br/><br/>Need more evidence that Hopkins did a role of a lifetime? His screen presence was so powerful, he even tricked the audience into thinking he appeared all throughout the film, yet was only shown for under 25 minutes, or less than a fourth of the film. Not the shortest timeframe for an actor to win Best Actor over Best Supporting Actor, but his impact not only impressed the Academy Award voters and audience, but you will truly feel his presence even when he's not on film.<br/><br/>This is largely due to the fact on how great Jodie Foster was – another role of a lifetime for her. She carried Lecter's spirit with her when she left his asylum, and on screen, that's not easy. In addition, she was vulnerable and strong, smart and slow, determined and deterred.all of these at the same time. As much as everyone, including myself, focused on how great Hopkins was, she deserves equal treatment on how masterfully she played her part.<br/><br/>""I've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it."" – Dr. Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>Actually, he's the one that made our world a lot more interesting."
"thefatgoaty","10","2","3","20 February 2010"," Scariest Movie Ever
","For me Silence of the Lambs is the all time scariest movie, because its realistic. I'm more afraid of a sadistic serial killer than a monster that doesn't exist. The whole movie is eerie, especially the dialog. This movie is so well written and the scene when Clarice Starling first meets Hannibal there was no scary music or suspenseful build up to a fright, but i was still scared. The types of things Lecter talks about, eating people, murder, dismemberment, he doesn't even flinch at it. I think this movie has one of the greatest scripts ever, one of the greatest characters ever, one of the greatest plots ever and the all time greatest title ever, if you don't understand why its called ""The Silence of the Lambs"" I won't explain but if you watch the scene where Clarice talks with Hannibal in his new cell they explain it subtly.<br/><br/>Through out the whole movie I was really confused about what to think about Hannibal, I wanted to hate him because he is a murderer that eats his victims, but I always wanted the best for him... strangely. I really wanted him to escape from captivity and on some weird level I felt like Lecter and Clarice were friends. At the same time though, I found him extremely frightening. I guess thats what makes him such a bad ass character. The other antagonist in the film was a serial killer called Buffalo Bill who is murdering girls and skinning them. I found this character unbelievably scary because of his mystery. Some directors try and make the villains scarier by giving them more screen time to see what horrible things they are capable. I think when a character is seen more through out a film, a sense of familiarity is formed with the character. Demme made it so you didn't see much of Buffalo Bill, thus more mysterious and scary. Any scenes with him in it are extremely disturbing, like the infamous ""Put the Lotion on the Skin"" scene. <br/><br/>The whole plot is compelling and it's very rare for a film to make you feel like the main character was always in trouble. The way the whole mystery is unraveled is clever and well put together. If you are more into a cheap scare film with jumps and sh*t your pants moments I would suggest not watching this movie but if your into realistic horror and psychedelic thrillers The Silence of the Lambs is well worth watching. A nearly perfect film."

","Clarice Starling is a naive, country, raw FBI recruit who enlists the help of a convicted, confined serial killer mastermind, Hannibal Lector to solve a string of homicides.

From the understated opening Title, to the mesmerizing, haunting soundtrack this movie is a living, breathing entity that has a heartbeat and will live in your inner soul for the rest of your days.

"happyendingrocks","10","2","3","12 July 2009"," Absolutely perfect
","I'm going to try to be brief with this write-up, since almost everyone can already agree that Silence Of The Lambs succeeds as a nail-biting thriller, one of the best examples of ensemble acting in modern cinema, and more simply as a brilliant motion picture. I won't be able to add much on that front, certainly.<br/><br/>However, Silence Of The Lambs is most truly notable for being the only genuine horror film to ever win a Best Picture Oscar. Now, I'm not one to consider this a particularly profound achievement, since I have almost never agreed with the choices of the Academy in regards to their silly statuettes (this one being a rare exception). But, the nomination and victory of Silence Of The Lambs is also a victory for the horror genre, a much maligned and at times unfairly targeted film classification that has been deemed damaging by the moral powers that be. It may be going too far to say that the recognition of SOTL is an acknowledgment that horror films can be accepted as art (especially since most fans would argue that landmark films like Dawn Of The Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween proved that distinction a full decade before), but it certainly speaks volumes about horror's acceptance into mainstream culture and bridges the gap between decades where genre films opened on a meager amount of screens and our current climate, where horror films routinely top the box office upon their release.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that SOTL is the one film largely inspired by the infamous tale of real-life sicko Ed Gein that doesn't tout this inspiration. This is further ironic since Silence Of The Lambs is a much more accurate visualization of Gein's deeds that the two most famous films that are historically viewed as on-screen representations of elements of the Gein story, Psycho and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Since nearly any horrific deed a writer of the macabre can conjure has likely happened through the course of real events (or be found in the writings of Poe and Shakespeare, for that matter), it's unlikely that the film-makers were unaware of the connection between Gein and Jame Gumb, but their distancing actually serves the film, because we become singularly focused on Gumb instead of comparing his work to Gein's (even though I just did so here... I'm definitely overthinking this, and I'm already being way more long-winded than I was intending).<br/><br/>So, awards and all that crap are definitely nice, but the true impact of Silence Of The Lambs must come from the film itself, and not from any historical or achievement-based standpoint. In that regard, SOTL must be considered one of the most classy, well acted, and generally terrifying horror films of all time.<br/><br/>Every performance in this film serves as a defining role for the players, and though all eyes are deservedly on Anthony Hopkins' textbook perfect essay of Hannibal Lecter, I'd rather spend my two minutes here saying publicly that Ted Levine delivers by far the most nuanced and well-realized screen portrayal of a serial killer ever put to film. This is especially impressive considering how little screen-time Levine has in the film, and every moment spent developing his character adds a new layer to his twisted and complex megalomaniacal portrait of the sickness that dwells within humans on this planet filled with as much self-loathing and everyone else-loathing as Jame Gumb. Amazingly, despite the truly horrific deeds we seem him commit, he remains a sympathetic character, and Levine's portrayal is so precise that we always see the loneliness and misery that permeates this dejected predator between his bouts of pathos-seeking rage.<br/><br/>The word ""masterpiece"" doesn't come from this keyboard lightly, but Silence Of The Lambs is simply a perfect film, and not only the best picture of 1991, but one of the best of all time. If you are reading this entry because you agree with that assessment, then I thank you for celebrating one of my favorite films with me. However, if you are genuinely seeking out information on SOTL because you haven't seen it, then the preceding minutes you spent reading this are only delaying you from experiencing this incredible film for yourself. Since you should have stopped reading this several paragraphs ago and just started watching the thing, I won't keep you any longer."
"varun-mentor","10","2","3","25 May 2009"," Mindblowing psycho thriller!!! *spoilers*
","I have seen almost all the major titles in IMDb top 100 but this one stands out on its 17 minutes camera time. All the fans must know what that means, Dr Lecter blows your psyche away with those close face camera shots (superb cinematography, best I have seen), penetrating eyes, unflinching wilfuly crafted dialogs and layer by layer account of psycho analysis of a crime and criminal.<br/><br/>I watched this movie last night only and I wasn't able to sleep properly, the intense sequences and the confrontations between lecter and clarice were so dramatic and real, they totally grips your psyche and pulls it deeper and deeper inside the mind of a serial criminal slowly making you believe the thin line dilemma between how criminal a crime could be and the other side of the delusion.<br/><br/>Silence of the lambs is mainly about 3 characters, Clarice, Lecter and Bill. Clarice (Foster) is a young FBI agent sent as a curve ball after failed attempts to grill Dr Lecter (Hopkins, hail hopkins, generation after generation will praise thy performance as the greatest screen presence and portrayal of a psychotic cannibal), the motive for which changes gradually in getting Lecter to catch a dreaded serial psychopath killer, lady skinner, Buffalo bill. As the movie progresses, you feel the synchronicity between Clarice and Lecter so amazing, their eyes doing the communication and you reading between the intervention.<br/><br/>Especially the escape from prison scene of Dr lecter and initial confrontation of Clarice with Dr Lecter when you get the justification for the title is awesome and mind boggling cinema at its best.<br/><br/>My personal favorite: Lecter kills the policemen and then looks up with light focused on his face and his face covered with blood while he tuning his finger to symphony with closed eyes in peace.<br/><br/>Kudos Hopkins! 10/10"
"gavin6942","8","2","3","18 June 2008"," Modern Masterpiece and For Good Reason
","Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) enters into a relationship with Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant but deranged flesh-eating psychiatrist. He may be her only hope in catching Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), a new serial killer who strips women of their skin for his own nefarious purposes. Can she trust him? ""Silence of the Lambs"" won a few Academy Awards, and it's plain to see why. Everyone involved does a wonderful job, and even after several viewings the movie remains fresh and enjoyable. I still haven't figured out what kind of accent Jodie Foster has, and I probably never will. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Lecter, and I think it goes without saying that this will be the role he is remembered for. Maybe not his best role, but certainly his most widely received.<br/><br/>The film has a timeless quality to it. Of course, we can tell the year the film was made from the clothing styles and production quality of the film. But there's nothing glaringly time-specific about it (compare it to ""Manhunter"" with the pastel jackets). Some things may seem silly and unintentionally comedic (there are excessive amounts of close-ups on Lecter that make me chuckle) but overall it's a good, smooth showing.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into detail about the film, director Jonathan Demme's vision or the changes from book to film (such as the number of Lecter's fingers). The film has been combed through a hundred times by critics and fans, and I'm merely adding an opinion that's been voiced before. But I will say this: as of 2008, the film retains all the qualities and positive aspects attributed to it when it first arrived in theaters. One suspects it always will."
"screenman","10","2","3","17 May 2008"," Supreme Cinema.
","This is one of those very rare movies in which every detail meshes. It's a whole piece. A comparison that comes most readily to mind is 'The Usual Suspects'.<br/><br/>From the beautifully evocative orchestral music onwards, you just know you're about to witness something special. The camera-craft and lighting are at times quite sublime, the acting entirely believable. For those with a decent sound-system, one can almost feel the changes of ambiance. Take, for example, Clarice Starling's first encounter with Hannibal. A slight echo typical of the prison facility above ground, is lost as she descends into the catacomb-like dungeon of the most dangerous inmates. Now there is no resonance at all. Instead we have a thick, claustrophobic silence that is frighteningly intimate. This is a nerve-racking aural prelude to their first meeting at the other end of the chamber. It is wonderfully crafted. And because it serves our expectations so well, we take it for granted. For this reason, good quality sound-engineering is often overlooked.<br/><br/>And so the movie goes on. Dr Lecter is standing in the middle of his cell. It's a strange, unnatural posture, as if momentarily paused from some action. But he just remains, quiet, still, fixedly watching. <br/><br/>The exchanges between nervous Clarice and himself are amongst the classics of cinema. Jodie Foster is ideal with her nervous palpitation, but still driven by pride and ambition to achieve something, whilst Anthony Hopkins, playfully enigmatic, intelligent, and with a barely-restrained madness, sets her a perfect foil.<br/><br/>The plot twists are numerous and clever. The discovery slow, slick and often shocking. The script is arch, witty, but still entirely believable, and delivered by a cast of actors who never put a foot wrong.<br/><br/>Small town America is depicted as a sad failure. Properties are neglected. The people appear defeated. The lighting is always dull, with the colours washed-out. It's grim. The sun never seems to shine. The music is pensive and thoughtful. A great deal of attention went into describing emotion by light and sound, and once again we can easily take it for granted. But someone thought it all out, piece by piece.<br/><br/>Fast forward to Buffalo Bill's lair. We meet the man himself at last. He is naked, obsessing over his pathological delusion. In the mirror he conceals his genitalia between his legs as metamorphosis into femininity. A different music is playing - heavy metal.<br/><br/>Clarice has found him out. But he has descended into a sub-basement hell and she must follow and find him. Groping in absolute darkness amongst unimaginable ghastly relics of wickedness we see her at last from Bill's perspective. He has an image intensifier and can observe her every move. She is desperately afraid but yet more courageous still. She will not be deterred. In the stifling confinement we hear her hyper-ventilating with terror and barely able to hold her gun steady. <br/><br/>Then it's over. Bill is disclosed by his own sound and seen in a whirl of momentary gun-flashes. During the chaos a blind is disturbed and at last there is sweet daylight flooding in. A Chinese-lantern affair is twirling gracefully in its glare. The audience collectively begin breathing again.<br/><br/>This movie is a master-class in cinema as an art-form. It is possible to exhaust one's fund of superlatives in praise. I cannot watch it very often because I am drained by the sheer emotional experience. When Hollywood does it right, they really cannot be bettered. Oscars for best film, best director, best screenplay, and best actors for both Hopkins and Foster, with two other nominations - never more deserved.<br/><br/>As a footnote to an earlier commentator. Apart from the corpses, the only character in the movie to be seen naked is that of buffalo Bill himself. And even he spares our sensibilities. At no time does Jodie Foster expose herself, neither does Anthony Hopkins, nor indeed anyone else. I begin to wonder if that commentator was watching a different movie."

","Films don't usually get as creepy or thrilling as the top-notch, first-class creepy and chilling thriller known as Silence of the Lambs. There is nothing that can take your breath away with so much style and wit like Silence of the Lambs does. You'll need to watch this film in order to understand how thrillers are created and executed.<br/><br/>The young and feminine Clarice Starling, who is training to be an F.B.I. agent, must find the whereabouts of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. The only way possible is interviewing a captured serial killer named Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.<br/><br/>Hannibal Lecter is perhaps the best movie villain that ever lived. Anthony Hopkins plays his role with perfection, because you will hear Lecter's voice stuck inside your head. ""I ate his liver with fava beans and a nice chianti,"" will re-play in your head over and over. Hopkins deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the most sinister character on the big screen. Creepy, sinister, devilish, clever and cannibalistic-How much better can it get? If the villain isn't enough to entertain you, then perhaps the hero will. <br/><br/>Jodie Foster, also a gem as the role, plays the feminine F.B.I agent in training, Clarice Starling. She is seemed to be well-liked (often flirted with) but insecure and very timid. Starling is very realistic, and shows how timid the human nature can be.<br/><br/>At a first viewing, all I could keep my mind on was the prison escape scene. I kept repeated the phrase ""Oh God,"" and kept preparing myself for what was next. During a second viewing I realized the depth of the story line and the genius behind it all.<br/><br/>One thing this movie definitely has is atmosphere. The killings, the characters, the dialog, and everything else that leads up to the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter makes the film look so delightfully creepy. Even though Hannibal is silent when we first see him, it is considered one of the creepiest introductions ever made. Of course, we can't forget about this man. Even after the ending, he delivers one last line that sends shivers down our spines.<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs may make you a bit disgusted, yet thrilled and excited. You will stay on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece, atmospheric thriller.<br/><br/>10/10"

Anthony Hopkins is just wild in his Academy Award winning performance. I find it amazing that I was getting chills up my spine just from watching him play Lecter. This is the best of his Lecter performances, as the other movies (that would be Hannibal and Red Dragon (though they were okay) lack the dramatical oomph so prevalent in this one.

This film is a brilliant, tightly-plotted masterpiece, a tour de force of masterful acting, absorbing dialogue, and tempo and pacing that is at once highly tense and soothingly mesmerizing. The give-and-take between Starling and Lector has an almost heartbeat-like rhythm, quiet and subtle yet extraordinarily powerful. I don't think it's inappropriate to say that this film doesn't hit any truly false notes. The main reason that my friends often won't watch this film is simply because it scares them too much -- which, I believe, is one of the film's greatest triumphs."

","This is the best horror movie ever made for several reasons. While the story is terrifying and grizzly, Demme never lets it become schlocky or sensational. He plays is straight, so to speak, never letting the plot become secondary. Perhaps a more... ambitious, director would have added more creepy atmosphere (like David Fincher does with ""Se7en""), but Demme smartly keeps it real, which makes it all the more terrifying. Nothing that happens in this movie couldn't happen in real life (and it does happen). This approach also harnesses the lead performers. He never lets Foster get too melodramatic, and never lets Hopkins become a flat Halloween mask. As frightening as the film is, there is a moral core throughout that neither hides completely nor brow-beats you. I have a bunch of videos and DVD's, but when almost any friend comes over and looks them over, they always want to watch ""Silence of the Lambs."" It's uncanny."

","When I first saw this film, I was about 14, lying in my bed, watching it in German on TV late at night, with the lights on, and almost falling asleep (probably actually dozing for a couple of minutes now and then). When I was waking up once, noticing Hannibal Lecter on my television screen, looking at me with his alive, clear eyes and speaking to me about screaming lambs, that was surely one of the most exciting moments in my movie-interested life. So it is definitely a good idea to see this at night, with one's concentration wandering away.<br/><br/>Now I saw it again (at daylight!), and many other things struck me. The character of Catherine Martin is actually really cool. The snobbish daughter of a famous politician reacts to the terrible things that are done to her in an unusually offensive way - it looks as if she was never giving up.<br/><br/>And then did you notice how utterly serious this film is? There is not a single funny scene in it. And this is really great! Which other feature film today manages to be taken seriously by everybody and never being unintentionally funny although it does not have a single moment of irony? The humorous take-outs attached to the DVD version seem really weird and out of place when you are in the mood this unbelievable film creates."

Hopkins did a great job in the movie as Dr. Lecter to.But it is only my opinion tho.Make YOUR opinion- SEE Dr. Hannibal Lecter IN ACTION :)"

","This is one of the all time great police thrillers. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is absolutely flawless and engrossing. It's fast paced and relentless from the moment it begins. This movie is also a first for having a female lead role.

"morgan1976","10","2","3","20 August 2004"," Excellent!
","When I first saw the trailer to this in the theaters, I was instantly interested in it, so I read the book before it's release.  Although movies seldom live up to the respective novels in which their based, this one equals it, but in different ways.  I have to hand it to Ted Tally for his script adaptation; his script keeps the core of the story while stripping away the more complex and unnecessary aspects of the novel and still makes it suspenseful and interesting.  The acting is magnificent, Foster plays Clarice with what looks like such ease, and yet keeps the character complex, smart, strong, and comfortably flawed, and aware of those flaws.  Hopkins is equally brilliant as Lecter: he is everything Clarice is but more charming and unaware he possesses any flaws at all.  One of the things I love about the film is it's simplicity.  The sets and clothes look normal, unimportant, everyday, cheap.  Nothing's flashy or overly ornate looking.  It still holds up very well after 13 years.  Won Oscars for Best Actor, Actress, Adapted Screenplay, Director, and Picture.  Highly recommended."

","Lector Quotes: ""People may say were in love.""  Call it what you want, this film is a scary, crazy, sacred love story.  Clarice (Jodie Foster) has a dark past, much like Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) who has a hunger to eat the flesh of human beings. There's a scene when Lector finnaly helps Clarice to let go of her past, and as she's about to walk away he touches her finger. That touch has all of his emotions, love, anger, and the rest is all of the above. But that is what I mean by sacred, its weired but sacred.<br/><br/>THE PLOT<br/><br/>A vicious psycopath is murdering women throughout the midwest. Believing it takes one to know one, the F.B.I. sends agent Clarice Starling (Foster) to interview a prisoner who may provide clues to the killer's actions. That prisoner is Hannibal Lector (Hopkins), a brilliant, demented cannibal who agrees to help Starling only if she'll feed his morbid curiosity with details of her own complicated life. But as their relationship develops, Starling is forced to confront not only her own hidden demons, but also an evil so powerful that she may not have the strength to stop it.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster deliver sensational performances, and portray complicated and enigmatic characters. The only film that I remembered scaring me like this was ""Psycho"", and thats what we have to compare this film to. ""Psycho"", ""The Exorcist"" and even the modern thrillers, like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs.""<br/><br/>I love this film, I give it ****(out of 4 stars)."

","The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most thrilling, well-made movies of all time. Having been drawn up from Thomas Harris' bestselling novel, the movie is flawlessly written and possesses immaculate acting from all characters involved, which becomes, deservedly, the heart of the film. While all involved became their roles and acted superbly, it is really Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins who take the credit come judging time. The characters are so different: Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, AFI's number one villain, a freakishly brilliant and frighteningly destructive serial cannibal, whose psychotic mind hosts the facts and clues everyone needs to solve the case and track down the elusive Buffalo Bill. Foster is Clarice Starling, the protagonist, the incredibly strong, courageous and sharp heroine of the story, who overcomes her scarred past and measly FBI trainee label to surge past the real FBI and catch up to Bill herself. It is impossible to walk away from this film without numerous thoughts racing through your mind, especially about the sparkling acting, story, directing and all-around movie's production. Silence of the Lambs has become one of America's greatest films, a psychological thriller that makes you think every step of the way. Oscars for best actress Jodie Foster, actor Anthony Hopkins and director Jonathan Demme. Well deserved."

","This is one fantastic movie. Anthony Hopkins plays the brilliant, all knowing, Dr. Hannibal Lecter who 'helps' in his one unique style(which becomes clearer each time you see the movie), rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling track down 'Buffalo Bill', serial killer. Lecter, the genius that he is, perceives Starlings inner demons and want to know more about her in exchange for information about the serial killer. His line: ""Quid pro quo, Clarice. Quid pro quo. You tell me things, I tell you things"" is my (and my wife's) favorite. Lecter engineers events and makes a daring escape which is gripping to watch. Hopkins portrayal of Lecter has been voted by AFI as the the number 1 villain of all time and deserves it all time. The film deservedly won Oscars for best film, best director(Jonathan Demme) , best actor, best actress and best screenplay. The only other film to have won all five top Oscars was 'It happened one night' (1934)."

"stryker-5","Null","2","3","5 February 2000"," ""You Don't Want Hannibal Lecter Inside Your Head""
","Demme and his long-time collaborator, Tak Fujimoto, have a crack at turning a weird novel into a movie.  I'm afraid to say that it doesn't work.<br/><br/>    There are moments when the film seems about to go somewhere interesting, but each time the idea fizzles out.  Clarice's flashback memories are evoked by Lecter's nasty mindgames, but in the end her feelings for her lost father are opened up too pedantically and the chance to do something truly disturbing is lost.  An exquisite dilemma is set up - should Agent Starling flout her orders and training, and subject herself to appalling risks, in order to save the endangered Catherine?  But Lecter decides to pursue other objectives, and the potential is squandered.<br/><br/>    Intelligence is a fine thing in a film, and it is very satisfying for the viewer to see the clues unravelled in a thriller.  However, cleverness for its own sake, unanchored in the bedrock of character, is a pernicious thing.  Lecter's anagrams ('Hester Mofet') don't come off, partly because they are too remote from the chase itself, and partly because they have to be explained to the audience.  ""We covet what we see every day ..."" - this is hopelessly poor as a clue, and when the agents solve it, I for one am reminded of the TV ""Batman"" episode when the Penguin commits robberies all over Gotham which, when marked on the map, sketch out the shape of his distinctive hat.  It's as far-fetched as that.<br/><br/>    Doctor Chilton is awful.  He is a cartoon character, outlandishly pompous and unsympathetic.  The prisoner's escape ploy makes me cringe, it is so preposterous - wouldn't the paramedics actually try to examine the supposed facial wounds?  And why are they pumping him full of Ringer's solution without ascertaining that he's losing haemostatic pressure?<br/><br/>    Admittedly, Clarice's time in Bill's house is psychologically gripping, but this has nothing to do with the film's alleged cleverness.  It is the oldest device of all, to get us to 'know' the girl, so that we make some emotional investment in her, then stick her in an old dark house with the creepy bad guy.  Nothing about that final sequence stands up to even the lightest analysis.  Why doesn't the FBI agent simply call for back-up, and stay put?  Once she locates the victim, isn't her duty to stay with her to protect her?  Once Bill eludes the agent, why doesn't he just escape?  He can't want to kill the agent as part of his compulsion.  She doesn't come close to fitting the victim profile that the film has so laboriously developed for us.  He must know that if he remains at the scene, other agents will arrive soon.<br/><br/>    Lecter is interesting enough initially, but one has to question the way the film makes a hero of him.  Are psychotic killers imprisoned in cages in large rooms like this?  Are they handcuffed to the bars at mealtime?  And supervised by a team of two no-brainers?  Can they dupe SWAT teams and medical staff with ease, and escape, blood-soaked, from busy cities?  Do we really prefer Lecter to Chilton?  And if we do, should we?  I don't want Hannibal inside my head, not because he is terrifying (which he isn't), but because he is a waste of my time."
"witch king","10","2","3","22 October 1998"," This movie takes a real bite out of you!
","The normal human being's fear of being attacked, bitten open in a violently impersonal manner and then taken in as food is as old as the first human being's shattering witness of such a primordial act. In the thousands of years of human evolution, intelligence has armored [most of us] against predations of that horrible sort. But even more incomprehensible is an attack, for mere hunger's sake, by one human being upon another! When first we see Dr. Hannibal Lecter, his madness is merely the subject of comment, responsible or otherwise. As we view him [uncomfortably] from the safety of a theatre seat, we can only imagine the deep wells of need which forced him to savage his fellow human beings in this manner, and this makes all the more terrible the awful scene in the Memphis courthouse. Into all this walks Clarice Starling, her innocence and anxiety both touching and troubling. She is essentially tricked into taking the assignment to ""interview"" Lecter by her superior, Jack Crawford, who callously deems her expendable. She somehow summons the rural courage of her youth, forged from the furnace of her weary sufferings, and becomes the blank sheet for both Crawford's and Lecter's amusement. As the result of being pulled in opposite directions in the murderous tug-of-war between Lecter and Crawford, Starling is almost totally alone in the film. In spite of her genuine liking for Aredlia Mapp, Starling's isolation is nearly so complete as to be claustrophobic. Director Jonathan Demme's finely-nuanced work here is well served. Her enlightenment takes place primarily in darkness, whether the setting is Lecter's cell in the dungeon, or whether the apotheosis takes place in the demon's lair. There are almost no likeable characters in the film save Starling. This makes it easy to root for her to overcome the furies which have pursued her since her tenth year. Clarice's predatory instincts are to bring a vicious psychopath within the scope of punishment. In sharp contrast, the other main characters in the film are possessed of predatory natures of a baser, more primitive kind, whether it is Dr. Frederick Chilton's need for sex, or Crawford's need for control, or Lecter's need to destroy for pleasure. The music score by Howard Shore is reminiscent, in a eerie way, of Bernard Herrmann's work in Psycho. Shore's opening theme foreshadows the loneliness and desperation of Starling's dual quest, which is to kill both beasts: the one without and the one within."

","I am not the world's biggest Jonathan Demme fan. I have to admit however that The Silence Of The Lambs is a great foray into film-making. Demme's use of close-ups are there to put you in the face of the horror that is serial killing. Hopkins performance is a stand-out one, although I didn't care for Jodie Foster's performance much at all. Foster's southern accent sounded forced and slurry. This film is tight though and at 118 minutes it never seems to be long or drawn out. There are many scenes in this film you will never forget and many more that you will try to forget for a lifetime."

After a string of bizarre murders, FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is hired to interview psychopath Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to find the perpetrator. In the process, we get to learn some very interesting things about both Starling and Lecter. The main thing is that, despite how vile Lecter is, we can't help but admire him. And I don't mean just because he's helping Clarice; something about the guy, you just gotta love him.<br/><br/>In case you're squeamish, I should remind you that this movie contains some very ugly scenes. But don't worry, director Jonathan Demme knows how to handle them. This masterful combination of acting, directing and writing helped ""The Silence of the Lambs"" win the top five Academy Awards, putting it in a league with only ""It Happened One Night"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Watching the movie, you will agree that the movie deserved these awards. In fact, you just might want to have an old friend (over) for dinner."

","What is so special about this film? I've watched it once, about a year ago, and could never figure it out myself. What I saw was a pretty good thriller which bombed out at the very end. I never thought the acting was all that great either. I think Anthony Hopkins was overacting, and I thought it was one of Jodie Foster's slightest performances. She had a more complex character in Freaky Friday. <br/><br/>Oh, and the end that I mentioned above (I guess SPOILERS):<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Jodie Foster just stumbles on Buffalo Bob while following her clues. It seemed believable to me that she might come upon him before she actually new exactly who she was confronting. But it also made the film seem rushed to actually have the final showdown as soon as she accidentally runs into Buffalo Bob. It almost seemed to me as if they decided that the movie was too long at that point, and that they should just let this coincidence develop into a finale, even if it was premature. If you don't understand what I am talking about, that is, if you thought the film ended at the correct time, read Roger Ebert's review of the film. I did not develop my opinion from his review either, he  just confirmed my suspicions. I don't think Silence of the Lambs was particularly fascinating elsewhere, but it was often entertaining. I would have given it a 7/10, but the sloppy ending knocks it down to a 6/10. Jesus, how did the Academy remember this at awards time. 1992 must have been a slow year."

","Other than Hannibal there is nothing. He was the only interesting part but he wasn't even the main character or villain. This buffalo bill character had absolutely no development and his reasons were never explained. He wanted to turn into a woman. Okay...? Thats an interesting idea but it came out of nowhere and we not at all developed. Clarice was EXTREMELY dull. She had no personality or character development. I feel like the writers noticed that half way through the movie and just threw in the story about her on the farm with the lambs to make her seem more interesting and she cried like she was so broken up by it. But showed absolutely no emotion before that to show that she had a troubled passed. So that was weird. But even as I watched it I thought that maybe this was something she had bottled up and now it was released and she would be become a better character...but nope. After that she went right back to be dull plank of wood type character. So what exactly did this movie have.

Hopkins manages to be both menacing and gracious as this cultivated serial killer, it's one of the most unique pieces of acting in cinema history and his Best Actor Oscar was well deserved. Jonathan Demme's direction is spot-on: he crafts a chilling atmosphere and a realistic, believable world that makes the film's story all the more engaging.

","""People will say we're in love,"" jokes Lecter, as he tantalisingly squares up young FBI trainee Clarice Starling in the tense first meeting. The excellence in Demme's direction comes from knowing what to linger on and what to hint at. He milks that first encounter of the two leads to its extremes, leading a young Foster down into the underground cells, past a room flooded in frantic red light (along with strict instruction and warning) and finally along that long corridor. The other prisoners leer and jeer as expected, but arriving at the end is a glass cell and that still and unblinking monster in Lecter. This very first conversation is impeccably shot; they trade blows and tight POVs immerse us into their mind's inner sanctums, and as Clarice's thin facade and accent is shattered by a few choice words, she is pushed off centre, disorientated and vulnerable. The plexiglass walls augment the atmosphere of unnerving intimacy between the unconventional pair. Like several other figures throughout the film, Lecter's male gaze seeps into the frame from front on and in extreme close-up, hungrily eating up Clarice's insecure psyche and exposing the screaming of the lambs in her dreams. Foster plays this part magnificently, not with acts of bravado, but in the nervous addressing of a room full of male police officers questioning her authority, in the low-class accent she tries desperately to mask, and in her sense of honesty and goodness that sets her apart and convinces Lecter to take a liking to her. ""Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?"" We experience this in the rather nervous way her POV is presented to us, gazing absent-mindedly in every new scene, scanning the surroundings, and trying to avoid the sexualising and trivialising gazes of the male dominated law enforcement agency, which she must navigate with self awareness and a casual, tactful disposition despite it evidently worrying her. Lecter's eyes are also fixated intensely, but not on her body. <br/><br/>Apart from the harrowing monologues of the screaming of the lambs from Foster, there are other ways that Demme increasingly notes her state of mind. Her introduction has her determined in the midst of male power and domination, no better expressed than when she enters an elevator full of male agents a good head taller than her. Mid investigation, she creeps over to the slightly ajar door, and with a smooth edit, we are transported to her youth, her father's funeral that began the terrifying downward spiral of her life. She makes the initial breakthrough with Lecter and expresses her frustration at being used by her superior, Jack Crawford, and the fading light within the tunnel is forced back into the frame via the car mirror, opposite Clarice's increasingly independence and wariness. And in that brilliant misdirection just before the climax, two operations are crosscut with the utmost precision, the complex man power of the SWAT take-down, and the pleasant but curious face of Clarice, not yet aware that she has stumbled onto Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>Opposite her is the demented yet strangely eloquent and intelligent Hannibal Lecter, a character which Anthony Hopkins lifts into classic film territory with his performance. When a golden pen is cast wayward in the holding cell, we are given a moment's glance, like Lecter and his eyes light up behind that grotesque and terrifying mask, Hopkins immediately conveying his intentions. We fear him so much more for the things unseen, our imagination going haywire as we witness him pull off a bloodied mask of skin in the ambulance, or as we stumble into the third floor with a officer hung up like a gory tapestry, or in that final haunting credits sequence, as he plots the meal of his former nemesis. Yet he remains staunchly interested in Clarice; in a fleeting close-up where they exchange files, their fingers touch for the only time in the film, yet we don't flinch, because strangely like Clarice, we know that he means her no harm. It's a sort of agitated confidence, after the brutality of Lecter's escape that flashes with terrifying aggressiveness and disregard for human life. <br/><br/>His advice and assistance steers Clarice into the terrifying climax in the basement, the tensest sequence in the film. Shore's score simmers menacingly beneath the surface as Clarice prepares to enter each room of uncharted territory, the sound design magnifying each heavy breath and gasp, as well as the faint cries of the kidnapped daughter and the poodle's frenzied barking. As she kicks open each door, the camera doesn't immediately peer in and reveal its empty non-threatening contents, but holds onto Foster's panicked sweeping glance and brief window of relief. This forbids us from gaining a foothold onto the scene, and like Clarice we are constantly looking over our shoulder, even more so when the lights are switched off and she is forced to fumble around while the eerie night vision places us right in those slimy hands of Bill. The dread is perhaps a little cheapened by the slow-motion reaction and gunshot, but all the same, a film shows its excellence in sustaining tension when you are forced to back away a little. Here is the only horror film to win Best Picture, one which drives the audience and the horrors of imagination along the edge, brimming with nervous apprehension and fear. Best served with some fava beans and a nice Chianti."

"samwellcross","10","1","1","8 September 2015"," Deeply scary.
","Silence of the lambs has to be simply put the best crime thriller of it's kind narrowly beating out Se7en. The plot is unique in that FBI cadet Clarice Starling has to investigate the brutal murders of the Buffalo Bill serial killer by using the specialist advice of incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter. Sir Anthony Hopkins is that good as Lecter that you forget that he's not actually the main villain in the film, which makes his escape all the more shocking, and he brings a new layer to the character that Brian Cox was slightly lacking. Jodie Foster puts in another top of the range performance as the aforementioned, toyed with FBI cadet. Yet she manages in certain cases it seems to hold her own and even rattle Lecter. Jonathon Demme's direction is very good as he always keeps a sense of realism in the film without holding back on the shocking moments. This is a very deep and dark thriller that shouldn't be watched by people with nervous dispositions. It has no equals in it's own semi-genre, and has given new life into an all time legendary character. A definite 10/10 if ever there was one."

","This film is beyond its time. The movie goes through the solving of the death of a girl and the disappearance of a governor's daughter who the new detective figures is connected to the most recent killings of a man by the name of Buffalo Bill. The only person who could know anything of the man is murderer Hannible Lector who is also a canible. The detective and Hannible form an unique bond that no person has ever been able to have with him. Without giving direct information, the detective was able to to piece together the clues of where Bill could be located. In the end they're able to capture him as well as the Governor's daughter. What I appreciate most about the film is its ability to keep one on their feet. From the moment that she walks down the stairs of the jail to see Hannible to the moment she walks into Bill's house alone. The best scene was for sure when Hannible was able to be escape from the polices custody. It's ironic that for this one man they needed two helicopters, a squad team and practically the entire police department and he was still able to out smart them. No doubt in my mind did this movie deserve every award it ever received."

","I don't think I relaxed the white knuckle grip on the edge of my seat from start to finish. This is what story telling is all about. It's easily the type of film that whenever you catch it on t.v., you have to watch it till the end, commercial breaks, time constraints and all. Jodie foster impressed me more in this film than she has in any other that I have seen her in. And to say that Mr Hopkins is what nightmares are made of would really not be giving him enough credit for what he is able to pull off on this film.The pace of the story, the soundtrack, even the amount of violence that they decide to use or not use is so well done in shaping this film."
"MUFCOK","9","1","1","9 February 2015"," One of the greatest thrillers of all time
","I read somewhere that Anthony Hopkins has little more than 15 minutes actual screen time in a feature that runs just under two hours. For me, whenever Silence of the Lambs is brought up I instantly think of Dr Hannibal Lecter. This speaks volumes for how much of a powerful and memorable performance he gives as one of the best villains of all time, despite only featuring for around an eighth of the movie. His performance/character is faultless and gives a completely different approach to so many other villains we see in the movies, he is calm, well educated, has an intelligent vocabulary, witty sarcasm and is brutally honest. But on the other hand he is also intriguing, disturbing and very uneasy to watch. The greatest thing about him though is how he is caged off from the world in each of his scenes, like a monster, he isn't accessible and comes across as untouchable. The most baffling thing of all though is that despite Hopkins playing a serial killer cannibal who is criminally deranged, you actually have a strange sense of fondness towards him. At one point I felt myself feeling sorry for him, how is that even possible? Hats off to the creators and Anthony Hopkins for that to give the viewer that feeling, quite the achievement!<br/><br/>Jodie Foster gives an incredible performance and this is easily my favourite out of all the roles she has played. She plays a young, trainee detective who is extremely vulnerable and is struggling to deal with the demons of her childhood. Buffalo Bill is a serial killer on the loose and the FBI are running out of time to catch him, Jodie Foster's character is sent to visit Hannibal Lecter to do research into the mind of a serial killer. She visits him in his confined mental institute where he is serving his life sentence. Hannibal Lecter starts to mentor Jodie Foster and the few scenes we get of these two, either on opposite side of reinforced glass are some of the most intense but somehow touching scenes I have experienced.<br/><br/>The plot is perfect and stays very grounded, it knows what it wants to be and it stays true to itself throughout. It doesn't get over complicated or take any unnecessary risks, it simply does what it needs to and the actors do the rest with their fantastic characters and script. There is one scene in particular that stays in my mind when thinking of this movie and It is very tense and disturbing but shows us just what we need to see, it isn't overly gory for the sake of it. This is what Silence of the Lambs does so well, it is very graphic yet it doesn't make you want to look away in disgust, instead it connects with you very well.<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs has it all, it has a solid plot, characters with depth and development, incredible acting, tension and a great script. All it needs in my opinion is some more screen time for Hannibal Lector as he really is a faultless villain but then on the other hand the way he is used is subtle and could well be more effective because of this. Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest thrillers I have seen and it deserves all the awards and accolades it has received over the past 24 years.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This movie was amazing. The dialogue was witty, clever and sometimes chilling. The directing was beautiful and the acting was absolutely superb. Jodie Foster was great as the the FBI agent Clarice Starling who is on the trail of a serial killer. Foster was good but the star is of course the magnificent Anthony Hopkins who steels the show with his rolling eyes and taunting voice. Both actors deserved the Oscars awarded to them. So did the director Jonathon Demme. The story was great, the only clique was with the ending that has always bugged me. The movie is an intelligent chilling thriller and there was this great build up to something that didn't meet the audience's expectations. Besides that everything about this movie was perfect.

I hadn't seen any of the other Hannibal films, but this is not necessary.<br/><br/>There was a perfect amount of back story and analysis to thrilling parts. The creepiness of Hannibal was played brilliantly by Hopkins and the clever but young and naivety was played equally brilliantly by Foster. Clarice's willingness and ambition was clear, but that eagerness put her in vulnerable situations. This was seen be Hannibal and provided an enticing relationship between the two.<br/><br/>Thoroughly recommend."

","Silence of the Lambs is about Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) a trainee FBI agent assigned to get help from notorious psychopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who use to be a respected psychiatrist to help locate and find another killer Buffalo Bill who cuts his victims skin off. The only catch is she has to give Lecter personal information before he revels anything. After prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped its a race agents time to try and save her but will Hecter keep playing games? Silence of the Lambs is a really good movie they make you care about Clarice Starling and know about her personal life in a really cleaver more realistic way and not her just blurting it out when necessary like you see in other films. Anthony Hopkins gives a performance so chilling and powerful, you want to know what he dose next every time he's on screen, doing this in a very calm and polite manner (most of the time) makes it even more suspenseful. The other serial killer in the movie, Buffalo Bill was just as gripping to watch, a man who kills and skins young women was truly scary. One of the best most suspenseful scenes iv ever seen, was near the end, a scene in which they find Buffalo Bill which was for me the most scariest scene in the whole move and props for the rest of the film for building up to the that bit so well! Just as i thought it could all be all sunshine and rainbows Clarice gets a call from none other than Hecter who ends the call on a line that just makes you wanna watch more. Silence of the Lambs is a great movie and even if it is just once, go watch it!"
"ajayiitian123","9","1","1","19 August 2014"," Play on your fears, meet the psychopaths !
","Directed by Jonathan Demme, based upon the novel by the same name by Thomas Harris (1988), the movie takes us through a journey of psychopath minds: the way they think, the way they justify their crimes (even to themselves), the methods they use, and how the FBI works to catch them. The movie has the seriousness and intensity that has been entirely lacking in horror movies lately. It features two serial killers, one who is an imprisoned criminal, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the other one nicknamed as Buffalo Bill by the FBI. Clarice Starling(Jodie Foster), a top student at the FBI's training academy is set upon the assignment of investigating Buffalo Bill, who kills young women and removes the skin from their bodies for purposes not revealed(Spoiler alert!).He is an amateur, has his weaknesses and can be caught, although only someone who has begun to think like him can defeat him. Clarice is advised by her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" Dr.Lecter, to find out any leads to track down Buffalo. Lecter being an interesting character throughout the movie, is a prize-winning psychiatrist turned a killer and cannibal who gently manipulates her mind and plays on her fears. The intimidating intellect of Hopkins' character is also reflected in his abundant wit, which he uses to provoke and torment his jailers and later confuse the forces to get away. He remains an unrepentant killer, almost as dangerous in his cell as he is on the loose. With his cunning facial expressions and amazing telepathic performances, he's the monster as genius, and Hopkins plays him with disturbing authority. Cinematography and screenplay have very well put the seriousness intended by Harris in his novel. A tale of bloody scenes, suspense, deception, manipulation and a masterpiece for those longing to watch horror movies."

"slokes","9","1","1","19 July 2014"," Good Cutting Makes For Great Slasher
","""The Silence Of The Lambs"" is famous for being Hollywood's finest slasher film, a masterpiece of unblinking psychological gamesmanship, but its best cuts were made in the editing room.<br/><br/>Time is running out for psychopath Buffalo Bill's latest kidnappee. Trying anything, the FBI sends a young trainee, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), to chat up an especially diabolical serial killer now in custody, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). The hope is the two will hit it off well enough so that Lecter will help with nailing down Bill's persona. But what starts out unsettling enough for Starling soon becomes a real journey into fear.<br/><br/>""Silence Of The Lambs"" has a great story, diabolical atmospherics, and a stark visual template that pulls you in. But two things work for it beyond these elements.<br/><br/>The first, which is widely commented upon, is how everyone in this film is working outside their comfort zones, all the way through to the audience. Director Jonathan Demme did quirky, humanistic comedies centered around redemptive themes. Foster didn't play cops. Hopkins didn't play psychos or big-screen villains, unless it was a historical figure like Hitler. Handing such creative people different hats and making them work allowed for fresher, vital impressions.<br/><br/>Second, and more critical, was the way ""Silence"" was cut. Looking at the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD reveals scenes trimmed or edited out entirely, employing plot elements from Thomas Harris' source novel. A couple of dropped scenes between Starling and FBI lead investigator Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) are particularly involving, but the overall subplot they work to establish, about Crawford's dispute with a nasty superior and Starling's own line-crossing of FBI strictures, only obscure what the audience cares most about, which is the relationship between Hannibal and Starling and also the ongoing case of Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>The first of these is really where ""Silence"" best delivers. So much of the movie's cultural legacy rests in the exchanges between Starling and Lecter as written by Ted Tally and delivered by Foster and Hopkins.<br/><br/>It's a tense cat-and-mouse situation, not devoid of humor or pathos but focused relentlessly on the core issue of stopping Buffalo Bill. What motivates Lecter is not sympathy but his interest in Starling, both as someone he rather likes and as a worthy opponent. ""People will say we're in love,"" he jokes at one point, and it's funny because it's kind of true in a twisted way the movie is not afraid to develop, even if the idea of an actual relationship between the two seems absurd, at least in this iteration.<br/><br/>While known as a slasher film, violence is handled very well. We see as many murders actually take place here as we did in ""Psycho,"" which is not that many. More is done by showing less. Hitchcock would have approved.<br/><br/>Some aspects of the film keep me from declaring it perfect. The way Hannibal makes his big play in Tennessee is too much of the Hollywood- magic-villain variety, while Demme emphasizes Starling's discomfort as a woman in a man's world in a way that comes off dated and pedantic today. Howard Shore's music adds to the atmosphere but never gels as anything with a character of its own.<br/><br/>But when you watch the movie, all you care about is what happens to Starling and what Lecter could do to her. And that is exactly what should happen. The end result is a very involving, one-of-a-kind experience."

","A really great film that everyone should take out the time to watch at some point in their life. We've watched this multiple times in the film program at USC. It's a great film to break down and understand the basic tenets of movie-making and storytelling. One of the best parts of the film, in my opinion, stems from the adept chose of shots. We are brought into the intimate world of Agent Sterling. We not only learn about her past through the perceptions of Lector, but Jonathan Demme, pulls into a world dominated by the sexual nature of men, and it's viewpoint from the eyes of Sterling. Rather than opt for simple wide, medium, and close coverage the director chooses to give us the vantage point of the main character, especially through the copious amounts of POV shots taken throughout the film. This is only heightened when you realize Demme wanted the audience to appreciate the perspective of a woman in an environment where men are prominent and dominant. Great film."
"axel-koch","9","1","1","3 February 2014"," One of the best book adaptations in film history and the epitome of a psychological thriller
","With The Silence of the Lambs, Jonathan Demme laid the foundation of all psychological thrillers to come after it and also accomplished a contestant for one of the best book adaptations in film history, as he transformed Thomas Harris's entertaining and thrilling novel of the same name into a visionary, absorbing, and stereotype-defying motion picture that deservedly ranks among the prestigious trio of films to have won the Big Five categories at the Academy Awards. It's one of the very few thrillers (not horror films, as asinine Hollywood likes to classify it) that improves with time, similarly to the Chianti Hannibal Lecter mentions in the essential The Silence of the Lambs quote, as it's neither a whodunit nor a howcatchem, but rather a study of psychopaths' and serial killers' twisted states of mind. <br/><br/>For doing so, Demme actually has two at his disposal, though only Anthony Hopkins's shockingly stoic and sophisticated cannibal counts among cinema's unforgettable villains. This film's actual antagonist, Buffalo Bill, is quite fascinating himself and contributes to some outstanding scenes, but gets a disappointingly amateurish exit, one of the very few flaws The Silence of the Lambs has. While I'd not call it a flaw, Jodie Foster as the film's protagonist is a bit overrated in my book, being a relatable and strong heroine that manages to bear up against Hopkins, yet not having overly interesting features herself. The contrary is the case with the film overall, that may not satisfy viewers looking for a good scare, but is a masterful look at human emotions and, if that's not your cup of tea, also a splendid psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Another important factor contributing to making The Silence of the Lambs a classic is its visual appearance, most inventive in the parallel montage of a FBI squad kicking in the door of Buffalo Bill's suspected lodging and Clarice, alone, knocking on the door of one of Bill's acquaintances and the showdown, seen through night vision goggles. Because of all this, The Silence of the Lambs can very well be called the epitome of a psychological thriller and is setting the bar for films of this genre until today, more than twenty years since its release."

","It has been a good long while since I have felt the presence of Evil so manifestly demonstrated as in the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" He stands perfectly still in the middle of his cell floor, arms at his sides, and we sense instantly that he is not standing at attention, he is standing at rest - like a savage animal confident of the brutality coiled up inside him. His speaking voice has the precision of a man so arrogant he can barely be bothered to address the sloppy intelligence of the ordinary person. The effect of this scene is so powerful that it underlies all the rest of the movie, lending terror to scenes that do not even involve him.<br/><br/>Like all great entrances in the movies, his is carefully prepared. We learn that his character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, is both a brilliant psychiatrist and a mass murderer, known as ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" because he eats his victims. He is already behind bars (and unbreakable Plexiglas) when the movie opens, and indeed ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is about the search for another mass murderer, named ""Buffalo Bill,"" who skins his victims.<br/><br/>Operating on the theory that it takes one to know one, the FBI agent in charge of the case thinks Lecter might be able to provide useful clues in the search for Buffalo Bill. But Lecter toys with most of his inquisitors, or dismisses them, and so the agent hits on the idea of sending in an untried young female trainee (Jodie Foster). Perhaps she will appeal to the monster.<br/><br/>Foster is inevitably upstaged by Hopkins' rich and gruesome creation, but her steadiness and pluck are at the heart of the movie.<br/><br/>Some interesting aspects have been provided for her character: She is ""one generation up from white trash,"" as Lecter correctly guesses; she tries to disguise her hillbilly accent, and she has to muster up all of her courage to order a roomful of lascivious lawmen out of an autopsy room. The movie has an undercurrent of unwelcome male attention toward her character; rarely in a movie have I been made more aware of the subtle sexual pressures men put upon women with their eyes.<br/><br/>We are frightened both because of the film's clever manipulation of story and image, and for better reasons--we like Clarice, identify with her and fear for her. Just like Lecter."
"GeorgeHarrington","10","1","1","23 July 2013"," Fear and Pity in ""Silence of the Lambs""
","This movie has special meaning for me. It was the first scary movie that I ever saw -- and I wasn't supposed to see it. I was ten years old and performing the role of Patrick Dennis with Shani Wallis in ""Mame"" at The Candlewood Playhouse, when one night in the dorm where all the actors were staying, I convinced some of the older actors to let me watch it with them. <br/><br/>I've never been so scared in my life (a close second would be when, at the end of Sarah Connor's quiet and somber monologue that opens Terminator 2: Judgment Day, a cyborg's foot is seen and heard crushing a human skull). <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins' acting throughout the movie is a master class in how to choose one, specific action to punctuate your lines. He does not do much standing there in his cell -- and in fact, at Jodie Foster's best moments, she is as still and specific as he is. It's almost that crisp commitment from both actors more than anything else (the plot in general) that induces both the fear and the pity we experience watching the movie. At the beginning, we fear Dr. Lecter, and we pity Clarice on her task to track down the current criminal Buffalo Bill from interviewing the evasive and experienced psychopath in his cell...but because of the specific and simple acting and a great script, that dynamic certainly shifts, and by the end, our original assumptions are perhaps tossed aside."

It was all masterfully done, from beginning to end, you could almost sense what was going to happen next, however they would do what you expected but better than you anticipated.

So compelling, so interesting and so scary. This movie is my all time favorite horror movie, up there with Psycho and the Shining but in my opinion more enjoyable then both.

","This film is by no means a typical low budget slasher. This film is a unique brand of crime and investigation where FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned the deadly task of hunting down the notorious killer Buffalo Bill. However, to do this she'll need the help of another psychotic mastermind, Dr. Hannibal Lector. Lector is a clever but mad criminal, and this is made evident as soon as the trainee and criminal meet. The acting is fantastic and Anthony Hopkins makes the movie addicting. Buffalo Bill is also disturbingly creepy, and his scenes are very difficult to watch.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a brilliant gem from start to finish, sweeping four of the Oscars for 1991. Best picture, actor and actress, and major Academy Awards are just some of the awards collected over the year from this film. The film is definitely worth viewing not just once, but multiple times as many people already have. The Silence of the Lambs is a stellar, suspenseful, and altogether thrilling horror film. To this day it is looked upon as one of the most disturbing and horrifying films ever created. Everyone should see this movie, it's well worth your time."

","There's no other way to describe this masterpiece. From the start I was gripped by it's amazing camera shots, acting and music. Jodie Foster is amazing in her roll as FBI rookie Clarice Starling. Anthony Hopkins is just incredible, his roll as the monsorous Hannibal Lecter just blew me away. The best part is definitely the part when Straling is interviewing Lecter, this partis not only scary but very interesting. Buffalo Bill on this film is also scary. He skins his victims to make his ""Woman suite. (You'll get it if you just it) Overall, this film is dark, disturbing and very gripping. It will definitely keep you to the edge of your seat."

","Manhunter is my Hannibal movie of choice. There aren't many to pick from, but it's the kind of choice you're frequently confronted with and says something about who you are; Alien or Aliens? So maybe this is yours. <br/><br/>These films, to get into it a bit, are an offshoot of the many sophisticated threads that first came together in film noir (yet others led to Lynch). The most self-evident aspect is that they are detective films, but much more pertinently: they are about the effort to see and investigate into a part of your story that you didn't know was so dark. For Clarice, it's the screaming lambs and what it means for her as a person (lamb lost in a callous world). They are about twin-nested-worlds: the rational world of cops and forensic experts where the mind attempts control over narrative, and the semiconscious world of urges, self and powerful intuition that makes it all bubble up in the first place.<br/><br/>The detective can solve the case because she straddles both.<br/><br/>So, these films have power because they're not just about the case or cinematic criminology, that case which is usually wrapped in exotic madness to make you, the viewer, want to keep looking for answers. These answers horrify, assuming we are in sensitive hands, because that madness has, as a fulcrum, actual human beings in pain. We're a long way from Charlie Chan. The difference between detective and killer is not moral right, but having discovered ways to reason with that part of damaged self. Clarice has signed up for the FBI, and the FBI provides a structure (note the staged scenarios in training that allow her to exercise decision-making and control). Our anchor for the entire film is in her world of controlled emotion.<br/><br/>Manhunter is my type of film because of a spin that seems very powerful to me; it ever-so-lightly transfers the anchor to the killer, in a way that we understand that that guy breathes and covets in an actual word, and that world has logic of its own, and that logic affects our logic and vision. <br/><br/>Because we spend time there in ways that make deep sense, his world of latent visions deepens our own.<br/><br/>Demme was not up to it here. So even though well-made, and even though Lecter explains that Buffalo Bill is a child that was hurt, every moment we spend in Bill's world is cheap and sensational. Demme goes to lengths of the silly dance routine in drag, but not so much as a glimpse inside the skin of that man. There is no real shift of vision from the comfortable quest to destroy evil to a more ambiguous nature.<br/><br/>We're just not in sensitive hands here. Because we're not, the sense of lurid spectacle spills over the entire thing: from Lecter's prison block that looks like a medieval dungeon, to the extended crosscutting between houses in the finale that sensationalizes the bleeding obvious.<br/><br/>It's sophisticated and heartfelt on Clarice's end of investigating herself, but on the other end it's a silly potboiler that looks like a Texas Massacre sequel. It captivates but it doesn't deepen."
"aaronlmadden","9","1","1","26 July 2012"," Disturbing and powerful
","Jonathan Demme's masterpiece stands out as one of the greatest films of all time. It is distinguished in every aspect. The direction, the writing, the acting... all superb. It captivates, disturbs, and fascinates the viewer. This is a film that plays on the senses; on fear, on imagination, and on emotions.<br/><br/>The director's visual style paints a dark, bleak, yet colorful world that depicts the ugly side of humanity. The story itself is phenomenal. It is intriguing, unsettling, and is told so effectively. The cast is its strongest point. They are what make this film unforgettable. Anthony Hopkins is a powerhouse in this film, dominating the role of Hannibal Lecter, with his leering stare and his creepy demeanor.Yet there's a charm and wit that draws you in. You forget that he's a psychopathic killer. Jodie Foster is incredible. She gives her character so much depth. She disappears in her role with her subtle mixture of strength and vulnerability. Ted Levine deserves more recognition for his role as serial killer Buffalo Bill. He is so disturbing and appalling in this film. He gives a chilling performance. <br/><br/>The scenes with Foster and Hopkins are undeniably the strength of this movie. Hopkins picks away at Foster's inner demons, forcing her to open up her troubling past. In exchange, he reveals more and more information on the identity of a notorious serial killer. Foster's desperation does nothing to budge Hopkins from his request, and her vulnerability is more and more present as their scenes progress. They are both remarkable in this movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this classic if you've never seen it. It hasn't aged at all, in my opinion. The failed attempts at cinema today make this film even stronger today than it was in 1991. It is truly a masterpiece."

","This is one of those films that sticks with you. The psychological horror of Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter is like a thick fog that remains in your head, sticking to the corners of your subconscious in a way too few villains have ever managed. It's one of those career-defining roles that, having seen someone so naturally take it on, you cannot imagine anyone else stepping into. Having read Thomas Harris' fantastic novel beforehand, this was one of the biggest selling points to me. As anyone who has read the book(s) can tell you, Hannibal Lecter is an extremely deep and complicated character that demanded an actor capable of both sophisticated mannerisms and a terrible underlying nature of pure evil. The moment Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling meets Hopkins' Lecter, you can see it all in the intense gleam of his eyes.<br/><br/>As a best picture winner, this film was righteously recognized for it's strong merits of precise storytelling, incredible lead acting from Hopkins and Foster and a strong supporting cast, and most of all for truly engaging the viewer in it's atmosphere of horror. The little touches round out the fantastic experience, from Lecter's disturbing facial appliance to Clarice's slow unveiling of her troubled past and Lecter's bizarre way of showing his empathy and affection, all the way to Ted Levine's superb portray of the psychologically disturbed Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>A movie that still gets under your skin all these years later, it's a crime if you haven't seen it. A brilliant film from beginning to end is rare enough, but when it also features a character who was destined to be one of horror's iconic faces, it becomes a legend in the making."

"alan-stone","9","1","1","28 March 2012"," Unbelievable!
","""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of cinema's history. Every single element contributes to create a disturbing and unique atmosphere, and I use very carefully the word 'unique'. I highly doubt anyone was reminded of a villain with the same caliber as Dr. Hannibal -with the chilling rhyming nickname- Lecter, masterfully personified by Anthony Hopkins. I doubt anyone remembers a similar movie where a young, vulnerable and non-Ellen-Ripley looking girl doesn't play the victim, nor the hero's love interest, but the actual heroine. Clarice Starling, as a FBI trainee is played by Jodie Foster, in a performance subtly combining feminine vulnerability and heroic tenacity. And no one would have expected the film to have a binary structure with a classic serial-killer's investigation in one hand, and a subplot involving one of the greatest movie villains of all-time and his interaction with the heroine, on the other.<br/><br/>The script is tightly constructed, patiently leading us to assemble each piece of the puzzle until the series of interactions between Clarice and Hannibal approaches a disturbing truth. The relationship between the two leads is even more fascinating because it deepens their personalities and allows us to get more and more in their background : the wounds in Clarice's past, the mystery around Hannibal Lecter, and the roots of evil that inspired the serial killers' acts. And this is where the freshness of the film relies on : its capability to put everything into perspective and invite our perceptions to go beyond the simple 'good vs. evil' dichotomy. The villain are no sharks, no monsters, no possessing demons, they are everyday men, like some Norman Bates with an extra level of savagery and pervert creativity and we try to understand to better fight them."

"johnsh03","10","1","1","18 June 2011"," Silence of the Lambs is an excellent in the thriller genre.
","Silence of Lambs is a crime thriller produced in 1991 by director Jonathan Demme. The screenplay was written by Ted Tally, taken from the novel written by Thomas Harris. Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, is an FBI cadet who is assigned to interview the psychopathic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. Starling gains the confidence of Lecter, a former psychiatrist turned killer/cannibal, in order to obtain information which may lead them to a serial killer tagged by authorities as ""Buffalo Bill,"" who is killing and skinning women. During the interviews Lecter psychoanalyzes Starling and in turn, he states as ""quid pro quo,"" offers clues which lead her to Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>The theme of this film focuses on plot; good guy trying to catch bad guy. Within this basic theme is an underlying theme of change. This theme is characterized by motifs, or patterns that are repeated. Symbols of metamorphosis are present throughout the story. The killer is trying to turn himself into a woman by sewing together pieces of the women's skins. He places a cocoon, the embodiment of change, in their mouths when disposing of the bodies. When Starling kills ""Bill,"" played by Ted Levine, a twirling picture displays a butterfly that appears to fly as it twirls. <br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs has a similar theme to the crime thriller film Se7en, produced in 1995 by director David Fincher. The theme of Se7en also focuses on plot: good guys after bad with an emphasis on human depravity which is symbolized by each murder. Victims are chosen by the sins they commit. Both films delve into the psychological profiles of both the killers and the detectives. <br/><br/>The use of color, particularly red, in the film foreshadows dramatic scenes that are relevant to the theme. The first time Starling goes in to see Lecter the lighting at the basement entrance is red and directed from the side giving a sense of foreboding. The room in which Bill performs his sewing contains lots of red objects. When Lecter is on the ambulance gurney (everyone believes it is the police chief), the strap across him is red. When Mr. Crawford, Starling's boss (played by Scott Glenn) is on the plane to Chicago, the lighting in the plane is red; as well as the van when the police stage a delivery. <br/><br/>Sound is also used in this film to help in building suspense and highlight theme. The most dramatic use of sound in this film was the doorbell scene. The police are raiding the house in Illinois and ring the doorbell. The buzzer goes off in the basement at Bill's house. At the same time Starling is ringing the doorbell at Bill's door. At first, you are not sure which house Bill is in. <br/><br/>The relationship between Starling and Lector is a driving force for the story. The use of color, sound, and motifs emphasizes and builds on the theme, which in turn creates the dramatic and suspenseful effects used in developing the plot of Silence of the Lambs."

","This film is often criticized for its treatment of using homosexuals as the bad guy, but when watching this film, I could not even think of political standpoints. I was so engrossed with how well made the film actually is. Anthony Hopkins (In his best role to date) plays Hannibal Lecter, a devious former psychologist turned cannibal with a brilliant mind. When a serial killer stalks the Midwest called Buffalo Bill, the FBI recruits a trainee, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to visit Lecter. Their main goal is to get Lecter to help them capture Buffalo Bill by looking into him psychologically (Bill skins women, and the FBI doesn't know why). Thus, starting a relationship between Lecter and Starling. Not a love relationship, a personal info relationship: Starling must reveal secrets about her past in order to get Lecter to talk. This film is by far one of the most deftly made suspense movies ever made. With Jonathan Demme's crisp, point of view direction, we see through the eyes of the character and this gives us a sense of how they are feeling. Winner of five well deserved Oscars (Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, Adapted Screenplay) , Foster and Hopkins leave this film by giving us a chill down our spine and a heart that is still beating from unbearable suspense from the finale."

","The Silence of the Lambs (1991) reigns supreme as one of the greatest thriller movies of all time. Jonathan Demme reaches cinematic perfection by combining writing, direction and acting of the highest calibre together to form a classic that blows the usual mediocre thriller out of the water. The film tells the story of young FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and her quest to help find the serial killer Buffalo Bill. To find Buffalo Bill, Starling requires the help of Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is imprisoned for his cannibalistic behaviour.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is excellent in all aspects of production and form. The dialogue is crisp, poignant and always essential, resulting in a film that is pulse-racing and highly absorbing. The presence of pretentious or stilted dialogue is negated early on in the movie, Clarice referring to a contrived reference as ""too hokey for Lecter"". Never a dull moment, the Silence of the Lambs is masterfully suspenseful as Hannibal Lecter is always one step ahead; his omnipotence, humour and theatrics providing the audience with a villain that is as charming and likable as he is perturbing. The performances are incredible; Hopkins unforgettable as the cannibalistic Lecter, while Foster is compelling as Clarice Starling, playing the young FBI Agent with understated confidence and assertion. Clarice is created as a feminist character with incredible subtlety; she remains unfazed by the advances and gazes of on looking men throughout the film, focused solely on prevailing in her male dominated field of work and uncovering justice. The chemistry between both of the actors is undeniable, Clarice's freshness and subtlety boding well with Hannibal's abrasive and supercilious behaviour.<br/><br/>Twenty years on, time does not appear to have worn upon the Silence of the Lambs, Demme's masterpiece still considered as one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time. With strong performances, an intense score and a no-nonsense script, The Silence of the Lambs elucidates the seemingly forgotten art of story telling to create a film that is captivating from start to finish, and chillingly lingers in the mind long after it has been viewed.<br/><br/>This superb film rates a 10/10 from me. I do wish I could review longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner..."

It's a very vile and intense film, it's filled with dark, unnerving scenes that make you feel dirty for watching them. The tension just never goes away, it never gives you a moment to lay back and relax. Anthony Hopkins has surprisingly little screen time, but somehow his uncomfortable presence is always felt. Damn those prison scenes are ominous, downright unpleasant to watch really. Jodie Foster is pretty brilliant too, even with her much-ridiculed Southern accent she still gives a stellar performance. The climax is also everything you expect and more, excellent to say the least. To me this is one of the best and most exciting thrillers ever made."

","Jodie Foster stars as FBI Agent Clarice Starling who's on a mission to track down a homicidal maniac, but only the sneering cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is the only person who knows his whereabouts. But his presence is luring and quite intimidating so getting into his head shouldn't be an option. With supreme intelligence like Stephen Hawking and diet that will put Jeffrey Dahmer to shame, Lecter has the delight in manipulating his victims through his diabolical mind games.<br/><br/>Kindly, Lecter obliges to Clarice in helping with her investigation if she joins him in his little web of mind games. but the catch is she must reveal her personal background about her and he'll do the same. The horror genre in the movie isn't some dark, scary macabre individual going on a joyful killing spree, but a chilling, manipulative supremely intellectual individual who's desires is to play games with the medulla oblongata. He's got the gift of smelling one's fears and knows exactly where to strike at you, psychologically. There's even a good chance that the psychopath Agent Starling is after might even be twice as crazy as Lecter. But Lecter's motives are so convincing and executed to perfection by Sir Anthony Hopkins that the room temperature in the theater got a bit colder than usual.<br/><br/>With the instincts of a snake, Lecter starts then starts to slurp. Hopkins later reveals it was improvised just to add more intimidation to the character. This role as Dr. Lecter brought this relatively unknown British actor exceptional fame and Hollywood started to take more notice from this middle-aged performer. Lecter himself has identical similarities to Boris Karloff's 1934 movie ""The Black Cat"" in which Karloff plays a demonic Satanist. Instead of making Lecter an evil, ghoulish monster who goes on a killing spree, he takes the Norman Bates route and plays a monster in the form of a sophisticated gentleman. Sure he gladly helps Clarice, but at cost of haunting her as well. Sure he's not as bad as we are lead to believe, but you can't help taking your eyes off the screen when he comes on.<br/><br/>What was fortuitous about the release of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was released at the time cold-blooded cannibal/serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was making the headlines. Both stories were quite identical to one another as they both lured their audience with gripping and chilling effects. Therefore, it is safe to say that ""Silence of the Lambs"" gets us into sorting out connections to find a convincing explanation as to what drove Dahmer to be the way that he is. Unlike other psychological thrillers, this one will have you pondering to yourself over what kind of connection this movie has to the Dahmer story. The real shortcoming here is that audience at the time wanted more, as in more Hannibal. Well it took 10 years in the making and in 2001 ""Hannibal"" was released. And even though Dahmer is rotting in hell, Hannibal will live on into ours minds forever."

Even though her performance might not have been quite as jaw dropping as Anthony Hopkins, it was still in my opinion the best of her career, and for an actress like her that is saying quite a lot.<br/><br/>Overall, The Silence of the Lambs is probably in my top 20 best films of all time. It absolutely blew my mind. If you have not seen this movie, then I recommend watching it as soon as possible, because I can assure you that if you are a movie fan you will like it."

","What makes The Silence of the Lambs, which won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1991, a classic? It's not the story, involving a serial killer kidnapping a senator's daughter. There's nothing wrong with this story, but it's rather the characters that make this movie so memorable and powerful. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter, one of the greatest villains in movie history (if not the greatest), a perceptive psychiatrist turned cannibalistic killer turned prisoner. Jodie Foster plays Clarice, an FBI trainee who gets to know Hannibal, hoping he can help her with a current serial killer case. Hopkin's performance is mesmerizing. He's intelligent but a monster. He's frightening because, as Crawford tells Clarice, ""you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head."" But Clarice lets him inside her head, and breaks a number of other rules regarding how to talk to Hannibal. As Hannibal asks Clarice for details on her personal life, their meetings become a sort of twisted therapy, developing Clarice as a character and allowing Foster to deliver an impressive performance of her own when telling her lamb story.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is compelling, and frightening. The moth is creepy. Lecter's escape scene is, for me, the scariest thing in the film; his face is calm as he's killing the guards. The movie ends with Hannibal free again, a cliffhanger ending that (unfortunately) resulted in a disappointing sequel ten years later. The Silence of the Lambs is one of my all-time favourite films."

","Clarice Starling (Foster) interviews cannibal Dr Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) in an attempt to track down serial killer Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>No amount of praise that comes into this world will be enough to recognize the brilliance of this picture. Intelligent, quick witted, psychotic, different, shocking, tense and beautifully acted, the list of positives simply continues.<br/><br/>The most recognized feature of this film is more than likely Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the evil Hannibal Lecter. An extremely intelligent man who simply knows everything, he IS the epitome of evil.<br/><br/>His smart sophistication and intelligence is brought to the screen in a vivid and shocking manor when dealing with FBI trainee Clarice Starling. The pairing of Jodie Foster (The Accused) and Hopkins (World's fastest Indian) is a thing of art. With Clarice's entry into the crime world and Hannibal's experience, we see a wonderful reflection of life. The past, the present and the future all intellectually driven by Lecter. Ideologies of investigation, nightmares and diagnosis's are all brought to the screen in a shocking manor, brought to an astounding light and credit to the actors who both received Oscars for their acts. Though Hannibal has hardly any screen time he is the stand out figure of the picture and will leave a devastating effect in the viewer's mind that will never be erased.<br/><br/>Based on Thomas Harris' novel, this tells the story of Clarice, coming into the FBI world, unaware of anything and still haunted by her past.<br/><br/>Unlike many crime films out there, this 1991 Oscar winning picture is beautiful in crafting character but also delivering a knockout issue driven plot, combining the two most important elements of films. This is achieved through some intelligent portrayals, but a grasping realistic direction tactic by Jonathan Demme.<br/><br/>The plot is consistent with the dramatic ideology of the serial killer driving the film forward. There are a couple of scenes that are questionable, and a second viewing is usually necessary to capture all the necessary information.<br/><br/>Having never read the book myself, I find this to be a shocking tale that the book may either offer so much more, or put a dent on the picture. Either way, the film is a necessity for any film fanatic.<br/><br/>Smart and sophisticated, Silence of the Lambs is fast and flowing, beautifully realistic with a great line of characters, and one of the greatest on screen villains in history."
"jzappa","10","1","1","28 October 2008"," An Artistically Complex, Penetratingly Intimate Drama Leaning Towards the Thriller Genre
","Broodingly, intimately and truthfully shot, quietly edited, with a gloomy orchestral score and a richly commanding cast everywhere from Hopkins and Foster's obvious milestones to Scott Glenn and Ted Levine, this artistically complex, penetratingly intimate movie is a masterpiece in all departments. I do not categorize it as a horror film. Maybe a suspense thriller, because whenever I watch it, I view it as such, but the reason it is so compelling is because it is not genre-specific. Yes, it is scary, it is suspenseful, especially in its heart-exploding climax, and our fear of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is established as soon as he appears for the first time, as FBI cadet Clarice Starling reticently passes the maximum security cells of clearly demented ward occupants, and director Jonathan Demme cuts to her point of view as she arrives at Hannibal's cell at the end of the dank corridor, and he is awaiting her already, standing with perfect posture, a pleasant, polite look on his face. His speaking voice has the care of a man having transcended the common cognizance that he can hardly be concerned to speak to the slack acumen of the ordinary person. The effect of this scene is so powerful that it underlies all the rest of the movie, affording fear to scenes that do not even have to do with him.<br/><br/>There is so much to say about Hannibal Lecter, as a character, as a villain, as a person. But rather than doing so, I shall simply say that the reason Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs as a film works incomparably better than Ridley Scott's Hannibal or Brett Ratner's Red Dragon, in the sense of portraying Hannibal in the most powerful and mystifying way, is because it tries to create sympathy for him through his charm, his incredible intelligence, his creative cultivation and his penetrating insight into the mind with all five senses, then turn the monster loose. Accordingly, there are moments when Lecter commits brutally violent acts, but Demme and the adapting screenwriter Ted Tally wisely let a little go a long way, with the foreseeing intention that the long-term impact is of his evil psychological strength.<br/><br/>Most of the best stories never started from ideas but always from character. I firmly believe that The Silence of the Lambs is an offshoot straight from the creation of Hannibal Lecter. Even as rich and sympathetic and real as Clarice Starling is, she is a projection of what Dr. Lecter would find fascinating, how he would affect an eager but inexperienced rookie's undertaking of a critical case.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is not simply a horror film because of its involvement of two psychopathic serial killers but because of its organic use of the great common phobias and fears. Here is a story involving not only cannibalism and skinning, but also kidnapping in the least likely situation, one that will shatter one's trust and sense of good samaritanship, being trapped in the bottom of a well, the details and anatomy of decomposing corpses, large insects, being lost in the dark, being tracked by someone you cannot see, not being able to get people to believe you, people who know your deepest secrets, beheadings, bizarre sexual perversions, and being a short woman in an investigation otherwise led completely by tall men.<br/><br/>Demme is aware of the pitfalls of shock value and exploitative horror film techniques, but does not hesitate to take chances. His first scene with Hopkins could have gone over the top, and in the hands of a lesser actor almost certainly would have. But Hopkins is in the great British tradition of actors who internalize instead of overacting.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster is unavoidably upstaged by Hopkins's fertile and horrific conception, but her stability, natural sensitivity and stealthy backbone are at the core of the film's resolve. Real and attention-grabbing facets lurk within her character as they do in any one of us: She is one age group ahead from white trash, as Lecter precisely conjectures, she tries to camouflage her southern accent, and she has to rally all of her nerve and fabricated confidence to instruct a room full of coarse small town lawmen out of an autopsy room. This gripping and incessantly developed drama has a nuance of unsolicited male attention toward her. Hardly ever in a movie have I been made more alert to the understated sexual burden men instill in women with their eyes. Ideally, if you're going to have a character appear in a story long enough to glance at a woman, pass by at the wrong time, take a picture or anything to such a minuscule effect, they had better be real enough that you can guess what they ate that morning. The makers of The Silence of the Lambs understand this."

","Review:<br/><br/>The Silence of The Lambs is easily one of the greatest films of all time. From it's eerie and atmospheric opening Lambs grabs you and doesn't let go. It's plot is riveting, it's characters unique, it's direction is remarkable and it's acting is top notch. Hopkins character is by far one of the most intriguing and psychotic to have ever been portrayed on film. From the demonic looks to the glaring and unblinking eyes, Hopkins has crafted a menacing and deranged character that only will stand as being one of the greatest roles. The first time we encounter this psycho is in the dark bowels of the asylum, where Hopkins conveys an aura of pure insanity and evil by doing nothing but just standing in the middle of the cell.<br/><br/>Lambs is an excellent and taught thriller that boasts great performances as well as an A* worked direction from Demme who works this first rate classic like a symphony orchestra. Demme creates visual style and symbolic substance that take movies and especially thrillers to a new level.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Scary as hell and thrilling in equal quantities. And a pure acting sensation for Hopkins and Foster."

","First off, I will recommend this film right now to anyone who can take in this truly horrifying story, as there is not one minute where even we, the audience, feel safe. The Silence of the Lambs is right in my top-10 list for the best films of the decade (1990-1999), and after viewing it, it may be in yours too.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant from all involved. Jodie Foster's performance is one to cheer for every step of the way, but the real star of the show, even for how his character plays out in the ""big picture"", is Anthony Hopkins. There's not one scene where we do not fear what this psychopathic genius Hannibal Lecter knows, and every moment he appears on screen your heart will sink -- even if his screen time is VERY short. Ted Levine is very good as Buffalo Bill and sightly underrated for his performance.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's music is haunting, terrifying, and uncomfortable, making it a score I'd recommend to anyone who listens to orchestral music. From tone to realization, Shore's intense music sets the stage for what we see, making it a great achievement -- probably the best of the decade as well.<br/><br/>The story is very graphic. The violence is pretty heavy, and the first scene between Clarice and Hannibal are disturbing -- especially the moment when she is about to leave; definitely not for young viewers.<br/><br/>The story is very enthralling and extreme. The mystery and suspense works every time, and Jonathan Demme and Ted Tally deserve every award they get.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this film to those who can watch such an intense film with deeply disturbing subject matter. This is just one horrifying and excellent masterpiece that you must see."
"brando647","10","1","1","21 September 2008"," A Masterpiece of a Psychological Thriller
","Jonathan Demme's 1991 film is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it's one of the reasons that drove me to study film-making. It's an intense psychological thriller with a phenomenal cast and some of the most memorable characters/scenes in cinema. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, the film follows Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who has been pulled on to assist in a case by the head of the FBI Behavioral Sciences division. Starling must interview incarcerated serial killer Hannibal Lecter in an attempt to help capture a new killer who has risen up and killed three women for their skin. Of course, this movie is legendary, so I'm sure everyone knows this much already...<br/><br/>Demme's film, while not the first to feature the character of Hannibal Lecter, is what turned the psychopath into one of the greatest movie villains ever created. Most of the credit for this can be attributed to Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the evil genius. The character is charismatic and frightening, all at the same time, so you can't help but like him despite the terrible things he's done. Lecter is a film icon due to Hopkins' performance. The best scenes in the film are any that include conversations between Lecter and Starling (Jodie Foster). They make every other scene in the movie (including the primary plot) seem insignificant and I found myself waiting for the next interview scene. Foster was great as the naive FBI agent-in-training who is thrown into the fire for her first real assignment and Scott Glenn gave a strong performance Jack Crawford, head of Behavioral Sciences. Aside from Hopkins, I'd have to say the best performance came from Ted Levine as Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb. Perhaps I am just easily entertained by sociopaths but watching him as the severely disturbed Gumb still gives me the creeps.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say I was ever really scared by this movie, so I wouldn't classify it as horror. It was more a sense of uneasiness from the film's two resident psychos: Hopkins and Levine. It gives you a minor glimpse of the mind of a serial killer and it does it effectively, thanks to the writings of Thomas Harris and Ted Tally. Despite having been released in 1991, the film is timeless and continues to stand today as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Honestly, if you're reading this and haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it."

","This movie had scared the bejebus out of my sister. But I'm mad that I haven't seen this movie a lot sooner than last year when I was 17. I wish I seen this movie when I was like 10, I just loved horror. But then again, this movie isn't a horror movie, it's more of a psychological thriller. This is hands down the most terrifying thriller of all time, I wouldn't recommend than young teenage girls (if you're brave enough) see this movie because it might scare you. But nevertheless, this is a great movie.<br/><br/>Swept all five major academy awards for best actor in a lead role, best actress in a lead role, best picture, best screenplay, and best directing. Jodie Foster performance in this movie is incredible, especially near the ending (she's been doing it since she was a kid). Anthony Hopkins performance is so good that is can scare you. Two of the most horrifying villains are in this movie: Hannibal Lector and Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>If you like a good thriller, this movie is for you. Even some of the things the characters said in the movie really gave me nightmares. You will be terrified of this movie, I can guarantee it!<br/><br/>You must see this movie."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","1","1","28 July 2008"," Tense, grisly, suspenseful thriller
","The more I watch ""The Silence of the Lambs"" the more I think that Hannibal Lecter is given far too much attention. Anthony Hopkins' performance is the shortest ever to win an Oscar for best actor in a leading role, and it really isn't much of a leading role. Sure, he is an integral part of the movie both in performance and plot and he is the main feature of what is by far the film's greatest scene, but he is no more than a supporting character. A great supporting character at that. One need not look further than Ridley Scott's ""Hannibal"" to see that he works best in a more or less limited role. It is amazing that just about everyone who discusses this film, even 17 years after its release, focuses on no more than 16 minutes of the film's running time.<br/><br/>The only real lead character in the film is Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling. As effective as Hopkins is I'm going to have to say that Foster's performance is the best and most nuanced in the film. Without a really good actress in the lead role this film might have been a massive failure not only commercially but also simply in terms of the storytelling mechanics of the film. It is still to date Foster's finest performance, and she really gets a chance to shine in the final thirty minutes of the film.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is probably Jonathan Demme's best dramatic feature. His concert films and other documentaries are almost all excellent but ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the only time a scripted effort from him has really been consistently excellent. The film still suffers minor issues, for example Demme's insistence on numerous occasions on having his actors deliver dialogue directly to the camera. It's rare that such an approach works and although it allows for some of the most memorable shots of Lecter in the film it also works against the tension building up in the scenes. All in all, however, Demme's work here is consistently excellent and two scenes in particular, both in the final hour of the film, stand out as some of the tensest, creepiest scenes in early 90's film. <br/><br/>Ted Tally's screenplay is essentially perfect given the sort of film this is. I'm not convinced he's a very strong writer in general, but he has enough to draw on from Thomas Harris' novel to write a tight, concise screenplay for the film. The score by Howard Shore is memorable and Tak Fujimoto's photography often lends the film just the sort of eeriness it needs. <br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" features one of the most memorable escape sequences of all time but beyond that remains a film glorified for the wrong reason- a short, 16-minute long performance. Ted Levine's Buffalo Bill is creepy enough and Clarice Starling endearing enough that the rest of the film maintains the sort of edge most procedurals could only hope for. The cast, the script, the look of the film, it all just clicks to create one of the most entertaining films of this sort. Not perfect, but a great film nonetheless. <br/><br/>9/10"
"cosmorados","10","1","1","13 July 2008"," ""I've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it"" and the world is more interesting for this film being in it!
","Clarice Starling is a trainee FBI agent, and although we live in liberated times she is clearly regarded as decoration by most of her male compatriots, after all, she is a woman in a male dominated world. That said we know she is something special when she is the only one left in the elevator on the way to the top. She is asked to go on an assignment by Jack Crawford, a senior figure at the Bureau to profile serial killers, perhaps, to help profile a new killer, Buffalo Bill, a man who skins his victims, different patterns each time and all dumped in different places. The Killer she is given the job of profiling is the one that will not co-operate, the infamous killer Hannibal Lector, formerly a renowned psychiatrist before he went off the rails towards the siding known as insanity.<br/><br/>And so Clarice begins a series of interviews with Lector where they both attempt a kind of intellectual and emotional sparring as they try to find out more about each other. As they get to know each other, with Clarice giving more in terms of info and Lector giving more in terms of soul they become unwitting colleagues in the race to stop Bill adding to his list of victims. <br/><br/>This film is a modern classic in every sense of the word. The colour seems to have been bled from every frame leading to a drab and desolate world without hope or sympathy. The use of symbolism is some of the best I've ever seen with the bug motif occurring throughout and not just in terms of the killer's signature, be aware of how his eyes look in the night vision goggles, we know that Bees can see in ultra violet and the way in which his vision is turned into one colour is extremely bug-like, however the big parallel with bugs is at the end of the film (Spoiler alert) when we see the figure dying on the floor with the night vision goggles on, with the wounds on both sides of his chest, he dies like an insect, something that many people may not notice.<br/><br/>The film is also clever in its usage of more familiar symbolism to make us feel certain ways. As Bill's next victim is driving along we see her singing to a song on the radio, not just singing the main words but flitting between backing and the main lyrics, just the way we all do, making us far more concerned than we would be if she was just driving home, by showing her doing what we all do, she becomes us and we fear far more for her future fate.<br/><br/>However, this is not just a film about symbolism, this is a film about the decisions that we make and the decisions that we are forced to make. Clarice is sent on a path to the FBI after the death of her father, he was her world and all she seeks is his approval and by following in his footsteps it is the closest she can think to do that, this is a decision made by circumstance that is unavoidable, and she has no regrets over it. Hannibal by contrast goes fruit loop after dealing with endless whingy whiny patients with no problems when what he wants to do is deal with interesting problems. Somewhere along the way his mind snaps and the discussions that he would have no doubt enjoyed with Clarice are soured by the fact that there are bars between them, this regret is clearly etched on his face when they discus serial killers and Clarice says, so impassively, ""No, you ate yours"", she knows what he is and he doesn't impress her like his mighty intellect should, because he is a killer and to her that is all he is, and, as he realises this and looks away it is this regret that is revealing. Lector loves battling or discussing intellectual matters with equals, and so few ever came his way, and the regret he feels over meeting Clarice clearly too late is portrayed beautifully by Anthony Hopkins who gives the performance of a lifetime in giving us this killer who still contains within him a human soul.<br/><br/>This is the glory of this performance, although people have pointed out that his screen time is more warranting a supporting actor nod, there was simply no finer male performance, supporting or otherwise, and perhaps one of the greatest pieces of luck that the film enjoyed was Gene Hackman turning the role down. Anthony Hopkins doesn't just perform Lector, he inhabits him and we get treated to an amazing piece of acting that shows us that Serial Killers, the worst kind of people that there are, are still people, and that this is perhaps the saddest thing about them.<br/><br/>To add to this great performance Jodie Foster not only gave a good performance but matched Hopkins perfectly, showing all of Clarice's strength's and vulnerability with such stunning realism that we feel almost every shiver that goes through her skin as she trawls society's bottom step in order to stop a monster feasting endlessly on victims that society does not care much about. Scott Glenn rounds off this acting triumvirate with a measured controlled performance that exactly matches his character.<br/><br/>Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the music compliments every scene with an uneasy balance that never allows you to settle in your seat and the script is first rate. After I thought about this film and considered how good it was I tried to think of some reason to give it a nine, and I couldn't. This film really is a ten and although the subject matter is not everyone's cup of tea, it is worthwhile for those who have a hard enough stomach."

","I saw this film Saturday night, on A&E, and I have to say, it is a very good film. First off, the film is highly entertaining. This is a film that will please almost everyone. It is a crime thriller, but also very much a psychological horror film. The film surely gives us a classic movie character, Hannibal Lector. The acting in this movie is amazing. I have seen a lot of evil, psychotic characters like Lector before, and always an actor plays it in an evil, maniac sort of way. So when Anthony Hopkins acted this way, I was glad, but also kind of let down(since there are a lot of performances like this). But as the film goes on, we really identify with this character, and it did take a great amount of talent to pull it off. Jodie Foster kind of came as a one-one. Yes, she pulled it off too, like in personal moments that Dr. Lector figured out about her. You can really sense her talent, but sometimes I found her to come off a bit mono-tone. BUT I guess that is how her character was, and she did greatly act all her own to this performance. The man killer, Buffalo Bill, I think Ted Levine also did a great performance, and was underrated. BUT I found the story to be kind of unoriginal at all, yes, there is nothing really primarily wrong with the screenplay, but there were some very choppy scenes, and yes, it was a very good film. In the best horror films ever made of course, but I would have liked more from Dr.Lector and Buffalo Bill...I don't know, i just have that feeling.

The chemical reaction that takes place between these two on screen is so palpable and acidic you find yourself hardly able to watch.<br/><br/>Their dynamic is what sets this film apart from any other serial killer/horror/suspense/thriller ever made. The verbal jousting never wains when they are on screen.

","It was the time of my life, watching this movie, Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lector, yes this movie has to be my favorite thriller of all time!

How many Oscars did it win, um let';s see, 4 Oscars! They are coming back, to make Hannibal Rising, that movie looks pretty satisfying, but nobody can top Anthony Hopkin's performance as Hannibal Lector...never, i bet Gaspard Ulliel is a pretty good actor, too bad he'll never be as good as Anthony, sorry...Gaspard."

","Congratulations are in order. Each of the films has lots to offer (Manhunter the least), but Silence of --- offers the most. I've never seen a better performance from Jodie Foster. Anthony Hopkins will forever be remembered as Dr. Lector. Who else could play the role? Johnny Depp, as fine an actor as he is?<br/><br/>On to the most despicable characters; they are so easy to hate, more so than Lector's murderous cadre of acolytes, who, after all, have an excuse. In order of increasing odiousness: 1. Catherine, the rich, loudmouthed senator's daughter. Whatta bitch! She would have done better as a capacious frock. 2. Freddy Lounds, the flaming asshole tabloid publisher. Whatta spectacular way to go! 3. Dr. Chilton, the smarmy director of the mental hospital, who never tired of tormenting his prisoner, Hannibal Lector. Did he go well with fava beans? We can only hope so, for Lector's sake.<br/><br/>Finally, is that Barney who gets off the plane in the ISLANDS, MON, with Dr. Chilton? There was a remark made about security for the Big Shots. If so, that was just desserts.<br/><br/>One of the most sensuous scenes in any film I have seen is when the blind woman, Reba, is taken by Dolarhyde to 'experience' the beautiful tiger, under sedation. The way she listened, took in the scent and touched the animal, finally burying her cheek in its fur. Now, THAT was a scene! It beats the pants off Salome's dance, eh?"
"charchuk","9","1","1","4 April 2007"," Purely chilling
","A film that actually deserves all the acclaim and praise bestowed upon it. Everything, from the story right down through to the music, is outstanding, making for a chilling and memorable drama. Hopkins steals the show, of course, and his Oscar is well-deserved despite it being the shortest performance for a winning lead actor; Foster provides a nice contrast to him, and is also deserving of the acclaim. The scenes between Lecter and Clarice are so exceptionally done that it's nearly a shame when the focus shifts from him to Buffalo Bill, but an underrated performance by Ted Levine makes the climax just a thrilling. The scene where Lecter escapes is one of my all-time favourite cinematic moments, not just because of the gore, but because of the pure horror that is developed without any supernatural elements."
"Global_Marketing_Pros","10","1","1","5 March 2007"," Moral and Ethical Vs Immoral and Unethical characters, or the Silk Worm Vs the Merchant
","In The Republic, Plato puts the tale of the ring of Gyges in the mouth of Glaucon, who uses it to make the point that no man is so virtuous that he could resist the temptation of being able to steal at will by the ring's power of invisibility. In contemporary terms, Glaucon argues that morality is a social construction, whose source is the desire to maintain one's reputation for virtue and honesty; when that sanction is removed, moral character would evaporate.<br/><br/>What is the screenwriter trying to tell the audience other than another gruesome tale of human nature. The entertainment of the doctor, Hanibal Lecture, must be as equal to the thrills of the audience. Just as the good doctor hears the evils of man baptized by the oath of Hippocrates he is obligated by the oath to remain secret. At least until that oath can be legally dealt, and still due to personal intelligence the details not recorded are his duty to disclose.<br/><br/>Almost like a shield that mirrors his own reflection his conscience maintains his own character, but it consumes him. This reminds me of the scene from Superman II as well during the hour of judgment of the State criminals. Where they become imprisoned in a mirror for their crimes. Was it really three different criminals or just one with three personalities of a mute, military general, and women.<br/><br/>Just as the beginning of this analysis ancient myth of human nature could play on many aspects. Perhaps the reason for the use of the Deaths Head Moth being placed in the mouth. Or, based on history of film this could be the screen-writers reference to Der Fanger, 1966. A German movie that deals with a butterfly collector who develops a super-ego of power that deteriorates into a psychosis of mania where he begins to collect women.<br/><br/>Myths such as the emperors new cloths may play a significant role. Hence the use of women to make a new image that is respectable. The women are used to conceal the hidden emotions of the dual character of cross-gender nature. Thus the suspect makes a physical outer appearance as apparent as his illness inflicts is physical character.<br/><br/>Just as a garment is made from silk cloth at the expense of the moth the image of mentally ill must be at equal risk concerning human virtue. As the story is told and what is known about society and human virtue without both the individual is naked to the morals and ethics of the society. Thus as an analogous relationship just as the moth is destroyed for the sake of the merchant because of the separation of Buddist values and economic values the mentally ill individual destroys women when he truly separates from the moral and ethical obligations of society to promote his own individual image.<br/><br/>Actor Anthony Hopkins plays a fantastic role as the doctor. His practice at being cold and clever makes him seem the more distant. This is the exact opposite in his role as Ted Brautigan in Hearts in Atlantis. Anthony Hopkins recently became a US citizen from the United Kingdom. His duty to the UK military and theatrical skills have propelled him in his own career that is highly noted by his peers from around the globe. Good job Anthony Hopkins."

Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lector is something else. There are very few evil characters that you find yourself rooting for, and even despite knowing that he is a sicko mass murderer, you want him to escape from the prison.

As much as I would love to give away parts I just can't. Buffalo Bill was simply a freak but I was fascinated on how Lector was able to lead Clarice to him by the small clues he gave her throughout the movie.

Anthony Hopkins is excellent as the clever, but sinister mass-murderer Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. She goes to where Lecter(Hopkins) was being held. To me I get the chills being around that guy. But as the old saying goes, ""to get a killer, to find a killer."" That other killer is ""Buffalo Bill""(Ted Levine), a Ed Geine-like killer who kidnapping and killing young women. Unlike Geine, he didn't eat his victims like Lecter. Trusting a killer like Lecter can be bone-chilling, but as long as a trust issue isn't a problem, they can work together. I like the scene where Lecter was in this round cage, and when he called out Clarice to get her papers, he strokes her hand with his finger. Some may call this scene nerve-racking, to me it's a flirt. He trusts Clarice, and I bet she does the same too. Hmmm! Then after that, he gets his dinner, he killed those two guards. He got the liver of the tougher one. Must tastes like foie gras. (HEH HEH!) And he wears the face of the other, another Ed Geine-like action. There's plenty to see in that movie, the moths, the booby traps, and the chilling climax this movie got. It didn't lack anything there! A Neo-classic! 5 stars!"

Hannibal Lecter is one of the most terrifying characters in film due to his extreme intelligence and disturbing habits. The camera work in this movie is also outstanding, especially toward the climax of the film, when the florist is ringing the doorbell; that's all I will say as to not give it away, but it throws you for a loop. Who can forget the eery ""Goodbye Horses"" tune with the infamous dance? The climax will have you on the edge of your seat, just waiting to jump.

"insomniac_rod","10","1","1","23 July 2006"," Excellent display of acting, direction, dialog, and the mind of a serial killer through the eyes of Dr. Lecter.
","This movie is simply excellent because it truly shows you the life and methods of a serial killer. Not only that, the movie also demonstrates how the FBI investigates, studies, and acts against these maniacs. If that isn't enough, the movie also displays the basics of criminology. <br/><br/>We have a complete serial killer movie with high budget and excellent production values. This is by far, the best movie about any serial killer. The main character should be Buffalo Bill because all of the events have to do with him. The FBI is ""hunting"" him because he kidnapped the daughter of a senator. The FBI agent in charge of the case is investigating hints given by the sinister Dr. Lecter in order to catch Buffalo Bill. And of course, Dr. Lecter's speeches always give something away in order to capture the maniac. The events that lead to the ending have important information; every scene is a step towards the mystery behind Buffalo Bill. Agent Sarling is the person in charge of the investigations. She's clever, brave, and beautiful. <br/><br/>I won't get that much into the scenes of the movie because it would be giving away important things to those who haven't seen it. I'll just comment on how this movie displays the intense relationship between a novice agent and a powerful-minded cannibal, who also is a psychologist. The relationship between Dr. Lecter and Agent Starling is the best feature of the movie; all the scenes involving both are great in the acting and dialog factor. The acting couldn't be better. Mr. Hopkins delivers his best performance to date. Dr. Lecter is the eyes of Buffalo Bill; we get to understand and learn about him through Lecter. Jodie Foster demonstrates that she's a brilliant actress and person. How could she manage to perform this complex character? She's just great. <br/><br/>The direction is great. With the proper use of dark combined with beautiful exteriors, ""Silence Of The Lambs"" is an unsetting movie with excellent cinematography. This movie has some memorable scenes in movie cinema and will always be the number one movie about a serial killer. Watch this movie in order to witness one of the best movies of all time, and expect excellent dialogs, acting, direction, and an entertaining factor like in no other movie."
"theshadow908","9","1","1","11 July 2006"," Chilling psychological thriller.
","The Silence of the Lambs picks up 5 years after the events of Manhunter. A serial killer is kidnapping and murdering women, and wearing their skin as clothing. When the governor's daughter is kidnapped, an FBI trainee named Clarice Starling is sent to talk to the cannibalistic Dr. Hannibal Lecter so he might shed some of his vast knowledge on the case. This leads to a bizarre relationship where Clarice opens up to Hannibal for information. This is a very good psychological thriller that will live on through the years as a timeless classic.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is superior to it's predecessor because it seems to be made on a larger budget, and it uses some big names. It successfully translates the mood from Thomas Harris' novel to film, so the movie comes off as dark and creepy. The characters are awesome. The cat and mouse conversations between Hannibal and Clarice are immensely interesting. She is shy, and Hannibal forces her to be bold. The serial killer in this movie, Buffalo Bill, is based off of real life killer Ed Gein, and he is extremely disturbing in this movie. Another good thing is that this is a no holds barred movie. It doesn't pull any punches. It shows what it wants, and it makes the movie more realistic.<br/><br/>The acting is awesome. Anthony Hopkins does a vastly superior job in the role of Hannibal Lecter than Brian Cox did in Manhunter. He made the character his own, and that's why nobody mentions Brian Cox in the role. Hopkins' portrayal is creepy and memorable. Jodie Foster does a knock out job as Clarice Starling, the shy FBI agent forced to interview Hannibal.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an amazing movie, and it definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar.

","Silence of the Lambs has perhaps the best script translation onto screen I have ever seen. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins mix so seamlessly in this psychological thriller that it pulls you in farther than you expected a movie could do. It won numerous awards, and for good reason, it simply put is in a league all its own. Hopkins performance as the now infamous Dr. Hannibal Lectar is perfect. A psychologist genius, who eats his patients is detained in the insane ward for life due to his total threat to society. Meanwhile one of his old patient's lovers (Buffalo Bill) has become a serial killer pursued by Jodi Foster/the FBI recruit. Only Lectar knows the identity of the killer and has the mental aptitude to elude the FBIs questions long enough to enjoy the numerous conversations between him and Jodie Fosters character Clairice. The true terror of Hannibals character, genius and cunning , is contrasted by Buffalo Bill who skins his (female) victims after holding them hostage for days. This film gives you interesting glimpses into the FBI's pursuit of a serial killer, putting you in the shoes of an investigator piecing together a puzzle in order to save a young womans life. This film is purely psychological, and extremely clever with subtleties that most people who have seen the movie have never caught themselves. Examples are the numerous hints Hannibal gives in very unconspicous ways about the killer Buffalo Bill. The movie has a couple big twists that are hard to see coming among all the SUPERB acting and dialogue. One of the more memorable scenes are of the Buffalo Bill home and torture levels below ground that seem to go ON AND ON forever. It almost looks like he'd been living down there since the 60s or 70s and never moved junk around..very cool prop work. I just can't say enough about Hopkins performance...finally, a SMART villain. Amazingly, Silence of the Lambs proved that the scariest villains aren't supernatural but could be the people next door."

","This is another film in which so many aspects of it have been written, critiqued, and analyzed that I seriously wonder why I am even bother writing a review of it. Based on the best-selling novel by Thomas Harris, LAMBS is film that manages to successfully play to both cerebral and visceral senses without slighting one for the other. In other words, those looking for an intelligent psychological thriller will be rewarded with an articulate script and strong performances, while slasher fans will reveal in such genre staples as a transvestite killer who skins bodies. Jonathan Demme's taunt direction ties all the elements together flawlessly, and delivers outstanding performances from his stars.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster brings her innate intelligence and charming naivetÃ© to her role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, and she should receive major kudos for portraying her character's strength as stemming from her brain rather than any pumped-up Sigourney Weaver-esquire physical prowess. Anthony Hopkins also delivers a tremendous performance that and belies his relatively brief screen time with immense effectiveness. He is so menacing that it feels like he's everywhere, even though he is only on-screen for roughly one-fourth of the picture. Scott Glenn and Kasi Lemmons are fine, but underused - this is the Foster and Hopkins show all the way! The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were certainly fans of the film, as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS swept the Academy Awards, deservedly winning Oscars in all five major categories. This was only the third film in history to do so.<br/><br/>A perfect motion picture."

Foster as FBI trainee & former farm orphan Clarice Starling gives a very convincing naive, wide-eyed, & reluctantly courageous young woman faced with finding a sadistic ""Buffalo Bill"" serial killer & getting to know the infamous Dr. Lecter. Both actors make you believe in their characters & leave you further engrossed in the movie.<br/><br/>SOTL is the story of a manhunt for a serial killer dubbed ""Buffalo Bill"" because he skins his ""humps"" or victims. FBI trainee Starling is summoned by Behavioral Science Dept. guru agent Jack Crawford to make a visit to Baltimore Psych. Hospital & talk to its most famous patient, Dr. Hanibal Lecter. Starling is briefed on the physical procedures used with Lecter by conceited & aloof hospital director Dr. Frederick Chilton, who Lecter despises. After a brief encounter with Lecter, Starling uses the doctor's clues to find a patient of his, also a victim of the serial killer. The decapitated head is that of Benjamin Raspell, who Lecter knows intimately. Lecter gives Starling clues to catching the killer as long as she provides him with very personal information about herself. Starling is warned about Lecter's devious ways but decides to cooperate with him to get more clues. After more victims & a U.S. senator's daughter kidnapped by Buffalo Bill, Starling is on a race against time to save her from certain doom. Starling goes to W. Virginia with Crawford to examine the body of one of Bill's latest victims. Starling discovers a object forced into the girl's throat which happens to be a moth, scientifically known as the Death's Head Moth. After Starling & two entomologists index and identify the pupa, she discovers the moth is a grisly calling card. Starling also finds the same moth pupa in the head of Benjamin Raspell, a former patient of Lecter & lover of Buffalo Bill. With Crawford leading the way & Lecter agreeing to guide her for favors, Starling follows the trail to Memphis, TN., where she meets the Cannibal on last time to pick his remarkable brain for clues. Lecter makes a deal with Memphis authorities & Senator Ruth Martin to assist in identifying Buffalo Bill in exchange for access to books, etc. & an annual trip to Plum Island for a short retreat under S.W.A.T. team surveillance. Starling speaks with Lecter shortly as she is escorted to a plane back home by Chilton & Memphis police. Lecter makes his move by ordering a 2nd meal consisting of extra rare lamb chops in Starling's honor. Lecter upchucks a small metal object behind a screen in order to free himself of handcuffs used by police to enter his make-shift cell. Of course, Lecter escapes confinement by trickery, kills the policemen guarding him, & makes his way out of trouble posing as a wounded cop.<br/><br/>Starling stumbles upon a surprised Bill at his home who must either run from or kill the young trainee. Starling prevails by killing Bill, saving the Governor's daughter, & graduates from Quantico at the delight of Agent Crawford. Lecter, now on the loose & following his nemesis Dr. Chilton, licks his chops at the notion of ""having an old friend for dinner"". Lecter slyly walks the streets abroad to surprise Chilton with his usual ""calm sociopathic demeanor.""<br/><br/>SOTL will scare you, surprise you, & make you remember Hannibal Lecter for days to come. If you like a thriller with ""bite"", this film will give you your fill in spades. Superb nail biter that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. A must see!!!"

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" is truly a masterpiece. It's a thriller that requires brains to figure out the twists and turns. It's not a mindless horror movie either; the horror elements are very psychological and tend to be disturbing. Furthermore, the film is almost exactly like the novel of the same name.<br/><br/>I really love the characters in the movie because they stayed true to the characters in the book. Jodie Foster played the role of FBI rookie Clarice Starling in a very realistic setting, and Anthony Hopkins played his role as the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter superbly. Both characters were very convincing, thanks to the powerful performances done by Foster & Hopkins.<br/><br/>The cinematography is outstanding. Everything about the background imagery mentioned in the book sprang to life in this film. Some locations look very beautiful, while others are downright creepy.<br/><br/>The theme music throughout the movie is good and scary, enough to make your nerves tingle. There are also little scenes where familiar popular songs are featured.<br/><br/>To conclude, this is a very rich film and sticks to the book very well. It is just as enjoyable as the novel.<br/><br/>I give this film a 10/10."

","I do not believe there are movies which are perfect, but some are close.

There are always scenes which could have been better or just thrown away. This is where 'The Silence of the Lambs' is different, here you can definitely talk about quality and not quantity.<br/><br/>The main reasons, in my opinion, for the success of this movie are; the excellent light- and sound effects, the psychological manuscript and the professional actors such as Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter).<br/><br/>'The Silence of Lambs' did not, in any way, scare me physically but psychologically and that's why I believe this one of the best."

","This is the movie that inspired me to become a filmmaker. It is absolutely brilliant on so many levels and so entertaining. So many films since have tried to copy its creepiness or its gore or its psychology, but none have found the right balance. If I could ever make a film half as good as one minor scene in this movie, I would be complete. The whole movie is a strange combination of subtlty and over-the-top theatrics. At first it seems like a common thriller (ready for late night HBO), then it takes a strange turn when Lecter begins his self-indulgent question and answer session with Starling. From that point on, it's one symbol, event, and spectacle after another. Everyone definitely needs to look for all the ""I'm just a little girl trapped in a world of men"" - thing that happens with Starling. She is constantly the only woman in a room. Men are constantly oggling her. What was Demme trying to say? Hm? I think the Academy Awards speak for themselves."

","I have always wanted to see this movie. I mean, I was always told that it would creep me out, and it was exciting and beautiful (okay, that's just going a little overboard)and it would scare the living crap out of me, but it was on TV, so I watched it. I taped it, and watch it every chance I get.<br/><br/>I did not get the scares that you would normally get from a thriller, but from the movie, I got the emotion of each character, and the suspense that made it simply irresistible.<br/><br/>The plot for this movie is outrageously original. You don't just get one serial killer, you get two for the price of one. Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is so spine-tingling and ominous, that it is hard to imagine how he could of been a psychiatrist. Clarice Sterling (Jodie Foster)is the perfect choice for THomas Harris, the man who wrote the novel, to have chosen for a mission such as the one she is facing in the movie.<br/><br/>Buffalo Bill (ted Levine) is disturbing as well. He has contributed one of the most famous lines from a thriller into pop culture: ""it rubs the lotion on its skin, unless it gets the hose again"" The acting is so realistic, that you can hardly believe that this is not really happening, but it is actually playing out in front of your eyes, almost as if its true. The suspense is almost hard to bear. You can't wait to see what happens next. I know that when I saw it, I was called away, and I practically hung on to the television to see what would happen.<br/><br/>YOu wouldn't want to let go either. I gave it a 9 out of 10"

I am glad that it was in when i did rent it because i was really starting to get mad. I would not say that this was the best of the trilogy,I would have to say that Red Dragon is the best, most people do not agree with me but that is their opinion.

"kingpace1","9","1","1","15 February 2005"," Great film worthy of its hype but a lot of hidden meaning
","This is a great film that has a lot of hidden meaning. Especially that for women's rights. In the way that Clarice Starling is treated unfairly. This is really a film about overcoming adversity. Their is plenty of scenes which detail this perfectly. One is when she is running with her friend at the FBI compound when a group of males go running by and give them looks of ""What the hell are they doing here."" The way Hannibal Lector will only talk to Clarice a woman mainly I feel because it is a different approach the FBI used. This main fact is covered up by the fact that Lector likes her or has a crush on her. Another is when she is doing training at the FBI compound when they run into the place to secure it Clarice messes up and is told that she is dead and he looks at the guy and says you did great, but to Clarice he says you messed up. The scene of the film which details my point is the scene in which they are at the funeral home in which all the police are meeting and Scott Glenn's character tells the other police officer to come with him into the other room to talk details, this way Clarice can't hear them and then Clarice looks around to see herself surrounded by men. All in which are giving looks of ""What the hell is she doing here."" If you pay attention closely this is repetitive throughout the film. One scene in which Clarice overcomes her ""disadvantage"" which don't get me wrong is not one but detailed in the film this way is when doing an autopsy of the body, Clarice yells at everyone to leave. They listen to her and leave. She actually cracks a smirk in this scene, to almost say to herself ""I did it."" Of course we all know the ending of the film, where the women was right and all the men at the other place were wrong. She overcame her adversity and succeeded over the men and is also shown at the award ceremony at the end where award ceremony says her name first as opposed to the male name next. Scott Glenn's character is a closet sexist. This is a great film once again and deserves all its credit but watch close for these details throughout the whole film. 9/10"

In this movie you can find a great tension, cruel stories but also there is this relation between Lecter an Clarice...

","The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest horror movies I have ever seen. I absolutely loved it, even when I first saw it at age ten I loved it. Anthony Hopkins is so incredibly intriguing, and without him, Hannibal Lecter wouldn't be anywhere as capturing as I find him to be in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy. Hannibal and Red Dragon are also great. Manhunter I didn't like nearly as much as any of the others because of the not having Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lecter. Hannibal is my favourite out of any Hannibal Lecter movie or book because it shows him free. That is my main reason. You get to see what the doctor is like without bars in front of him. I recommend The Silence of the Lambs as well as any other Hannibal Lecter movie to anyone that enjoys horror movies, but then again I have been told over and over that I have an obsession with the Hannibal Lecter movies and books. As long as your stomach can handle the occasion blood and gore that is included in the movies."

","Once in a while a movie comes along that just blows you away, and this is one of them. The performances - ALL of them - are downright brilliant, from the unsure, yet aggressive Clarice Starling, her controlled superior Agent, the insane Buffalo Bill (by the way one of the more haunting movie villains...he'll come to you in your dreams ;) and, of course, Hannibal Lecter. What can I say about Hannibal - he is the reason why you watch the movie another time. I said Buffalo Bill is haunting. Well, if that is true, Lecter is the stuff that nightmares are made of, and yet, in a strange way, you want to have dinner with him (preferably one that you cooked yourself). A fascinating character that you wish to see more of, and actually have the feeling to see more than you actually do - He has a total on-screen time of about 15 minutes. Fun Fact, I believe that's the shortest on-screen time that ever brought an actor an Academy Award. <br/><br/>To sum up the rest, the storyline is compelling, has enough creepy moments to be classified as a horror thriller, and was followed by a bunch of movies that desperately want to be ""the silence of the lambs"", but are not. In my opinion, and I only include this because another reviewer stated the opposite, it is by far superior to ""Se7en"". If you haven't seen this movie, it's about time.

","I had always been putting off watching ""Silence of the Lambs"". Everyone always said I'd never sleep again (or something along those lines). Granted, they said that about ""Jaws"" and ""Psycho"", too, and I wasn't...completely...freaked out by them. Then a few weeks ago I watched ""Red Dragon"" (what can I say, I'm Norton/Fiennes fan). I thought it was very interesting -- and it caused me to ask myself, yet again, why I haven't seen the original Lecter-a-thon. So I finally watched it, and I am very, very glad I did.<br/><br/>I think that it is considered so great, not necessarily because of the writing, but because of the other beautiful aspects of its production. The cutaways added much appreciated suspense (as did the music...and acting, of course), the closeups pulled you closer into each character's world, and, much like ""The Shining"", the filmmakers were able to make the most open spaces seem the most confining and ""scary"". <br/><br/>I immediately noticed the difference between ""Lambs"" and its sequel-prequel ""Dragon"", most notably the effort involved. All of the actors WERE their characters, and everything seemed so wrapped up in the environment (in a good way).<br/><br/>Although this movie does not make it to my favorites list, I thought it was very good (the quality more than anything), and I recommend it to everyone - well, unless you hate bugs."
"movieguy1021","8","1","1","17 August 2004"," The Silence of the Lambs: 8/10
","I think it's gotten to the point where most people don't really care about the Academy Awards anymore, because they're not for individual achievements, but for appreciating an actor or a film because it cost a lot of money. But back before those days, when the Oscars meant something, it was a huge honor to win the five major Academy Awards-picture, actor, actress, director, and screenplay. The Silence of the Lambs is the third, and most recent, one to do that. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins won acting awards, Jonathan Demme won the directing award, and Ted Tally won for best adapted screenplay. Was it deserving for all of those awards? For the most part, more or less.<br/><br/>Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), a serial killer/cannibal who has the identity and the whereabouts of notorious serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), is being interviewed by rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster) for information on Bill. But Lecter's more cunning and demented than first glance, and has fun playing with the mind of Starling as she's interviewing him.<br/><br/>Since I don't really know what to say about this movie, I'll go my fail-safe way and go over each award it won and why it should have won for that reason. The screenplay, based off of the book by Thomas Harris, has a slow build-up (one that originally turned me off), but as soon as Lecter is introduced, it's paid off. The script takes us inside of the head of Lecter, making him one of the most interesting celluloid characters of the 1990s. The screenplay also doesn't really waste that much time with unimportant characters, although a little more on Jack Crawford would have been nice. But the screenplay is tight and holds together well, throughout the hit-or-miss directing career of Demme.<br/><br/>Demme won an Oscar for best directing. I have mixed feelings about this one. On one hand, many scenes in Lambs aren't boring, but not really that exciting or involving. He does have some good style (I love that night-vision scene), and does build up some good suspense as the movie comes to a close. The suspense is laid on thick at the end, and I suppose it makes up for the still entertaining but not thrilling rest of the movie. Demme does set up some mystery, too, as we follow Clarice's adventures. There are also some very disturbing scenes (""It rubs the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again!""), which fit in with the tone of most of the movie. Disturbing, yes, but actually impacting? Not really.<br/><br/>Both Foster and Hopkins won acting Oscars for leading roles. Foster's character, as I said before, began as being annoying to me, but soon became a person I could tolerate. But was she deserving of an Oscar? A nomination is even a stretch, mainly because of that awful accent of hers. Hopkins was great, but with total screentime being around 16 minutes, he was more of a supporting actor (although, I guess the awards were crooked then. They wanted to give an award to both Jack Palance for City Slickers and Hopkins, but they were both supporting roles). I think we got the gist of Hannibal in those 16 minutes, and Hopkins put in a memorable performance in that time.<br/><br/>Lastly, Lambs won best picture. Is it the best picture of 1991? I'm not sure, I haven't seen every film from 1991. But it's a damn good one.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language, violence, and disturbing themes."

Jody Foster should now be considered one of he greatest female movie detectives of all time. She provided an excellent view into the life of a struggling student with real skills that was able to overcome her previous experiences. I now consider ""The Silence of the Lambs"", not only my favorite horror/suspense film of all time, but just my flat-out favorite.

EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS FILM!"
"farfromperfection","10","1","1","4 June 2004"," Silencing the Lambs
","**Deemed spoilers**<br/><br/>No matter how many times I watch this film, I always get the deep sense of brilliance taken from the first time I watched it. <br/><br/>This is certainly one of the better films of our generation - In light of the a-typical ""horror"" movies of today, Silence of the Lambs is in a considerable class of its own. Although gruesome in parts, it perfectly balances the sense of fear and psychological reliance's the different characters have upon each other. <br/><br/>The play between Lecter and Starling (Hopkins and Foster) is a duo that rarely is seen on screen, and was utterly plausible. Starling walks into Baltimore as a trainee FBI agent (and as others have commented before me, this perhaps is the only bone of contention, the reality or lack of henceforth of a training agent being assigned to the case) and you feel she leaves Lecter's cell a completely different person. Relenting all the pressure people have hyped around Hannibal ""Cannibal"" Lecter she reaches him with no airs and graces and willingly accepts the feat. The relationship develops into something on a level of trust, Clarice recognising Lecters needs and desires, and when he escapes towards the end of the film she is aware and sure he will not come and find her. This is the kind of rapport they built up during the movie, almost the blind leading the blind. Lecter had a sense of dependency on Starling as much as she had upon him, although she to a more extreme extent. <br/><br/>Hopkin's and Foster play the characters with absolute precision and to this day I know anyone else having been cast in those roles would have not found themselves anywhere near the on-screen chemistry (platonic, of course) that the aforementioned actors had. Hopkin's is in a class of his own as the mentally inept yet frighteningly intelligent Lecter and Foster is equally magnetic as the vulnerable, shielding Starling trying her hardest to face the horrors in front of her. Her reliance on Lecter is more than just meets the eye - Her main priorities were to deal with the ""Buffalo Bill"" case but you can see having spoken to Lecter on numerous levels she took a sense of knowledge and experience out of it. The connection on an emotional level was fantastic to watch, especially as Lecter purges out Starling's memories of her troubled youth. Foster, in particular, played this part wonderfully.<br/><br/>My favourite scene is most probably when Clarice is visiting the home of one of ""Bill's"" victim, and whilst looking around the rooms she notices the closet, adorned with fabric reading in dress making. Realising what Bill is doing to his victims (and without trying to give too much away) she immediately phones HQ and the desperation in her voice as she tries to articulate her discovery is the first in many climax's the film offers.<br/><br/>Behind the clear thriller sense of the film and the tendency to sit on the edge of your seat (the first time you watch it, you will have a completely new concept of a ""thriller/horror"" movie, especially if you are seeing it for the first time from here forth) the stories of the character weave so well together and as well as enjoying the build up of suspense, you also come to appreciate the characters themselves. In my humble opinion the prequel and sequel of Silence of the Lambs didn't get near what this 1991 excellence gave to the audience. <br/><br/>A definite 9/10."

","You realize you're in a different sort of thriller when Clarice Starling walks down that corridor, trying to ignore the cat-calls of a cell-block full of lunatics, only to find that the most dangerous inmate on the block is standing calmly in his cell, waiting for her, almost as if he's welcoming her to a cocktail party. Rare is the movie that gets everything right, but ""The Silence of the Lambs"" comes awfully close to providing the perfect example for a modern thriller. It's so disturbing to watch for some people that it's often described as a horror movie, which says more about other films involving serial killing, in my opinion, than it does about this one. We're not used to crime thrillers that actually show killing and its aftermath in gruesome, clinical detail-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. We're not used to films showing us psychopaths of unnerving ferocity-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. Most importantly, we're not used to seeing this kind of story presented in such a matter-of-fact way-- ""The Silence of Lambs"" is never showy in its camera work or its performances. Most crime thrillers don't quite thrill, and certainly don't frighten, because you never quite believe them. You believe ""The Silence of the Lambs"", especially when you wish you didn't."

","This is quite possibly the scariest movie since ""The Exorcist"". Metaphorically speaking, Hannibal Lecter appears to be The Serpent to Clarice Starling's Eve. Hannibal is a member of elite society; a representation of the best our civilization has to offer. His  Jeckyl-Hyde persona is a mockery of that civilization, and thus Satan-like. Starling, the would-be savior of the ""lambs"", is inexplicably drawn to him. This is without a doubt one of the best good-vs-evil stories ever filmed. The cast, from Anthony Hopkins, to Jodie Foster, to Anthony Heald as the creepy Dr. Chilton, to the unforgettable Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, was remarkable.

I haven't seen part 2 or 3, I don't want to-nothing could possibly measure up and Jodie Foster probebly knew this after all we don't see her in the sequel.<br/><br/>To wind up, this isn't just a good film, it's superb.And the academy knew it to, I just wish they hadn't made a sequel."

","For character development of Hannibal Lecter, please view Red Dragon, first.<br/><br/>It is the prequel to this movie, and bestows the viewer with much needed information not gleaned from this production.<br/><br/>The end of ""Red Dragon"" tells us that Hannibal has an upcoming visit from another FBI agent to look forward to; a female agent. He asks for her name but due to the nature of prequels, we already have that information: Clarice Starling. This is one of those Oscars-dominating movies whose name was on the tip of everyone's tongue for a while. From time to time, a movie comes along which is so annoyingly popular as to make me wish to never see it. <br/><br/>Mainstream popularity is not wholly attractive to me, and I tend to avoid it at all costs. However, I was forced to view this film as a class requirement in college. So I rented it, determined to hate it. <br/><br/>First of all, the whole movie, although released in the early 90's, appears to be obsessed with the 1980's. The clothing, the hair styles, the clichés, the soundtrack, and the atmosphere seems to be wrapped in a time warp. Starling's (Jodie Foster) character in particular, seems to be a walking cliché. She is a hapless hick; an unfortunate who is, as Lecter put it, ""...one generation away from poor white trash."" <br/><br/>Secondly. I was born in the south, and I can tell you that her accent, though sometimes a decent reminiscing of poor West Virginia, is horrible. It comes and goes seemingly at whim. <br/><br/>Third. The training and knowledge Starling exhibits, combined with the fact that she grew up poor, in a home where sewing was almost a certain necessity, the fact that she missed the obvious sewing patterns of skin removed from the victims just does not work for me. I grew up upper middle class, and I knew in the first 30 minutes what Buffalo Bill was up to. Her character should have been written to be more intelligent. She was able to puzzle out Lecter's riddles, but not see what was staring her right in the face? <br/><br/>And lastly. While the film quality is horrible; grainy and low quality, the cinematography itself is startlingly good.<br/><br/>All that having been said, the psychological aspects of this film are above reproach. Dr. Lecter's character, portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins, is the perfect portrayal of a psychopathic sycophant with a ""taste"" for high society. <br/><br/>As a slave to his own superiority, he is a thousand times more dangerous than those psychopaths who believe they are on a holy mission, or at the head of some spiritual metamorphosis into a higher state of being. <br/><br/>Lecter is under no such delusion. He is the brilliant sociopath who can blend into society without casting even the briefest hesitation in our acceptance of his social graces and high society politeness. He does as he does, merely as a means to humor himself, and for no other reason. There are no outward clues or appearances of anything gone wrong within and therefore, is all the more deadly for it. He simply...is. <br/><br/>His manipulation of Starling is on a high intellectual level. He is a sage of such devious management of others' minds. His knowledge of Buffalo Bill, the newest personification of sickness, brings Starling to his cell. As a brilliant psychiatrist turned ""Chesapeake Slasher,"" Lecter has had the opportunity to touch many lives; to shape, mold, and guide others less fortunate than he. Indeed, his influence may very well have assisted Buffalo Bill in his crossing the stream between being a confused and needy individual, to that of a homicidal psychopath. <br/><br/>Many researchers have agreed that offender profiling can be a useful tool in solving serial homicides (Egger, 1998; Stevens, 1997; Holmes, 1998; Canter, 1994; Douglas and Olshaker, 1995). However, the question remains as to whether the lack of ability the modern police department has in dealing with serial homicide has created a real need for this type of investigative practice. <br/><br/>A lack of psychological training, limited resources, and an apparent rise in serial homicide rates may be creating the appearance that police need new investigative techniques, when in reality what may be more appropriate is a higher standard of psychological training among police investigators. <br/><br/>The number of serial killers presently active in the United States has been estimated to be between 30 and 500, depending on the source (O'Reilly-Fleming, 1996). Just think. With the possibility of 500 serial killers who are ""active"" in the US, how many of them are as educated and intelligent as the character of Hannibal Lecter? The statistics are chilling at an estimation of 80% (O'Reilly-Fleming, 1996). <br/><br/>Many serial killers are professionals; doctors, lawyers, even law enforcement personnel or city employees. People who have passed the civil service tests, psychological evaluations, and thorough screenings. Sociopaths are such due to their ability to ""blend in"" with our society without any obvious dysfunctions. <br/><br/>How many people do you know who are a little ""quirky,"" eccentric, or just plain freaky? Chances are, they are not the homicidal maniacs in your lives. Chances are, they are the very polite, nice, friendly and helpful person at the drug store where you go; the empathetic lab tech who is drawing your blood; the family physician with the terminal smile...think about this, and these movies, next time you encounter an overly-polite stranger. <br/><br/>Just a thought. <br/><br/>This movie rates a 9.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","My absolute favorite ! Glued to the screen from frame 1 till the end. There are a lot of good things to be said about this movie and have already been said. One thing however, which I find is great about this movie, but which is hardly mentioned is that it keeps you at a 100% suspense level without going into a ""shocking"" scene. I mean there are no kiekaboe scenes (you expect someone to jump from behind a tree in the opening scene, etc), no special stunning effects, no bloody scenes (the camera is on Lectors face when he kills the policeman), etc, etc. Nothing really scary is directly shown, all is in the suggestion that something is going to happen. Great !"
"levigarrett","10","1","1","4 August 2003"," Well researched, stunningly gruesome, beautifully written.
","This film pioneered the Hollywood image of today's serial killer.  Well researched, there are minimal flaws to ruin the credibility of the gruesomely graphic files of both the cannibal Lector and ""Buffalo Bill"".<br/><br/>Ted Bundy, Jeffery Dalhmer, Clifford Olson, and lately Robert Picton have exposed the world to the sensational world of the serial killer.  The media exploits the stories of these demented murderers as the consumer watches in disgusted amazement.<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs showed a somewhat accurate, yet oversensationized view of the takedown of a mysterious freak of society.  The killer, first portrayed as an unknown to his victims, makes you feel vulnerable, like it could be anyone.  Toward the end of the film it is revealed that the killer was known to at least one of the victims, leaving you feel as though it could be your neighbour, or uncle.<br/><br/>This wonderful movie will have you looking over your shoulder and second glancing at those strangers who pass you by."
"Angry_Arguer","10","1","1","6 August 2003"," Hannibal Lecter's America
","The subtext of Silence of the Lambs is phenomenal considering it is the work of Jonathan Demme.  He is not a creative person, but it is a blessing that this movie lacks any subtle directorial touches.  The focus is on the actors, not the circumstances.  This is evident in Howard Shore's score, a mix of the conventional horror movie and the old school thriller.  It is not particularly pompous, but it doesn't need to be.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster attempts to be deep, if it weren't for Demme's camera she would be nothing more than a decoration.  Her accent is just a distraction from her actions, by golly I hated it.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is the dominant feature of the entire film.  More than him, it is his character.  Hannibal is certainly one of the 10 deepest characters ever created for film, he has superseded Hopkins himself.  Notice how the camera loves Hannibal and he loves it back.  Hopkins will never be better despite recent efforts to eclipse his role.  Hollywood has tried cashing in on Hannibal Lecter's persona, but never understanding the context enough. Gore doesn't substitute for script.  <br/><br/>The final parody, of course, is the way Demme presents America as either a victim or something hidden in a closet.  The apparition never gets to see the light of day because it is constantly being snuffed out at night by the forces of evil.  Maybe he was being prophetic in his primitive mind.<br/><br/>Given the documentary style of the film, it is interesting how much attention is given to Jame Gumb.  Had he been absent more often, I'm certain it would've helped the suspense, but one must wonder ahead of time where the story is going.  We can guess what Clarice is going to do ahead of time, but what about Hannibal?  That is the fault of the editors, but Silence of the Lambs is certainly better edited than Batman or Empire of the Sun.  It is gruesome, not for titillation in the fashion of Friday the 13th. Rather, it is present for the sense of realism.  Might I add that this is one of the most disturbingly dark movies ever made.<br/><br/>Overall, a well-deserving winner of Best Picture (for once I agree with the accursed Academy of fools) that stands out in its genre.  Horror will never be the same.  I would have preferred if Foster didn't have that nagging accent, but that's a small price to pay for a lack of a message in the film. Geometrically superior to its so-called 'sequels'.  4.5 out of 5 stars."
"crystaly-williamson","9","1","1","25 July 2003"," Muting of the Mutton
","This movie is the perfect example of the magic that can happen when you have a great script,superb actors and a director who can make it work.  Unlike its sequal Hannibal, which was too over the top with its movement lacking cohesion, unessary and confusing artsy/fartsy b.s., violence and gore that it left the plot and characters involved weak and under-developed while the prequal-sequal Red-Dragon although a descent piece of work did not go the extra mile to really develop the characters and the story itself was much too ""similar"" to the story-line of Silence to stand out on its own as being anything other than ""what you might expect"". Silence stands on its own as a dramatic and meaningful peice of cinema with a well developed plot and deep charactars that pull you in and take you on a chilling thrill ride.

Anthony Heald gives an underrated performance in his supporting role also.

"xbabe82517","10","1","1","18 June 2003"," Brilliant masterpiece, and utterly unforgettable!
","A few years ago I tried to watch The Silence of the Lambs but there were many distractions and I was unable to follow it properly. Having had Red Dragon delivered to me accidentally (my own fault, through not cancelling the order) and thinking it was brilliant, I decided to invest in The Silence of the Lambs. And I am delighted that I did. It is the best psychological horror/thriller I have ever seen, and Anthony Hopkins is undoubtedly one of my favourite actors, especially after seeing his first class performance in this film. He has such presence on-screen, a real intensity, and fantastic chemistry with his co-star Jodie Foster. He completely underplays his character, largely only talking for the majority of the film, yet you cannot help but watch him in awe when he is on the screen. I also found - and I'm sure others did too - that I was unable to hate Hannibal Lecter. Despite what he has done, and seeing what he is capable of, Hopkins's portrayal of him makes you think that somewhere inside him he is capable of feeling, and his developing relationship with Clarice shows this. What also makes The Silence of the Lambs exceptional is it's surprising lack of violence and gore. There is only one scene that some may find disturbing (but it had to be in there somewhere!), but other than that it is the gripping storyline, and the wonderful acting that keeps you glued to the screen. The Silence of the Lambs does not need to rely on the cannibalism issue to interest people, and when you think about it, the film is not really about cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer - oh, and he's got a taste for cannibalism as well. Perhaps the only reason it is remembered so much for this is because - in my opinion - no other film has managed to use this subject in an effective way. There would be nothing entertaining in seeing bloody, gory images of someone cannibalising someone throughout an entire film. A good storyline is needed to make this kind of film work, and that's exactly why it does work - it's brilliant in every way, and I cannot fault it."
"pieintheface","10","1","1","1 June 2003"," Nothing Short of Spectacular
","Silence of the Lambs is a modern day classic. That is all anyone can say about it. From the day it hit theaters, this was the movie that defined the psycho-serial killer drama. Even more, though, the movie is able to escape the horror genre and explore other themes, which is perhaps the main reason it has garnered as many accolades as it has. In recent cinema, I cannot recall another movie that had won the top five awards at the Oscars (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor, and Actress) and all deserved for that matter.<br/><br/>The movie still keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it, and believe me, I've watched it numerous times. The best part about it is that I find new things to marvel over every time I watch it and the special features on the DVD version enlighten me to even more exciting new things. This was the role of a lifetime for Jodie Foster. In fact, Foster's portrayal of Starling was a pivotal part of the movie. Her humility and vulnerability contrasting with her strong convictions and go-get-em attitude created the perfectly believable character. Her role as a young FBI agent separated from her male counterparts opens the door for gender analysis as well. Furthermore, the chemistry between Hopkins and Foster was so strong that it created the `Beauty and the Beast' relationship originally intended by author Thomas Harris.<br/><br/>It's hard to pinpoint exactly what is so remarkable about Demme's film, other than that it's just a good movie. Oftentimes, the film is dark, but it is executed with such deft that the film never loses its viewer."

"arvidstromberg","9","1","1","4 May 2003"," Psychology, violence, suspense, excellence.
","First of all: if you have read Thomas Harrises novel and not yet seen this film (what have you been doing?), you will find that they differ. This is not a bad thing at all, this is one of the best cinematic adaptations of a novel I have ever seen. So, there.<br/><br/>*******POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW!!!*******<br/><br/>The plot starts out when young FBI agent trainee Clarice Starling (Foster) is assigned to interview the definitely terrifying Dr Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). Dr Lecter is a serial killer, now imprisoned in a mental institution. He is believed to have information concerning a murderer on the loose. But he is unwilling to help, unless he receives something in return...<br/><br/>For anyone who has read Thomas Harrises novel, you will know that in his stories, everything is psychological. What is so wonderful about this cinematic adaptation is that it has really captured the spirit of Harrises writing. With the ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" reference, the filmmakers could easily have been driven to turn this into a gorefest. Instead, the interaction between the charachters is central. This is most prominent in the scenes where Foster and Hopkins are face-to-face. It is wonderful to see two such actors of quality really create something more, a connection that reaches from the screen right to the viewer. It only goes to show that you don't need excessive force or blood spurting in every scene to convey horror or fright to an audience. Sometimes, two people's eyes meeting is all it takes. Also, there are plenty of classical one-liners delivered by Hopkins along the way, guaranteed to send chills down your spine.<br/><br/>
Finally: though this IS a psychological thriller more than a violent horror flick, it has its share of more violent scenes. Hence, if you dislike explicit violence, I sincerely recommend Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" instead. What this however is, is excellence in suspense- one of the greatest thrillers I have ever seen, and a magnificent display of acting skills. Ms Foster, Mr Hopkins- I salute you."
"Cinesnatch","10","1","1","2 May 2003"," Questionable, but strangely acceptable camp emanates from this chilling, engaging suspense story.
","***Warning: SPOILERS herein***<br/><br/>One of the few Best Picture winners (not that the A.A.S. is any great measure of quality), and the only one since I've been alive, that I actually think may have been one of the best pictures of the year it came out, if not the best.  It's not without flaws, but it certainly offers some of those most riveting examples of mainstream filmmaking.<br/><br/>The plot: lt. Jack Crawford sends one of his top academy students, Clarice Sterling (played with unwavering focus by Jodie Foster), unbeknownst to her, as a covert, but feeble and desperate attempt to extract information about a serial killer on the loose from genius psychiatrist Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins, who, I imagine, will never be able to usurp this performance) who is incarcerated in an asylum for the criminally insane.  She exchanges information about the killer for biographical details about herself. Through F.B.I. missteps, Lector manipulates the situation towards freedom while guiding Sterling to the killer and recognition for her efforts. All the while, there is the subplot involving the killer and his current victim from her initial kidnapping towards the end of her captivity.  The killer feels he is a transsexual failed by society and modern medicine, who takes his aggression out by selecting over-weight females, kidnapping and starving them, before killing them and removing their skins.<br/><br/>The film takes itself mostly seriously with a slightly off-beat tone one could expect from director Jonathan Demme.  However, it's the ending, while fun and clever, that throws into question the film's integrity.  Did we just witness the emotional journey of a young woman's plight to deal with her childhood ghosts while trying to save another young woman from dying or are we rooting for a truly psychotic man too intelligent and bored with this world while our tongues are pressed firmly in our cheeks?  The film is mostly representational of the novel, which has an easier time alluding these questions with its pulpish nature.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, the interaction between Foster and Hopkins are chilling and mesmerizing.  The scenes with Ted Levine as James Gumb are mostly gruesome and disturbing, but hardly worth protesting for negative gay stereotyping. (I feel the same sentiment towards Basic Instinct was unfounded; however, it probably did help them both at the box office, I imagine)  For a film where you know who the serial killer is from the beginning, it's engaging and suspenseful none-the-less.  And Clarice Sterling offers its audience a modern heroine which they embraced, which isn't that frequent, if you think about it.  She's just finds herself in the confines of a film whose intentions are somewhat dubious.<br/><br/>The success of `Lambs' ignited an inferno with the serial killer genre wh ich became hugely popular with inferior-quality, even more dishonest films like `Se7en' and `Fallen.'  I own a DVD-version of the film and watch scenes every now and then, but mostly for the camp its degenerated to.<br/><br/>10: One of the few films, one can use the term ""modern classic,"" though its not exactly classy."

"omophagia-2","10","1","1","25 March 2000"," For once, the Academy wasn't entirely inaccurate!
","When most novels-- the ones worth reading, at least-- are converted into films, the results are, in most instances, vastly inferior; on rare occasions, the movie adaptations equal or even surpass the creative impact of their written forms.<br/><br/>_The Silence of the Lambs_ is one such film. Though it is quite different from Thomas Harris' widely revered novel-- and I will refrain from elaborating upon these differences because everyone should, at some point, sit down and read Harris' finest work-- the film is no less an artistic triumph.<br/><br/>The strength of _The Silence of the Lambs_ is in the tense interplay between Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling and Sir Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lechter. The rapport between their characters is both riveting and bone-chilling in its intensity, and the thought of lesser actors tackling such scenes is perhaps as frightening as any of this masterful film's horror. Their performances are the driving force behind the film.<br/><br/>Jonathan Demme's direction is also first-rate. Though the score is occasionally too obvious and overpowering, his decisions-- from sweeping camera pans to tightly framed close-ups-- are generally wise, and they give the film the uncomfortable atmosphere needed to create the dramatic tension that sustains the viewer's interest through to the movie's unsettling climactic scenes.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best films of the 1990s, a decade characterized by extravagance, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is sufficiently daring, while managing a certain restraint within all of its elements-- the intelligently-composed screenplay, Demme's direction, and the ensemble acting-- that allows it to transcend to an artistic level far above most every other film of the past ten years.<br/><br/>RATING: 10 out of 10. It's not entirely perfect, but _The Silence of the Lambs_, with its unrivaled intensity and passion, epitomizes the psychological thriller genre.

Anthony Hopkins was the perfect choice for Hannibal, and I think that the best performance OF ALL TIME was given by him in this movie. He also worked perfectly with Jodie Foster, and she worked perfectly with him. Not even Einstein could have created better chemistry than what went on between those two. When Clarice was interviewing Hannibal, I started shivering in fear. And as the movie went on I kept on getting more and more scared.<br/><br/>But the acting would not have been so great were it not for the plot itself. The plot was scary and thrilling in itself.

Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the second greatest movie villain of all time next to Lord Darth Vader, was so convincing that he more than deserved the Academy Award.  I am glad that he will reprise the role again. Jodie Foster was so good in her role of Clarice Starling that I am glad that she won the Academy Award.  She should come back for a sequel. More praise should go to Ted Levine.  With the exception of the nude shot, he was incredible as Jame Gumb, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill. I think it was interesting how he kept refering to Catherine Martin as `IT' instead of `SHE' OR `HER'.  Very convincing.  As I said before, a sequel is WAY overdue.

","Silence of the Lambs (1991) C-118 min. D: Jonathan Demme. Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Anthony Heald. Suspenseful detective yarn about an FBI trainee whose only way to track down a notorious serial killer is to ask for help from another one, the infamous Hannibal `The Cannibal' Lectar. Pretty good mystery/thriller has some disgusting subject matter (even for the TV version, which is what I viewed) but hits home in a bravura finale. RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, strong language, adult themes, and disturbing subject matter."
"Rich-91","10","1","1","22 October 1998"," Psychological Horror
","""Silence of the Lambs"" is horror at its best.  While it lacks the stupidity of traditional slasher films, it possesses the intelligence to use the most adaptable medium for horror--the human mind. Hannibal Lector is brought to life powerfully by Anthony Hopkins  in the role that has defined his career.  Hannibal is scary because he is destructive, manipulative, sadistic and, above all, a cannibal.  The horror that comes from his character is, despite all his ""evil"", he is likeable. Charming in an eerie way, all his evils are projected graphically onto the screen.  Unlike other horror villains, Dr. Lector is distinctly human.  We are all the more scared because he is real and believable.  Many people truly think Hannibal Lector is a real person, a credit to Thomas Harris (for creating the character) and Anthony Hopkins (for bringing Dr. Lector to life).  Dr. Lector again breaks the stereotype for modern horror villains because he actually helps our hero (Clarisse Starling) find the real killer. It is his words that lead Clarisse to the house of Buffalo Bill.  ""How do we first start to covet?  We covet that which we see everyday."" ""Silence of the Lambs"" isn't a pleasant film, but it is an unforgettable movie experience."
"S.F.1014","10","1","1","10 October 1999"," A splendid movie - even better than the book!
","Maybe I got this opinion 'cause I first watched the movie, but Demme's Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter makes you shiver much more than Harris' Hannibal does. Hopkins' acting, too, is so brilliant, you really believe him to be this hyper-intelligent, cold-blooded monster. But even better is Jodie Foster, who shows us a different kind of ambitious, young career-woman. She's not stonecold and harder than hard as we've seen so many times. Fosters' Clarice Starling is weak sometimes, and this makes her real and human."

Dr. Lector is called Hannibal the cannibal you can pretty much guess what he did. Dr. Lector keeps giving Starling clues in an exchange for answering his questions about her childhood. Anthony Hopkins performance stuns me every time it's simply brilliant. Scott Glen performance as the psychopath who wants to be a transvestite was bravo as well. Jodie Foster received an Academy award for her excellent performance as well. The scene when Jack is watching Clarice as she goes through the house is chilling.

","Excellent.  A true gem.  ""The silence of the lambs"" is the third and last movie up to date to have garnered the four major Oscars: Best picture, best actor (Hopkins), best actress (Foster), and best director (Demme).  The one thing that might make the fact that this movie won these four Oscars all the more exceptional is that contrary to  ""It happened one night"" and ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" which are a romantic comedy and a heavy drama, ""The silence of the lambs"" is a high-scale horror-movie.<br/><br/>  FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster) is assigned to track down a serial killer who calls himself Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).  The only problem she must confront however is that to catch Buffalo Bill, she must consult with Hannibal ""The cannibal"" Lecter (Hopkins) who is an ex-psychiatrist renowned across the country.  Dr. Lecter has a clue lying in his head as to what Buffalo Bill's true identity is and how to catch him.  However, Lecter will not cooperate unless Starling lets him in onto some of the details of her private life.<br/><br/>  Incredibly gripping and frightening, ""The silence of the lambs"" is one of those rare thrillers we see.

","I have to say that The Silence of the Lambs ranks as one of the best thrillers of the decade.<br/><br/>  Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is nothing short of remarkable.  The first scene where we see him is beautifully done.  His voice is utterly chilling and he seduces you into liking him, a difficult task. Jodie Foster also gives a great performance as Clarice Starling, sent to interview Lecter in the hopes that it will lead to the capture of Buffalo Bill. Their four scenes together are nothing short of magnificent.  The tension that appears is real, and we feel it.     Jonathan Demme is a director whom I have never really admired.  Now, I can say that I do, and this movie is a masterpiece of direction.  Especially the climax.  He also directs the final confrontation scene between Hopkins and Foster very well.  It plays out a perverse parody of a love scene, and there is a lot of sexual tension (especially when he strokes her finger at the end of it).<br/><br/>  Simply stated, a great movie experience, and worthy of it's place on the AFI list."

Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are both brilliant, they give us all a clear example of what good acting is all about, and earned well deserved academy awards for their efforts.  This film is so gripping, it draws you in instantly and it holds you there right until the final credits end.  All I can say is what a movie!  TSOTL delves into the human psyche, and questions the way we think, why we act on things the way we do, is anything incidental?  How can we better judge people so we may have any idea to what goes on inside people's minds.  This film is mind boggling.  While it is  excessively violent in places, it has to be so the viewer can visualise the true horror of the character's actions.

"eeq","9","1","1","12 June 1999"," Excellent as high level psychological drama (but the book is better)
","All right you guys.  It's simply not appropriate to compare Silence of the Lambs with its 'prequel' Manhunter (Red Dragon). SOTL is a high level psychological drama targeted for the big audiences with top actors--with minimal procedurals. Manhunter is more of a procedural with attempts at psychology and targeted at a different (and smaller) audience with a virtually no-name cast.  Each does its job very well, but its really unfair to compare the 2.  After not getting to play Hannibal the cannibal in SOTL, I am glad to see Brian Cox getting other juicy (albeit smaller) roles, usually as the villain, in other action/suspense movies.  As far as the novels go, Red Dragon is better written, but SOTL has a superior (virtually perfect) ending."

The performances of Hopkins and Foster were so real you forgot it was a movie you were watching and not real events and they truly deserved the Oscars they picked up for their roles. I suggest you also watch Manhunter which is based on the prequel to the novel Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, which has a Dr. Lecktor in it. There is also plans for the upcoming sequel to the book, Hannibal, to be made into a movie, so watch out for that, I'm sure it will be just as excellent as Silence of the Lambs was."

","The only movie that can compare to the tension and suspense of this movie, I think, is Jaws. The same elecrifying thrill and fear you feel every time the shark approaches is mirrored by a terrifying monster in this film, one that also eats people - Dr Hannibal Lector. The popularity of this film was such that I knew the plot when  I was ten in 1991, although I only saw it about a month ago. I will usually never watch films that are disgusting, and I didn't really want to watch this. But rather than being a disgusting horror, it turned out to be a psychological thriller of the highest order. The movie is amazing. It presents a gritty, realistic world like that of a documentary, with no typical Hollywood cliches whatsoever. That way we don't know what to expect. The actors are actors first and stars second, and the two central performances are simply superb. Hopkins is so effective in his role, you could easily believe Hannibal Lector really exists. In fact he is so good, he won the Best Actor Oscar for a supporting role.<br/><br/>Even better is Jodie Foster, who has surely proven herself now to be one of the best actresses ever. The most convincing performance I have ever seen. Director Demme skillfully uses angles to make her look small and isolated in a world of danger and fear. Better than Psycho. Better than Jaws. Undoubtedly one of the best films of all time."

Foster is great as a strong female lead which works with around some strong supporting males and the extremely powerful leading male (Hopkins, in a mythical performance).<br/><br/>Absolutely a film not to miss."

"Vindicti","9","1","1","24 February 1999"," Positive and rather brief
","Silence of the Lambs is one of the best American films I have seen in ages. It settles comfortably into the genre of ""psychological horror"" along with such modern classics as Seven and...The Game I suppose. It is true that the afformentioned genre has not been overly exploited, and in view of a collection of films described as having ""a questionable degree of merit"" that is probably a good thing.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster is excellent as a trainee FBI agent, but her performance is a little overshadowed by that of Sir Anthony Hopkins in the role of Dr Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lector. A lot has been said about Hopkins' portrayal of the cannibalistic serial killer, and as I'm limited for space all that I can say is that after seeing the movie, Lector seems a more believable character than Hopkins himself (that's a compliment by the way).<br/><br/>In short, an extremely effective movie, and one that has for many embodied the cinema of the '90s."

The was covetousness is dealt with, and particularly the manner in which eyes roam over Foster throughout, is wonderfully off-set against that of the serial killer. Enough.

","""Silence of the Lambs"" will never be silenced.  It easily ranks among the best movies of the 90's.  Anthony Hopkins steals the show here, even though he is not the serial killer at large.  He manages to be menacing yet charming at the same time, which is often a quality of our most infamous serial killers.  Jonathan Demme did an excellent job directing this move, and rightfully received an Oscar reward for best director.  He kept everything going at just the right pace and allowed enough time for character study to flavor the film further.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" is loaded with memorable scenes; my favorite one is where Jodie Foster has to feel her way around the dark while the killer (wearing night-vision goggles) just toys with her for a while.  Since ""we covet what we see everyday,"" try not to give in to the temptation of seeing ""Silence of the Lambs"" everyday as there is no telling what might happen then..."

The same thing with Anthony Hopkins. He looked much younger (because he is). I especially enjoyed the scenes with Ted Levine who plays Buffalo Bill, the serial madman that Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to find. I heard on some documentary and on the IMDb trivia page that Buffalo Bill was a combination of three real life killers. Ed Gein, Bundy and some other guy. I also heard that Jodie Foster was creeped out by the making of this film. Which is probably why she chose not to do the sequel, HANNIBAL. The film creates an eerie and chilling mood all by itself. It lets us know that something this sick and twisted has actually happened. All the performances in this film were great. Just about everyone I know has seen this movie. So, I would assume that if you are reading this review, that you have too. So, I'm not going to recommend that you see it. I'm going to recommend that you see it again. If you want a good scare, see this movie again. Maybe if you haven't seen it in a long time, it will creep back into your memory and scare the hell out of you. Hannibal's escape scene was classic.

They plug the stuffing out of this movie on almost every TV show, especially those running around the time of this movie's release. So finally, I rented it from Blockbuster, expecting good things, because it won 5 Oscars, has Jodie Foster(who has since become my favorite actress and dream wife) in it, and it's notoriety. I got more than I asked for. Jodie Foster plays Clarice Starling to the ""tee-est"" of ""T's"". Young, beautiful, determined, brilliant, vulnerable. Hopkins scares and intrigues me simultaneously, amazing how I would never want to be in the same room as Hannibal Lecter, yet would not mind terribly if he sat down next to me on a park bench. Hopkins calculated every movement, every speech, and basically brought Hannibal Lecter to life in which maybe no other fictional character has been brought to life, made a part of human consciousness. In 2010, he will face Keyzer Soze for the title of the most feared movie villain ever. This and ""Fatal Attraction"" have the distinction of being the only two films to ever scare me, frighten me, seriously unsettle me. I own the movie, am soon getting the DVD, and am sorry ""Hannibal"" was not as good as this. Movie deserved every award it won, and the infamy surrounding it is no accident.

","It was one of those films that teenagers would have stayed up late to watch on a Friday night, and the school playground would be buzzing for weeks after! This film achieved that very easily. Other film's that achieved this was Basic Instinct, and Se7en.<br/><br/>From the moment the film is over, you NEED to see it again. Was it a dream? Was it a nightmare? Did what you just see happen, or was it your own imagination? That's how good this film is. It introduced us to Dr Hannibal Lecter, arguably the greatest screen villain ever. Who could forget those claustraphobic scenes between him and Clarice Starling? That frightening noise of his Liver slurping antics? And that eerie ""Good evening Clarice"".<br/><br/>It won all five 'major' Oscars, and deservedly so, even though it was realeased as early as February! <br/><br/>A gripping storyline, and performance's make this a must see film. Just as me and my teenage friends talked about this film many years ago, many of our discussions continue to this day. That's a sign of a good film. Psycho is another! The way the focus is thrown from Starling, played magnificently by Jodie Foster, to Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins (need I say more?!), and Buffalo Bill, a splendid Ted Levine. We are forced to observe their actions, be they honourable, horrible, or homicidal, these are the key factors that make this intense viewing.<br/><br/>Of course another stroke of genius is to have a woman as the hero, heroine. Starling, is a student at the FBI, so we feel for her as she tries to unravel the mystery of Buffalo Bill, and her encounters with Lecter. Never has there been such a strong overwhelming performance from a woman since Ellen Ripley graced our screens. Starling also has a past, all hero's usually do, and this serves as an underlying psychological issue in the film. It's also what interests Lecter. He is very fond of her.<br/><br/>
Director Demme, never lets us and Starling forget that the world she occupies is mostly a 'man's world', and this makes us identify with her whether we're male or female. We WANT her to succeed. (PLOT SPOILER!) In a perverse way, we want Lecter to escape and succeed too, but the way in which he does so is shocking, very shocking. That scene where he discards the officer's face is gruesome, but neccessary to further Lecter's character.<br/><br/>A taughtly directed thriller/horror, this film delivers on all levels. From acting, to set and costume design. Hands up who thinks the dungeon setting for the Starling/Lecter conversations is very atmospheric and oppressing? And credit goes to whoever created that Lecter face mask - ingenious.<br/><br/>If you've been living in a cave for the last 10 years and haven't had a chance to check out this great classic. Don't hesitate in seeing it sometime soon. ""You spook easily?"" I hope so. Perfect 10. Enjoy."

Every scene contributes to one of the best movies of crime drama and would make Mr. Hitchcock stand up and say ""BRAVO, I wish that I made that one."" Anthony Hopkins is Hannibal Lecter and brings out the best performance of his life and Jodie Foster proves her superb talent as an up and coming student who will make the FBI proud. This is one of the strongest movies I've ever seen. Plus the character actors contribute greatly and it is funny to  see them appear in a lot of Mr. Demme's movies.

Jodie Foster couldn't have played Clarice Starling better. Clarice, alone and vulnerable, yet so strong and smart. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter - wow!

I was a bit nervous while watching Silence because everyone made such a big deal about how scary it was. While watching it, I realized Silence is an incredibly action filled movie. It is done so well, the acting is perfect and the way everything turns out is amazing. I have to say that I didn't find it very scary ONLY because I had seen Hannibal before Silence. However, the ending is very, very intense, and I can see why people say it's scary. Also, just the fact what Hannibal Lector and Buffalo Bill do is scary enough.

As such, being a hater of this genre, I only got around to watching this several years after it was made.  Now I wish I had seen it before.  <br/><br/>Unlike the villains who cut and slash in the standard horror films, we understand that the psychos in this film have motivation.  You actually feel empathy for these people, even the man who doesn't have any - Hannibal Lecter.  You feel sorry that this obviously cultured, intelligent and, yes, dedicated man is trapped not in a prison, but by the fact his brain can't stop him from carrying out the worst things he can imagine.  As such, this film sheds as much light on the criminally insane as any twelve films that could be made about Charles Manson or any of his ilk.  Demme actually tries to understand what makes Hannibal the man he is, and in the end we start to understand as well.<br/><br/>Add to this an excellent plot, engaging characters, and ""good guys"" that seem more out of it than the villains and you have a must see movie even for the most squeamish.<br/><br/>That being said, I hope the sequel can live up to the original.

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","1","30 January 2001"," Definitely one of the best thrillers of all time.
","I'm normally not one to spend much time concerning myself with who won what Oscar and who didn't win that Oscar, but if anyone but Anthony Hopkins had been awarded the Best Actor Oscar in 1991 I would have been bitterly disappointed. In my opinion, Hopkins' performance as the deceptively charming Hannibal Lecter is one of the best performances ever caught on film. Especially if you have read the novel by Thomas Harris, Hopkins flawlessly captures all sides of the tremendously complex personality of Hannibal Lecter, providing for one of the main things that made The Silence of the Lambs such a spectacular film. <br/><br/>(possible spoilers ahead) Another person who performed amazingly well was Ted Levine as the horribly disturbed murderer Jame Gumb. Levine presents a startlingly convincing portrayal of the disgustingness of this character, as well as his psychological isolation from the normal world and other people in general, shown with great effectiveness through the way that he talks to his victims (`It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.'). Jame Gumb (whose first name, Jamie, had been misspelled on his birth certificate, but he insisted on leaving it that way) is the man that the FBI is utilizing Lecter's tremendous intelligence to try to capture. Gumb kidnaps full figured women and cuts portions of their skins off, which he sews together in order to make himself a full body human skin suit. <br/><br/>One of the amazing things about this film is that it was able to win a Best Picture Oscar while having such a gory premise, and this obviously has something to do with the tremendous quality of the movie. It was so good because there were so many things going on in the film.  I guess you could say the plot was extremely thick. Clarice Starling, played excellently by Jodie Foster, is an FBI trainee who is assigned the emotionally and psychologically dangerous task of trying to get Lecter to talk to her, because he sees right through all of the questionnaires and surveys given to him by countless other, more experienced, personnel. Beyond that, Starling is also fighting her own personal demons; she's struggling through her training, she has to ward off the amorous advances of at least one of her superiors, and now she is faced with an assignment that dwarfs all of those problems. Then you have the story with Jame Gumb, and on the other side, you have the struggle of dozens of people trying to control Lecter and get him to talk without damaging anyone emotionally or psychologically (evidently he was able to talk the insane inmate in the cell next to his into swallowing his tongue one night). You also have a very detailed subplot about the types of insects that are found on the bodies of Gumb's victims. And, of course, you have Lecter's stunning insights, providing in one very tense scene, the meaning of the title, The Silence of the Lambs. <br/><br/>Clearly, Thomas Harris deserves a lot of credit for his outstanding novel, but so do the filmmakers for their efforts at crafting this first rate thriller. This is not exploitative cinema in any way, and it is extremely unique in both its story as well as its presentation. Some scenes really stood out in their originality, particularly Dr. Lecter's escape, although it is never clearly explained how Lecter, while in restraints, was able to get a hold of Dr. Chilton's ballpoint pen, which he had been eyeing as it lay on the desk and which he eventually used to open his handcuffs. Luckily, the quality of the film as a whole overshadows trivial things like this, making them more than excusable. This is a very graphic film, make no mistake about that, but it is so well done that it can be enjoyed by virtually anyone."

Jonathan Demme directed very well: he knew what to do to feel claustrophobia in the prison-scenes, and to be afraid when we are in the house of the serial-killer. My favorite scene is the last action sequence: Clarice cannot see anything, but the killer sees her: and what comes after, knows everyone.

","Plot-holes abound, in another in an endless stream of silly thrillers, that started in the 80's.  This one actually won an Academy Award for Best Picture, over a cinematic masterpiece like Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"". The plot has been done before, and with much better results, in Michael Mann's taut, chiller, ""Manhunter"".  This film spends a lot of time pretending to be chilling, but it really is a poorly written piece of fluff. It get so preposterous, that it ends up being not unlike those old movies, where the heroine goes toward the danger with a candle.   Jodie Foster's character is so dumb in this film, that she doesn't even HAVE a candle. After an entire film of telling us how smart and with it she is, she does the stupidest things, in the climax of the film.  Foster and Hopkins deserved their Oscars, for basically rising above the inane script.  They give fine performances.  Otherwise, this is an overrated turkey.  I never have and never will get what all the fuss was about.  See ""Manhunter"", instead."

"kpat","10","1","1","26 October 1998"," Jodie Foster is sent to the depths of psychological terror as she interrogates imprisoned serial killer Anthony Hopkins in the hopes that he might lead her to serial killer at large, Buffalo Bill.
","Silence of the Lambs is a well constructed suspense/thriller taking us to depths of the human psyche that are repugnant to the Christian soul.  And while we turn our heads and hide our eyes at grisly demise and naked evil, at the same time we are intrigued by the motivations and actions contained therein.  Jodie Foster plays the role of Clarice Starling with a hardened vulnerability which surfaces in her encounters with Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).  The first time I watched the movie, I was engrossed in all aspects of it- the disappearance of the senator's daughter, the mystery of Buffalo Bill, and the terrifying aspect of Hannibal Lecter.  But in successive viewings, the part that stands out the most is the interaction of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.  It is this interaction that allows this movie to transcend the genre of suspense/ thriller and defines a class unto itself.  Lecter uses his finely tuned manipulative instincts to peel away the layers of Starling revealing the closely guarded motivation for her entire life's work.  He delves beneath her mask of coolness and self sufficiency revealing her inner vulnerability.  And somehow, while revealing the most intimate secrets about herself, she still manages to deceive Lecter and gain the upper hand- if only for awhile.<br/><br/>While this interaction is the core of the movie, there is a plot, and it is a very good one.  For what I have outlined thus far could easily be a romance, but the twist is Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer with a very loose sense of morality and Jodie Foster is an FBI agent whose moral code is strict and uncompromising.  And while Lecter is peeling layers from Clarice Starling's walls, he is chilling us with his icy demeanor- describing how he loves to eat human liver and fava beans- and leading Starling on a merry hunt for clues to the name of the elusive Buffalo Bill; who has captured another victim with time ticking away.  In summary, the greatness of Silence of the Lambs lies in its ability to bring the demons of its heroine's past and intertwine them around a complex suspense/mystery, and keep the audience interested the entire time."

Demme's direction was almost flawless and kept the viewer feeling disturbed throughout the film with his use of uncomfortable situations (ie- someone following you in the dark, being stuck in a well, being locked in a room with no way out).

","Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence Of the Lambs"" is a grisly spook show, and one without any sympathy for its victims (or for the audience, who get a good hammering on the head). Yes, the Oscar-winning performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have become legendary (and for good reason, they are both intensely focused and driven), but the picture leaves scummy feelings in its wake, as if Demme had suddenly turned carnival barker for the ultimate freak show. FBI trainee Foster, invited into the gruesome investigation of a serial killer, seems to climb the ranks awfully easily, being allowed to do potentially dangerous work on her own as well as going mano a mano with Hopkins' Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned cannibal who may hold the key to the crimes. There's chilly art in Demme's presentation--it's a polished piece of work--but I soon tired of the Woman as Hero underlying theme, complete with a who's-in-the-dungeon finale that doesn't work at all, the sacrificing of real human drama for shock value and lots of outlandish violence (such as a mutilated security guard hanging from the top of a prison cell like an angel). The black-humored kicker is that all this perverseness is good for a raunchy thrill, and what better way to arouse a stultified audience than to give us two psychopaths--one who eats his victims, the other who carves up women. **1/2 from ****"
"Hey_Sweden","9","6","15","27 December 2012"," A dynamite Hollywood thriller.
","This is deservedly one of the most popular and praised of all the entries in the worn-out ""cop vs. killer"" genre, and represents a career high point for its key participants. It's especially noteworthy that it should have swept the five major Oscars for the year of its release, considering that the Academy wouldn't normally award such acclaim to a thriller with often grim and disturbing content - a tribute to how well crafted it is. Also worthy of a mention is the way that this film put the Behavioural Sciences unit of the FBI on the map - that unit devoted to the study of the most deviant ""human"" beings among us. Director Jonathan Demme shows a great skill for the genre, and with the assistance of a first rate crew creates some eerily effective suspense. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, it stars Jodie Foster as an eager beaver young FBI trainee who is sent by her superior (Scott Glenn) to interview an imprisoned murderer, the intelligent, cultured psychopath Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), in the hopes that he can lend his insight into the activities of ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine), a serial killer currently on the loose. Other than a music score by Howard Shore that is a little *too* over the top and manipulative, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" hits all the right notes, telling a story in a taut and convincing manner. The subject matter admittedly is not to every taste - especially when one thinks about what Bills' ultimate plan is. The editing (by Craig McKay), production design (by Kristi Zea), and cinematography (by Tak Fujimoto) are exemplary; among the scariest scenes are Clarices' (Foster) search of a storage space, and the climactic action where agent and maniac are finally face to face (and the sequence leading up to that). Of course, the real meat of the story is the unusual relationship between the charismatic Lecter and the determined Clarice, as he demands she divulge personal information in return for his thoughts on the Buffalo Bill case. Lecter is a truly memorable character, from his choice of entertainment to the way that he gleefully toys with those people that he holds in contempt. Hopkins and Foster are both very effective in these parts, although the contributions of the supporting cast absolutely should not go overlooked. Given the way that Lecter dominates the proceedings, it's important to point out just how extremely creepy Bill is; his performance brought character actor Levine to real prominence. Brooke Smith is very good portraying a would-be victim who actually tries to use her wits and fight back in some way. Also appearing are many other familiar faces: Anthony Heald (as the smarmy jerk in charge of the insane asylum), Diane Baker, Kasi Lemmons, Demme regulars Charles Napier and Tracey Walter, his old mentor Roger Corman (as the director of the FBI), Frankie Faison, Dan Butler, Chris Isaak, and Daniel von Bargen. Even at just under two hours long, this is actually pretty taut in terms of pacing; there's no filler at all, just some very potent entertainment. This was preceded by another Harris adaptation, ""Manhunter"", in which Brian Cox played Lecter, and would be followed by ""Hannibal"" and, after that, ""Red Dragon"", another film version of the source novel for ""Manhunter"". Some people tend to prefer ""Manhunter"" and consider it superior; this viewer merely prefers to think that they each have their own heavy assets. Nine out of 10."

","Silence of the Lambs is a horror/thriller film most notable for its character of Hannibal Lector a cannibalistic psychopath played by Anthony Hopkins. Jodie Foster is one of my favorite actresses and she seems a little too vulnerable here to be an FBI agent. Anthony Hopkins, surely one of the world's greatest actors, is suitably creepy as psychopathic Dr. Lector, however, I prefer his performance in Magic; his role is much larger in that movie and he does more acting. Jonathan Demme, also one of my favorite directors, does a good job but, once again, I prefer his Married to the Mob (1988) or Harold and Melvin (1980) over this film. Howard Shore's musical score is terrific. As far as violence goes, Silence of the Lambs might have been shocking when it was release but, by today's standards, it is tame. There are no lingering closeups of violence. The CSI TV series shows much more graphic images. I see why this film won Academy Awards, mainly because the competition was not that stiff. Although it's a good film, it does not deserve the high status that is has been accorded. But it is still well worth seeing because of the tension it manages to build and for the terrific performances of Hopkins and Foster."

","I saw this movie when new, and liked it plenty.  That was years ago, and I've grown considerably.  My interest in Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"", and the screenplay I'm working on based on it, prodded me into renting SOTL for repeat viewing. I've always held the Oscars in low regard, but have dropped that regard all together after viewing this nonsense.  The 1,000 word maximum on these posts prevents me from mentioning all the folly I found in the film.  But I'll try....<br/><br/>Acting:  In most instances, overwrought.  Hopkins was a good psycho, but a bad Lecter.  The Lecter of the novels was far more sedate in his demeanor, prefering to ""charm"" his opposition, allowing himself access to their psyche.  Sniffing the air for skin cream is highly dubious.  Foster did a good job as a young recruit.  The problem I have with her is has more to do with the story.  Seems a bit too unrealistic.  Will Graham convinced me.  Clarice Starling didn't.  Dr. Chilton was played as a complete idiot.  Typical Hollywood bad good-guy.  Made the viewer biased for Lecter.  WRITER SHORTCUT!  I recognize this as a substitute for compelling writing and acting.  Simply bias the audience toward the main character by surrounding him with easy-to-dis-like characters.  No childish brat like the Chilton portrayed would ever hold a job of such responsibility.   Ted Levine was terrific throughout.  Voice, appearance, contortions, crotch, :  all wonderful.  Most of the supporting players were of TV movie quality. Canned dialog, playing dumb for an assumed dumb audience.  Posh on that, Director. As for direction, too many flubs and gimmicks to mention here.  I'll mention one:  The cat in the window growling as Buffalo Bill drives away with Fat Girl # Whatever. Like any cat is going to react in that fashion.  A cat would not bat a whisker if in the presence of such drama.  Would only move if the master was going to land on it.  Otherwise, no fur ruffled.  What a gimmick that was.<br/><br/>The music was typical of Hollywood reality.  Never in my life, when confronted with drama of any intensity, have I heard violins out of nowhere. DIRECTOR SHORTCUT!:  Adding sappy ""music"" to enhance mood.  In most cases, this is to bolster or cover any weaknesses in writing, acting, direction, or all three.  (NOTE: This is certainly not exclusive to this film.  Most Hollywood productions employ this tactic.) The ending of the film was almost good about this.  No music, just Foster in the dark.  ***NO SPOILER***  But the ending could've been better.  Easily.<br/><br/>MANHUNTER should have won 15 Oscars, if SOTL could win 5. Sure, it was a bit too 80's in appearance, but far more accurate and convincing.  Better book, too.<br/><br/>In summation, too dumbed down.  Booooooo."

","I've always wanted to see Silence of the Lambs and finally got to today. I thought that Hannibal Lector sounded like a really cool character and of course I anticipated excellent film-making with the sort of praise it has received.<br/><br/>I saw it, and I would say that as far as movies like this go, it is excellent. But for cinema in general, Silence is unremarkable and, really, given the hype and awards, ultimately disappointing. <br/><br/>Jodie Foster was good, but she is haunted by the slaughter of a lamb from her childhood? Ridiculous. Anthony Hopkins was great. I think he deserved his award, though his performance is overrated. Not exactly a very complex or hard to portray character...<br/><br/>The story was not particularly exciting. It was fairly clumsy and failed to capture my attention. I was repelled by Buffalo Bill but not interested in his character whatsoever. I watched the movie for the rare encounters with Hannibal Lector, and the search for Buffalo Bill was an uninteresting but necessary backdrop. Also, how on Earth would the FBI bring a SWAT team to a house that is a false tip, that is hundreds of miles away from the killings...? It makes no sense - they completely ignored the evidence and conclusions they had already made. And so, when the so-called thrilling doorbell scene took place, I was not surprised. Of course he's not in Chicago. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>I can honestly say I enjoyed Lector's escape. It was clever and suspenseful (if a bit illogical) and to some degree makes the movie.<br/><br/>And is this movie scary, as has been said? No. Definitely not. The serial killer is creepy, not terrifying. Hannibal is intriguing, but not too scary. I've heard of people not sleeping for days, others having horrific nightmares... I don't understand it.<br/><br/>This movie is worth watching if you like thrillers/serial killer/ kind of movies, but if you go into this film expecting a great piece of cinema, some groundbreaking technique or idea, or a thrilling scene or two as I did, you will be disappointed. A good movie, yes. 23rd on IMDb Top 250? Absolutely not. An 8.7 on IMDb? No."

","Saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was pretty great. Suspenseful, well-acted, different....and critics were heavy-handed with praise; which probably heavily influenced my opinion. Recently re-watched it, and had a more critical opinion. 1) What was the deep inner turmoil that Starling was suppressing all those years? That she saw a lamb get slaughtered on a farm as a young girl? So what??? 2) Did she REALLY surmise ANYTHING from the ""clues"" he gave. Seems she somewhat randomly stumbles onto his house. 3) Too many closeups; too many plot contrivances. Nearly every scene is a closeup shot. Adds intensity at first, but quickly becomes annoying. That Lechter could uncuff himself from behind with the tip of a pen and overtake the two Keystone cops, not very believable. Less believable that he was ever placed is some makeshift iron box in the middle of a library or gymnasium. 4) She chases him down into his night vision dungeon? C'mon!! OK I get it for the movie's sake...but way too unrealistic. And with all the FBI's resources and knowledge they're somewhere else storming the empty house of a false lead? C'mon."

","For me, this movie was a pretty blah experience. That it managed to grab the top five Academy Awards is a mystery to me; 1991 must have been a truly dismal year for the movies if the Academy chose to honour this rather average offering. I've been really anxious to see the film after I've heard so many good things about it, and as I sat through the first rather unremarkable half-an-hour, I kept saying to myself: ""Ok, it should get brilliant any time soon now... shouldn't it??"" But it didn't. It wasn't involving, it wasn't chilling or scary or compelling in any way. I usually adore Jodie Foster, but here she gave an unremarkable performance and I didn't care for her character one bit. Anthony Hopkins almost saved the movie for me with his truly brilliant turn as Dr Lecter, but I felt that it was a supporting role at best. Overall, Se7en is a way better movie than this so-called ""masterpiece""."

"Cinema_freak","7","4","9","26 December 2017"," A good piece of cinema, but seemingly overrated beyond oblivion.
","I find ""Silence of the Lambs"" to be one of those movies that is hailed by one and all, and yet is underwhelming once watched - definitely good, but still underwhelming. You wonder what the hullabaloo was all about.<br/><br/>The settings were cartoonishly murky and dungeon-like, to the point that Lecter's asylum (and at points even Clarice's FBI training centre) looked like Hell itself. I also personally disliked the ""screaming lambs"" scene; it felt unnecessary and dragged, and Jodie Foster's emotional reactions to Hannibal's questions felt absolutely out of place. As if he miraculously healed her of her long nightmare-sufferings in an Osho-esque way.
Overall, the camera work, sound and direction are all great. I especially loved those first-person shots with Hopkins and Clarice. Very claustrophobia-inducing.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting, Anthony Hopkins, though mightily entertaining - very often chuckle-inducing with his sly sarcasm - came across as far from real. His performance was in no way what a true psychopath (especially one so well educated) would be like. I honestly did not find the man scary, though I did find his screen-presence charismatic and imposing.
Jodie Foster was excellent , her vulnerability, her subtle pretence in font of Hannibal, everything.
Ted Levine was marvellous - that strange voice, his quirky dialogue and body language - it all added up perfectly. A great example would be the scene where he gives a slight chuckle, and then runs behind a corner, when confronted at his house. Hard to believe this was the same man who played Pacino's subordinate cop in ""Heat"".
Scott Glenn underplays his role so well, that he seems disarmingly real - cool and calm. It's no surprise that Clarice wanted to work for this guy.<br/><br/>Conclusion: SOTL is by all means a very a good film, but to be called one of the greatest movies of all time? I don't think so.
It's predecessor ""Manhunter"" (1986) is by all means the superior Hannibal film, and in my humble opinion, much, much more significant a film (and by significant, I mean more worthy of being preserved in archives for times ahead, than ""Silence of the Lambs"") . Sadly, ""Manhunter"", although a cult classic now, has always been criminally under-appreciated and misunderstood (strong emphasis on ""misunderstood"") and has since remained under the shadow of this one."

","""Something Wild"" director Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" proved to be a memorable milestone of a movie in both the careers of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. This serial killer thriller concerns the efforts of an FBI agent in training who proves instrumental in cracking a case that nobody could have solved without her help. The daughter of a small-time cop, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster of ""Taxi Driver"") is minding her own business at Quantico, Virginia, negotiating an obstacle course when the FBI Chief of Behavioral Sciences, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn of ""Sucker Punch"") summons her for an interview. Crawford wants Clarice to visit convicted murderer Dr. Hannibal Lector where he has been imprisoned for eight years. In fact, Lector hasn't laid eyes on a woman for eight years. The warden in charge of Lector's incarnation is a conceited egotist, Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald of ""Red Dragon""), who makes a pass at her and fails. Before he allows Clarice to speak with Hannibal, Chilton shows her a photo of what happened to a nurse that Lector gnawed on. The nurse is permanently disfigured as a result of Lector's attack. Lector is now kept in a cell with a reinforced glass window and stone walls. Dr. Chilton is prepared to escort Clarice into Lector's presence, but she convinces him that Lector may clam up at the sight of Chilton. Rudely, Chilton dismisses himself and turns Clarice over to Barney. Barney (Frankie Faison of ""Hannibal"") provides Clarice with a chair and she and Lector talk briefly. Lector isn't the only unsavory soul in the prison. In what amounts to an infamous death row of sorts, other perverts are housed in the same area. One of them, Miggs, make a derogatory comment to Clarice about her body odor, and Lector later kills Miggs. Meantime, Clarice entices Lector to talk about Buffalo Bill. Bill is a serial killer who has slain five women. These women are a little bigger than the average. In Memphis, we watch as the killer, Jame Gumb (Ted Levine of ""Heat"") abducts a girl when he is struggling to load a sofa into his van. Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) backs into the rear of the van and Gumb traps her and takes her to his house. In the basement of his residence, Gumb has a pit where he holds Catherine. Meantime, Lector provides Catherine's mother with information and he is moved to another facility. During his sojourn at the new facility, Lector fakes off the guards, kills them, and manages to escape. Lector's escape is pretty incredible. By this time, Clarice believes that she has found a clue. Crawford warns her that they have found the killer. Clarice continues with her part of the investigation and stumbles onto Gumb living in the residence where she thought she would find somebody else. Clarice narrowly survives a suspenseful moment when Gumb extinguishes the lights and uses night-vision goggles to overpower her. Clarice cannot see but she can hear and she shoots at the sound of a revolver being cocked. She empties her gun into Gumb and he dies. In other words, he doesn't jump up a few moments later. ""Silence of the Lambs"" concludes with Clarice graduating from the FBI Academy. Well-made, well-acted, ""Silence"" is top-notch material."

","It's hard to believe this film is twenty years old, having seen it when it first came out and not again till now. The movie lived up to it's opening hype as a masterful thriller bordering on horror. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of serial killer Hannibal Lecter defines the story, but when all is said and done, his character doesn't appear in the picture very much at all. However when he does, one's attention is riveted to the screen, attempting to outguess director Jonathan Demme's next move in a deadly cat and mouse game between Lecter and his adversary, be it FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), or hapless security guards caught unaware by a scheming mad man.<br/><br/>The larger plot involves the chase after a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, named after a penchant for skinning his female victims after he murders them. To say that the picture has it's grisly moments would be an understatement. There are more than one scene that require caution for the faint hearted, visualizing grim aspects of brutality that don't leave much to the imagination. Buffalo Bill himself (Ted Levine) is an inspired piece of work, a monster that could have stood alone as a title character if not part of this larger story.<br/><br/>Without giving it away entirely, I have to say that the hunt for Buffalo Bill gives rise to a clever gimmick that will catch you off guard for a moment, only to redirect itself very quickly to it's suspenseful conclusion. This one's recommended for fans of psychological thrillers who'll try to guess the ending only to be set up for one more neat twist at the finale. Anyone for a glass of Chianti?"

To aid the investigation she is requested to interview an already incarcerated psychopath, the infamous Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Cunning and very intelligent, Lecter takes a shine to Starling but will only assist her if she is prepared to let him into her personal make up. As Buffalo Bill kidnaps the daughter of an American senator the clock starts to tick down<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is directed by Jonathan Demme and stars Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. It is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. It won the top five Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay. With a production budget of $19 million the film went on to record a staggering Worldwide profit of almost $254 million. Those awards and those figures don't lie, The Silence Of The Lambs is one of the rare occasions where everything came together perfectly.<br/><br/>The source novel is in truth brilliant anyway, but how many times have we seen film makers make a hash of good material by either cutting corners, or by trying to be too Hollywood in the telling? Too many is the answer. Jonathan Demme and his team know that not much needs tampering here, their task was to understand Thomas Harris' complex characters and give them narrative strength, which they got courtesy of Ted Tally's brilliant writing. The portrayals of said characters have gone down in history to an extent they barely need me to have an opinion. From the first meeting of Starling and Lecter down in the bowels of the asylum, to the cheeky and unnerving closure, Foster & Hopkins engage and chill respectively, one of the weirdest, yet most tender relationships to have hit the silver screen. Scott Glenn is professional personified as Jack Crawford, while in the wake of Hopkins' classy monster show it gets forgotten just how brilliantly twisted Ted Levine makes Buffalo Bill. Two quality monsters for the price of one movie here, a bargain if ever there was one.<br/><br/>For all the plaudits for cast, direction and writing et al, ""Lambs"" climbed to the top echelons of 90s cinema because it also exists as an excellent thriller, even a pant filling horror at times. While it also works very well as a criminal procedure movie. We know who the killer is quite early on in proceedings, but with Lecter tossing out conundrums and the FBI utilising all their tricksy scientific methods, it makes for a fascinating watch. And lest we forget that Demme shows himself to not only be a purveyor of adroit pacing, but quite a dab hand at thrilling set-pieces too-one that would be a spoiler should I mention it, and the other coming during a wonderful double handed twister as the net hopefully closes in on Billy Boy.

When you usually hear about the performances in this movie you always hear about Anthony Hopkins and Ted Levine. Due to this when it comes to the movie you would think both of these actors blow the young Foster out of the water but this isn't quite how it turned out. Yes, she was slightly overshadowed by the their performances but not enough to the point where Jodie's performance wasn't noticeable. Also the other twos performances were some of the best performances known to date. While Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal, The Cannibal, Lecture stole the show from Ted Levine, again it wasn't by much. Both had their moments of making you feel uneasy and even physically cringe in places. Although only small, the only issue I have with this movie is that all other characters were out shined. This is down to their performances just not being good enough to stand up to the three main characters' as named above.

Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's attempts at ""dissecting"" him and rebuffs her. As she is leaving, one of the prisoners flicks semen at her. Lecter, who considers this act ""unspeakably ugly"", calls Starling back and tells her to seek out an old patient of his. This leads her to a storage shed where she discovers a man's severed head with a sphinx moth lodged in its throat. She returns to Lecter, who tells her that the man is linked to Buffalo Bill. He offers to profile Buffalo Bill on the condition that he be transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests.<br/><br/>It won Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay. It is also the first (and so far only) Best Picture winner widely considered to be a horror film, and only the third such film to be nominated in the category, after The Exorcist in 1973 and Jaws in 1975."

","Silence of the Lambs is a psychological thriller that positions its most dangerous (and interesting) character in a prison cell for much of the screen time, so his character can be shown through intuitions, subtext, hindsight narrative and general creepiness.<br/><br/>That character is Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal Lecter"", a cultured psychiatrist imprisoned among psychiatric criminal scum who longs for decent human contact or escape, except he himself has a history of killing people and eating the mutilated parts.<br/><br/>All of this is described off-screen, and the film doesn't indulge in unpleasant gore or cheap shock effects - the films main secondary character is Buffalo Bill, a man who applied for gender reassignment, but Lecter explains he was repeatedly denied on basis of his psychological profile. Due to repeated abusive childhood trauma, has become an anonymous, dysfunctional recluse who randomly assaults and kills women. Lecter suggests that his victimhood narrative contributes to his inhumane treatment of others, he drops other details and secrets about the killer but isn't fully cooperative about providing a complete psychological profile of the killer due to the indignity of his life in prison.<br/><br/>Clarise Starling is an FBI rookie, chosen for her attractiveness, to get information from Hannibal Lecter on his former patient and contact Buffalo Bill. The reverse-symbolism of having Dr Lecter behind bars whilst Starling is just beyond them is a brilliant bit of staging, as much of the film's subtext is about the gender coding of behaviour, identity and social roles. <br/><br/>Its also genuinely scary, but mostly on the level of dialogue and performance, Silence of the Lambs is rightly considered one of the best films of all time in the drama/thriller/psychological horror category, also the police procedural scenes are taut and realistic, or as realistic as you could expect. A second underlying theme of the piece is that the state ultimately protects its own interests, but is unable in the last instance to truly protect the public from crime.<br/><br/>There is a 'happy ending' of sorts in the picture, in that Starling, a lone female FBI agent in a predominantly male service, overcomes a male aggressor mentally and physically. An empowering ending that's more of a relief than an actual closure.<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs is brilliant, but also the hubbub surrounding the films release and its subsequent awards greenlit some terrible sequels where this movie's lead, director and screenwriter didn't even contribute. Some audience members aren't aware but this film bares similarities to the previous Thomas Harris adaptation ""Manhunter"", released as a film in 1986. Later films in the ""series"" are a pointless cash-in on the famous character Anthony Hopkins embodies in this film."

","The Silence of the Lambs (1991): Dir: Jonathan Demme / Cast: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Diane Baker: Psychological thriller where the film's core regards interrogation of evil without physical contact. Female victims are found skinned by Buffalo Bill and Hannibal Lector is believed to be able to identify him but every agent who has approached his realm of confinement has been led astray. The Senator's daughter is kidnapped so a female F.B.I. trainee is issued in hopes that Lector will give in to a female. We learn about her through Lector's ability to trespass the mind. Shocking thriller directed by Jonathan Demme who also made Melvin and Howard. Anthony Hopkins brilliantly demonstrates Lector's sly methods of penetrating the mind. He delights in toying with victims, which is why his brutal escape occurred. Jodie Foster is excellent as the young trainee haunted by her father's death. She is intelligent and brave particularly when dealing with Bill in the shocking climax. Ted Levine is monstrous as Buffalo Bill whose one breaking point arrives when the Senator's daughter gets hold of his dog. Scott Glenn is standard as the agent in charge of the case but instrumental at a wrong address. Diane Baker plays a Senator whose daughter is kidnapped by Buffalo Bill. Penetrating thriller will shock your nerves and silence your senses. Score: 9 ½ / 10"

","I think its so hard for a such stars like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie to produce Crime,Thriller movie at this time..<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs is a heart-racing thriller that has arguably one of the most interesting characters in cinema history, Hannibal Lector, a famous psychologist who also has Antisocial Personality Disorder. Hannibal Lector is played by Anthony Hopkins and at the beginning of the movie, he is approached by a young, rising FBI agent, named Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster. Clarice has come to interview Hannibal, because she is currently on the hunt for a serial killer, nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kidnaps young women and skins them in order to make a ""suit"" made out of human skin. Since he is both a psychiatrist and a ruthless killer himself, Hannibal is the perfect person to ask for help to catch Buffalo Bill, and the rest of the movie is devoted to Hannibal's relationship with Clarice as he helps her catch Buffalo Bill and as he toys with her psychologically.<br/><br/>Hannibal Lector only appears on screen for 16 minutes and yet, he has such a commanding presence over the entire movie. Before the viewer even meets Hannibal, we hear that he is manipulative, dangerous, a monster, and a cannibal, and yet, when the viewer finally has the opportunity of meeting him, he appears genuine and even caring. However, it soon become evident that this charming persona is only a disguise used to get what he wants, whether that is his freedom or traumatic memories from Clarice's childhood. He has no trouble tricking people into trusting him, and seems to enjoy that he is able to cleverly manipulate people to get what he wants from them. On top of that, he is rude and makes very offensive remarks towards others without any regard to how offensive his comments are. Again, he seems to enjoy being able to offend people so much with the words. Finally, perhaps the most telling of all is his murderous nature. Hannibal enjoys eating people (cleverly nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal), and had been arrested for serving his dinner guests the liver from a man who he had killed. In one scene, he is seen brutally attacking two guards, biting off one person's cheek and then savagely beating the other to death, and then after the killing of both guards, he begins to sway peacefully to the classical music that had been playing in the background. It was the exact same persona as he saw him standing in his cell when we first meet him, cool, calm, and collected, thus indicating his complete lack of guilt for the serious crime that he had just committed.<br/><br/>As I said above, the movie does an excellent job of creating Hannibal Lector, and his behaviors are consistent and similar to the behaviors of people who have Antisocial Personality Disorder. Like most other people with this psychological disorder, Hannibal shows no remorse for hurting others, especially the people who gets in his way, and he is certainly fine with committing murder. He manipulates people to get what he wants and amuses himself by offending and toying around with others, displaying a common symptom of people with Antisocial Personality Disorder, a disregard for other people's rights.<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs would have been an excellent movie if it only had Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lector, but it also has a great performance from Jodie Foster and an unbelievably well shot movie. It is definitely worth watching, and it does a good job with showing how creepy and scary a person with Antisocial Personality Disorder can be."

","""I dwelt alone in a world of moan, my soul a stagnant tide."" – Edgar Allan Poe <br/><br/>Would ""The Silence of the Lambs"" work as well as it does if actress Jodie Foster weren't an in-the-closet lesbian? Consider this: the entire film is about being uncomfortable in one's skin. Buffalo Bill, the serial killer at the heart of the picture, has sexual identity issues and hopes to build himself a woman's body. Scorned by the world, Bill kills his victims and strips them of their skin, his aim being to knit himself a ""body suit"" so that he may ""blossom"" and ""become a more beautiful person"".<br/><br/>Likewise, Foster's character, a young FBI agent tasked with finding Buffalo Bill, is constantly placed in positions in which she is chided, belittled and insulted. Taunted for her cheap perfume, her ""white trash"" roots, her lowly status, she's constantly being intimidated by men (inmates, police, prison wardens etc), sees her commander as a sexual threat, and seems to have entered the FBI in order to redeem her father, a modest cop shot on duty.<br/><br/>Foster's performance throughout the film (at the time, she was known for a slew of androgynous roles) is itself incredibly fragile, masking insecurity and uncertainty behind a facade of toughness. Because her character is so delicate, we the audience become almost protective of her. We watch as she fights her way through a variety of ominous situations and breath a sigh of relief when she eventually emerges victorious, blossoming into the beautiful flower (a promotion to FBI Special Agent) that the deranged Buffalo Bill is denied. Foster may not end the film feeling entirely comfortable in her own skin, but she's proved to herself that she can survive within her body. She can be herself - somewhat - and win.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Demme's follow up film was ""Philadelphia"", a film which revolved around a gay character, so it's possible that ""Silence's"" homosexual subtext - if any - was deliberately nudged by him. Regardless, Demme's direction is remarkable throughout the picture. Watch how he milks every scene, every sequence hyped or taken to incredibly dramatic lengths. Foster's visit to Hannibal Lecter (a cannibal who lives in a maximum security prison), for example, takes us down endless flights of stairs, each level heralded by ominous dialogue, a prison warden even pausing to show Foster a photograph of Lecter's mutilated victims. But importantly, while characters in the film flinch in horror at the image on this photograph, the photograph itself is never actually revealed to Demme's audience. This happens throughout the film: horrors are talked about, emphasised, hyped, our appetite whetted at every turn, but never actually revealed. Here is a film which respects our imagination and treats the macabre with a certain amount of apprehension. Even the film's ending, in which an escaped Hannibal Lectre walks confidently off into the horizon, is the kind of dramatic tease-climax more common in super hero movies. Whilst most horror movies are a series of carefully set up orgasms, ""Silence"" is all anticipation.<br/><br/>With the publication of ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"", horror maestro Edgar Allen Poe became the father of detective fiction. But what's interesting is that with this book we see that crime fiction was born within the horror genre. More specifically, from the very start, the criminal has been (wrongly) treated as a vaguely supernatural being; an incomprehensible, alien and irrational monster.<br/><br/>""Lambs"" raked in zillions of dollars, and so kicked off a chain of copycat movies. Post ""Lambs"" we thus had such films as ""Kiss The Girls"", ""Along Came A Spider"", ""Taking Lives"", ""The X Files"", ""Seven"", ""Zodiac"", ""The Cell"", ""The Bone Collector"" etc etc, all of which copied ""Lamb's"" formula, all of which hoped to cash in on its success. The film also spewed the ""wrong house cliché"", the ""he's in the elevator cliché"" and numerous others, before the series, with ""Hannibal"" and ""Red Dragon"", degenerated into a silly franchise (the same fate befell ""Jaws"", ""Halloween"", ""Psycho"", ""Alien"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Elm Street"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Exorcist""). In a way, the fact that these franchises and sequels were even possible, highlights the faintly ""supernatural"" roots of such monsters. The vengeful sharks, serial-killers, aliens, demons and slashers come back to haunt their audiences, not because they can never be killed, but because they aren't remotely ""realistic"" in the first place (and, of course, because profits necessitate their reappearance).<br/><br/>8.5/10 - Worth multiple viewings. See ""The Pledge"" and ""Memories of Murder""."

","I should probably mention right up front that I am not a huge fan of thrillers and, in particular, I don't care for violent or gory films. Because of this, I have waited a very long time to finally getting around to seeing this film. The idea of a film about serial killers just doesn't appeal to me. However, there is also an obsessive part of me--the part of me that wants to see all the Best Picture Oscar winners. Apart from this film, there are maybe two others I need to complete this...until next year! And, my daughter assured me that the movie wasn't too gory. So, this film review is best appreciated by others who just aren't into gore, serial killings and cannibalism--though, oddly, a very high percentage of viewers DO like such plots.<br/><br/>First, the bad news. I sure as heck thought it was a gory film...a very gory film. You see people with huge chunks of skin ripped off, a guy's face ripped off and lots of blood. I don't know how my daughter would think this isn't gory! Second, the not so bad news. Although I really didn't like the film very much, it was interesting and different. Anthony Hopkins did a nice job playing a psycho murder--though I also felt this performance was anything but subtle--but it was entertaining. So did the film change my mind about the genre or this film in particular? No. But, apparently I am in the minority here.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I recently began watching the TV show, ""Hannibal"", and although I also think it's way too graphic, I much prefer Mads Mikkelson's version of Dr. Lecter. It's much, much more subtle and creepy--without the over the top theatrics of the movie version of the guy."
"cdhuff9","3","6","16","13 September 2001"," Basically garbage
","Well, I had only seen this film once, back in high school, and was quite drunk the first time, so I didn't remember it very well.....so, I thought I'd check it out with its new ""special edition"" release and see what all the hoopla is about.  I mean, it was named Best Picture, it has two excellent lead actors (Foster and Hopkins), and it's gotten nothing but praise and good ratings on the IMDb site, so why not take a look?<br/><br/>Here's why:  it was very poorly shot.  The script was a pretty good idea, but very, very predictable and formulaic.  Foster's performance was overstated, and, while the Hopkins role was very well-done, every single other character in the film was VERY poorly played.  The dialogue was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Half of the movie was shot without any actual ""acting"" going on; people were just talking to the camera in close-up, and their editing was supposed to make us feel like these people were actually having an exchange of some kind (does anyone think that Foster and Hopkins were ever on the set together, simultaneously, at any point?).<br/><br/>The actual villain of the film, ""Buffalo Bill,"" is given no background at all except for a few very unrealistic newspaper clippings, from which we are expected to gather something.  This is the equivalent of countless crappy Lifetime movies establishing past relationships between people by panning past photographs of people standing together, while piano plays in the background.  This guy isn't frightening, menacing, or even suspenseful in the slightest.<br/><br/>The largest amount of actual entertainment in the film consists of how all the cops act.  If the rest of the movie weren't so poorly made, I'd like to think that the director was making them so comical and silly on purpose; maybe trying to make a point of some kind.  But, judging from the rest of the film, Demme probably thought he was portraying these people accurately.<br/><br/>""Silence of the Lambs"" isn't one of the worst movies ever made, but it is certainly much farther from being one of the best.  All the little details thrown in, the ones that actually let us see just what the director is actually doing with the film, are stupid (like the cat waiting in the window when the girl gets kidnapped----it growls as the van drives off.......ridiculous).  What little action there is in the film is purely by-the-book, industry-standard, average garbage (save for the scene where Hopkins grabs the guard and sucks his face---that was far below average).<br/><br/>If you've never seen this movie, but you've seen some other detective/killer/suspense film sometime in the past 20 years, don't bother. It's certainly not up to the level it's touted at.  If you saw the movie once, while in junior high or high school, and you think maybe your film tastes have matured since then, watch it again.  I think you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>I just can't imagine what the people (those that consider themselves to be knowledgeable film critics) were thinking in 1991.  Best Picture.  Doesn't speak well for the other movies released that year.  I wonder........."

I think it would have been better if he hadn't been in that prison for all that time and had got out and been killing people at the start. And also if they ditched the other killer because he distracts attention and looks weird..<br/><br/>The film is all about two serial killers being chased by a woman FBI woman and how she brings them to justice, but that idea falls apart under its own brevity because one of the killers is caught!

","The Silence of the Lambs is only the third movie to win all 5 major Oscars (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is another): Best Picture, Director, Actor (and Anthony Hopkins has some of the least screen time for a best actor winner), Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is the only horror film to ever win Best Picture, and it made all sorts of money-- staying on top of the box office for like 5 weeks and already having made back its budget in the first. So the data coming in would say that I would probably write a review on how good Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster were, and how this is such a landmark horror film that would rival The Shining as being the best ever. But I'm not going to. I believe this movie has been highly overrated, and if you allow me to explain, perhaps you'll end agreeing with me too.<br/><br/> When you think about this movie, the first thing you think of is either fava beans or Hannibal the Cannibal. But the star is Jodie Foster... What's her character's name again? Clarence, Karen, Carly? You know what, doesn't really matter. We'll save Jodie Foster for later because Anthony Hopkins is really what this movie is known for. And there's a lot of good to indeed say. His looking right at the camera as his character is introduced, his improv mocking of Foster's accent, his unblinking eyes and famous lines. Oscar Winner? Sure. It's all there. My criticism will be discussed later when we talk about the director. What I will say, however, is that Ted Levine is vitally underappreciated as Buffalo Bill. First, I'm glad to see Teddy in a role that isn't a sheriff or cop. Buffalo Bill's luring of women and skinning his victims already made him a viable villain, but it's his dancing in front of the mirror that takes the crown and serves as the creepiest thing in the film. <br/><br/> Okay, I can't hold back any longer. Gotta talk about how this movie suffers. Over the course of filming, I have no issue with the directing. It's not too special, but it's not bad; the camerawork is a different story. It's inconsistent, sloppy, and moves around too much. It tries creating a style that just doesn't work for the film. The exception is Dr. Lecter's scenes. Everything works there, but it seems like the film basically was built around what happened there. Which brings me to the actual story and the editing. We start with Jodie proving herself in the FBI and toughing it out as a female there. It's brief, and some exposition is quickly thrown in to establish her character because, after all, we have to hurry up and get to Hannibal. Which still doesn't seem totally logical. They go to one of the most dangerous and cunning psychiatrists to help catch the notorious Buffalo Bill, and they send an FBI agent who hasn't even graduated? That doesn't add up for me. Fast forward a scene or 2 and we get introduced to Buffalo Bill. It's a disturbing scene, but now we know who everyone is looking for. So the small amount of film dedicated to detective work really hardly serves any purpose because, after all, let's just get back to Hannibal. However smart the Hannibal scenes may be, they're also predictable. And the music really is more nonchalant than anything, and when you mix it all together, you get a film that really isn't all that scary. It's a cop story with a good, not great, female lead and an unremarkable story, so it all dwindles down to Hannibal. And he's truly a pretty great movie psycho, but surround him in a film that is surrounded around him, and the result is just eh. <br/><br/> The climax has predictable moments, but it was leading up to the tense finish I was hoping for the entire film. And then the decisive moment happened and it was so lame. The redeeming part is how the movie ended because despite my criticism from before, I thoroughly enjoyed the ending. So there is that. But if you want an actually scary film with a cool, strong heroine, go watch Alien, Zero Dark Thirty, or just something else.

","If you consider yourself a movie fan but have yet to hear of the Criterion Collection turn in your movie fan card. I've touted the amazing things being offered in the past by companies like Twilight Time, Shot Factory, Olive and Arrow. Criterion was one of the first companies to bring forth full-fledged special editions of classic movies with numerous extras that make them worth tossing out the old version of a film in favor of theirs. If you need an example of why here is one.<br/><br/>Released in 1991, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was the second time that the character Dr. Hannibal Lecter appeared on screen having been seen just a short time in Michael Mann's MANHUNTER. But the performance of Anthony Hopkins in this version will forever be sealed in our minds as the perfect performance to associate with the character. But maybe you're not familiar with the story.<br/><br/>Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is in training to become an FBI agent. Her desire is to work in the behavioral science department. She's called to the office of Agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) for a special assignment. They're doing a survey of serial killers and he wants to send her to see Dr. Hannibal Lecter in prison in the hopes he will respond better to her than most and agree to answer the questionnaire.<br/><br/>Starling goes to visit Lecter at the facility he is imprisoned in for the criminally insane, first having to deal with the facility's head Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald) before being taken to the now iconic cell block that holds Lecter. Behind a Plexiglas wall she sees him for the first time and he converses with her. But Lecter is one to use psychiatric measures against those he confronts and the pair play a cat and mouse game until he finally agrees after a traumatic experience with the man in the cell next to his.<br/><br/>Crawford is actually working on a current case, another serial killer the press has called Buffalo Bob. His assignment to Starling was in reality a hope for clues that Lecter could provide. He takes Starling along with him on the case as they begin to investigate the latest victim. Each has been killed but held captive after several days and each has had portions of their skin removed. As Starling delves deeper into the case and her communications with Lecter, he begins to offer her clues to aid in finding the new killer. But at what cost? Her sanity? His freedom? Or is there something more going on here?<br/><br/>The film is one of those perfect movies that works on all levels. The direction of Jonathan Demme is some of the best ever committed to celluloid. He combines all of the pieces used to create a film that terrifies and fascinates at the same time. That combination of music, cinematography, acting, sets, costuming, stunts, makeup and more are all molded into a movie that you won't forget after seeing it just once. Having the opportunity to watch it more than a single time just helps you to appreciate the effort and end results all the more.<br/><br/>The film was released in blu-ray format before in a collector's edition by MGM so why bother picking up this version instead? That's where Criterion shows what they do best. To start with the presentation of the film with a 4K digital restoration approved by director of photography Tak Fujimoto. The images on screen are the best you will find for this film. But the extras are not limited to that.<br/><br/>The audio commentary track from 1994 with director Demme, actors Foster and Hopkins, screenwriter Ted Tally and former FBI agent John Douglas (the actual agent Crawford was based on) is here. A new interview with film critic Maitland McDonagh focuses on both the film and a brief discussion about serial killers in reality and on film. There are 38 minutes of deleted scenes. If this wasn't enough there are four documentaries that feature hours of interviews with the cast and crew. Then there is a behind the scenes featurette. The storyboards used for the film are on hand to view. The original trailer is here. And this new version includes a book featuring an introduction by Foster, an essay by critic Amy Taubin, articles written by Thomas Harris, the author of the book the film is based on, from 2000 and 2013 on the origins of Lecter and lastly an interview with director Demme. That's an extensive amount of extras along with the best presentation of the film ever all brought together by Criterion.<br/><br/>While I've been aware of Criterion this is my first time viewing one of the versions they've put out. I'm glad to see that they live up to their reputation. As a matter of fact they have exceeded it. They not only put out versions of popular films such as this one they make it a goal to seek out classic films of the past as well as foreign films that might not have gotten the attention or been made readily accessible to movie fans around the world. It's a tremendous and thankless job that they do. After my experience with this film let's hope that they carry on with their goal and achieve it daily."

","I definitely understand why this movie has received many awards as well as its actors. The movie does a really good job at drawing you in more and more when you watch it. I really like the way Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is portrayed as the good guy in trying to help the FBI, and wanting you to like him even though he is a serial killer; it brought a sense of benevolence to him. I thought it was interesting how the movie started off with watching Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) running through the forest; the way it was filmed made it seem like something was going to happen to her as she was running and then the guy coming up behind her, it starts off the movie with making you watch carefully and letting you know there will be surprises. Also, another interesting point in the beginning was how they used Clarice an agent in training as the person to help find Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) and trying to get information out of Hannibal. I really like the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice, it started out as Clarice being very afraid of Hannibal and as the movie went on they got closer and there was a sense of respect for each other. The way Hannibal was asking Clarice about her childhood was a really intriguing way of trying to help her solve the case. It made the timeline of the movie even more interesting; because, there was kind of two stories one inside the other the main story being the FBI trying to find Buffalo Bill and the small story being the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice. Overall I thought the movie was really good, I am not a big fan of horror movies but I liked the story this one had and the way it was all put together. It is definitely worthy of the awards it got and the actors."

","With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre. It is a first- rate production all around. It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme. Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home. The two lead actors won Oscars for their performances...each deserved. Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer. Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation. He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed. The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins. Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well. A quality film in all aspects!"

","I love this movie because it's timeless. The cutting edge suspense and psychological questioning transcends that of a typical thriller made in any era of filmmaking. It can't be replicated or considered a staple of the 90s because it is art for the ages.Creepy story of an evil serial killer, stalking women and using there skin for his sick perverted reasons. A rookie FBI agent (played by Jodie Foster) is asked to interview an incarcerated serial killer Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins) who knows the killer's identity. This is a very squeamish film and is still quite frightening even for today's standards of violence in the film industry. This is one of those movies that will stick to your ribs like ""Liver and Fava beans and a nice Chianti"". Anthony Hopkins is superb in his portrayal of Hannibal Lector, and Jody Foster fits agent Clarice Starling to a T... I enjoy this movie every time I watch it.Extraordinary acting by all involved.Even after all these years and watching it for the third or fourth time I find this movie to be brilliantly made, highly entertaining and one of the few movies that can be watched multiple times without getting boring."
"Emerald_Catt","10","2","4","13 May 2016"," Instant Classic
","Defiantly one of the movies film lovers should see before they die. The film is overall well written, the film stays true to the source material- the series by Thomas Harris. All the characters are on point and well performed! Its no wonder Sir Anthony Hopkins won awards for his performance. His character only had 8 minutes in screen time though. I would defiantly record this film to any film lover- but beware the gore and subject matter. the film is not for the faint of heart and the gore is not softened by the film effects of the 1990's. overall, the film is a must see and is recommended for 15+ due to subject matter. it is enjoyable regardless if you have read the source material or not."
"PredragReviews","9","2","4","13 May 2016"," I've learned to appreciate fava beans!
","Johnathon Demme's The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is perhaps an anomaly - it's not your average slasher horror film or predictable thriller, which have come to dominant the genre. The haunting performances and psychological interaction between the characters, coupled with the presence of a strong female character, makes for an eerie production that brings raw emotion into the thriller genre. The plot is undoubtedly intense and well-written. However, it's not so much the story-line as the performances of the actors that make Silence a must-see. Hopkins' control and almost monotone high-pitched voice takes sadistic lines to a whole new level. His gaze brought shivers down my spine as he delves into Clarice's psyche. But Clarice can hold her own against the former psychiatrist. Foster plays her character as young and innocent, but not to a fault. She uses Clarice's naivety and lack of experience as an advantage to stand up to Lector, which he, in turn, finds admirable.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a few gory scenes, but the implied wickedness, the spine-tingling suspense, and the electrifying, terrifying chemistry between the two leads will keep you on the edge of your seat. The actors all did their homework on serial killers and the people who strive to catch them and that effort paid off. The Silence of the Lambs captured the imagination and attention of American moviegoers like few Horror films have. Perhaps this is due in part to the fact that most didn't realize they were watching a Horror film to begin with. I'm sure Chianti sales skyrocketed, perhaps even sales of fava beans.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

","Trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is recruited right out of Quantico by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Services. He's investigating serial killer Buffalo Bill who skins his female victims. He's interviewing imprisoned killers but Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to cooperate. Starling is sent to talk to Lecter.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Demme takes the serial killer genre onto another level. It is brilliantly intense and brutal. It's a solid entry but then there is Hopkins' Lecter. It is an iconic villain for all times. From the moment he first appears, he steals the movie. It's rare that somebody can produce a character that is so original and so memorable. He is so impressive that he actually overshadows the penis-tucked human-skinning lotion-basket transvestite serial killer. Foster is also pretty solid. She brings a competence to the role that is needed for the outrageous villains to shine."

","I used to think that this film was just sick. But now I've watched it, I can appreciate how thrilling and brilliant this movie is. <br/><br/>If it wasn't for Anthony Hopkins performance as Dr. Hannibal Lector I would have rated this movie 7/10. What a stunning performance, I was amazed by how the role of the psychopathic Hannibal Lector was filled perfectly by Anthony and it couldn't have been done ant better. <br/><br/>It is a great storyline based on the novel by Thomas Harris, and I haven't mentioned Jodie Foster's Oscar winning performance as rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling, but let's face it, Jodie Foster's performance is good but it was overwhelmed by Anthony's performance. But still two good Oscar winning performances and good acting from the rest of the cast especially Ted Levine's role as Jame Gump (Buffalo Bill). <br/><br/>This legendary movie swept the main five Oscar's which were: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. <br/><br/>The soundtrack of this movie also made the movie what it is.

","In the story, the heroine's feelings for Hannibal are very complicated. He has both his idealistic traits, such as professionalism, calmness, restraint, keen insight, and fear of him as a brutal attacker. Therefore, the heroine is more an idealized empathy for Hannibal than the Oedipus complex of Oedipus. Because the heroine does not lack father's love, in the critical period of psychological development (1-3, 3-6, 6-10), the father has always existed as a good object (betting on the object of feelings). Hannibal and his father are not the same kind of person. The heroine's internal courage, courage, and perseverance are all derived from the identification of his father. And Hannibal is more like that ideal self (of course, this refers to the positive side).<br/><br/>The whole story of the play is driven by the traumatic needs of the heroine. Saving the daughter of the MP is the need to save the lost object. Working with Hannibal is the need for idealization. Killing the Buffalo Bill is the need to defeat the attacker. And these three people perfectly played the role of the heroine to fulfill these psychological needs. All in order to silence the lamb in Starling's heart."

","Verdict - Hit
Storyline - This movie does start with an FBI trainee who is on an FBI academy of where here future job will be an police officer, but this what you will see in this movie of how she will get trained to become an police officer such as able to kill the criminal people or arrest these criminal people by getting them, also it teaches the way you shoot, also police has to be fast of where it has to have an good fitness level if i say in this way, but the character name for this movie of this FBI trainee is clarice. Anyway, clarice has been called to an office by professional police officer, but asked been to to an interview of this person which is lecter who is an former serial killer, but has been jail for about 8 years, but is locked in an special cell because they are still dangerous people as from the past who had interview them from jail, this former killer has eaten some part of their body which is disgusting, anyway they have strict rules from this cell. However, the reason of why clara has been asked to do this investigation because there has been an serious killer name buffalo bill, which is occurring now who kill young womans by first either murdering them or kidnapping them, but this murder is disgusting because he remove their skin, anyway apparently he is connected to lecter because he knows this guy from the past, but interviewing lecter may help the police officer to find this serial killer, anyway this first investigation could be helpful for clara in order for he to become an capable professional police officer, however when she first met this former series killer in an jail, but both of them are separated anyway, but lecter is clever who knows anything and he looks creepy, however lecter does not like the main person who is in charge of this jail, anyway clara has slowly asked the lecter question which link to an buffalo bill, however from first instance, he asked to look out for his former patient, so we also know find out as an audience that this former series killer is also used to be an phystarist, anyway clara is heading there to find this former patient who is from different location, but inside the garage, the patient is there of where this former patient is actually killed, however only his head is there, this is just disgusting, but there is insects in his head as well, this is something mysteries of which clara is solving this case and knows that this patient is killed by buffalo, but this lecter is definitely has an link with buffalo bill because he knows him from the past, anyway when i was talking about insect, this mean an moth which is stuck inside the throat, but that is disgusting as well. Anyway, this buffalo bill does do something of which you need to watch, if you want to as he kidnap other womans by putting them in an van and kill them, then took their skin off, oh no, another disgusting scene, anyway she is murdered from this killer and now the police officer as well as clara are investing this case as well, but trying their best to find the clues, but they do find an moth inside the throat and even ask special people about these moth of where it comes, but still these evidence are not enough for police to catch this series killer. Later, there is an special person who their daughter is kidnapped by buffalo bill, however they have been asked by an police officer to get the series killer this time because she could still be alive, anyway clara made an plan of which lecter agree by transferring him to an hospital of which it is still locked up, but will have more freedom, also allow 1 week holiday in an island with police officer as well who will keep eye and keep this series killer with them, otherwise he would escape, but only this deal will work if this series killer help clara to find the clues based on the investigation to get the series killer, also if the girl is not killed, then this deal will work, anyway this is agreed, so lecter is getting transferred, also you know, not all police will agree of what clara is doing. Anyway, there is more points of which i would like to talk about of this series killer of where once it kill one, it will kill more as it is used to this, also it has been revealed that he may has done this due to the abuse he get from the past, also he is an bad killer as well, however there is an story revealed which lecter knows that buffalo bill kill these patient as well as he probably want know one to stand his way as he abducts girls. Anyway, somehow lecter is actually locked up in a different prison, anyway clara visit him as she want to solve this case by asking him the question in order to find the clues which will link to find him, but unfortunately lecter would not tell as he first ask her from the past story, anyway it is now revealed of why this movie is called ''the silence of the lambs'', as from the past her father was murdered because of burglar who killed him and her mother died from young age, but she was going to be orphan before being raised by someone, but she hears an lamb who is either crying or screaming want to go away as it does want to live there, probably in an farm that is owned by an human, anyway she escape with one lamb who suffer from this, however what happens, you just need to watch this, however this is why she has horrible dream of this from the past while from this present story, she is solving this case. Anway, lecter refused to answer the question about the series killer, so clara was asked to leave and she went away, anyway later on, lecter do escape by killing police officer, but how he escape, you just need to watch this in order to understand this scene, but he even wear police suit so that no one recognise him, so now he escape. Anyway, clara finds out this information, anyway she is not bothered about this as she do want to find this series killer, but police thinks that they find him, but no, anyway this series killer is also an crazy sometimes, but has an own dog, also he do keep girls, underneath the ground, but his house is also big, also he live alone in an quiet area as well. Anyway, as you watch this movie of which clara herself investigate this case by searching through the house, but she is clever of doing this case and then she arrive at this series killer house who she is suspicious once she go inside, but does recognise an moth, but she knows that this is an series killer and even chase him in an house of which he escape, but you just need to watch this to understand of what happened in this scene, also she does find the girl who is alive, but at the end, clara does kill this series killer who always own technique to do an murderer, but at the end, there is no more an series killer and clara has been proud for herself as well as other police of what she has done which is an big task to do this investigation as it is not always easy. Anyway, do you think, it is happily ever after because what about lecter who is freedom as we know he is an former killer, but they have killed buffalo bill, is it because police cannot find lecter anymore and it is not important, but he is chasing his old friend who works in an cell, is it because, lecter does not like the person who was charge in jail from those days when he was locked in there, this is why he could still be an killer because this could be next target, maybe, well, this is the ending of this movie which these physiological thriller movie, does not mean end in an good way even-though you think that you solved the main case.
Extra Information - This movie story was just good, but it was an simple story of 2 hours long about finding the series killer by asking an former killer, but it done in an good way which will keep you attracted of how they will find this series killer, also this movie does contain disgusting stuff, but at least, it is not too much, anyway every actor had good performance, also these killer do actually look evil and series killer, however the dialogue were good in this movie, also this movie is an old movie which has an old style, but these old movie still use different ways to attract us as a audience of how they will kill these serious killer, but if you watch the climax scene, then you understand of what i am saying, also this movie does explore of how trainee are training to be an become policer, also this movie, in an jail, there are creepy people who are there, locked up, also there is more things happening in this movie of which you need to watch when they solve this case, also there is one scene of which other police want to know information about the series killer from lecter before he is transferred, also he does tell one lie of which you just need to watch to understand this, also there will be more information revealed about the series killer when they solve this case, but it is an worth a watch if you not seen this movie."

","As a reasoning film, Hannibal 's intelligence to Agent Starling is particularly intriguing. The lines between the lines are all points of the Buffalo Bill, which are worth scrutinizing. As a horror movie, Hannibal 's escape from prison in the building and the brutal killing of the two guards formed psychological fears, especially one of the prison guards The belly was hung on the cage like a butterfly, which deepened Hannibal's terrible impression of a high IQ cold-blooded killer. The Buffalo Bill is a pervert in criminal behavior and forms sensory oppression. Looking at the peeling of each body and trapping the victim in a dark and damp basement mine, the terrible sense of helplessness will permeate my heart. . Especially when Starling arrested him in his dark and weird room, Bill 's tension when he was hiding in the dark and peeping into the blood vessel was creepy.<br/><br/>Detective Starling is the only sunshine in this film. From her perspective, she was open and honest when exchanging information with Hannibal, thinking about the content of the conversation, and summarizing the characteristics of the corpse. Taking us step by step to expose the murderer, and through communication with Hannibal, let us see that besides the bloody side of eating human organs, Hannibal also has a gentleman side of courtesy.<br/><br/>The frontal close-up shots of many characters in the film can capture their expressions and touch the audience most intuitively."

","Film with a strong psychological color, the hero and heroine of the formation of the character are described in detail. The film highlights one aspect of STARLING'S CHARACTER: The harrowing images she had as a child at her adoptive parents'home when they butchered their animals. It was because she could not bear the whines of the cattle that she stole away from her adoptive parents'ranch. Pity for the weak became her subconscious obsession and her motivation to get into the FBI and die. She's Dead Tone a serial killer hunt, Jim? Gammy couldn't bear the tragic death of his hostage. She broke into Mason's farm alone because she didn't want Dr. Lecter lynched. The lamb's pain had been a constant urge to do her duty. The film is unique in its descriptive perspective, exploring the spiritual world, the formation and change of character from the perspective of Floyd's psychoanalysis, and peering into the character's behavior from the complex expressions of the unconscious and the conscious, the ID, the ego and the superego, there are a lot of things we can chew on and learn from.

","It's a really good movie... but to me - it doesn't align with the overall IMDb rating. Don't get me wrong - it is a great movie... the storytelling is good. The acting was great too, in particular - Anthony & Jodie were perfect in their roles.
But the movie did become a little bit boring towards the end and I was willing for it to wrap up. Perhaps because something major happened in the middle portion of the movie, and then after that it quickly went flat. The ending was bland. I've watched it twice now, and I've felt the same both times. I much prefer 'Red Dragon' over this one. I easily gave that a high rating.
But I don't want to take away from the fact it is still a good movie and was enjoyable."

","The horror movie genre has historically exalted the objectification of women. In slasher movies, teen exploitation flicks, and even seemingly innocuous thrillers, women are cast for the purposes of screaming and disrobing. The antithesis within the horror/thriller genre is the 1991 Academy Award winning film The Silence of the Lambs. Although not thought of as a ""women's movie,"" a feminist undercurrent is present in the film through its protagonist, a strong female character who contradicts previous genre stereotypes. Her scenes impart an objection to the objectification of women and depict the difficulty of working in a male-domintated institution. Furthermore, her character's success in the movie is her own doing; there are no male rescuers or helpers."

","The Silence of the Lambs based on the novel by Thomas Harris - featuring Dr. Hannibal Lecter, (played by Anthony Hopkins who steals the film and was deserving of his Best Actor award) who is perhaps the most iconic character in film history and Agent Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster who really holds the film together and her performance is her greatest in my view). The film is a rare example of where a film wins several Oscars for Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, and Best Picture.

Jonathan Demme's, the director was superb, in respect to how the film is shot, it is shot with a unrelenting atmospheric dread throughout which never ceases, the suspense never drops. We talk about how ideas are in your head before they are put onto paper - even though this film was based on a book it still had to be brought to life without losing any of its atmosphere, that is the greatest test of all. The Silence of the Lambs, which in less capable hands may have just turned out to be another cheap thriller film. It is rather intellectual, a surprise given similar movies in the genre. It can be argued that it is more psychological than violent, even though there is a fair amount of blood.<br/><br/>The fact is that with the tense score, marvellous cinematography and with an almost bleak aspect in regards to theme and the aesthetics - just really all adds to what in the end is not only is the perfect thriller but the perfect movie."

","Starling is not a simple woman, only ignorant people can be really simple. Starling's character is complex, she is rational, smart and ambitious, which is said by Hannibal herself, and she also knows how to deal with interpersonal relationships quite tactfully. These traits are one of the reasons why Hannibal likes her. Hannibal said he hates rude people, and ""etiquette"" and ""restraint"" are precisely the suppression and domestication of human anti-animal instincts. Most simple people follow their own nature and act bluntly without thinking, and Starling is definitely not one of those people. On the contrary, she seems to be a little too self-restrained, causing this cold beauty to constantly reveal her fragile fragility under her strong appearance, adding a bit of lovable beauty to her. but in addition, you can strongly feel a cold heart and an unshakable belief that you are in a weak position. Hannibal has always been a man with excellent mental control and seems to have transcended all the limitations of human inferiority. He advocates reason, intelligence, and appreciates classical literature and music (remember the Gothenburg variation in the background when he was in a cage, Bach's music is recognized as the most rational). He must have loved the grandeur of classical tragedies more than the pleasures of earthly life. So there is no doubt that Starling is typical of his favorite image: rational, strong, neat, self-respecting, sensitive, and because of the shadow of childhood or her nature, she has a strong melancholy temperament and the lonely beauty of isolating the crowd. a little neurotic can also please a psychiatrist. So Hannibal should be attracted to her at first sight.
In the end, however, it was the story of the screaming Lamb that eventually prompted Hannibal to fall in love with Starling, which was so idealized and symbolized that it had a certain allegorical color. That kind of compassionate feelings, the great love for human suffering, make Starling exude a kind of holy martyrdom, but also make Hannibal explore her story again and again and be deeply shocked. Hannibal has always been sure of analyzing people's minds, and Starling is an exception. He had speculated that she might have been sexually abused by relatives or wanted to escape from a poor and barren childhood, no matter which kind of trauma was limited to her personal misfortune. It is common for people to hurt themselves because of bad luck, even if it is reasonable and reasonable, because it still cannot escape the scope of personal grief, and the resulting tragedy is marked by a particular experience. And the real profound tragedy should be a more universal, not based on this appearance, based on the origin of life shudder. It needs to put aside the abusive self-catharsis and resonate with it with a rational and simple soul. So Starling's story was a big surprise to Hannibal. She saw other creatures suffering, grieving for them, and giving up everything to save them, a state that few people could achieve. It is an exaggeration to say that there is an awareness of Christ carrying the cross. So Hannibal would give an infinitely gentle sigh, ""Thank you, Starling."" I think the second half of what he didn't say should be ""Thank you, Starling, you have given me a little bit of confidence in human beings."" So ""the world is more interesting because of you"". The only physical contact between the two men in the film was a touch of the index finger, reminiscent of Michelangelo's famous mural Genesis, and God's finger turned Adam into a spiritual connection between God and man. this passage in the film may suggest a subtle shift in the relationship between Hannibal and Starling. The dialogue between the two of them across the cage is my favorite part of the play. The exquisite performance and deep music are very touching. There was a lot of symbolic dialogue, and Starling said that at first she wanted to release the lambs, but they ""didn't know how to run away, they just stood there confused and didn't want to go."" How similar these lambs are to the dull world. Even if they are given physical freedom, they are still prisoners of their own souls. They all say that the strong save themselves and the saints pass from one person to another, but most mediocre people do not know how to escape from the tragedy of life. They are even so sad that they do not realize that they are in a tragedy. They only keep wandering outside the heavenly gate with a fragile heart and a wandering soul, constantly indulging in pain. Keep screaming in my heart. And all this cruelty is masked by a colder silence between heaven and earth. As sung in ""The Sound Of Silence"", when silence becomes a sound, making people think that everything is normal, but tearing apart this layer of appearance, is it not the execution ground of hell burning in the scorching sun in front of us? The pain and weight of life will unbiased fall on everyone's head, as Starling said, ""they are too heavy."" Did Starling really hear the ""scream"" of the lamb when she was a child? I think the answer is probably no (for movies only). It's winter night, everyone is sleeping, and the butchers shouldn't have started yet. How could the humming of a few weak lambs be big enough to wake up Starling in the room? Why can't other people just hear this sound? So this ""scream"" is probably an abstract intention, a voice that exists only in Starling's heart, and echoes again and again like a nightmare as an adult. This is the symbolism used in the film. The title of the film tells us that ""the Lamb is always the most silent animal"", but only in Stelline's eyes they keep asking for help and struggling because of suffering. In the final analysis, it is because she has a sensitive insight into the world. Many times as sensitive as ordinary people and several times as compassionate as ordinary people, Starling is not destined to be a happy person. Hannibal's sketch shows her dressed in white with a lamb in her arms, and her eyes seem gentle but exude a desolate and resolute strength, which bears a resemblance to the Virgin Mary. In fact, if we talk about the topics of ""the strong"" and ""the weak"", is it true that each of us is not a ""weak"" in front of nature and fate? And the world itself may be the greedy eyes that Hannibal said. People come to the world with the original sin called desire, unconsciously fighting against each other, forming an invisible and huge net, each person is not only the giver of evil, but also the victim of evil; both greedy peeping and frightened escape; both a sinner and a victim, there is no escape, no escape. Like poor bad boy Bill, like the man who looked at Starling at the airport, like those contemptuous male policemen, like you and me. Perhaps, in the eyes of Hannibal, human beings are pathetic, struggling for their own interests, but can not escape the butcher's knife of fate, and will eventually be mercilessly swallowed up by life, just like stupid and frightened lambs waiting to be slaughtered, ignorance, numbness, pitiful and pathetic. It can be said that Hannibal has been looking down on human beings with a cold reason, just like a ruthless god, who does not know what benevolence is, regards all things as a ruminant dog, and cannot change human tragedies, so he is indifferent. Until he met Starling, a shepherd girl who, sensitive by nature and aware of human tragedies, was crying to save even one lamb, a thin, frail girl who tried to carry all the sufferings of the world on her shoulders. The two people are both similar and completely opposite. So Hannibal's love for Starling is not only a sympathy for each other, but also a guardian of the beautiful soul of dissidents. ""Brave Clarice, if one day your lamb stops screaming, will you come and tell me?"" If this world can really become the kingdom of heaven one day, even the ruthless gods will be a little moved, right?"

","I've seen way too many thriller movies, and The Silence of the Lambs was one of them. When it comes to movie genres, thriller movies happen to be my very favourite. This was a very good movie to watch. This movie was made on the year I was born, so it makes it that extra more special.<br/><br/>I would say this movie, The Silence of the Lamb, was on the same level as movies such as Seven and Copycat, with Copycat being one of the more underrated ones. I know this is ""The Silence of the Lamb"" review, but Copycat was a seriously good movie, and on par with these other movies. You'd be surprised just how similar and good it is. You should check Copycat out. It's a very good thriller movie along with Seven and The Silence of the Lambs. All three of these movies are great thriller movies.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs though was a masterpiece. It happens to be one of my favourite movies, and watched it a countless number of times along with some of the other ones.<br/><br/>The start of the movie, where the FBI agent, Clarice Starling, was training outside at the academy was a great introduction. I have never seen a introduction like that before in any of the movies I have seen. The start of the movie was great, and from there, it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>In this movie, Clarice Starling, who is still a trainee, is tasked to finding, searching and capturing a serial killer or madman named ""Buffalo Bill"", who happens to be a psychopath. She asks for assistance from one of the psychopaths located and imprisoned in an asylum called Dr Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist, in capturing Buffalo Bill, who happens to skin his female victims. Clarice Starling has a challenging task in bringing and taking down this ""Buffalo Bill"".<br/><br/>What I liked about Clarice Starling was her character. I have never seen a character quite like her before especially a female one. She's very keen on her job, and looks very determined in the task in hand, and ultimately bringing down Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>I liked all the training sequences Clarice Starling was undergoing at the academy. She sort of inspires you or someone to undertake a job or career like hers. It's a dream career - working for the FBI.<br/><br/>Jack Crawford was also interesting, and I like how he leads the charge in this operation.<br/><br/>This movie, The Silence of the Lambs, was a very interesting one. You have to be very attentive to what actually happens in this movie, and may need to watch it at least few times to get a true picture of what this movie is really about.<br/><br/>What I found most interesting were the interactions between Dr Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. It was hard to predict what was going to happen during those interactions. Sometimes, those interactions between the two was scary. It looks as if something was about to happen.<br/><br/>If you are watching this movie for the first time, and reading this review, I would advise to try turning your volume-up on your television just for the suspense. It's a thriller movie after all, and that's what thriller movies are all about.<br/><br/>That's how great ""The Silence of the Lambs"" really is - it's a thriller!<br/><br/>It's a different movie when you see this though the second and third time, respectively.<br/><br/>It's the plot or story that's more interesting more than anything when you see this again more than the suspense itself. The suspense is already lost.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lamb is a great thriller movie for anyone especially if you're into crime. There aren't too many crime movies as good as The Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>It's one of the best thriller movies from the nineties. Aside from the suspense itself, it's a movie you could watch repeatedly. That's why The Silence of the Lambs happens to be one of my favourite movies."

","Watching the complete film, I was deeply impressed by Hannibal, played by Hopkins, dark red eyes, graceful and decent manners, citing classics, talking back to back, clean and white prison uniform, with the Savior 's Compassion, but the opposite is an ogre who reads through reality and sees through human nature. I went back to the dormitory and found a lot of background information about cannibalism. An allusion mentioned in a short movie review is very relevant. What is said is that eating people may be related to a primitive sense of power. When a person tries to gain strength, the primitive man kills another strong man, so that he can obtain the strength and wisdom of that strong man. This kind of strength is called Manner in religion. After reading these, I was relieved to the fact that he was eating people. Hannibal, a man with a strong heart comparable to the existence of God, is there really such a perfect person in the world? Perhaps, I have no way of answering this question. Hannibal is just a speculation about the savior. Unlike the savior known as the strong human body, such as Spider-Man and Iron Man, this savior is spiritual and human. Hannibal, this character, in the end, I completely ignored his bloody background. I only remember that he killed the police and deliberately made Jesus die on the cross and wiped his fingers with Stalin's fingers. The scene, the touch of tenderness was the deepest, and his sketch of Stalin's clothes: Stalin was quiet and quiet, holding the lamb in his hands, as holy as the Virgin. Hannibal, in my opinion, is a man with God's cleanliness. Maybe he shouldn't be human, and he is not worthy of such a great existence."

","The Silence of the Lambs, originally by Thomas Harris, was directed by Johnathan Demme, and my god did he do a great friggin job. SOTL made 272.7 million dollars at the box office, well deservingly. Johnathan Demme, Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, & Ted Tally all won Oscars for their part in the film.
This take on Thomas Harris' story was done brilliantly! It takes you on this psychological rollercoaster, and just plays ping-pong with your brain. The team behind the camera did a great job pacing the film out.
Anthony Hopkins trademarked his role as Hannibal Lecter. The emotion and seriousness he brings to the table was well worthy of the Osacr he received. Believe it or not, Hopkins only had SIXTEEN MINUTES of screen time. I need more Hopkins!! Jodie Foster did a phenomenal job in her leading role. Demme did a great job by making her character vulnerable, in a way; A rookie on an on going case. Ted Lavine as Bill Buffalo did very good as well, but got somewhat shadowed by the two leading preformances. Bill Buffalo is all types of twisted, and was a great compliment to the leads.
The screenplay by Ted Tally was so deep, and witty. It set this dark, and creepy feel throughout the entire movie, in the best way possible.
The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto was shot so beautifully. The close up shots were very dramatic, in a good way, that added so much depth to the feeling of the film. Some shots were so fast, but it captured everything you needed to know; it was done very well.
Overall, this movie should go down as one of the greatest of all time. Very well shot, preformed, and everything around it."

Nominated for 7 Oscar's, winner of the 5 major awards, Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay (not original screenplay), Actor and Actress.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs (1991) became the third film in Academy history to win the ""Big Five"" Academy Awards for producing, directing, acting, and screenwriting following It Happened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).<br/><br/>A rookie FBI trainee is tasked to interview an incarcerated psychopath for information into a recent crime spree. Foster won a Best Actress Oscar, and in addition to winning Best Actor, Hopkins' Dr. Lecter was named the Best Villain by the AFI. Demme's Oscar-winning direction and Oscar-winning screenplay make one of the most tense and chilling films of the past 20 years; Lecter's eventual escape being especially scary. This is a slick, first-rate masterpiece! I give it a 10/10."

","The Silence of the Lambs is based on the 1988 book by Thomas Harris. The film is directed by Jonathan Demme (Philadelphia, 1993 and Rachel Getting Married 2008), and stars Jodie Foster (Panic Room), Scott Glenn (Buffalo Soldiers, 2001) and Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs, 1991).<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins, by the way, has done some other fantastic work. But this, undoubtedly, is the role of which he is best known.<br/><br/>There is something uniquely fascinating about 'psychopaths' - lack of empathy and indifference to the suffering of others. Dehumanised minds, inhabiting human bodies discreetly, blending in with the rest of the human population, there is something profoundly, beyond words, unnerving about this aspect of human nature.<br/><br/>There's a statistic that says that around 1% of the general population are psychopaths. Go along to prison and supposedly that rises to 25% of the community. And 5% of CEOs have the traits too, supposedly.<br/><br/>I find the 1% stat more terrifying. One in every 100 people that I walk past in the street would feel no emotional impulse to help me, should I lay down in a state of serious ill-health. But, they would trample over me, literally and figuratively, in pursuit of their own wants and needs.<br/><br/>Hannibal Lecter is of no garden variety psychopath, however. And the movie does an outstanding job of exploring this very real and disturbing side to human nature, embodied in the character played by Hopkins. The FBI trainee Clarice Starling (played by Foster) is the film's protagonist, called to work on catching 'Buffalo Bill', serial killer at large. The two characters are very different, and there relationship and interactions are the main force of the movie.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster's character stands in a mostly male-dominated FBI environment and the way the men react around her. Also, Foster is 5,3"", which is also played upon. The movie leverages this to significant effect, both in creating some short, effective scenes; Starling standing in a lift surrounded by taller men, for example. Then also, using it to develop the characters quickly and believably. For example, the relationship between Starling and the FBI's behavioural science lead Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) becomes meaningful in its own right, as both characters interact with each other in this law enforcement world.<br/><br/>Starling's family history is also tied effectively to the whole. Clocking in at about the two-hour mark, this movie packs a lot in terms of character work and staying close to Harris's original approximation in the novel.<br/><br/>While this movie is entertaining, one might have guessed it's not always fun to watch, and I don't feel my review would be complete without mentioning that some of the scenes are truly disturbing and disgusting! This is not one to let the kids watch.<br/><br/>The only complaints are about small pieces, details of the whole. One is how did Lecter get his hands on the pen of Dr Chilton? All we ever see is him staring at it, and then later Chilton missing it. We only ever see him here incarcerated in the most visceral way, with the trademark face mask and his entire body locked vertical and straight into a sack truck. A detail probably brushed over in production, but one that I felt was a missed opportunity to elaborate the cunning of Dr H.Lecter.<br/><br/>The second is that I felt some of the actions of the law enforcement characters were slightly hokey compared to others.<br/><br/>I rewatched this movie last night, in 2020. Times may have changed, but the realities of human nature this movie explores in fiction remain as darkly alluring as ever."

","Are the Lambs Actually Silent?
Silence of the Lambs is a classic psychological thriller film that everybody hears about. The film was based on a psychological horror novel written by Thomas Harris in 1988. The film was directed by Jonathan Demme, he won an Academy Award for Best Director for Silence of The Lambs. The film made $273 million worldwide after it was released on February 14, 1991, making $14 million its opening weekend.
The film takes place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1991. A young FBI agent in training named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is asked by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is known for being a forensic psychiatrist, also as a cannibalistic serial killer. Jack is in charge of her and giving her a chance to help with the case. While Dr. Lecter is locked up in a state hospital for the criminally insane, Starling and her superiors think that he can help them find another serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).
Starling keeps going back to talk to Dr. Lecter and he helps her break down the case of the other serial killer. While they talk he made her talk about her childhood in exchange for information about Buffalo Bill. He then goes and gets transferred to Baltimore to talk to the senator and he tells them who Buffalo Bill is. Clarice then goes back to talk about what he said before when they were talking about her childhood, she reveals what haunts her the most.
Since this film is a psychological thriller, it uses low angle lighting to show how scary and sinister Dr. Lecter is when talking to Clarice. A good majority of the scenes with Dr. Lecter are shots with low lighting. The actress that played Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) was remarkable with her acting and how she portrayed the character. She won awards for her great contributions to the film. Along with her co-star who played the character Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), won awards for his role and acting. The film uses many close up shots of the characters to show their emotions and maybe get some from the audience. Most of the close up shots are when the two Starling and Lecter are talking. They had good makeup and costumes to show who the characters are and the blood made it more thrilling.
The characters showed a lot of emotions in this film. It felt like I was there with them and I couldn't look away. Some of the characters I did not like because of what dialogue they had. I thought that one particular character didn't need to say what she said because it made me not like her as a character, but she did have some good lines that made sense in the situation that she was in.
This film is thrilling, haunting, and suspenseful. It takes the audience through the mind the cannibalistic serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter and what his thoughts are. This film sucks you in and wants you to keep watching because the characters are so fascinating and have many dynamics to their characteristics. Silence of the Lambs is a film that I highly recommend seeing if you like thrillers with some gore."
"t-14162","10","0","0","22 January 2020"," The Silence of the Lambs
","Director, Jonathan Demme has created a pure masterpiece with The Silence of the Lambs. The suspenseful mystery has an exciting plot along with Oscar winning acting performances. I found The Silence of the Lambs to be a perfect balance between horror and crime. The thoughtful and witty way the movie is put together leaves viewers at the edge of their seats for the whole hour and fifty eight minutes.
The Silence of the Lambs is about the FBI working with a convicted serial killer to catch an active serial killer. The convict, Dr. Hannibal Lector, is a killer who is known for eating parts of his victims after killing them. Although he is a psychopath, Dr. Lector is extremely intelligent so the FBI wants to study him. The young FBI student, Clarice Starling is sent in to try and talk to Dr. Lector. While meeting him for the first time Clarice discovers that Dr. Lector has information on the known serial killer, Buffalo Bill. Following this discovery, agent Starling makes it her mission to find out what Dr. Lecter knows about Buffalo Bill. Through this process Clarice learns a lot about Dr. Lecter and about herself.
The biggest part to this movie's success is its uniqueness. No other movie can directly compare to the genius of the plotline and the pure skill in the acting. The Silence of the Lambs is about the psychology of serial killers to try and help people to understand why they do what they do. The truth is that there is no way for most normal people to understand this because it is insane. Most of all I found that The Silence of the Lambs is a film about personal redemption. I first saw this when Clarice talks to Dr. Lecter about her childhood. She talks about why she wanted to be in the FBI and how as a child she tried to save a lamb from being slaughtered. She heard the lambs screaming and she thought that if she just saved one of the lambs she would feel better. Clarice feels the same way about the girl that was kidnapped as she did about the lambs. Clarice thinks that if she saves the missing girl she won't hear the screams of the lambs waiting to be slaughtered anymore. This is where the title of the movie comes in and the profoundness of the plot becomes apparent.
My only complaint for this movie is that the supporting acting was a bit weak at times. The police scenes and a few miscellaneous other scenes seemed a bit cheesy. Nevertheless, the main actors save the day with fantastic performances all around. Jodie Foster does an amazing job as Clarice Starling with the emotion and the pure confidence shown. Yet Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector steals the show. His dead stares in the close ups and the way he can sound insane but intellectual at the same time is amazing. Hopkins acts flawlessly in one of the toughest roles someone can be in. In my eyes, Hopkins as Dr. Lector rivals Jack Nicholson's role in The Shining.
The Silence of the Lambs was a success because of its creative storyline and its remarkable acting. I believe any fans of the horror genre or anyone looking for a good thriller with a tremendous plot would love this movie. However I will warn that if you aren't a fan of parts of people's faces being eaten off this may not be the movie for you."

","Watching The Silence Of The Lambs again some 30 years later, you come to realize it's greatest strength being, is that it is an 'actors piece'. This is what raises the picture up to it's still seminal and legendary status today, whilst the background story, events and supporting cast can seem slightly dated and diluted, due to the sheer number and diabolical content offered by thrillers since its inception.Both lead performers have weathered and survived the years immaculately however and is primarily the root source of why this film still holds up as strongly as it does.Both are exquisite in their creation and to watch.The haunted house finale is a bit wobbly and unreasonable even back in 1990 but probably not enough reason to carp.I don't think, in regards it's honouring, the Academy sweeps the thriller/horror genre under the rug in so far as accolade, more like a case being that films of undeniable excellence such as The Exorcist and this one are just so few and far between."

"manojmagecha","10","0","0","24 December 2019"," A Sophisticated Killer
","There are psychological thrillers and then there's this. I cannot think of anyone other than Sir Anthony Hopkins to play the lead role of A serial killer/ cannibal/ sophisticated psychopath. He's a conversational artist, and someone who knows what he's capable of without fear of expressing his interests in what we refer to as cannibalism. The initial meeting between himself and the FBI agent Clarice, gives his character a sense of meaning, and purpose. It's not everyday he has the pleasure of indulging in a conversation, and being locked up you would think his social skills are little rusty! But quite the contrary.<br/><br/>I'm expected to believe that this DR knows he's aging and on the verge of never seeing daylight again, and so Clarice becomes more of a confidant, and helpful test subject for the DR to engage with, in context of the finer, more simpler pleasures of human interaction.<br/><br/>He gives off a sense of honour; it's not everyday a psychopathic killer is approached by an agent that seeks advice on a case which she cannot understand! The DR has been caught for similar acts of violent murders and knows no-one else is better equipped to advise young Clarice.<br/><br/>And now we have reason, we have a plot, and we have established the characters influences on each other. The Dr Seems to be more than willing to help, so helpful in-fact you feel as though Clarice will truly understand the mind of such a character. The Dr (aka Hannibal lectar) effortlessly allows the agent to believe she is the only form of communication he has, and that he needs her just as much as she needs him, however under false pretences, to give her the impression that he's worthy of her trust and at the same time asserting his mannerisms. No-one truly knows what Hannibal lectar seeks, except Hannibal himself! Perhaps to be remembered? By consolidating with the detective? A more exciting challenge presenting itself with Clarice in the frame? After all Clarice is the only person that can truly reveal the DR to be more than what society has labelled him to be! Through Clarice, a young in-experienced agent, the doctor sees opportunity, to tell A story, presents his theories and ideology like A conductor leading an orchestra, like a father leaving behind a legacy, like a master educating his disciple. It begs the question, if you were in the detectives position, how comfortable and relaxed does Hannibal lectar make you feel? Do you feel closer to his mind? Are you forming a bond?...... The answer is YES! And this exactly how he begins to lead his victims into a false sense of security, to eventually get close enough to you too............ EAT YOU!!!!!! Muhahahaha!!!!<br/><br/>As a member of the audience I was lead to believe the DR is creating a calm and relaxed environment with his tone of voice, but at the same time I felt he created a somewhat eerie atmosphere, as his reputation truely begins to preced him, from the moment he is introduced!<br/><br/>A film worthy to be considered as one of the most sophisticated and eerie performances to date. Suspense, suspense, suspense."

At no point does the film get bogged down in clichés or fluff, and every moment compounds the character development, drives the plot, and mounts tension; nothing is wasted. The pace from start to finish rises and swells like waves crashing on a beach in an approaching storm, and as the climax arrives we are drenched in the power of its pinnacle, only to be softly released as the story teases its epilogue. Every actor brought their 'A' game, and created a memorable image and sound that would be imitated and admired ever since. One of the best."

This character is brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins. He did a good job by portraying the ideology of Lector. The cinemaography is very good, according to it's decade.<br/><br/>Now talking about the cons, I felt something missing at the end of the film. It just felt incomplete. Hannibal's character should have been given more time so we could understand his mind and principle. Another thing is that some more scenes should be shot of Clarice at Buffalo bill's house where she could've been abducted and torture to make the atmosphere more intense.

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>Very few films can capture me and enthrall me as this one did. Back in 1991, when it first came out, we went and watched it on opening night and it was all we could talk about for weeks to follow. It was so good, we went to watch it again before it left the theaters, and then we bought it the day it was released to VHS - before DVD's were even invented.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" stars Jodie Foster as an FBI Trainee, Clarice Starling (in her finest role to date), and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (also his finest role to date). Clarice is assigned by FBI Agent, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview Hannibal - who is locked up in a high security facility - in an effort to get into the psyche of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill, still at large, in the hopes of locating and apprehending him before he can kill again. When news of a Senator's daughter being kidnapped, by who many believe to be Buffalo Bill, is aired on television, the race is on as time begins to tick down in an effort to save her life. But, for Clarice to get Hannibal to open up, she must face her own inner demons before he will help her.<br/><br/>A news reporter at the time stated that when he interviewed the actor, Anthony Hopkins for his article, he was nervous and afraid - that's how convincing he was in his role as Lecter. This is one of the best movies ever made, in my opinion - a perfect film. This film grabs you by the throat and never lets go - keeping you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat. Everything associated to this film was top notch - the acting, the cinematography, the story, the music, the pacing, the suspense and all the psychological aspects to it were second to none.<br/><br/>This movie comes at the highest recommend possible. A personal favorite of mine and one I have and will still watch over and over and over again."

A gripping tale of cat and mouse and back and forth between a killer and FBI agent is fantastically well executed and there's a constant overbearing tone of dread. With Foster & Hopkins, the 2 leafs there's amazing performances and quite frankly the frequent use of direct to camera address is enough to make the skin crawl, and is extremely unsetttling. Tense, creepy and a sound film all round, there's a lot on offer to a potential audience especially those interested in the likes of ""Prisoners"" which has a very similar structure/plot, I highly recommend"

","How can you review this film without first talking about the amazing Anthony Hopkins? He is absolutely magnificent. He perfectly conveys the charming sophistication of Hannibal Lecter. In fact, I think he was so good that he outshone Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) as the true antagonist of this film. This is no disrespect to Ted Levine who was great in his own right, but Anthony Hopkins was even better. Although I was very disappointed with Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford. He was very bland and nothing special compared to Harvey Keitel in Red Dragon and Laurence Fishburne in NBC's Hannibal. <br/><br/>Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/MNVquh"
"Hamez98","9","0","0","8 April 2016"," Unforgettable.
","This physiological thriller really does stick with you once you watch it. Every scene incorporates micro features to to play with your mind during and after the film. <br/><br/>One thing that makes this film one of the best out there is of course the story line, but personally the acting from Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter is on another level than most psychopathic characters in other films. The way he looks, talks and even positions himself all combine to a outstanding performance. However, I would have liked to see a bit more of Hannibal and see his character develop.<br/><br/>Jodie foster stars as Clarice and her relationship with Hannibal is a huge driving force behind the film and its intrigue. Clarice refuses to be a victim and her attitude shows equality at its finest.<br/><br/>Another Character that is unforgettable is buffalo Bill, played Ted Levine. He is a crazy killer and although not anywhere as near scary and cold blooded as Hannibal his methods still keep you up at night.<br/><br/>My only criticism of the film is it comes to an abrupt end with Buffalo Bill, However With Hannibal it can still play on your mind weeks after. This cold blooded killer will stay with you for a long time. Jonathan Demme has directed a masterpiece."

I had no idea at the time that I was watching what would be considered a classic film. <br/><br/>At that time the entire movie was new and fresh: this genius of a madman named Hannibal Lechter, this young FBI agent in training named Clarice Starling and this absolute freak making clothes out of women's skin dubbed Buffalo Bill. I was enthralled with these characters and the story. I was in disbelief at the gruesome nature of it yet the intelligence of it. After watching it again today, fully, for the first time I have an even greater appreciation for it."
"rockinghorsestudios","9","0","0","7 January 2016"," A brave but brilliant masterclass
","I thought it was about time I actually took the time to review, The Silence of the Lambs. What was already a very interesting and exciting picture was made even more so once I took the time to do some research into the story behind it. But first, from viewing the film itself, it is entirely dependent on the acting abilities of the main roles. Jodie Foster's great performance is only bettered by that of Anthony Hopkins in the role that cemented his place in Hollywood soon after he had all but given up on one. To give the performance that he does, in doing so creating one of the most memorable characters in cinema history, despite only sharing the screen with his co-star for no more than four scenes is without question a remarkable feat. <br/><br/>I didn't think much of the opening titles design, taking up most of the screen and defeating the object of having visuals behind them. And the film does have a relatively slow start until the two principal characters meet each other. This is a brave choice for a thriller but one that works. However, I go back to it - if it wasn't for the acting and chemistry of Hopkins and Foster then that slow start would have continued for a very long time. It is some time before any conventional ""action"" is to be found. <br/><br/>I felt the scene when Lecter disposes of the two policemen/security guards seemed ridiculous, cheap, macabre, poetic and brilliant all at once. The low angle victim's POV shot as Lecter bashes him with his own baton somehow looked majestic but also rather faked at the same time. But it works. <br/><br/>I have never been familiar with the work of Jonathan Demme before this picture but he makes some incredibly brave choices. The amount of close up POV shots took a lot of bottle with cast members even doubting him as he did it. But then when you analyse the psychology behind why he made those choices and he is immediately forgiven for the impact it has. Also, the way he chose to cut together the reveal that Clarice Starling is actually at a different location to Jack Crawford's men in the culmination of the third act was an editing masterclass. This is made even more fantastic when in the knowledge that Ted Tally did not write that to be a twist but they chose to make it so when in post. <br/><br/>Budgets being cut halfway through the screenplay being written, starring roles being turned down and casting nobody's favourite picks in the end, doubt over the director, the studio facing bankruptcy - there was so much leading towards this film never happening or flopping miserably; culminating in the film being made to wait behind Dances With Wolves for a release which spelled next to no hope at any Academy Awards recognition. <br/><br/>But then the film scoops every major prize at the Oscars. You just couldn't write it. The only reason this film doesn't have a 10/10 is that for all its bravery, there are one or two occasions when the shots don't quite have the desired effect and the opening is a little slow but, given its based on a novel, there wasn't much that could be done with that. <br/><br/>A genre defining masterpiece."

","This film defines the genre thriller with one of the most smartly written scripts and characters portrayed by an wonderful cast. Anthony Hopkins just add to his already star stunned status as one of the brilliant and well respected actors of the cinematic business. Jodie Foster gives her best performance of her career, a role that put her on the map as an actress to watch out for. Scott Glenn, who just came off of doing Hunt for Red October gives his best film performance in his career as well. Ted Levine, says a very memorable line in the film. Everyone does an excellent job acting. But what also stands out is the story and smart dialog that keeps you guessing and wanting more. You feel like you are in the middle of this case with Foster's character and you sense the danger when the moment of truth prevails. It is a film about trust, intelligence, and fear within your soul. The character, Hannibal Lector is considered one of the greatest villains of all time he too says many memorable lines. Hopkins and Lector would go on to two more films: Hannibal, and Red Dragon. But Silence of the Lambs is a superior film one worth watching. Now to grade this. Characters: A Acting: A+ Music: B Dialog: A+ Story: A+ Effects: A- Overall: A"

He is the only strong character in this movie. Therefore it gets an 8. I've always said a good horror is about the story and not the effects. This movie delivers just that.

The purpose or reasoning behind the direction's inclusion of the American Flag is that the American flags symbolizes freedom yet the movie is mainly about people who are in one way or another trapped. Hannibal being trapped in the facilities, buffalo bill trapped in a man's body yet wants to be a woman, and Clarisse trapped in her dreams hearing the screaming lambs. And at the end buffalo bill is freed from his body by dying, Hannibal is freed from his institutions and Clarisse should be freed from her dreams and able to sleep."

After watching this film in a college class, FILM 240, we discussed why the director made some of the decisions that he/she made. We discussed the recurring image of American flags; I think the director place the flags in there to create a constant reminder of the fight for freedom and justice in the United States. Because Buffalo Bill had been rejected so many times for a sex-change operation, he had desperately turned to kidnapping and skinning his victims. The fight for equality and justice is present throughout the entire movie, with Buffalo Bill wanting a new identity, Jack Crawford wanting take down Buffalo Bill, Clarice wanting to be treated like one of the guys and catch the culprit, and Hannibal wanting to get out of prison."

","The thing with comparing this larger than life serial killer movie, to like Seven or Rampage, they of course come off way much more realistic. As for the serial killers, they're way over the top, as in terms of their characters and how they kill. SOTL is a different kind of serial killer movie experience, with three mains who deliver top floor performances, none than more than Hopkins of course as Dr Hannibal Lector, where he's at his most brilliantly chilling in this pic. When seeing the end of Red Dragon, it's hard to believe that was just prefore to the start of Hannibal's presence here, as Hopkins was much more effective and scary. There are nasty moments in this film, where a lot of people couldn't get over the fact of it's M 15+ rating which was very questioning. Some content will indeed disturb people, but that's one of the movie's intentions, where for some sickies, they're are addictive pleasures. The movie's a great re watch and will still manage to disturb and rivet you, if not seeing for years. Truly dedicated, 24/7 Agent Clarice Starling, is played with so much professionalism, no one can do the role better than Foster, yet too, I really liked the under appreciated Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford. Glenn is an actor who always delivers, no matter the role. Honestly I'd have to say, he's almost on par with Foster. Of course the other role of the other sickopath, Buffalo Bill is played by great character actor, Levine. Foster implores Hopkin's genius to help her track down this very bad boy, a transsexual sewer, who kidnaps and skins his victims, the latest one is from a high ranking family, and of course, Hoping making a deal, does the inevitable: he escapes, making way for a following of course. The movie is really over the top, but it's good, and an addictive watch with some truly terrifying, scary quality moments, in a fantastic script, Foster's first visit to Hopkins dungeon cell is one scene, I never got out of my head. The movie pulls some story tricks I liked too. The film is a well oiled machine, where also I must praise another great character, Heald, as the smarmy Lector hating, Dr Chilton, who has no idea what's in store for him. Great fittingly, unnerving music scores adds greatly to this unsettling film, a must see, for movie buffs."

","Man, that was scary. I hadn't been so scared with a movie in quite a long time, maybe since Shutter Island. This movie has everything a good thriller needs, from the long, slow shots that hide more than what they show, to the creepy music and creepy scenarios. The mysterious dialogues in which the actors are watching at the camera are particularly good, and that sense that Hannibal Lecter is actually talking to you is difficult to forget. And Anthony Hopkins' character didn't get a well-deserved place in popular culture and Haloween costumes for nothing: it is by far the best of this movie. From his amazing way of speaking, to his lines, going through all the security paraphernalia around him (which undoubtedly help to create the feeling his quite a dangerous man), everything shouts ""You're gonna have nightmares with this"". Not to forget the quite memorable scene of his escape, one of the highest peaks of the movie.<br/><br/>Buffalo Bill's character is also pretty damn good, and every time a scene involves him you just want the scene to end before anything bad happens (which, given the character's unstable personality, might happen at any time). The final persecution scene is heart-stopping, and is way too long for any viewer's sanity (specially the last tiny bit with night Vision glasses).<br/><br/>And Jodie Foster? Yes, she is not bad. I specially like her West Virginia accent. And the fact that she is a young woman talking to an old, crazy, creepy serial killer contributes something to the movie that could never be present in Red Dragon, for example."

"jeffcartwright","7","0","0","17 July 2014"," A Classic
","The extent of my viewing of the horror/scary film genre consists of Halloween and the Scream Series. I admit it I scare too easily. The 1990 critical and commercial success Silence of the Lambs was never a film I even considered viewing. However, after sweeping the top categories at the 1991 Academy Award (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor and Actress) I admit I had to reevaluate. Still an actual viewing of the film did not occur until after 2000. Yes, I was scared, and slightly horrified, yet completely captivated by the superior filmmaking. This film is a tour de force. Anthony Hopkins embodies the character of Hannibal Lecter to perfection, each syllable spoken with intent and hidden meanings. A monster, yes, but a brilliant one. In later films his Hannibal becomes almost a cartoon of the original, but in the beginning this man could send chills up and down your spine. Jodie Foster finds the perfect balance of innocence and steel determination trying to impress her superiors, but also following her gut instinct. Throughout you can feel her struggle to be accepted is what motivates her though never spoken it is apparent through her true skill as an actress. There are no dull moments this film keeps moving, not letting the viewer become restless and feel ahead of the story. There are displays of horror, blood, violence and true moments of tension, but they are not included for shock value, but integral to the mood the film creates. Every viewing I find something new to be intrigued by, whether it be a camera angle or a supporting player I hadn't paid much attention to in the past. This is a true classic."

","This is a pretty good movie that should be in everyone's collection. Hopkins is at his peak here and really plays a bad guy that you'd like to hang out with, but maybe take a rain check on the dinner. The combination of the music, acting and atmosphere makes for a movie that I myself have watched at least 10 times. The scene where he is locking the straight jacket almost made me believe he was trapped for good. Each time I watch it I get the same chills in my spine when he so coolly slices into that guys brain. it would have been nice if the movie would have stuck to the book a little more, but I thought that was not really a major issue."

","The media has a way of historical revisionism. They glorify past movies or music as if it was so legendary and sacred. As if it is beyond what we have today. But 10 or 20 years from now, they will do the same thing with what we have today.<br/><br/>That is what happened with The Silence of the Lambs. It is good, but it isn't a perfect movie. There were some major plot holes. There were also parts that would be far better done by today's filming techniques. A plot hole is how Hannibal Lecter escapes... he was a life sentence prisoner. <br/><br/>Anyone who has ever been to jail or prison knows, there is no escape. Because you're in a cage within a cage within a cage within a cage within a cage. and even when you are moving to a new cage, you are foot cuffed and handcuffed to a chain that is tied to like 15 other prisoners. All jails and prisons now a days also have drop off points, where giant cement gates close behind the car, as big as the wailing wall, before they let you out of the cop car. Jail is big business for the government.<br/><br/>Also, he has some stupid way of escaping from the building that the cell was in. Totally unbelievable. The ending ""dilemma"" between the protagonist and antagonist is very poorly done by today's film standards. Maybe they didn't have access to great technology and programs, but still it could have been better done. The camera view was supposed to be 1st person at one point, but it could have been more realistic to how a person would be acting in such a situation... far more.<br/><br/>Worth watching, and good. but remember how the media tries to sell it's past to us."

","I'm definitely a fan of horror films and films of most types and I certainly love movies such as the Shining and I thought that this film would greatly entertain me as Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal is like the Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence. <br/><br/>I must say the film is definitely very good, but I cannot quite understand why its regarded as so good. It definitely was a good mystery film and the acting by Anthony Hopkins was breathtaking and it pretty much kept the whole movie going nicely. Judie Foster was also brilliant in this film and these two are the stand outs. <br/><br/>However, what I like about this film is that there are two completely different villains in the film and of course Hannibal stands out! <br/><br/>The score by Howard Shore is great, as usual and the cinematography and special effects are great for a 1991 film. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** The scene where Hannibal is served dinner in his cell and he kills the two officers was absolutely awesome and to me, that was the moment of the movie. When we see the ""dying"" police officer inside the ambulance and he stands up and removes his face and it turns out to be Hannibal, that was the other standout of the film. <br/><br/>The end of the film with Hannibal Lector calling Clarice and saying that he has an old friend to catch up with, whilst following Dr Chilton was a great and suspenseful ending to the film as the mainly focused villain throughout the movie was Buffalo Bill. This ending pretty much reminded us that Hannibal was also a bad guy. <br/><br/>***END OF SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I, however wish that instead of Buffalo Bill being the main villain, it was Hannibal as the film would've been more entertaining and suspenseful that way.<br/><br/>Overall, I certainly enjoyed the film but cannot understand why this film is so highly praised and has won 5 Oscars."

Good direction (except a few cheap shots), good actors, captivating atmosphere.<br/><br/>What I didn't like, mainly, is that it seems the script is kind of rushed, especially at the end: I felt that the screenplay was unfolding too fast, resulting in a few easinesses. The movie really could have used an extra 30 minutes to properly resolve the plot.<br/><br/>Another thing, not a real flaw actually, but I thought Lecter's character was more interesting than Gumb's, supposedly the main target. You get the feeling that the movie should've centered around Lecter instead of Gumb."

","It has been a quite long time to watch a surprisingly nice and scary thriller film like this. There is no ghost, no ear-splitting sound, but horror comes calmly. Power of story and characters. <br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs numbed me with its notorious(?) thrilling characters and scenes. Now I understand why this movie is so much famous and loved. It deserves to be called a masterpiece of thriller. I guess it will be fun to catch some homage for The Silence of the Lambs in later films. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins was just Dr. Lecter himself. His existence was very irresistible. Buffalo Bill was also great, but it is well described in the film that he is just a cocoon compared to the moth, Dr. Lecter. The actors play their characters wonderfully. The most shocking thing about the film is that Anthony Hopkins was in the film only for 15 minutes, in total. He is brilliant. <br/><br/>I hope I would have a chance to watch more films like this in 2012."
"Kubris","9","0","0","22 January 2012"," The nature of the beast
","IMDb Top 250: 26<br/><br/>Some films grab you in the first scene. Some grab you later on, and well some films don't grab you at all. The Silence of the Lambs gets your attention before you sit don to see it. It grabs you before you even think about seeing it. That's because the title alone is interesting: poetic, graceful, yet sinister. So you look it up, and the premise is more... dangerous... than the title even: An FBI trainee confides in an incarcerated, cannibalistic murderer to catch another serial killer who skins women. Wow. That's heavy stuff- now how does it relate to lambs? And from there you're hooked. Some books don't make good film material. The Silence of the Lambs made a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It's no secret- the film is extraordinary. One of only 3 films to win all the 'major' Oscars (and personally it's the best of them), 'Silence' practically started the modern dark-crime sub genre. From Seven to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it can all be traced back to this, and with good reason. Based on excellent source material, which I finished yesterday and will draw on later, The Silence of the Lambs has been imitated, parodied and drawn from an impossible amount of times, but the original still stands on its own.<br/><br/>I've already mentioned the exquisite plot, a great mystery, or thriller, or horror, or however you define it. A huge success of the film is its atmosphere, a very dark, draining world. This is achieved through dark colours, small sets, and a haunting score by Howard Shore that is equally influential, even in his own later work like Seven. It never takes the credit, but constantly accompanies the action.<br/><br/>The Academy will tell you how excellent the characters are. At the forefront are the two winners, Clarice and Lecter. I believe Clarice to be arguably the greatest female heroine ever. She is strong and determined, work-oriented in her male dominated world. But at the same time she can show vulnerability and fear. It's amazing. I'm glad the sub-subplot of her mild romance was removed. Hannibal Lecter. There's a name you won't forget, nor a face you'll forget. It's all been said before: Anthony Hopkins delivered one of the most legendary performances in cinema history as the charming and terrifying doctor. His facial expressions, his voice, his choice of words, even his posture. A perfect example of quality over quantity. The scenes these two share are very intense, with closeups. Lots of closeups.<br/><br/>There's three other characters worth mentioning: Crawford, Starling's mentor, is the likable and work focused head of the Buffalo Bill case. While he suffered the most loss in transfer from book to screen, as well as the whole plot of his wife being removed, he is still likable, due to an honest performance. On the other hand, Chilton, the asylum doctor, is an absolute slimeball. He's a great character, but something about the portrayal is off. Lastly, and the most important one, Buffalo Bill, Jame Gumb. He is the single most terrifying, creepiest villain in fiction. He was scary in the book and in the film he'll make your stomach churn. The voice and look, and unbelievably freaky, scary, disturbing dance mark a CRIMINALLY underrated performance by Ted Levine, who I cannot see in any other role now. He IS Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>The first time I saw the film, one key thing I remember is the patience the film exhibits. Coarse language is used only when necessary, but more importantly is how violence and gore is treated. The book wasn't a gorefest, but there were ample opportunities for shock violence, like the picture of the nurse or the autopsy room. For the most part, the visual is held back, until that one sequence, and you'll know what I mean, when everything is gruesomely put on the table, and into your mind is burned several terrible images. Great films have patience, and this is a great film.<br/><br/>I usually don't read source material, but I had to read this one. I'm not used to it, so I don't know how much films usually cut out from their books. But 'Silence' is very true to the core of the novel. The screenplay cuts out what you might expect: character development and history, as well as Bella, Klaus, the media and Southern angles, and unfortunately (for me) Barney and Bill's story. The film is short, just under 2 hours, but even with these shortcuts maintains the slow pace of the book. However the adaptation is very faithful to the book, and rises above in some places.<br/><br/>Some scenes are handled much better with visuals. Lecter's cell is much better with glass instead of bars and nylon mesh (?), and the key sequence in Tennessee is spectacular, with the violence. And the ambulance, let to the imagination in the book, leaves viewers is absolute terror.<br/><br/>Bookended by a great opening and closing, The Silence of the Lambs marks a milestone in film. It is an influential modern classic with brain and brawn, amazing performances and characters, and a smart plot. It's an icon of the genre, and a must see. 9.4/10"

","this is something else. this character Hannibal fits right in there with Freddy Krueger, Michael myers, and Jason Voorhees. it was a amazing film. there is a lot of suspense and relationships going on in here. the plot is a FBI trainee named Clarice is searching for a killer named buffalo bill. he captured a senators daughter and Clarice goes to an institution of the criminally insane to see Hannibal lector. he is a smart man that might have relations with buffalo bill. Hannibal only gets about 16 minutes of screen time and most of those 16 minutes were with Clarice. during there interviews Clarice tells lector her past her dark past that she has kept secret. this may sound strange but i think that her and Hannibal have some sort of relationship. even though Hannibal is gay, they have a sort of connection. and i think Clarice feels secure with lector because Hannibal will listen to her. this is a different film but it was very good and Anthony Hopkins who played Hannibal defidently deserved the Oscar he got for that film. so did Jodie foster for her role as Clarice and she got one as well. pertaining to this film. see it"
"ModKuraika","9","0","0","1 January 2011"," Psychologically thrilling until you've fallen from your chair.
","The Silence of the Lambs is a film directed by Jonathan Demme, adapted from the Thomas Harris novel of the same name. It currently stands (at the time of this review) as my favorite film of all time.<br/><br/>The plot follows FBI agent in-training Clarice Starling, who is called in by Jack Crawford to get some inside collective information on the mind of a murderer by imprisoned, former psychiatrist Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. Starling uses Hannibal's intellect to help track down the serial killer dubbed ""Buffalo Bill"".<br/><br/>Starling is ambitious and keen, albeit somewhat naive. Lecter (my favorite film villain of all time) is intellectual, courteous, and classy. The more he and Starling interact, the more he learns about her, and affects her mind, all the while helping her figure out the identity of Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>Howard Shore delivers a chilling score that blends quite nicely with the theme and tone of the performances and pacing, similar to his great score in The Fly (1986).<br/><br/>The film offers a brutally realistic aspect of the mindset of particular murderers. It's frightening, and Anthony Hopkins and Ted Lavine's performances in particular add a huge weight to the presentation. <br/><br/>My favorite scene in the film is when Starling tells Lecter the story about the ranch and her lamb, explaining the title of the movie. As the scene progresses, the camera switches back and forth between the two, getting closer to Lecter's grim complexion every time it switched back to him. The scene represents Lecter's slow but deep integration into Starling's mind as he reads her further as she continues to talk.<br/><br/>The climax is exciting and throws you for a complete loop. At the end of it all you just feel almost out of breath with widened eyes, no explosion required. Lecter can be antagonizing when he wants to be, vague, teasing, and observational. He does so much with such a limited amount of space, and is like a ghost when he escapes his confinement at last.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a character study, and a great one at that."

","In Silence of the Lambs, just like Manhunter's plot (also based on a Thomas Harris novel) an FBI agent seeks help from the notorious serial killer Hannibal Lector to capture a psychopathic killer holding a girl captive.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Demme's 1991 award winner was a smash hit that almost catapulted Hopkins into typecast hell. Ted Tally screenplay is excellent and the dialogue superb, however, surprisingly both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins picked up best actor roles for their melodramatic performances.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Hopkins commands every scene he's in but really isn't that creepy. Unexplainably, Ted Levine was not nominated for his role as Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb, which is simply psychotic and chilling. Scott Glenn given an understated performance and the supporting cast are familiar faces which include Anthony Heald as Dr. Frederick Chilton and Charles Napier. There's walk-ons by Roger Corman, George A. Romero and singer Chris Isaak! <br/><br/>Demme won best picture for this solid thriller, the scenes lighting and sets are fantastic, including Lectors cell, temporary holding and Bill's House. The locations are distinct and some credit must go to Tak Fujimoto's photography for this. The final reel is amazing thanks to Craig McKay's slick editing coupled with tension of Howard Shore's score.<br/><br/>To Silence's credit it sets the foundation for Hannibal and Red Dragon. It is indeed a solid crime yarn but is overrated and lacks the sophistication of it's sequel and prequel."

","First of all, i couldn't feel the success at the end, The hero manages to win only because the villain made a mistake. And we don't know who the victim is you can't feel so sorry for a person you don't know. They did try to present her a bit that's true.<br/><br/>And i think a person's natural reaction in that situation at the end is to try to remain as silent as possible and listen to every sound. Instead she was making lots of noise moving around and breathing heavy being scared out of her mind. Then we see her confident receiving her medal because she was lucky. Didn't really look like she deserved it.<br/><br/>Also, i wasn't really be able to follow how the problem was solved by her, that might just be my fault, but again it stopped me from savoring the success at the end.<br/><br/>Another thing is that the characters seemed too cold, The female hero was totally unaproachable, that doesn't make a very nice character to care about. Hannibal was pretty great but then he just started doing irrational things and totally ruined himself as a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>And at the end he goes to kill his prison guard. What was that for ? He didn't seem like a bad character. Just to make an old cannibals joke ?<br/><br/>And what the hell was all that sweat on her at the beginning ? it was cold outside, how much would a girl have to run to get like that ?

Some have criticized her for being stiff in that movie, but I always saw it as pure honesty. She proved herself over and over again with many roles where 'truth"" was the operative word.

","Rarely ever do i praise a movie, the last movie that i saw which i said i enjoyed was a long time ago , it May of been the 1966 movie Batman, now that comment may seem out of place in a review for a movie such as The Silence of The Lambs, but I'll explain the link, both Batman and The Silence Of the Lambs both do exactly what they should do, they entertain, they grip you, they are well created, and they are molded perfectly.<br/><br/>The Silence Of The Lamb's strongest points do not lie in the direction, which is fantastic, they also don't lie in the deceptively obvious yet clever storyline, they don't even lie in the interesting score or special effects, no, the strongest aspects of this movie are Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins, and Clarice Starling , played by Jodie Foster. In this movie, these two amazing actors grip you, they pull you in, and they put you in the movie. Jodie Foster's confident yet fragile character ""Clarice"" is easily believable and very convincing, to the point were you feel as if she is a real person living through this torment, and she certainly deserves the Oscar she gets in return. And Anthony Hopkins once again stuns and amazes audiences in his role, and deserves every little part of his Oscar as well.<br/><br/>Now I've always been a great fan of Anthony Hopkins, from his performance in The Elephant Man to his performance in red Dragon which uplifted an otherwise fairly weak movie. And this is surely his finest hour, every single word and action in this movie is sinister, frightening and chilling, everything a perfect villain should be. His famous pronunciation of ""Clarice"" will go down in media history, and his first appearance in the jail cell will be engraved into the mind of every person who see's it for ever. His stance, his glare and his delightfully charming manner all add to this character, and Anthony's performance. He is so convincing in this role that by the end of the movie you actually question his existence yourself, and this is also helped by the brilliantly wrote and presented storyline, which relates this psychotic character to a real life background and real life events. Even though Hannibal isn't the main character in this film, or even the main villain, he certainly steals the show, and the Oscar he earnt was for the shortest ever award-winning performance in film history, spending only about 20 minutes on screen in total, but even this is enough for Anthony Hopkins to portray every aspect of his character.<br/><br/>And as previously mentioned, Jodie Foster's Clarice is also a fascinating performance. Getting such a small actress to take on such a big confident role, and to do it convincingly , was a big risk, but it pays off. Jodie Foster's performance is truly amazing, throughout she promotes a feeling on un-ease and difficulty, however she also gets you rooting behind her, as she ventures ever deeper into the mystery. As i previously said, there are spoilers in the review, and this is one of them, in one of the final scenes were Clarice is chasing down the Maniac and has entered his house and is now trapped in the dark is one of the most 'Edge-of-my-seat' scenes I've ever scene. The brilliant first person views and wonderful change in mood make this scene memorable and one of the movie's real strongest moments, almost creating the traumatized and lost women theme which would go on to back up other movies. And this movie just kept going, which was a good thing, because i generally tend to rate a movie not only on film aspects, but also on how interested it kept me, and this one kept me going till the end.<br/><br/>But as i mentioned, especially in the final scene, the direction of the movie is classic. The shots are often basic yet stimulating, yet occasionally the director uses his creativity and goes all out like a blockbuster should, the camera angles are near perfect and well taken care of throughout, promoting a sense of being in the film, yet not actually experiencing the danger's the characters are facing, such as many of Spielberg's movies.<br/><br/>I have to cut this review short due to the word limit, but i can finally say, go see this movie, it's not Entirely perfect, and that's why it misses out on a 10, it would earn 5 Stars but it can take a while to get going and can often confuse even the most intelligent viewer, which is what stops it from achieving a perfect score, but other that those, it's just too difficult to criticize this film. It deserved all of it's awards and should be seen by everyone, now."

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a film that needs no introduction. After all, who isn't familiar with Hannibal Lecter, chosen by the AFI as the top movie villain of all time? Needless to say, this is a thriller that touched a chord with movie-goers everywhere and continues to do so today.<br/><br/>One of the film's strong points is the casting. Obviously, Anthony Hopkins as Lecter was an inspired choice, but the thing that makes it even more special is the interplay with Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. Deservedly, both of their performances resulted in Oscar wins. The supporting cast is solid too, though unremarkable, except for Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>One of the film's other Oscar wins went to Ted Tally for his screenplay adapted (pretty faithfully) from Thomas Harris' best-selling novel. It's a compelling story and the female 'hero' makes it unique (or at least it was unique before countless copycats tried and failed with the same formula). It also features not one, but two, psychologically fascinating psychopaths.<br/><br/>Director Jonathon Demme won an Oscar for his efforts but I'm not especially crazy about the film's look. There are indeed a few memorable images but, generally, the whole visual presentation seems a little B-movie-ish to me. Howard Shore's score is mostly average as well though I suppose that it does have its moments.<br/><br/>However, what I perceive as a slight deficiency in terms of style is more than made up for in substance. Forget the scores of imitators that have followed (including the sequels), this is the real deal."
"AshCaton","8","0","0","5 December 2008"," Wonderfully Chilling
","Anthony Hopkins gives the performance of his career in this suspenseful thriller as the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter. It is, in a manner of speaking, Hopkins' film, a character study on his behalf. Any fraction of second with him on screen is electrifying. His manipulation, deception and fleeting seconds of violence are all so brutally portrayed; Hopkins' succeeds in creating what surely must be one of Cinema's finest villains. Jodie Foster does her 'I'm a bit damaged' thing and personally, I don't think this is one of her best performances, perhaps because she is so thoroughly upstaged throughout. Ted Levine manages to shine as the woman-skinning serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill. There are sequences where the script verges on being slightly hammy, but its raw impact and consistent tension always gets the better of it. What's so brilliant about this film is it's claustrophobia. The sense that, even from behind bars (or glass, as the case may be) Lecter manages to have people wrapped around his fingers, is far more terrifying than if you gave him a knife and fork and stuck an apple in your mouth. You don't quite get the feeling that Starling is anywhere close to being a match for Lecter, and perhaps if she had given him just a bit more of a run for his money, it could have been slightly more exciting. Then again, perhaps the most numbing thing about Silence of the Lambs is how easy it is for a monster to have his way with the world."

Silence of the Lambs really takes over where Vertigo finishes. They are two very similar movie (yes, I said similar). You have a man who has gone insane, with a mysterious past and nothing left to lose. This man manipulates a woman into relaying many of her secrets, and ultimately allowing him so far into her mind that he starts to change her. The relationship between Hannibal Lector and Clarice is very similar to the relationship between Vertigo's two protagonist( to me anyway). The one big difference between the two is the violent nature of the plot, and the speed at which Lamb's is delivered. This is not necessarily a bad thing for either movie. Lamb just takes a more 90s spin on a classic genre and idea. It is, in my mind, the best fusion of horror and psychological thrillers that has been made so far. I would definitely recommend people seeing it, and even buying it, if they like it of course. And I would also recommend seeing the sequel Hannibal."

","For some strange reason, human beings have always enjoyed being afraid. Scream out loud, hold your partners hand or just cover your eyes and look through the gaps. This is certainly not a modern trend, it has been around since the days kids gather around the fire to hear the eldest of the tribe tell his stories of werewolves or Wendigo. Later, there was the printing press and books such as Dracula or Frankenstein appeared. But since the 20th century, humans have found another way to portrait our darkest corners inside our minds.<br/><br/>A reason for this nature is simple. We like to read or watch people in scary situations, but still knowing that we, as audience are kept safe from the evils portrayed.<br/><br/>If we are to name one character that on the late years has managed to gain a position on popular culture, it has to be Anthony Hopkins' Academy Award winning portrayal of Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.<br/><br/>Along with its counterpart, FBI trainee agent, Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, these two characters are placed as #1 villain and #5 hero of all time by the American Film Institution. Also to add, that this movie is one of the only three movies to have won the five major Academy Awards for Best Actor in Leading Role, Best Actress in Leading Role, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Jonathan Demme and is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harrison. It deals mainly on this two characters, and how the young agent interacts, relates and tries to understand the once psychiatrist and now psychopath, in order to find and capture another psychopath by the nickname of ""Buffalo Bill"".<br/><br/>Previously to their encounters, Starling's superiors warn her to beware of the subject and not to reveal any personal information about her, information which she needs to share in order to get clues about the whereabouts and identity of Buffalo Bill. <br/><br/>The movie proved to be a success and has given several sequels and prequels in order to explode the license. To me, the movie's success and position on almost any list of the best movies, is due not only to the great performances, but its also achieved by its directing. Jonathan Demme has created a style of his own, this can be observed on the changes from third person to first person and back again, and the many first shots of faces that reveal to us the reactions of the characters.<br/><br/>This is a movie I would like to recommend to anyone interest in cinema, though it has some scenes not proper to the young audience."

Hannibal is played with chilling air of menace by Hopkins, giving the feeling that if the glass between you and him ever came down, you'd survive about thirty seconds. And yet, as a previous reviewer stated, he makes Lecter seem somehow human at the same time. Foster makes the role of Clarice totally her own, and what her so much more convincing for some reason, was giving her dark hair. A special mention must also go to Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a complete fruitcake for most of the movie but when Clarice calls to his house appears almost completely normal. Wouldn't think he was that bloke from ""Monk"" would you? Although I have not yet seen Red Dragon, of the Lecter films I have seen, this is definitely the best."

Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) a rising FBI agent has to capture this man. She consults with Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) (a former serial killer and psychiatrist currently in jail) to find out who Buffalo Bill is and to try understand the psychology of his mind.<br/><br/>The most memorable moments in this movie are the few scenes between Clarice and Hannibal.

As Clarice divulges her deepest secrets about her life to Hannibal he gives her information on Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>Although their performances are equally good. Hannibal will probably be the most remembered for the depth in his character and the way he abruptly changes with ease from a sophisticated, well-spoken psychiatrist to a deadly man-eater.<br/><br/>This is one of only three films that has won the five most coveted Oscars (best movie, best director, best actor, best actress, best screenplay) and it is well deserving of them.<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs is a movie that is over 15 years old and still well remembered by many.

","The brilliance of this novel/film truly lies in simplicity. Simplicity in deflecting. The plot itself is actually very simple: The FBI is on the hunt for the latest serial Killer Buffalo Bill and sends a trainee to gather information from the most valuable prisoner the Bureau possesses-Dr Lecter. Up until this point pretty simple, but this is the point where the magic begins, because from now on, although incarcerated, the cannibal Lecter, will orchestrate the whole show to suit his purpose - escaping, but also indulging in a deadly sharp mind-game with Clarice. I was watching the movie again some days ago, and somebody raised the question: how did Lecter get Dr. Chilton's pen, in his cell, while he was in a straight jacket? The brilliance lay in the fact that they never show us. It remains a mystery. Maybe a hint lay in the horrific image of the hanged angel, skinned policeman. Why do that, if not to distract from the simple yet cunning escape plan? After multiple viewings you will notice that Lecter runs the whole show, and Clarice, like all others involved are just subjects on Dr. Lecter's couch, but watching this movie 15 years later, knowing the outcome and every little trick, one must marvel at it's brilliance and style in using smoke and mirrors."

Anthony Hopkins seemed to give Hannibal parts of his own personality. Jodie Foster did an A+ job, both acting and making himself seem like the country, Virginia girl that Clarice was. I was enthralled by her accent, sometimes slipping, but usually crisp and precise.<br/><br/>The directing, though a tad overrated, was superb, as an understatement. The acting of Ted Levine was the most interesting of them all. His voice and character played along almost seamlessly with the progression of the film. Never before have I been so convinced that an actor had, himself, lost his sanity, along with the character he was playing. The lotion scene made me laugh, while making me want to claw my eyes out. How he could be so calm, talking ""Baby-talk"" to his dog, and at the same time have to listen to a woman screaming for him to let her go, is beyond my sense of understanding. I commend them all on a job well, well done.<br/><br/>Though, I'm not sure how old you should be when you first watch this, I was 13 and enjoyed it immensely.

The film, for me, ticks every box a film could. The acting is superb and completely well deserved of the praise the leading roles received. The mystery and enigma of the directing, especially when we are pelted with suspense knowing that she is in the notorious Buffalo Bill's house and the vulnerable Clarice has no idea. The wonderful use of the subjective shot making you quiver with fear in the eyes of Clarice and then feel somewhat disturbed in the eyes of the killer. The story unravels wonderfully and the relationship expressed between Lecter and Starling is breathtaking. I just wish I was a couple of years older went the film came out to watch it on the big screen. If I had however, I may have never been able to sleep again. My only disappointment is that the great Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role, if she had, Hannible would have been a good tribute rather than a struggling sequel. My only small gripe is when Clarice keeps calling Lecter's name over the phone over and over again right at the end. How long does it take to realise someone has left the phone?

What Crawford expects is Starling to contact brilliant psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), imprisoned for life and to have him help in the case as a profound expert in psychopatic behaviors and profiles (he is in jail for being a perfect example of both).

","If The Silence of the Lambs had been about Clarice chasing after Buffalo Bill, the movie would have been boring, and would have gone on a list filled with every other average thriller ever made. If The Silence of the Lambs had simply been about Clarice and Hannibal, we would've been deprived one of the most thrilling sequences ever put to film. All three of the characters- Clarice, Hannibal, and Buffalo Bill- are essential to why this movie is so good.<br/><br/>The movie works effectively as a thriller in Clarice's chase of Buffalo Bill, there's no doubt about that. But the added dynamic of Hannibal probing into Clarice's psyche makes it so much better. When Clarice (Jodie Foster) is sent to Hannibal Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) cell to learn from him and get information on the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), she is told not to give Dr. Lecter any personal information. He is a former psychiatrist who ate his victims, and he can deduce volumes about a person just by looking at her. Clarice, in an attempt to gain his trust, does give him personal information. I wouldn't call this a mistake, even though she went against her supervisor's advice, because she does gain his trust, and in the process, we learn more about Lecter and Clarice than we could've otherwise.<br/><br/>A plot summary would have you believe that the story of this movie is Clarice's search for Buffalo Bill through Lecter, but the real story lies in how Lecter reveals information about Bill to Clarice and what we learn about the two of them in the process. A lesser movie would have depended on action and violence to tell this story- and make no mistake, there is definitely violence in this movie. But the brilliance of The Silence of the Lambs is that it depends on character to tell its story.<br/><br/>And thank God for Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins being in it to make those characters. Jodie Foster plays a woman in a man's world, and she conveys the awkwardness and defiant streak that this brings out in her. There are moments where she plays the sycophant to get what she needs from the men around her, and others where she takes charge and we can hear the self-consciousness in her voice. Hopkins plays a creature that also happens to be human. He plays Lecter creepily, of course, and he pulls that aspect off quite well; but there is more to Lecter than just being creepy- he is also brilliant, and he has desires just like any other human being. Hopkins makes this noticeable. Ted Levine has less of a chance to show his chops, but what we do see of him is compelling and unsettling- he makes a wonderful villain.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite movies, now that I've finally seen it. It deserves it's place as one of the top movies of all time because it exceeds all expectations of what it's kind of movie should be, and in the process it surpasses great movies of more dependable genres."

","The Silence of the Lambs/1991/****<br/><br/>Main Stars: Anthony Hopkins Jodie Foster Ted Levine<br/><br/>Who would have thought such a peculiar story would have won five Oscars? Well, pretty much every one. There are so many Academy Award Winning films that are very unique including this one. It won five academy awards being BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST ACTOR, BEST ACTRESS, and BEST SCREENPLAY. I think that the BEST SCREENPLAY academy award is the most important mainly because the screenplay is what makes the film. The movie itself involving acting and directing could be crappy but yet if the screenplay itself is good, than the movie would still be good. That's my opinion and you have yours but yet many people agree with what I say (about the movies I mean). Examples of bad acting (somewhat) and directing (somewhat) films would be the original Star Wars films that had pretty bad acting (not counting the Emperor) from quite a few actors but yet the screenplay was adequate. So all the originals were average to good. But yet Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was excellent! The acting wasn't bad at all (not counting Hayden Christensen) and the special effects and script were great! But not all films are that way too bad. Anyhoo, The Silence of the Lambs would be considered excellent and definitely deserved the Oscars it received. And this film definitely deserves to be on ECLASSICS. ""Why was this film so excellent?"" People ask me. ""Because of the wonderful story by the author named Thomas Harris who wrote the book and the screenwriter named Ted Tally that transformed it into a movie."" ""Oh"" This is an all-around film to me because it has a wonderful story, screenplay great acting especially by Anthony Hopkins, great directing, and great music! You see the story is mainly about two psychopathic killers (Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), and Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). Hannibal Lector (as you all should know) is an intelligent cannibal. He enjoys beating people and BITING people to death but yet speaks rather calmly when talking to FBI agent Clarice Starling. The brilliant Lector has to tell her about another psychopathic killer who skins his victims named Jame Gumb or Buffalo Bill (his nickname). He's one deranged man. Not only does he skin his victims but he also shoves a bug cocoon down each of his victims' throats. But at least he doesn't eat people like a cannibal or Hannibal Lector. One good scene was when the FBI agents actually find out that Lector has killed two cops by releasing the hand0cuffs from his hands and beating them both, biting, etc. When the cops run to the door that leads to the enormous room with Lector's cell, you see a shadow on the door that's shaped like an angel. When they go in, one of them identifies the shadow being a person and the cop goes ""O dear God"". The camera instantaneously cuts to the scene with the cop. He is hung on the cell like an angel with a light pointed to his back to make him look glowing and the music goes crazy being so melodramatic, it gave me the chills. It was expected though. The gimmicky DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!! It was a freaky scene but a well-done scene the same. This movie was filled with great scenes including the end when he says he's going to eat an FBI agent (Jack Crawford played by Scott Glen) for supper that evening. Great ending, great! Then there are the sequels to this which weren't that good because they seem to be exactly the same as their predecessor just like almost all sequels are. Movie directed by Jonathan Demme."

Jodie Foster is impressively convincing as Agent Clarice Starling, and Anthony Hopkins' Academy Award was well-deserved.  Anthony Hopkins does not PLAY Hannibal Lector, he IS Hannibal Lector.  The first time we see him, the camera slowly moves past the jail cells of other criminals and when Clarice arrives at Hannibal's cell, he is standing there smiling, as if he was waiting for her.  It is not his one-liners that make him memorable (""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti"" and ""Tell me, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming"") but rather it is the way his eyes stare at Clarice.  He is both gripping and scary at the same time.  And when we see him wearing a straight jacket, muzzled like an animal, he is truly terrifying.  The only regrettable thing about this movie is that Hannibal Lector did not get more screen time (he appears in less than 1/3 of the movie).

She was great at the part of a strong female antagonist. Ted Levine's performance is often underestimated when reviewing the film. He was truly disturbing as Buffalo Bill (not Bob as others have named him). Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin was the most surprising as although she had little screen time, she played more than just a screaming victim, there was a psychology to it. Anthony Heald was great as Dr. Chilton, as you really grew to hate the man. Of course, the discussion of The Silence of the Lambs is not complete without mentioning the performance of Anthony Hopkins. Words can not give justice to just how brilliant his performance is. I have seen quite a few movies in my time, and I don't think we will ever see a performance that brilliant ever again.<br/><br/>All in all, it is one of the best movies of all times. The movie alone is great, enhanced my the masterful performances. Truly a trendsetter and a great one."

","From beginning to end, Silence of the Lambs is chilling, creepy and in general a fantastic film. Jodie Foster is outstanding in the roll of Clarice Starling, the ""woman in a man world"" and where do I start with Anthony Hopkins. He may be the only actor alive who can make your feel sympathy and disgust at the same character, at the same time. There are times that you really do feel that Hannibal is a nice guy, before you remember exactly what he has done. I think Jack Crawford's line sums it up ""Never, ever forget what he is. The dungeon scenes are among the greatest in film history. I urge anyone who has not seen this film to get hold of a copy. It is, without doubt, a true masterpiece of film."

","A Must-see! And yet this is a movie, about which I read, talked with, listened from people for about a decade before I actually watched it. Actually, I read so much about this movie, searched so many different websites that I was a bit afraid that the movie won't be able to live up to the mental picture I've had of it. And yet, when finally I watched it, I was overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Now, don't ask me who did the maximum justice to his/her role in the movie: Dr. Lecter, Clarice or Buffalo Bill, simply for the reason that I cannot decide. Many would perhaps find my view that Bill was as brilliant as Dr. Lecter or Clarice odd; but I believe that the film would not have been equally compelling without the brilliant portrayal of his role.<br/><br/>It's redundant to talk about the brilliance of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. While watching the movie, one does not see Hopkins playing a role; what one sees all along is a psychopath, and yet brilliant, forensic psychiatrist. Jodie Foster was equally brilliant , one who can make a monster such as Dr. Lecter cooperate and give her clues that would finally lead her to the culprit. And it's impossible to ignore the invisible bond developing between her and Lecter during the process: her indignation at knowing that she was used to play a game of false promises (The famous scene involving, ""You've no more vacations to sell."" follows this sequence), and Hannibal's helping her in spite of the way he was deceived shed a little light on their humane side. Both of them know the wall that separates them, the circumstances that they live under, and yet none of them resists the development of the warmth between them. In a sense, they share a concern for each other.<br/><br/>A couple of weak points of the movie in my opinion: The picking up of the pen by Hannibal (while being totally tied) in presence of Dr. Chilton, and his masquerading as an injured police officer, and then removing a mask from his face in the hospital room were unrealistic. I'm yet to read the book, and hence cannot comment if it was dramatic necessity or the director's desire to stick to the words in the book, that prompted those scenes: either way, (in my opinion) it would have been better not to have this mask sequence in this brilliant movie.<br/><br/>People who have watched and enjoyed this movie would, I'm sure, equally enjoy Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal in the movie, Red Dragon, as well."

","The Silence of the Lambs has one of the most suspenseful scenes in the history of cinema. The whole conflict between Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is one of the best screen duos ever. Plot: After several murders have happened by killer ""Buffalo Bill"", Agent Clarice Starling is assigned to ask Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a captive cannibal prisoner, the aspects and ways of a killer. She wants Lecter to help her with the case, and he agrees to. The more he helps here with the case, the better Clarice has a chance of tracking the killer down herself. The Silence of the Lambs is a very smart film. Lecter is both a villain and helper and is a very smart person. Lecter doesn't see himself as insane, and doesn't think that what he thinks is wrong. Hopkins is excellent in his role, as is Foster. The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best Thrillers of all time and the best film of 1991. <br/><br/>10/10 stars."

","I think Ted Tally is amazing. And this, in my book still stands out as the best in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy. I like the way he delays exposition e.g. Jodie's father..... Clarice telling Dr. Lecter everything about her running away. Its almost interesting to think of Lecter as Clarice's shrink.<br/><br/>
The violence is more psychological and suggestive. Its spookier that way, although there are occasional glimpses of the big cheese, they're kept subliminal. Such as the scene where Anthony Heald shows Clarice the photograph of what Lecter did to one of the nurses, oh Tak Fujimoto is a sucker for red light, Demme can say... <br/><br/>And I like the foreshadowing for a later, pivotal scene when Chilton warns Starling not to pass Lecter anything other than paper. The payoff? I won't spoil it for you... you may see it coming, but its a very gripping, earth shattering scene near the end. Just see it. <br/><br/>10/10 <br/><br/>Grade A+"

","This film is undoubtedly the best of its genre and one of the best ever made. It heads the league for dark, quite morbid, highly psychological and incredibly intense suspense-thrillers - has it created a new genre all to itself? Mesmerising performances, instantly-quotable screenplay, perfect (and I mean perfect, absolutely faultless) direction and a fabulous plot which in retrospect should be solvable with Lecter's drip-dropping of clues. It's only with hindsight that you see how ingeniously the story was worked.<br/><br/>I challenge anyone to name a more intense performance, with such a truly believable accent, by a leading actress (Kidman in The Hours is the only one). It's a given that the fundamental strength of the film is Foster's screen chemistry with Lecter. But never in the history of cinema has there been more captivating exchanges than between these two protagonists. This would simply not have been possible without Foster's AND Hopkins' Oscar-deserving, magical performances. And together with Demme's flawless direction (camera, screen-time etc), Hopkins has assumed the position of quintessential anti-hero, gaining a notoriety which will be difficult to challenge by future film-makers.<br/><br/>If there was one downside to this spectacle (like to all films), it was a scene of quite graphic gore, though it was certainly not gratuitous and if anything only added to the impact of the film.<br/><br/>Films to come in this genre will not better this one.

Great acting from all main characters,of course sir Antony Hopkins(his quiet meditation over classic tune after killing two policemen is unforgettable), and especially Ted Levine, whose portraying of mentally affected person with abnormal sexuality is keen and believable,and was underestimated in my opinion. The whole idea of putting two maniacs in the story, where dim twistedness of one of them is hardly a match to a brilliance of another, is refreshing. The story develops well and has more than a couple of grabbers on the way. One of the personal highlights is a cellar scene-music works just right,getting tension to almost unbearable level.

","I doubt I have much to say in the way of praise for this magnificent film that already hasn't been said better by someone else, so I'll keep this short.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a film that grips me every time I watch it--an entrancing, mesmerizing experience that sheds the pulp and trashiness usually associated with the horror genre, transcending into a tasteful, terrifying, and wonderfully-acted masterwork.  Jonathan Demme, who started his career making pulpy exploitation, exhibits maturity and confident directoral skill.  It goes without saying that Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is one of the most intelligent, multilayered depictions of a psychotic ever committed to celluloid, and Jodie Foster's twerpy, Southern-fried FBI agent is easily his equal; the understated Ted Levine is also excellent (and underappreciated) as the Ed Gein-ish serial killer who skins his victims.

"hockeyman11","Null","0","0","20 August 2003"," Look past the cover of this movie
","In my opinion, and once again this is my opinion.  You have to truely look past the surface of this film to see why it swept the oscars.  Anthony Hopkins is in no way overacting.  The Lector character because of Hopkins is truely deserving of the AFI's top villian in movie history.  Lector was supposed to be portrayed the way that he was because he is by far different than any other person that lived.  The point of the film was to show the horrific yet intelligent man could possibly exist.  Lector was intended to be cunning and intellectual yet terrifying.  I dont know if anyone else noticed but its Anthony Hopkins person and appearance that makes the character. The eyes and voice and demeanor of lector cold the part.  If you do a little research on the fbi's website you'll see that some serial killers were intelligent.  And yes i do understand that lector was a mix of more than one infamous killer.  Moving on, Jodie foster as Clarice may not have been the favorite choice of every movie buff out there but really look at her performance.  She fit in the movie nearly flawlessly.  She looks weak in the film,as she is supposed too.  The elevator scene in the beginning of the movie as she goes to see Crawford shows her size disadvantage.  She pale to show her contrast to the world around her.  You'll also notice the same contrasts at the coroners office after the discovery of Federica Bimmels bodie.  It is imperative to notice that Clarice is in no way perfect.  In her training she enters the room incorrectly, at the first lector interview she breaks the rules and is over reactive to lector.  But she puts forth a performance that has defiantely made her career.  I would go into Buffalo Bill but i will waste no more time.  But i will say that, if you did not know bill is based of killer Ed Gein, rent the movie and even read about him on the fbi website.  And my last comment is about Jonathan Demme. Brilliant, completly brilliant.  His first major film and look what he did. He does a great job of presenting the movie.  The effects and colors he used.  Sit back, relax and truely watch this film. I guarantee is better than you truly believe."

","At the risk of offending quite a few of you out there, this one of the most overrated films of all time. Not to say that it isn't a very good film; It is VERY good, but certainly not among the top 25 of all time.<br/><br/>My main concern with this film is that it white washes over some key ideas in Thomas Harris's novel that are very important to the telling of the story. The main thing this film fails to cover is the motivation behind Jame Gumb's killing and subsequent skinning of the women. We never even learn until the last 15 minutes or so what he is using the skin for, and we NEVER learn why he feels he has to do it. A true psychological thriller is best served by providing the motivation behind the violent acts it depicts.<br/><br/>
The performances of Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lecter are what make this film version of Harris's novel work. Both have an incredible grasp of what makes their character compelling. Foster the ambitious FBI trainee with a troubled childhood, and Hopkins the brilliant, but psychotic doctor who breaks her down emotionally for his own amusement in return providing info on Jame Gumb. You could just feel the tension in the theater when he asked her to come CLOSER.....CLOSER with her ID badge so he could get a better look at it. Wow!<br/><br/>Other than those two performances, this film is nothing special. Scott Glenn is too wooden as Jack Crawford. Ted Levine is a good actor, but I think he was miscast as Gumb. The screenplay is paced a little too quickly and by-the-numbers for my taste. There are only a few scenes that are as tense as they should have been. Anthony Heald is way over the top as Chilton. He almost comes off as a cartoon character. <br/><br/>I suppose if I'd never read the book, I'd like this film a lot more. I still haven't seen RED DRAGON because I fear the same disappointment is looming there, too. RED DRAGON is my favorite novel of all time, so I just don't see how the film could live up to that standard.   I did like MANHUNTER quite a bit, though.  <br/><br/>Over all, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a very good film. It just isn't quite deserving of the ""classic"" status it has been given.

I read a review of the film somewhere that stated how unsettling Lecter is in his stillness, almost as if he is an animal ready to attack. I couldn't have said it better. It is a nod to the fact that you may one day be sitting across from someone who may look normal on the outside and yet be a monster on the inside. There's just too much good stuff I have to say about this movie that I'm actually beginning to feel overwhelmed by it all.

","The most brilliant tactic used by Jonathan Demme in this movie was to use Anthony Hopkins in the way he did. To have Hannibal Lecter not as the killer that Clarice Starling is after, but as a ""helping hand"" in her pursuit of the main ""bad guy"" in the movie. This allows Hopkins to portray his brilliance as an actor in the character of Hannibal Lecter. His conversations with Starling in both of his cells as she seeks his help are the best scenes in the film. The audience sees Lecter as a wolf who is staring with invincibility over his prey, although Lecter enjoys his time with Starling, the dominance he has is stunning.

","""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the best suspense movies made.  Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), an FBI student, is training to work with the criminally insane. She is called upon to interview and `to learn' from the well-known Hannibal Lector.  In reality she is not only learning from the interviews, but helping to solve the case.   Hannibal will hopefully give some insight on the new killer, Buffalo Bill.  Being very careful, Lector is a very intelligent person, and could see right through anyone.  Yet he is very particular on how he gives Starling his information.  She tells him something about her and than he gives the information she needs to figure out the case. But does she realize what the information is before it is too late? I believe the director, Jonathan Demmel was trying to portray realism in the idea that the criminally insane are extraordinary,  from the way they scope out there prey to the way they act upon once they're ready.  It's amazing in itself.  The movie was so life like and seemed so real, I found myself looking for the `based on a true story' at the end.  Another aspect believed is definitely suspense. Foster will keep one on their toes through out the whole movie, leaving the viewer to wonder what is next. I found Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) to have played his role exquisitely!  I felt that he was really some crazed cannibal.  The cell they first showed Hopkins in was so amazingly true, from its plastic caged in area to the drawer that allows things to be passed back and forth.  He is allowed nothing.  The whole basement, where the cell was located, was like the Munster's dungeon.  The reality of this movie makes me admire the FBI for what they do. The well played roles and realism of the movie all come together perfectly to form a great movie.

","Silence of the Lambs is a great movie. But hardly qualifies as a horror movie. It has none of the horror movie features. Sex Drugs or obscenely brutal murder. It is more a FBI suspense movie with a hint of the dramatic in it. Not a horror movie . Very bothering to me"
"Old Joe","Null","0","0","21 December 2002"," Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Brilliant. Cunning. Psychotic. In his mind lies the clue to a ruthless killer. Clarice Starling. FBI. Brilliant. Vulnerable. Alone. She must trust him to stop the killer.
","There are moments in Silence of the Lambs' that are truly wonderful to watch. Yet there are others that are evil, gruesome and disgusting, that many people would have to turn a blind eye to. In that sense, it makes this film very unique, as it compels you to watch what you normally would not. Also, in my time of watching movies I have not seen a more evil and dastardly character than that of the now famous Hannibal, the Cannibal'.<br/><br/>
A psychopath killer known as Buffalo Bill' is kidnapping young women across the Midwest. Believing it takes one to know one, the FBI sends Agent Clarice Starling to interview a demented prisoner who may provide psychological insight into the killer's action. The prisoner is psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant murderous cannibal who will only help Starling if she will feed his morbid curiosity with details about her own complicated life. The twisted relationship forces Starling not only to confront her psychological demons, but leads her face to face with a demented heinous killer, an incarnation so powerful, that she may not have the courage  or strength  to stop him!<br/><br/>It is no wonder that Silence of the Lambs received five academy awards. Of great highlight to me was the cast, which was brilliant. Anthony Hopkins performance as the brilliant mad man', Hannibal Lecter, was truly astonishing. He played the mentally disturbed doctor to perfection. I love how we see the close shots of Lector's eyes, as they look full of intrigue and mischief. Hannibal is a clever man, and shows the audience this many times. I like the chemistry that Hopkins shares with fellow actress Jodie Foster. Her performance as Clarice was exceptional. I like how we see the character of Clarice being someone who is very vulnerable (she refer to her childhood and the lambs screaming'), a woman who is trapped very much in a man's world, then having her be the heroine, to be of great significance to the entire story. I am sure 10 years ago, it would have been rare to find a woman be the hero/rescuer in a movie story.  <br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast include many fine performances. The role of James 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb (Ted Levine) was great. I enjoy how we see that he has a very weird sense of reality and that he could be thought of as a transsexual. This role caused quite a lot of commotion in America with Gay activists and I can see why it would do that. You also have the role of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), Clarice's boss. He gives Clarice the difficult tasks of talking to Lecter, so she can solve the case surrounding Buffalo Bill'. Add in the minor role of Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), who was good in the role of the woman in distress and in need of rescuing.<br/><br/>The director of Silence of the Lambs', Jonathon Demme, captures many elements to the story which I feel were crucial. Such themes as the woman alienated in a man's world', Hannibal's evil character and the way Buffalo Bill' entices then kills his female victims are done in the correct way, making the movie feel so right. Silence's screenplay, comes from the book Silence of the Lambs' written by author Thomas Harris. With such an involved plot, it is no wonder that it was to be made into a movie. The person who made Silence's screenplay so good was Ted Talley, making Harris' characters really come to life<br/><br/>The cinematographer for Silence was Tak Fujimoto, who had some difficult tasks in this film. I like the way he made Hannibal look, as the camera is hooked on Lecter's eyes for the most part, adding to the thrill and suspense. Add in the way he showed Buffalo Bill to be a quite a queer character, fascinated in bugs and the like was exceptionally good. This leads me on to what extraordinary scenes Silence of the lambs' had. Gory and violent ones, such as when Hannibal escapes from prison and when we see what sort of an animal, Buffalo Bill' really is. I also enjoyed watching all the interaction with Clarice and Hannibal at the prison cell(s), as these scenes really bring out what the book had intended these characters to be like. <br/><br/>In concluding, I was not scared as I thought I would be by Silence of the Lambs', but more captivated by how good a psycho-thriller this movie really was. Then again, I have realised I am nowhere near as shook up by violence as an adult, than I was when I was youngster. I am sure if I had seen it back in 1991, I would have been a lot more scared. I was interested to find out that Michelle Pfeiffer rejected the role of Clarice' and Gene Hackman the role of director in Silence of the Lambs', as they thought the story was just too violent for their liking, which is understandable. Silence of the Lambs' also proves to me what a dangerous area Psychiatry can be. I have been monitored by such a doctor, respect what he has to say and trust him. I am unsure how the Psychiatric profession would feel towards Hannibal Lecter and the movies that he is portrayed in. All in all this is one of the great movies of the 1990's'.<br/><br/>CMRS gives Silence of the Lambs': 4 (Very Good Film)<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to mention how silly John Sammy' Newman can be on the AFL footy show in Australia. One night on the show he was wheeled out like Hannibal is in Silence of the Lambs'. A member from the audience was asked to take his mask off. Once they did, he lashed out of his costume and scared the wits out of them. Just hilarious. For this moviegoer, it was his first taste of what Hannibal Lecter' was going to be like."

","In some ways, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is what pure horror is made of. It does not have the excessive gore of some slasher movies, but taps into human fears in a way few films can ever hope to accomplish. Fears such as being trapped in a dark basement, being stalked by a madman, skinnings, and rotting corpses; all are incorporated into the narrative in one coherent package. This is not a cheesy horror movie; it's a dark, gloomy thriller--somber and eerie to the core, with stark, painful images. There is almost no humor or sunshine; few horror films actually succeed at being serious, but this one does, making it one of a select few along with ""Alien,"" ""Hellraiser,"" and ""The Exorcist."" Director Jonathan Demme (for whom this film may be the one he is most associated with) keeps this moving at a steady pace, with the suspense being nearly unbearable at times. There are few shock moments, but the taut direction makes them truly effective without resorting to cheap ""splatter movie"" tactics. Like other standouts in the genre, much of the horror is psychological.<br/><br/>The real meat of the story comes from the symbiotic relationship between the protagonist, FBI trainee Clairice Starling, and the imprisoned madman Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector. In the role of the latter, Anthony Hopkins is one of the most memorable psychopaths in film, delivering a performance that effectively conveys the essence of evil. Like Dracula or ""Hellraiser's"" Pinhead, he is not a mindless beast, but an articulate, intelligent creature, making him much more dangerous. However, the film is really Starling's story. Screenwriter Ted Tally and star Jodie Foster work to create a multilayered, complex heroine, struggling to overcome her unhappy childhood. Lector finds her intriguing, since she may be the only true intellectual equal he has encountered in many years. She wishes her assistance in tracking down the serial killer Buffalo Bill; he tests her, tantalizing her with subtle clues to challenge her emerging intellect (there is an interesting theme of deception running throughout the film, as every major character lies to or misleads one another to some degree). Foster's character directly defies the admittedly sexist portrayals in many other horror movies.<br/><br/>There are solid supporting performances as well; Scott Glenn is rock-solid as Starling's supervising officer--and a father figure as well. He studied with a real detective to prepare for his role, and the effort paid off; he seems more like a real law enforcement officer than an actor. Anthony Heald plays a pompous asylum head, and he does so well enough. Ted Levine is really creepy as Buffalo Bill, the type of person you'd only expect to see in a nightmare. Unlike Lector, he's not especially intelligent or articulate--he's not even a very good liar, as it turns out--but he is truly the master of his own little domain. His character is truly nuts, and I suspect the filmmakers were thinking of Leatherface from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""<br/><br/>It's difficult to believe ""Silence of the Lambs"" one Best Picture; some reactionary Academy Award members must have seen this as a slasher movie. Given the subject matter, it's certainly not for the faint-hearted; there are moments that practically define horror--such as Starling being trapped in that dungeon-like basement. It's not perfect either; certain details of how Bill is finally tracked down might be confusing without paying close attention. Nonetheless, for years to come, it has been regarded as one of the cornerstones of modern horror, and Hannibal Lector is destined to be a cult figure for the rest of time.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by Orion Pictures"

","This is by far, one of my favorite films of all time.  This film stands alone and does not need to have sequels and prequels.  Of course it was great to hear that 'Hannibal' was going to be an upcoming sequel to the film, but was not necessary and is completely different in the style of filmmaking.  Then when we learned of 'Red Dragon', i was worried that the studios were only in it for the money.  And yes, they were.  Be that as it may, Silence will always be the first thing to come to mind when we hear the names Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and even Hannibal Lecter.  The others will be forgotten whereas this true originator of the Hannibal Lecter series (minus Manhunter) will always be remembered until film reaches its end.  I strongly recommend this picture, not to say that I don't recommend the sequels & prequel, it's just that they're all in a class of their own."

Little over a decade has passed since its release, but its place in cinema history is already assured, as it's bound to stand the test of time - the mark of a genuine classic.<br/><br/>The sense of menace and intrigue, captured in Anthony Hopkin's spine-tingling portrayal of the cannibalistic Dr. Hannibal Lecter, will forever stand as one of the most chilling on-screen performances. A fairly accessible horror film - that's more suggestive than outright obscene - there remains a constant feeling of suspense throughout. The chemistry between Lecter and Jodie Foster's brave Clarice, stands out as one of the highlights of 1990s cinema.<br/><br/>After watching this film for the first time, one can't help but feel a mixed sense of disbelief, shock and fear, all rolled into one.

","The Silence of the Lambs is a movie that stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford.  This movie is about a trainee FBI agent who is sent to uncover information.  The only question they had was where they were going to find the information?  Believing that it takes a psychopath to know one, they turn to a convict named Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  Lecter is a cannibal who is locked up in Baltimore correctional hospital.  Hannibal might have information on a certain person named Buffalo Bill.  However, the only way for Lecter to tell her any information is for Agent Starling to tell him details about her complicated life.  Buffalo Bill is a psychopathic murderer who only murders young women.  Before he puts the bodies in a different river, he removes parts of the victims skin in different shapes.  He then places a bug cocoon somewhere in their body.  It is usually placed in the back of their throat.  A special woman's daughter has been kidnapped and she has not been seen in the area for a week.  Trainee Clarice Starling has to find information quickly before another young women is killed.  It is up to Agent Starling to come face to face with her fears and stop this psychopath dead in his tracks!  `Horrific, weirdly erotic and intimate.this terrifying thriller is an electrifying exercise in suspense'  (Newsweek)!<br/><br/>
This is a great movie.  It was well done, the acting was outstanding, and the suspense built awesomely.  Viewers need to be careful not to let their assumptions take over.  This happened to me and I was surely wrong. (Hint: it involves a doorbell).<br/><br/>I do not recommend this to anyone who does not like to get scared!  One thing scarier than this movie is your own imagination that goes wild, why is this happening to those people, and what if the cannibal escapes?  Those thoughts alone will scare you to death!  However this movie is absolutely great and is a must to see!"

In their desperate search to catch this monster, They turn to Dr Hannibal The Cannibal for help. Hannibal is himself a serial killer, and a brilliant one to boot. Always outsmarting his doctors and snubbing his nose at authority, Hannibal turns Clarice's plead for help into a psychological game of cat and mouse that not only puts insight in the case at hand but puts insight into Clarice's own fracture past as well.

","Anthony Hopkins, as we all know, is a remarkable actor. A man with charisma and intelligence. When Hopkins plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the audience will quickly refer to his off-screen character, but without the part of him biting people. Jonathan Demme took us to a spine-chilling journey, unsolved mysteries by a potential killer, and an intelligent man who is danger to everyone around him shows a young woman to the killer. Both Hopkins and Foster took in roles that ultimately showed them the true experience of a case, that significantly refers to murders. But this case really gave nightmares to everyone. This film did not at all show terror and gore which made it unbelievably scary. If you think that horror flicks today are scary, think again.

After reading the book a year ago, i was amazed to see how much was included in the screenplay, which is a rarity for many adapted films. Although the book is 500 pages long, writer Ted Tally was able to include every detail to make it one of the best adapted screenplays ever.<br/><br/>In terms of the actual film, it is flawless. The performances are superb all round with Foster and Hopkins giving their much deserved oscar rounds. Without a doubt, the most accolades go to the director Jonathan Demme, who by his skill, has crafted one of the best modern day thrillers along with David Fincher's Seven. With a surprisingly simple style of direction, his choice of povs, tracks, freaky closeups and making actors stare down the camera all accumulate to create an unnerving yet awesome anchor to Harris' story. Although Demme has been quiet since, He has taught many amatuer filmmakers and major directors that flashy direction is not appropriate all the time.<br/><br/>Special mention goes to the editor and composer. After watching the escape sequence and Starling's entrance to Gumb's apartment, editor Craig McKay cuts tension filled sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. With this and along with the expert, furious pacing, this film never wastes one second of screentime. Howard Shore's subtle and ominous score fits the mood perfectly and makes an excellent contribution to the film.<br/><br/>Being a filmmaker myself, many other people and myself admire the sheer talent and craftsmanship in this film and with big expectations for Red Dragon in October, I hope Brett Ratner and co. will do the Thomas Harris book justice and take notes from this thrilling masterpiece.<br/><br/>

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the best films of the 1990s. A police procedural that shapeshifts nightmarishly into gothic horror, it is one of the most intense, brutal and elegant thrillers of all time.<br/><br/>
Those who claim the film is boring probably first saw it on video, where much of its impact is lost due to the tinny sound and the tiny screen. This film derives its power from the intricate use of sound effects and the masterful evocation of clausrophobia, which is best appreciated when the screen is 20 feet across and you are trapped in a theatre. The cinematography is both grittily realistic and otherworldly, not superising since the film was shot by ""The Sixth Sense""'s Tak Fujimoto. Jonathan Demme, a comic director, somehow manages to create the only Hitchcockian film that is truly worthy of the name. The wonderfully paced final act, in which we assume the SWAT team are on the way, but... is one of the greatest hoodwinks I have ever seen. Ted Tally's script is phenomenal, outclassing even the novel on which it is based. <br/><br/>But ultimately, this film belongs to its actors. Not just Hopkins, who of course creates the greatest screen monster in history, or even to Foster, who delivers the performance of her career (and seems to have had a talent-ectomy shortly afterwards), but to Ted Lavine, for his courageous performance as a killer transvestite, and to the world weary Scott Glenn."

","Jonathan Demme's film ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a true work of art. The movie is told through Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who is an FBI agent assigned to a murder investigation.  She finds herself in pursuit of the infamous serial killer named `Buffalo Bob.'  In her search for the killer she obtains unusual information from an unusual person.  This information comes from a serial killer named Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins).  Lector gives Clarice the details about Buffalo Bob in a covert way.  Neither Starling nor the audience recognizes Lector's help until the end of the movie.  Bob was a patient of Lector's before he was arrested and put in prison.  Through clues from Lector, Starling catches Bob, thus ending the mystery.  Starling and Lector grow close together.  Starling is the one person whom Lector will talk to.  It seems like Lector enjoys his time with Clarice and would like to carry the game even further.  This shows us Lector's sick personality, as he likes to play games with serious murder cases.  Even though Hopkins receives little film time, he still offers one of his best performances.  His presence is felt throughout the movie. Demme deserves the, `2 thumbs up' for this film.  Not only does he tell a great story, but also keeps his audience on the edge of their seats.  This is a must see movie."

","Jonathan Demme's masterpiece `The Silence of the Lambs' is so laired in every sense of the word, it offers haunting drab scenes and some of the most beautiful dramatic pieces ever put on film.  It truly at its heart is an actor's film.  The camera is always right next to there noses so they are forced to look right in the lens and the result is one of the most thought provoking and brilliant pieces of film ever made.  Many will never forget the scene where Lector (Brilliantly played by Anthony Hopkins) is talking to Clarice (Jodie Foster) about why she ran away from here uncles home.  The filmmaking is so tender and so beautiful that you almost don't notice how great the film really is.  It is a scary film, and a touching film an unlikely mix when you talk about a cross dressing serial killer and a cannibal.  Claurice is so innocent and so confused not one person can't relate to her, Jodie foster gives the performance of her life and pushes the viewer to new heights of humanity and fear.  I love this film aside from Coppola's `The Conversation' I think this is the best suspense film there is.  It offers so much in every aspect, artistic and entertainment.  The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto (The Sixth Sense) is as humanly oriented as it gets, the way that camera `walks' and zooms is sort of how the human eyes work.  All these aspects are in the film so finely that it almost is hard to acknowledge it is there.  Jonathan Demme has since made a film that captivates its subject matter as well as this one. The characters are metaphors themselves, film and criminal investigators have all agreed that Claurice is a lot like the serial killer Buffalo Bill, which they both are searching for what they want and what they are.  They are a lot alike I must admit, they are different in their physicality towards there desires obviously.  The film is a piece of fact that of which `Saving Private Ryan' is.  It is not true in its narrative but in its background facts it is completely factual.  Hannibal Lecter is haunting and almost unrealistic but then again he is supposed to be.  He is so polite and so snooty that he is evil.  This film is just brilliant, that's all there is to it.  In all of it's amazing scenes it truly gives the best acting of the 90's.  This film may never be surpassed as one of the greatest horror/suspense films.  This film does so much on so many levels, beautiful acting, great direction, screenwriting, and its thought provoking cinematography.  It's sequel Scott's `Hannibal' does not offer the same depth charge that `Silence' offers,  the film falls to much around how Hannibal is an evil cannibal and he is gonna get you.  `Silence of the Lambs' is a brilliant scary film that will never be forgotten."

","Okay. I don't remember it very clearly, but 1991 must have been a TERRIBLY slow year for movies if this got Best Picture. I recently saw Silence of the Lambs for the first time, and was VERY disappointed by what had been built up in my mind as supposedly the greatest psychological thriller of all time. HOGWASH!<br/><br/>It's not that I didn't ""get it"", or that it's too violent for me. No, I tend to enjoy the dreary, bleak movies, I enjoyed Se7en very much (even if I saw its ending coming several miles off). But this was just painfully mediocre. The much-vaunted psychological ""mind games"" Hopkins plays with Foster are nowhere to be found. The two have all of three scenes together (admittedly, it could easily be four).<br/><br/>I can't really describe what's wrong with this film, it just has sort of an odd ""movie of the week"" feel to it, from the slasher-chic opening credits to the swelling music after the villain has been defeated.<br/><br/>
Taken out of context, away from all the ludicrous praise, it's certainly an enjoyable, fairly well-made film. But, please, don't believe the hype, and think for yourself."

","This ""psychological"" horror stuff always makes me gag. I realize that this type of movie is supposed to scare you through your mind, but it doesn't make a very good movie experience. You have to be totally into the movie to really get what it's trying to do, and that means you can't have any distractions and you have to see what the film is saying. Aren't movies supposed to provide you an hour or two of entertainment? Is that not their purpose? Well I don't find it entertaining having to immerse myself so deeply into a movie simply to get a kick out of it. A good movie should be able to do that anyways. Anthony Hopkins is indeed very creepy, however his over-the-top IQ make him seem more of a prodigy than an insane killer. Plus, he's behind bars (well, most of the movie anyways). Buffalo Bill, the serial killer who's still roaming free is not even scary. In fact, to be scared of this movie is to be scared of watching The Lion King. Psychological thrills? It's a concept that I hope dies out soon. It does not make a good movie. Everyone says that what you imagine is scarier than what you see. If you hear a noise in your house, is that scarier than hearing a noise and seeing some guy with a knife in the corner? I don't think so. Good movies allow you to be terrified without requiring you to look too hard. A good film maker should frighten you by what he puts into the movie, not by what you put into it. It seems that those that can't scare you by what they do with a movie have to make it a psychological thriller almost as a cover-up that they couldn't hack it. It gives them an excuse. So when someone says it wasn't scary, they can call them stupid. Yeah, right. If you made a good movie in the first place...Anyways, see this only for great acting and music. It's not scary at all. The actors may be, but that can't save this movie."

","Silence Of The Lambs is one of the most influential horror movies of the early 1990s. It inspired Se7en and a host of other rip-offs (like Copycat). Outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins, Jody Foster, Scott Glenn as well as Diane Baker and Kasi Lemmons make this movie extremely memorable. If you're at all into horror movies, let alone serial killer movies, this is the movie to see. The movie is based on Thomas Harris' second book featuring Hannibal Lecter, and it is one of his most researched ones, creating a sense of detail that is unmatched in most humdrum movie scripts. I think that's the real secret of this movie. The story is deceptively simple: FBI academy cadet Starling (Foster) is manoeuvred to interview serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) in his high security cell, because Lecter may or may not have information on another serial killer on the loose, ""Buffalo Bill"". Bill's latest victim is Katherine Martin, the daughter of a female senator and the clock, as they say, is ticking. The movie's psychological battles are not only between Starling and Lecter, but between she and her boss Jack Crawford, Senator Martin, Paul Krendler and head of the asylum, dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald's breakthrough performance - Law & Order, 8MM). Also, the movie is structured as a journey of discovery, for Clarice, who must face the horrors of her own past, as well for Lecter and ""Buffalo Bill"". It's director Jonathan Demme's achievement that he puts the emphasis of the story on the psychological battles, rather than the gore. This is also what makes this movie unique. 10 out of 10, because it's one of the great and significant movies of all time."

","I remember seeing this film in -92 and not being terribly amazed by it. With time though it has become a long time favorite of mine and I am yet to see such a combination of talent on a serial killer film as there is in this one. It is actually one of the few films that could have easily been a lot longer since the story had apparently been modified for the screen. The main theme of the film relies very strongly on the character of Hannibal Lecter and Hopkins should have had more screen time. <br/><br/>In retrospect the script, which is well adapted from the novel, doesn't really offer anything new. Much of the story is to me pretty standard crime/serialkiller fiction. Otherwise all the other technicalities of this film are well done and especially the music by Howard Shore adds to the eerie mood. The film works well as a kind of horror/thriller combination. I hope that the sequel will have a good story and a good cast."

Jodie Foster is good in here too, as the FBI trainee who gets closer to Hannibal than anyone.

","This movie is one I can watch over and over and never get sick of.  As a matter of fact,  after all these years,  there are still parts that I don't understand fully.  I love movies that take me a long time to figure them out!!!  I don't have the intellect required to just give a rundown on what it's about,  except that it's a facinating,  sophisticated,  brilliant psychological thriller (not a horror movie by any standards).  It is terrifying but not because of blood,  violence or gore.  Rather,  it chills you to the bone with what is unseen and unknown.  Jodie Foster (an actress of unmatched intensity and one-of-a-kind performances) stars as Clarice Starling,  an FBI trainee who is just a week away from becoming a full-fledged agent.  At the request of Behavior Field Science agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn),  Starling travels to a Baltimore psychiatric hospital to meet renowned serial murderer and former psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins) hoping to gain insight on how to crack unsolved serial murder casees.  From the moment they meet,  their relationship is riveting,  separated by differing values and a sheet of glass,  yet united in eerily intimate ways.  It's this intimacy that leads to an offer made by Lecter to Starling,  an offer that might be the chance of a lifetime for Starling to make a difference,  to save a life.  This movie is enormously entertaining,  but it's also intellectually stimulating and challenging, and not very many movies are like that to me.  Presently,  The Sixth Sense is a well-done addition to this few and far between genre,  though not quite as frightening as ""Lambs"".  I credit a lot of the chill factor of this movie to Hopkins,  whose soft-spoken eloquence only served to enhance the undeniable evil Lecter represented.  The lighting in the cell made his usually soulful blue eyes seem fish-like and lifeless,  as if to transmit to the viewer the absence of soul and morality.  Excellent work!!! ****"

In reality it won Best Picture because of a severe lack of good movies (seriously, if they decided to make Speed II or Muppets from Outer Space that year, the competition would have been tougher)  The movie's big mistake was totally selling out by having Hannibal Lector escape.  This draws the movie too far away from its central plot making the movie too much about him.  The way I see it, whoever wrote it at first intended Lector to be a deep psychological informant then decided he was too cool to keep under control then decided audiences would prefer him to get out so he damages the story to appease the masses in typical Hollywood fasion, when it would have been much better for him to be locked up the whole time.  Had they stuck to having him in the asylum the whole time, the movie would be a totally psychological thirller as opposed to a cheap ""whats the nutty douche going to do next now that he's escaped"" thriller.

","Where can I start. No doubt 90% of people who bother to read this will have seen the film and are wondering peoples' opinions on it. I for one can use the old cliche - the book is better. Hannibal Lecter's demented form of intelligence and Starling's vulnerability make it more of an interesting way to spend time than watching the movie. Lecter's character still far outshines that of Buffalo Bill who despite killing 6 people had all the edge of a butter knife and came across more as a violent Lily Savage wannabe. Harris' novel also expands upon Jack Crawford's role and his character is far more interesting than the celluloid character. These slight characterisation gripes aside, 'Silence...' is still an enjoyable, tense and at times brilliant film but for my money has to take a runner up spot to the less glossy and in my view more menacing take on the theme, 'Se7en' as the definitive serial killer thriller of the 90's. Having seen many a TV movie on the subject though, I still hand 'Silence...' and generous 8/10 due to its intelligent structure and clever direction."

Hopkins is Dr. Hannibal Lector, a psychopathic serial killer and the only person who could help Jodie Foster finding the whereabouts of Buffalo Bill another serial killer. Jodie Foster portrays an FBI agent in training who gets handed this case by her superior officer played by Scott Glenn. This is such a good film because Lector is playing psychological games with Jodie Foster asking her questions instead of having her ask the questions. I got the feeling that by asking her these questions about her personal life, which by the way was against the rules, he was helping her locate the serial killer Buffalo Bill.

","You'd think, from all the hype, that this movie is more than ""just"" a thriller, but no.  That's fine with me, but it's still sort of a disappointment.  The many people who say this movie has depth are cutting it way too much slack - it has about as much psychological/dramatic content as your typical Stephen King invention, though at least King is more up-front about admitting that psychology is just the mechanism that drives the scares.  Here, at times, you get the sense that they think they're actually getting at something more substantial.  The title, for example... If this movie were more honest with itself, it would have been called ""The Dressmaker From Hell!"" or somesuch.  <br/><br/>  And the famously classy acting, writing and directing?  Whatever.  I'd have enjoyed it a lot more if nobody told me it was really amazing - it seemed like people just doing their jobs well, making a scary movie.  There are little spots where the acting, the writing, and the directing each get downright clumsy; wouldn't normally be an issue except that this movie's bloated reputation makes it an issue.  I'd much rather not have been watching this movie at a level where I cared about those things...<br/><br/>  I'm not saying that a psychologically intriguing horror movie isn't possible - when, near the beginning of the movie, Clarice more or less dares Hannibal to analyze himself, I thought, ""ooh, that'll be fascinating, when he eventually does that.""  But that was, of course, a stunt this movie didn't have the focus to pull off, so the issue was just dropped, which I saw as implicit acknowledgement that the character is a psychological impossibility and that the movie's pretentions of depth were just that, pretentions, for atmosphere's sake.<br/><br/>And hey, that's not such a bad thing - there were some good scary ideas in the movie - the night-vision bit at the end was really nice, I thought - and there's no shame at all in making a scary movie with some pseudo-psychological atmosphere.  But I hold this movie responsible for the new sub-genre of ""sordid serial killer gothic"" which tends toward the tasteless and pointless by suggesting that the outlandish psychoses of made-up serial killers are in themselves worthy subject matter.  Like ""Seven,"" or that one with Jennifer Lopez in a box.  And others.  You know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>These people need to reread their Edgar Allan Poe and understand how psychology can actually relate to horror.  Or just settle for making gross-out movies and being honest about it."

","The Silence of the Lambs was a rather disappointing movie when stacked up against the beautiful novel by Thomas Harris.  Bridget Fonda really did no justice to the role.

","Oh, it´s you, Clarice. I was waiting for you...<br/><br/>It´s wonderful to see how a movie can determinate a style, and change the perception of horror films in so many ways.<br/><br/>Clarice Starling, FBI student, is told to have some interviews with a cannibal psycopath called Hannibal, in order to find about psycophaths´s psycology so they could find a serial killer called ""Buffalo Bill"". But Hannibal will talk to Clarice only if she feeds his sick curiosity. Clarice will face her fears, and will also face an intelligence and evilness that don´t seem to be human.<br/><br/>It has been the third film that has got the five most important Oscars: Best picture, director, actor, actress and script.<br/><br/>One of the best things of the movie is the constant feeling of danger until the end titles. That´s mainly because of Anthony Hopkins, as Hannibal: he IS Hannibal. When you look at his eyes, you can see nothing but an intelligent killing machine. And that´s scary, boy. The sensation of facing someone evil and so intelligent that he could be ""God"" is one of the scariest feelings anyone could ever have (although it has never happen to me, thank God). But that´s too because of Jodie Foster, as Clarice. She IS scared. She really is. She is scared because Lecter sees through her head like he could see though a window. She is scared because a person´s life depends on her (the woman ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnapped). She is simply scared of looking him at the eyes.<br/><br/>The mood is wonderful and creepy, even sick and macabre, it´s perfect for the film.<br/><br/>Demme did a marvellous job directing the actors. The script has absolutely no line you can dislike.<br/><br/>¿The best of the movie? Well, the dialogues between Hannibal and Clarice. They´re full of energy, of power, spinning inside a countdown. He enjoys the power he helds on Clarice, mental power, he likes humilliating her, because the recognizes every one´s weak point.<br/><br/>¿The worst? Nothing, of course!!!<br/><br/>Now, please, switch off the computer, go to the nearby shop, and get ""The silence of the lambs"". You won´t be disappointed.

Silence of the Lambs answers that question in a chilling and disturbing way.  Through a smooth script, clever directing, and superior acting, SotL is a thrilling ride through the mind of the common serial killer. Script 10/10- SotL has a very consistent plot with all the twists and turns that make any thriller great.  Ted Tally does a terrific job at telling the story from the serial killer's point of view. Acting 10/10- The acting is indeed the movie's strongest point.  SotL wouldn't be so good if it weren't for Foster and Hopkins, who work so well together.  Nobody else could have made Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter such a dynamic duo.  You can't forget to mention the supporting cast, either (especially Ted Levine, Scott Glenn, and Anthony Heald). Directing 9/10 Jonathan Demme does a fabulous job at pointing out what the actors need to do.  He sets the tension up and can easily put us at the edge of our seats. The cinematography is also flawless, because all the close-ups he does lets us see the emotion on everybody's face.  My only complaint?  Sometimes the lighting effects bother me a little. Other 9/10 The score is great, the editing is very smooth, and the set designs are also decent.  Costumes and makeup are exceptional (especially the human mask at the end).  All the technical aspects do wonders to make SotL more authentic Overall 10/10 This is the best thriller of the 90's and is appropriate for those looking for more than an ordinary slasher flick out today.

","My comment (may contain spoilers, if that is still possible) is focused on a particular reading of ""The Dantean Mind of Hannibal Lecter""; that is, based on the three novels by Thomas Harris and the three film adaptations, to date.<br/><br/>Demme's excellent portrayal of the entrance, into Hannibal's labyrinthine Limbo, of our new ""Special Agent, Clarice Starling"" -- who is so unlike the permanently damaged ""Will Graham"" who'd originally captured Lecter [""Red Dragon"" ends on some disturbing evidence of corrupting influences by ""Dr. Lecter"" and his ""mindset"" (psychologically, a 'to the dark side' partial conversion is alluded to in the novel; not Michael Mann's flawed 'happy Hollywod ending' to his 1986 MANHUNTER !)] -- is simply, hauntingly stunning. <br/><br/>My critical point about how 'the Jodie Foster character' conveys exactly that un-cynical combination of highly moral, ethically-beyond-reproach, innocence and 'purity' so very attractive to our Florentine aesthete and ""monster"" / for Anthony Hopkins' ""Lecter,"" will find it's fullest pay-off with Julianne Moore's street-wiser ""Clarice"" in Ridley Scott's HANNIBAL, of course. But, already in the 1991 SILENCE, the ""people will say we're in love"" trope of a COURTLY (""dark,"" to-be-sure !) LOVE affair between the politically naive ""well-scrubbed hustling rube with a little taste"" and a Nietzschean Uebermensch (taken to one logical conclusion Hollywood has never quite succeeded at before !), our ""psychiatrist"" of ""Chaos,"" is intriguingly presented for the very first time. <br/><br/>The heroics of this sincere ""Special Agent,"" in that corrupt ""stale bureaucracy"" our consummate cynic, ""Dr. Lecter,"" contemptuously holds such institutions as the FBI to be, quite obviously resonates with Dante's view of the ""Donna Gentile,"" ""Beatrice"" -- too pure and noble for this ignoble world. Is it any wonder that the question is raised : ""Do you know Florence ?  That's the Palazzo Vecchio and the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere."" Indeed, ""a trainee"" with ""Such sweet decorum"" (Dante) and her special relationship with ""everyone's favorite, gentleman, genius, cannibal,"" might have made his quick capture in Florence quite a simple matter. If it were not for the 'functional illiteracy' one must suppose also the FBI-like institutions suffer under today. <br/><br/>The manipulations of ""Clarice"" by ""that awful Jack Crawford,"" to bring ""Lecter"" out of his ""memory palace"" -- ""Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of a view."" -- are clearly cynical attempts to get him to assist in their hunt for ""Buffalo Bill."" And if he'd condescend to do so, it would be because ""he did it to amuse himself."" Such is the understanding between this ""Behavioral Science Dept. Section Chief"" and ""Hannibal the Cannibal."" If he had noticed the Dantean ""contrapasso"" of 'poetic justice' Lecter's making ""multiple Miggs"" swallow ""that offensive tongue"" displays, there is no evidence of it.<br/><br/>What is so impressive in both the novel and the film's (closest of the three) cinematic adaptation(s), is that there is a deeper, closer and more intimate, 'understanding' between Starling and Lecter at work. And it is the very ""straight arrow"" nature of Clarice's idealistic 'purity' which will forever spare her the unpleasant fatal visitations of Hannibal, after his genial escape : (although) ""I think it would be quite something to know you in private life."" ""I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it."" <br/><br/>He knows that, despite his enigmatic clues and help in getting ""Jame Gumb,"" Clarice judges herself ""with all the mercy of the dungeon at Threave"" (novel; Scottish ""Dungeon of the Supernatural"" with no escape), and her temporary respite, within the contemporary corrupt City-State of some Washingtonian Intelligence & Law Enforcement community, sleeping ""deeply, sweetly, in the silence of the lambs,"" will never long endure !<br/><br/>She IS ""the honet in the lion,"" after all !

","When broken down to its raw story Silence of the Lambs appears to be an almost formulaic crime film: The central narrative focuses on Clarice Starling a rookie cop chasing a serial killer and all the requisite clichés of the genre are evident, including social isolation of the central protagonist and a climactic chase that concludes the final act. However, critical opinion and a clutch of Academy Awards would suggest that Silence of the Lambs is something much greater than a generic cop film. Arguably it is the inclusion of the character of Hannibal Lecter that separates Silence of the Lambs critically, while also propelling the film towards generic hybridity. Indeed, it is easy to forget how few scenes the character is in since Lecter remains omniscient to the film as a whole, sorely missed when absent.<br/><br/>To many it is impossible to think of Silence of the Lambs without remembering Anthony Hopkins' powerful portrayal of the enigmatic Dr. Lecter. From our first meeting Lecter dominates our attention and it is clear to the audience that this underused character is the more interesting villain within the film. In Lecter we are offered a fearsome intellectual, who may victimise us as he sees fit. His killing of the insane criminal in the neighbouring cell, without any physical contact serves as testament to that.<br/><br/>The chilling silence and composure of Lecter is made all the more ominous when one compares him to the focus villain Buffalo Bill. As a character Buffalo Bill is less pronounced than Hannibal and Demme seems to have depended on crude stereotypes rather than characterisation. His pierced nipple, poodle and penis tucked between legs appear as cheap sensationalised representations confirming his stance as a classical deviant, ripe for a homophobic audience. The subtle touch applied to Lecter's characterisation is absent and as such the audience tends to forget Buffalo Bill more easily. This perhaps explains why we are so keen to see Lecter at the end; he is the more sculpted villain. However, from Buffalo Bill many themes of Silence of the Lambs become apparent, most specifically the idea that criminality and villainy is the result of society's influence rather than hereditary inheritance. In Starling however one could argue that the hardships of childhood have had a profoundly different effect; they have inspired her to strive for greatness. The death of her father is shown numerously throughout the film, through the use of brief flashbacks. Coupled with this is the emotional scaring that her uncle has dealt and her many years of striving to be recognised and respected, despite that fact that society as a whole regards her as nothing more than `one generation from poor white trash'. Starling oozes ambition and pride, yet one may suggest that she is disadvantaged by virtue of her class and sex, striving for equality in the FBI male hierarchy. At times she seems physically smaller than male colleagues and her stance as a trainee suggests that she is innocent and naïve. In spite of adversity she persists with her determination and fearlessness categorising her as a desirable female role model.<br/><br/>As an entire entity Silence of the Lambs is difficult to define within standard genre frameworks; indeed the inclusion of Dr Lecter's subplot opens the film to a vast array of generic labels. Although the climactic chase at the end is heavily immersed in the stock situations and relevant iconography of the cop genre, the taut meetings between Starling and Lecter convey a degree of suspense that would typically be attributed to a thriller or mystery film. Alternatively, the film may be described as a horror film, given the number of bodies discovered and Demme's frequent use of explicit post mortem investigations. Indeed, critic Roger Ebert argues that `[all the] universal phobias and dreads [are all to present in the movie]'. One thing is certain however; Silence of the Lambs is a modern masterpiece one that appears as potent and significant today some 10 years later."

","This is simply the scariest film of all time. Piece together some of the finest suspense-filled camera shots, a creeping, slithering score, some cut throat dialogue, and two of the greatest screen performances EVER, and you have the basis for The Silence Of The Lambs.<br/><br/>I know exactly why this film scares me so much. If it were not for this one ingredient, I would pass up this movie as just another psycho-thriller. But this movie scares me to my bare wits because of a character called Hannibal Lecter, and the virtuoso actor that is SIR Anthony Hopkins. It frightens me that there are people as sick and twisted as Hannibal Lecter in the world. It frightens me more that people as sick as him can be so intelligent and charming. And Hopkins makes me believe it. He makes me believe that Lecter could be real.<br/><br/>I don't want to get sidetracked into giving Hopkins all the praise, but every time he is on the screen in this film, my hair stands on end, my back starts to sweat and my hands start to shake. The first shot of Hannibal Lecter, stood erect and tall in his prison cell, waiting for Clarice, will flash in my mind for years to come whenever the movie is mentioned.<br/><br/>Foster is amazing too. Hopkins couldn't have been as good without an actress of her intelligence to gel with. She gives him just the right amount of respect while they share the screen, and this rubs off on her character. It is because of Foster that we are allowed to feel suffocated, frightened, almost ravaged by Lecter's intelligence, but equally intrigued by his knowleadgable and brilliant mind.<br/><br/>Ted Levine is excellent also. It's a difficult role that he takes on in this movie, yet he manages to be as sickening and disturbing as he needs to be. This is no easy task when you compare his screen time to that of Foster and Hopkins.<br/><br/>I can't buy this  movie. Simply because I buy movies to watch them alone when I have nothing else to do, and I can't watch this film alone. I symathise with Lecter too much, and that's probably what scares me the most. He enjoys exploiting people that are less intelligent than he is, and unfortunately, I can relate to that. The fact that I don't feel the urge to eat them is my only comfort.<br/><br/>All in all, you will not find a more tense, intelligent, disturbing thriller than this. Having watched Hannibal recently, I realised just HOW good this film was. And what a waste Lecter is when he isn't using his mastermind to get what he wants, to play with people. It's a role that only one actor could truly 'get his teeth into', and in Silence Of The Lambs, Sir Anthony has never been better.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch this film, make sure there's someone with you to hold your hand. Because otherwise you WILL forget that this is a film, you WILL become Starling, and Lecter WILL be truly in YOUR head too. And that's when the lambs start screaming....."

At different times of the story he comes of as a total intellectual mastermind who can get inside the head of anyone he wants to, and at other times he comes of as the most fearful thing you have ever witnessed. However, Hopkins is most terrifying when you don't expect at all, one of the great strengths of his character building. Even the way he say his lines can come off as he is actually a Psychopath. An incredibly wonderful performance."

","This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

This movie is perfectly adapted from Thomas Harris' novel of the same title. This is a redefinition of pure evil, and proof that your soul can only belong to you."
"Dignan_Tenenbaum","9","0","0","26 June 2001"," Truly the greatest movie of all time.
","Why is this the greatest movie ever, you might ask.  Well, for starters you can watch the movie several times over and get something different out of it each time.  Let me just clarify that by saying that I'm not a person who watches it over and over because 'Lecter is the greatest character ever and I idolize him.'  I like the movie because of the extreme detail we see in character development, the cinematography, and the tension that's built up. I can't sympathize with people who were shocked and horrified that Lecter would actually act the way he did in 'Hannibal.'  These people obviously never actually realized that he had been in that cell for a reason.<br/><br/>Anyway, every character in this film (except maybe Dr. Chilton) is changed by the end of it.  And isn't that why we choose to show the sequence of events that unfold in a story?  Every character has a great arc that is logically followed and believable.  Clarice is a wonderful character, and you really understand how she could affect a psycho-path in the manner that she did.  Crawford is presented as an interesting foil to Lecter in that he is the other predominant male figure in Starling's life.  After the loss of her actual father, she seems to seek these father figures to help her through her life.  That is, until the end when she has grown enough to strike out on her own.<br/><br/>As for getting more and more out of it with each viewing, to give you an example:  I recently revisited the film and the scene where Lecter is in the actual cage came up.  As Clarice is being dragged out, he hands her the case file and, in the process, brushes his finger against hers.  That particular shot of their hands has always given me the creeps.  But I finally realized that it was 'The Birth of Man.'  The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (please forgive my ignorance if I'm misspelling anything) depicts God bestowing life on Adam by touching his finger in a similar manner.  By handing Clarice the case file, Lecter is helping to save Catherine Martin's life.  She has taught him to care (even if it is only sometimes).  Now, maybe this wasn't the intent for the shot at all.  Or maybe it was the intent and it's so obvious that I'm a big dope for not having noticed it before, but I find these sorts of things every time I watch this movie.  And that, to me, makes it wonderful."

","Silence of the Lambs has got to be the greatest Thriller ever made. Hands down. It is so good. The acting is perfect, the camerawork is perfect, and the story is perfect. Can a movie be better than this? Yes, but very rarely is a movie better than this. Hannibal Lector is one of my favorite movie characters ever created. He is brilliant and he is psychotic. He is what every person has nightmares about in their dreadful dreams. He is what wakes people in the middle of the night and physically forces them out of bed to take a cold shower. Hannibal Lector is the epitomy of everything that is evil. Lector is the type of man that would make you vomit and make you smile at the same time. If you listen to every word he says, you will see the definition of ""genious"" spill out all over your mind. I think Hopkins deserved more than an Oscar for his perfect acting as Lector. That is how well he acted in that role. Of course Jodie Foster was great as Clarice Starling, but Hopkins steals the show.

","This film could not benefit any more from the amazing acting of Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter. He's so calm, collected and slightly likeable that he will scare you. I didn't think he had done until I had a nightmare that night dreaming he was by my bed repeating my name in the same hushed voice used when saying ""Clarice"". I can't think of anyone better suited for the role. Watch out for the part after he's killed two security guards. Standing with blood spattered over his face, his hands, his body he calmly turns on his classical music. Amazing. Jodie Foster is also good as the trainee FBI agent. The exchanges between her and Lecter are the main basis of the film and the most creepy. A brilliant film and I'm glad to see Hopkins will be reprising his role for 'Hannibal'."

","I cannot recommend or rate this film higher on my list of movies, but when all is said and done and the dust has settled, it is not without flaws.<br/><br/>The Silence Of The Lambs follows the story of Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who becomes entangled in a sort of psychological cat-and-mouse with the imprisoned Dr. Lecter in order to catch a serial killer who has a habit of skinning girls. Hannibal Lecter is a polite, cultured, and brilliant man who's desires are expressed in his curt tounge and in his desires for human flesh. and for every step Lecter helps Starling take, he is leading her farther into his mind.<br/><br/>as Lecter, Anthony Hopkins turns in possibly the best performance in recent memory. he raditates both amazing intelligence and humanity, and a chilling psychopathic edge. he steals the movie with less than 30 minutes of screen time (a quarter of the movie's whole).<br/><br/>Jodie Foster, as Starling, turns in a wonderfully subtle performance. watch her crumble as Lecter 'examines' her in an early scene without barely moving her face. we see about 5 expressions reflected on her visage simultaniously. later, when she must appear to be terrified, she looks it, in a realistic manner. try getting a more qualified actress.<br/><br/>sadly, outside of the Lecter/Starling relationship, the movie is still amazingly good, but pales in comparison to the chillingly appealing Lecter. Ted Levine is the weak link in the cast. he never acts truly scary, at least to me, but he doesn't act normal either. he appears almost clownish next to Lecter, and while he delivers everything that is expected of him in an effective manner, he never became a serious threat. of course, it's hard to imagine anybody else inhabiting his mazelike basement dungeon. and it's hard not to get creeped out when he begins calmly ordering a tourtered woman that ""it rubs the lotion on it's skin.""<br/><br/>in the end, Silence is an effective and intelligent movie that never outstays it's welcome. it is never really *scary*, but it is tense as anything you'll find in modern cinema. a modern classic, but nothing's perfect."

Hannibal Lecter is a fascinating character and Hopkins is marvelously mad as this maniac. His performance is nothing short of brilliant. Jodie Foster too is very good as Clarisse Starling. She is very believable as a young FBI agent who has to be against a mastermind such as Lecter. The scenes between her and Hannibal are spectacular. Actually, the story between her and Lecter make Buffalo Bill's part of the movie seem weaker than it really is. When you have such great scenes and have to live through good ones, you just hope the greatness will come back... And when Hannibal is back, so is greatness. The script in these scenes is just fantastic. They make an otherwise good movie excellent. The story in The Silence of The Lambs is very well written. As for the directing, Demme overuses the zooming in in some less important scenes a bit but his directing is still very effective and even excellent in some scenes. One near the end is seen through the eyes of Bill and is very well done(which is a good thing in a thriller).

","Terror and curiosity, these are the feelings Anthony Hopkins draws out of the viewer in the role of Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lecter. He is one of the few villains in cinematic history who can do these things and we are very thankful, as thankful as Clarice Starling, that he is behind the glass where he can't get to us. We have to get to know Hannibal because Clarice (Jodie Foster) has to do this. Clarice has to bargain with Hannibal using her own personal past in exchange for clues that will yield the identity of a serial killer. Buffalo Bill's his name and skinning plus-size women is his game. The next donor of material for his latest creation in fashion just happens to be a congress woman's daughter and that is why Hannibal is so important to us. He will provide the clues and just maybe they will be good enough before Bill can complete his sewing.    Movie magic is what happens when the young, beautiful and wise beyond her years Clarice Starling interviews Dr. Lecter. We recognize how vulnerable she is in his midst, even when he is locked away behind the glass. We shudder at every word spoken between the two because we know they could go either way. Yes, perhaps they can help capture Bill, but they may also give Lecter too much. Too much knowledge about Clarice and a glass may not protect her at all from the likes of Hannibal. When Foster and Hopkins are conversing we hang on every word with dreaded anticipation of what will be spoken next. The film is directed brilliantly by Demme and the screenplay is wonderfully adapted by Thomas Harris. Foster and Hopkins deserve every accolade and award they received for their performance. The lighting was perfect as the movie was often shot with very dim lighting framing the evil that lurks within this film. Lambs takes us into a deep dark world of evil, but not in a campy way. We are not overly consumed with gore and with the exception of Hannibal's escape we are not shown one murder on film. The suggestion of evil is there and very powerful through out without over indulgence. We know all too well that this is real and there may be and probably are people like Hannibal and Bill out there (Dahmer, Berkowitz, Bundy, etc). We know that there are lambs screaming every day in our world, crying out on their way to the slaughter house. This film just makes us realize it all the more."

","Dr. Hannibal Lecter: incredibly brilliant, amazingly deceptive and manipulative, and unspeakably evil.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" delves into the depths of the mind of Hannibal Lecter. In 1991, when ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was released, audiences were shocked when the previously mild-mannered Anthony Hopkins delivered the amazing performance as Hannibal Lecter.  It was the the third movie in history to recieve all five major Academy Awards, Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.  The Academy was right in giving the awards to this fantastic movie. Clarice Starling is taken away from her normal training as an F.B.I. agent and is dispatched to speak with Lecter, a formerly well known psychologist and now imprisoned murderer.  Her mission in this is to get a mental profile of Buffalo Bill, the current serial killer who the F.B.I. are desperately hunting down.  Maybe, if they had a mental profile from an actual serial killer, and cannibal, they could get inside the mind of Buffalo Bill and catch him.  Hannibal then more or less informs Clarice that Bill was once a patient of his.  As Clarice again interviews Lecter, the story unfolds. This film is more than just the pursuit to catch a serial killer, more than the actions of a serial killer, it is a journey into the mind of an enigma, Dr. Hannibal Lecter."

","I am continually disappointed seeing movie adaptations of books I've loved to read.  This is one of the few times I felt differently!  Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris' Silence of the Lambs is quite literally the most suspenseful, perfectly cast, exceptionally scored thriller in years. Kudos are due largely to the extraordinary performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins.  (To be truthful, even hearing him narrate this year's Grinch movie gave me the willies - imagine Hannibal Lecter in Whooville!?!).  Hopkins is delicious in his portrayal of the imprisoned doctor and Jody Foster's Clarice Starling is the perfect blend of intellect and innocence.  Both the tension and their rapport is instant and the sequel ""Hannibal"" will sorely miss this - Clarice will be played by actress Julianne Moore.  The screenplay was so true to the novel ( - agreed -  condensed as required - but true none the less).  My only complaint is the casting of Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford.  Unfortunately Glenn seemed a little too 'spit and polished' and a little less haggard (remember in the book he had nursed his terminally ill wife as well as made finding Lecter a crusade).  A more world-worn Nick Nolte may have satisfied my appetite better (no Hannibal pun intended). This is one of my top 10 favorite films and a definite ""must see"" for suspense/thriller fans."

","The above word is a serious understatement.  This movie was very well executed.  The acting was superb, the directing was dynamite.  It was a perfect thrill to watch. Jodie Foster was wonderful as Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee who is sent to Dr. Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lector in a crazy house for clues to a murderer. Anthony Hopkins was FANTASTIC as Hannibal.  The scenes with just he and Clarice are great, especially (MINOR SPOILER) when he passes her a towel through the drawer and announces she has a cut and is bleeding, and, well, you get why that can give you the creeps. Without giving away too many spoilers all I can really say is that The Silence of the Lambs deserves a 9.5."

In the same way that Harris' novel won critical acclaim the film, directed by Jonathan Demme, holds the audiences attention for the whole of its 2-hour length.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs tells the story of a young FBI graduate, Clarice Starling (Foster), who is investigating the abduction of several young girls by a serial killer 'Buffalo Bill'.  Her investigation leads her to the revered Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter (Hopkins), sentenced to life for murder, who helps Starling by offering her information on Buffalo Bill in return for a cell with a view.<br/><br/>It is obvious to see from the performances here why The Silence of the Lambs won awards in each of the five of the Academy's catagories.

"Quetzl","Null","0","0","24 April 2000"," A good Hollywood Movie *gasp*
","While the trendy thing to say is about the Silence of the Lambs is that Manhunter is a better film, as is often the case I believe that this trend is dead wrong. Manhunter is a very good film, and I personally recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Harris, crime movies, or movies in general. But it has strayed from the novel in many points in favor of telling a more traditional crime story, leaving out much of the personal anguish and spiritual torture which was the soul of the book. However there is this pervasive ideas that large budget, famous, ""Hollywood"" movies cannot possibly be great cinema, an idea which is both narrow-minded and hopelessly ignorant of the filmmaking process. Surely there is someone out there who can make a good film with a seemingly unlimited budget, the best available talent, and still render something an audience would like. (Of course, since part of the audience is American, I guess they would say an ignorent audience) The Silence of the Lambs is proof positive that this marvel of a feat can be accomplished. As all of the positives of the film have previously been accounted, I will take this opportunity to refute some of the criticisms of the antagonist.<br/><br/>     My personal favorites are the criticisms of the character of Hannibal Lector and his portrayer, Anthony Hopkins. The oft voiced gripes about his ""overacting"" are silly, as are the criticisms of the unreality of the character, at least to those who have read the novels. Hannibal Lector is presented within as a modern Mephistopheles, an incarnation of pure evil. He is smarter than you, stronger than you, more cultured than you, wiser than you. Worst of all, the character knows you better than you could ever conceive, your lies, your weaknesses, and your failings. He is just as interested in destroying your soul as well as your life. That is what Hopkins conveys in his Lector, an all knowing, all seeing being (NOT person, as noted in Red Dragon) who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything but himself. The only flaw that the character possesses (again, as noted in Red Dragon and Manhunter) is that he is insane, just like the Devil in Western folklore. Keep this in mind when you see Hopkins in Hannibal.<br/><br/>     Incidentally, I loved the critic who pointed out that they had never heard violins chime in during a dramatic scene in their life. Not only is that the most asinine argument I have ever heard for deriding a film (have you ever heard of suspension of disbelief?), but it is an argument which calls into question the validity the very foundations of all art. (What do you mean that's a woman? It's just paint on a canvas!) Good stuff."

","To keep up the goody goody cannibal spirit: ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a finger-licking GREAT thriller and one of the most righteous Academy Award winners in the history of cinema. Maybe I'm just saying that because I'm a big fan of nerve-racking thrillers and, let's face it, nerve-racking thrillers hardly ever win any Oscars, but apparently all audiences as well as all critics seem to agree that ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the worthy conquerer of 5 awards in the most eminent categories. The foundations of this cinematic milestone couldn't have been better, of course, with Thomas Harris' intriguing characterizations and basic story-idea (the efficiency was already proved in 1986, with ""Manhunter"") but really a lot of the film's brilliance is added by the Jonathan Demme and his outstanding cast. Despite not having directed a lot of horror/thriller films before this, Demme's knowledge of the genres is impressive and he terrifically manages to bring a constant level of tension without ever resorting to graphic violence or explicit gore. And that's quite an accomplishment because, primarily, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" handles about a sadistic serial killer, who eats his victims, who's recruited to assist in catching another sadistic serial killer, who skins his victims! Young FBI-trainee Clarice Starling is sent to Dr. Hannibal Lector's isolated prison cell to profile the new killer Buffalo Bill. But the highly intelligent and sophisticated Lector is only prepared to reveal clues about Buffalo Bill's modus operandi in exchange for answers to personal questions regarding Clarice's childhood.<br/><br/>Apart from being a truly exciting and rather educational serial-killer chase, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" also definitely is a compelling psychological drama-triumph! The 'Quid Pro Quo' conversations between Clarice and Dr. Lector are portrayed like highly competitive duels in which the young FBI agent isn't necessarily the weakest party! These conversations revolve on how determined both of them are willing to go in order to find out what they need to know and, simultaneously, we get to know how vulnerable Clarice actually is. These marvelous sequences appear to be even stronger thanks to the genuinely eerie and cold setting of Hannibal Lector's old, windowless cell. The camera perspectives throughout the whole film, as well as the cinematography in general, are impeccable and often trend-setting! Particularly classic is the ""parallel"" climax, which actually is a ridiculously simple and misleading trick but increases the suspense to an unprecedented high point. And then, of course, there are the acting performances but what praise can I possibly add that hasn't been said before? Anthony Hopkins is in one word hypnotic, Jodie Foster is pragmatic but truly overpowering and Ted Levine is genuinely terrifying as the personification of human complexity!"

","Academy Awards are rarely the sign of a great movie. The children of the Academy members, who do the actual voting, have notoriously pedestrian tastes. This movie does add some dramatic scenes and character development to improve on a poorly written novel. This movie's big draws, it would appear, were cannibalism, masogeny, and over-acting. Really great acting is transparent. If you're marvelling at the fantastic acting during the movie, then what you're enjoying is watching someone ""ham it up"" on the screen, not fine acting. The important thing is that the villain didn't have sex with the women, he just murdered them and skinned them, thus avoiding an x rating. And the females that we were aware of that did have sex were properly tortured for their sins. What I really find offensive is that Hannibal the Cannibal is portrayed as a likable monster, even after cutting off the face of an innocent guard in order facilitate his escape. Hannibal's a winner and American's love a winner, regardless of the atrocities he commits in order to achieve his goals. This movie sends the message that if we are clever and have no moral limits as to what we are willing to do, we'll succeed -which Hannibal does!

","Hannibal Lecter. The name that will spark interest, gain recognition, and most likely send a chill down your spine. He's one of the most interesting and well-known fictional serial killers, and this is probably the movie that manages to do him most justice. Anthony Hopkins as the serial killer, psychiatrist and cannibal was a great casting decision. He definitely performed the role as perfectly as it could be done. However, when it comes to the overall quality of the film, it just doesn't entirely measure up. The plot is good, and evolves at a pretty good pace; however, I couldn't manage to sit through the entire thing... I only barely made it, half-attentive, through the first 45 minutes. I couldn't even sit through more than 3/8's of the movie, let alone the whole thing. Now, this may be because I've seen it many times in the past years, but usually, when I can't sit through a movie because I have seen it before, it's due to my remembering most of the key parts of the movie, and not being surprised by it... but not this movie; I can say, in entire honesty, that I didn't remember or even recognize any of the film, despite having seen it plenty of times before, about one time a year. If I remember anything from a movie, that I haven't seen for a long time, it's because it had an impact on me; for example, I still haven't forgotten the twist of the famous Hitchcock horror-thriller, Vertigo, despite the fact that I've seen it once, and that was about five years ago. Nothing in this movie had an impact on me, nothing affected me deeply. Maybe I'm hard to impress, maybe I am too hardened by worse films... but still. The film involves sick and disturbing characters and actions; it should have an impact on the viewer. Maybe I'm not smart enough to get it; maybe I keep expecting the film to be very different from what it was... I don't know. I just didn't find this film as good as it has been made out to be. The acting is very good; Hopkins nails the role of Lecter perfectly. Foster is good, too. Both portray their roles convincingly, and make their characters and their actions credible. The characters are well-written, credible and, well, colorful. Buffalo Bill makes a great villain, very psychotic and disturbing. Levine also gives a very good performance. All in all, a pretty good horror-thriller, but inferior to Se7en(arguably the best of the genre), and only enjoyable for people who can appreciate the psychological aspects of the film(which I guess I can't). I recommend it exclusively to people who can enjoy a very psychological thriller-horror piece. 8/10"

","Every once in awhile, a film comes along that introduces a character so original that it is impossible to turn away. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is exactly this type of experience.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Silence of the Lambs"" sees young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) given her first assignment: interrogate Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychologist-turned-psychopath. In trying to glean some information from Hannibal about the grizzly ""Buffalo Bill"" murders, Clarice catches the caged madman's sense of gamesmanship and enters into a battle of wits with the thought-provoking Lector.<br/><br/>This film primarily works because of the Hannibal Lector character. From out of nowhere, he becomes one of the most iconic villains in cinema history. He's clearly a crazed personality (as evidenced by his cannibalistic tendencies), but at the same time he is utterly brilliant ability to dissect the inner human psyche. His inner battle of wits with Agent Starling is incredibly interesting material that never gets old no matter how many times it is viewed.<br/><br/>However, the film is also just an overall general masterpiece in pretty much all areas. The basic plot involving the Buffalo Bill maniac is chilling (especially the heart-pounding ending), the music is also creepily in the background, and the visuals are scary while still managing to be realistic.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever made. It created an iconic character, launched the career of Jodi Foster, and carved itself a place in many ""greatest of all- time"" lists. I've viewed it multiple times and it always seems to evoke the same creepy emotions every single time (the mark of a truly chilling viewing experience)."

","In this film, the young and inexperienced FBI Agent Starling will need the help of Hannibal Lecter, a dangerous and manipulative cannibal, to capture a serial killer. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it has screenplay by Ted Tally, and has the participation of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Won five Oscars (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay; was also nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing).<br/><br/>This film needs no introduction and has already become a classic. The Hanibal character is a horror icon and consecrated Hopkins as one of the greatest masters of representation of the late twentieth century. Decidedly, watching this film, we have the notion that all factors combined, in the ideal measure, to make a piece of art that, even so, due to the topic and some more shocking scenes, is not suitable for sensitive people.<br/><br/>The script is excellent and works in a masterly manner, without errors or holes. The work of director was essential for the success of the film, along with the performance of the actors themselves. In fact, even the supporting actors in the film were very good in their roles, although the spotlight have been under the heads of Hopkins and Foster. The two actors were brilliant, the way they interact is a drama lesson. The penetrating gaze of Hopkins, and his viperous cynicism, are one of the registered marks of the film.

","Ever since I was a little kid, I was obsessed with reading pulp horror. I've read more from the genre than anyone I personally know. Being a soon-to-be-published author myself, I've learned more about the genre by constantly reading than by any writing seminar I've ever been to. For those who don't read, by simple definition, pulp horror is: a story that is genuinely terrifying and thrilling, but purposely lacks any forced literary moral. Stephen King is pretty much the poster-child of this style of writing. With all of that said, when The Silence of the Lambs, the novel, was released and received mass critical acclaim for being the ""perfect"" horror-thriller, even being the major genre-whore that I am, I could really care less. Why? Simple because I'd read so many books EXACTLY like it, I had no interest. A few years later, when the movie was released, I felt the exact same way. This is why I've waited so long to view this ""impossible-to-miss!"" film. Because I knew it was just more of the same. When I finally decided to force myself to watch it, I found my gut instinct was underestimating. The Silence of the Lambs is not only just more of the same unoriginal story that we've all heard so many times that it's second nature to us, it's also cheesy, immature, over-glamorized, and, in the end, completely laughable. And here is why . . .<br/><br/>First and foremost: The Silence of the Lambs is, unarguably, 100% unoriginal. There is not a single original—or even creative—concept in the entire runtime of the film. This paragraph of my review is not my opinion. The way I view the world has no bearing on what has or hasn't been done in storytelling before. Saying that it's my opinion that The Silence of the Lambs is unoriginal is equivalent to saying that it's my opinion that the sky is blue. And just as childish. With that said, I can literally point you, scene-by-scene, to where every single idea in The Silence of the Lambs has been written and filmed in the past. Dressed to Kill, for a major example. From the formula, to the characters, to the situations, to the set-up: it's all, unarguably, one giant genre cliché. And, as I said, I can point to every movie, every book that has used the EXACT scenes in the past. This isn't just a coincidence; it's an unabashed lack of creativity and intelligence from the writer. Just more of the same cliché Hollywood and pulp fiction conventions we've seen all our lives. All the standard clichés are here, folks: romantic subplot, tension at the agency, troubled childhoods, etc., etc., etc.<br/><br/>Hannibal Lector himself is, admittedly by the author, nothing but a mash-up of various fictional and real-life serial killers. The two most obvious fictional killers he unabashedly rips-off are Leatherface (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1974) and Mark Lewis (Peeping Tom, 1960). Leatherface's actions (cannibal, wears victim's faces) + Lewis's mind (pretentious, psychiatrist, study's human behavior, kills people to study reactions, gives long speeches about serial killers, has a supposed vast knowledge of the human mind) = Hannibal Lector. There is not a single character trait that Lector has that wasn't done nearly 40 years before he was written. Again, a kindergarten lack of creativity. I honestly don't even know how his character got past copyright laws.<br/><br/>Not to mention Hannibal's cheesy persona. He pronounces ""liver"" with slurping sounds at the end. So did 3-year-olds, but I don't cower in fear of them. He never actually DOES anything on-screen, except talk. And talk. And when he does talk, he talks with the pseudo-intelligence of a high-school dropout who took a semester of psychology. Why? Because his psychological knowledge is laughably limited, and sometimes incorrect all together. He's supposed to be this oh-so-evil genius, but all he ever does is quote cliché phrases from dumbed-down Freud. He knows NOTHING about psychology. The pathetic writers just wrote enough cliché psychobabble between his laugh-out-loud cheesy slurping sounds to make it seem like he knew at least as much about the human mind as the average middle-school student. And then, just like all over-glamorized Hollywood, every time Hannibal is on the screen they point the camera up at his face with light shining behind his head as he stares at the ceiling without blinking. That's not good acting. That's made-for-TV directing they use in low-budget Jesus movies. Hannibal Lector is nothing but an awkward middle-aged man who is obsessed with talking and breaking copyright laws. How is that unnerving? If I met him, I'd laugh in his face and tell him to grow up.<br/><br/>So, at root value, I'm just trying to ask: What is so great about this movie? It's a generic crime thriller. It opens up with a generic cop-meets-killer scene, and ends with a generic cheesy-killer-in-the-house scene. Everything in between is exactly what you'd expect from an over-glamorized generic Hollywood thriller. It has NO significance whatsoever when it comes to originality. And as far as entertainment value goes, I don't see what's so entertaining in watching a middle-age man talk for an hour on end. If that entertains you, I pity you.<br/><br/>Oh my God! This movie TERRIFIED me! Why? Because an awkward middle-aged man pronounced ""liver"" like a 3-year-old.<br/><br/>I'll say the same thing to those of you who gave this movie a high score as I'd say to Hannibal Lector: GROW UP.<br/><br/>2/10"

To be shocking and unsettling for the purpose of creating a lurid freak show is another. This movie never even makes the most cursory attempt to look at what motivates the serial killers it portrays. It just wants to be creepy. Creepy it is, and full of suspense, too. But since when does that earn you a Best Picture Oscar? ""Jurassic Park"" was creepy and full of suspense, in far skillful and artistic ways, yet the suggestion that it was award worthy would have brought guffaws.<br/><br/>The performances of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are good, but definitely not Oscar worthy. In fact, for Hopkins supporting role to be included as Best Actor is abysmally ridiculous. And for all the hype that has surrounded the character of Hannibal Lecter, he is nothing but a by-the-numbers Hollywood pshycopath. <br/><br/>In short, parts of this film are well done (others are not), and unlike most contemporary horror films it's genuinely frightening.

","It seems to be a favorite hobby for some Christian-minded thinkers with superficial world view to take on books and stories that are written from and only understandable from a specifically non-Christian and anti-psychiatric almost satanic frame of mind.<br/><br/>It's as if a Priest pretended to be interested and infatuated with the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and made a documentary of his philosophy attempting to manifest the nature of good and evil within the philosophy of a philosopher that is famous for tearing down the very idea of good and evil.<br/><br/>The main idea in the Hannibal books is supposed to center on the depth of their own human nature that the detectives are forced to face when they confront Hannibal. How justice itself revolves around the concept of murder just like being an adult involves the symbolical need to murder ones parents. (Symbolical murder of the idea of parents is needed for the idea of parents as actual separate people, other adults.) One cannot have a view on justice without a willingness for a symbolical murder of injustice.<br/><br/>Where in Clarice Starling do we see this soul of a murderer that is supposed to be depicted in this story? Nowhere. Because the story of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not included in this movie.

","The greatest horror thriller ever made. Jonathan Demme's psychological horror thriller The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a masterclass in creative filmmaking, poignant acting, and striking visual storytelling. Demme directs The Silence of the Lambs with an eye for visual metaphors whether it's FBI agent Clarice Starling, played by the endearing Jodie Foster, standing meekly as a short female FBI student among her tall male co-workers. Demme keeps you gripped by showing you crime evidence photos, realistic corpses of victims, cuts to the killer's activities, and showing consultations with an infamous cannibal doctor. Demme's direction is intriguing with a constant unnerving representation of killers or their victims. You are forced to follow Starling's investigation into the brutal killings of a madman named Buffalo Bill. It's a creative cinema masterpiece as it remains always entertaining and genuinely chilling. Howard Shore's score is unsettling with subtle eerie melodies and soaring scary themes rushing around the gruesome crimes herein. Shore composes memorable music for The Silence of the Lambs that continues to frighten any audience that dares to view this classic movie. Notably, Jodie Foster gives her arguably her greatest performance in The Silence of the Lambs, and she was in Taxi Driver! Foster brings a sincere warmth, sympathetic trauma, inspiring gusto, and engaging intelligence to her role as Clarice Starling. She's an ambitious and cool FBI woman with top ranking in her class and a desire to become a real FBI agent. I love how Foster depicts the investigative process as serious and rational, especially in the face of crazy, seemingly random killings. Foster finds Clarice's earnest approach to communicating with a flesh craving cannibal and brings Clarice a clarity of conscious and morality that is fascinating in every scene. I appreciate Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs more with each viewing of Jonathan Demme's iconic film. Of course, most remember Sir Anthony Hopkins in his groundbreaking performance as serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter also known as Hannibal the Cannibal. Hopkins never blinks to throw you off balance in his imposing staring portrayal is simply marvelously creepy. Hopkins boasts a frightening stocky stature and suddenly violent physicality to his Hannibal that makes his Lecter even scarier than Brian Cox's archetypal portrayal back in Michael Mann's Manhunter. Hopkins plays the psychological torture by the doctor's words toying with Clarice to perfection. He is curious and cruel with malicious intent and shocking again and again. Hopkins will never not scare me anytime I see him as Hannibal Lecter. I should mention Scott Glenn is great as the FBI head Jack Crawford. His accidental sexism is beautifully portrayed by the nuanced Glenn. He is steadfast as a lawman, but always belittles Clarice, while encouraging her work. It's an interesting bit of acting and writing for an interesting character. Anthony Heald is so slimy and creepy and the sadistic narcissist Dr. Frederick Chilton. Last, but surely not least, Ted Levine is absolutely terrifying as the serial killer Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb. His feminine body language, effeminate voice, lithe appearance, brutal physicality, crafty killing, and playful attitude all culminate in the vicious atrocity of Buffalo Bill's character. Levine plays up the fact that Bill thinks he's a transsexual so well that you are fearful of his sudden changes in personality and masculinity. He embodies both masculine and feminine traits, thus creating a nebulous figure in Buffalo Bill. His character can be anyone and that's what makes him so scary. Levine's acting during the ""tuck"" scene as well as while meeting Clarice is just wonderful acting. Ted Levine is more versatile than I feel critics and audiences are willing to give him credit for as Levine is every bit a monstrous and scary as Hopkins' Hannibal. Overall, The Silence of the Lambs demands to be seen and will haunt you forever after witnessing all its glorious filmmaking and stunning crime."

","The horror genre has constantly gotten a bad rep over the years for being nothing but mindless gore, shocks, and popcorn entertainment. Even still, there have been many horror films that have managed to leak their way into the mainstream and capture the imaginations and hearts of a wide audience. The Silence of the Lambs proves that you don't need buckets of blood or a shock a minute to tell a thoughtful, unnerving, and unforgettable horror story.<br/><br/>Clarice Starling is an up and coming FBI agent who gets the opportunity of a lifetime - probing the mind of the deranged (but oddly charming) Hannibal Lector - a cannibal. Clarice needs information about a recently captured girl who she fears might be the next victim of an even more damaged psychopath who wants to wear her skin. Clarice and Hannibal end up working together to find him, but will Clarice be too late?<br/><br/>The trick of Silence of the Lambs is that it spends as much time with character development as it does with the action, thrills, and horror. We get to know Clarice and Hannibal over the course of the film and Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins have never been better (hence their well-deserved Oscar wins).<br/><br/>It also helps that every frame of the film feels real. Even small cameo roles are drenched in a quirky realism. We feel like we know or have seen people like this. The locations all feel like places we've encountered before. All this adds up to make the film way scarier than it has the right to be. There aren't any major jump scares in the film, but due to its realism and attention to every day detail, the film becomes all the more terrifying, because it's a world we recognize and we know we could very well be the next victim."

","Watching THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS again, after many years, it's evident just how much of a classic it truly is. The influence of this film on a generation of horror / thriller / suspense movies is obvious, as well as it's direct effect on TV shows, especially THE X-FILES. Perhaps taken for granted now, the stark realism / unflinching, boundary-breaking terror of TSOTL was unprecedented in any mainstream, American film of its era. In addition, the depth of the characters and intricacies of the plot raised this movie far above the usual, police procedural fare. Of course, today, Jodie Foster's FBI Agent Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins' unpredictable madman, Hannibal Lecter are well-known, but in 1991 they made jaws drop to the floor w/ their intense game of psychological chess. Starling and Lecter's symbiotic relationship was the heart, soul, mind, and strength of the film. Nothing like it had ever been seen or heard in any movie of its kind! Transcending its genre, this movie is a milestone which holds up incredibly well. Mesmerizing from start to finish, with so many brilliant twists and an unforgettable conclusion / epilogue. It jars and jolts without pandering. Bon appetit..."

","The Silence Of The Lambs is a riveting psychological thriller that gets in your head and under your skin. The film is done really well and the story is engrossing and both the motivations of the killer and law enforcement are explored and understood. Anthony Hopkins brings it big time with an iconic performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter which won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. The film won multi academy awards that year, which also had Jodie Foster walk away with a gold statue as well with her best performance ever as FBI agent/trainee Clarice Starling. Scott Glenn and Ted Levine are strong support for this very dark and suspenseful film. Director Jonathan Demme made a remarkable film that has no equal until Seven comes out. There is no doubt that The Silence Of The Lambs would be influential to Seven and many other films and for what it is, it is flawless. The sequel Hannibal however is not nearly as good, but this is mandatory viewing for anyone that wants to be movie literate, The Silence Of The Lambs is a must see."
"juliankennedy23","10","1","2","12 May 2019"," Poor Ted Levine
","The Silence of the Lambs: 10 out of 10: An FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned by her boss (Scott Glenn) to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a serial killer, whose insight might prove useful in the pursuit of another serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine).<br/><br/>In the history of the Oscars Silence of the Lambs is one of the most exceptional outliers. It went into wide release on Valentine's Day 1991 and yet swept all five major Academy Awards fourteen months later. (Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role Anthony Hopkins, Best Actress in a Leading Role Jodie Foster, Best Director Jonathan Demme, Best adapted Screenplay Ted Tally).<br/><br/>Only two other films had accomplished this before; It Happened One Night (1934) One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975), and no film has achieved this since. The Silence of the Lambs was a film that kind of opened slow and gathered steam by word of mouth far away from the Oscar bait crowd. Also, The Silence of the Lambs was an R rated horror film a genre severely underrepresented by the Oscars. There is not anything else like it in Oscar history.<br/><br/>The Good: Let us start with the acting. Anthony Hopkins runs away with the movie despite powerful performances from the other three leads. He avoids the undeniable urge to overact and chew scenery. After all, he is playing a cannibal serial killer, and a lesser actor's inclination would be more Heath Ledgers Joker than Masterpiece Theater. By not making any sudden movements and using only his voice and eyes in the opening scenes it sets the character up to be effective when he is tied to a hand truck with a Jason hockey mask covering everything but his eyes.<br/><br/>When Hopkins finally lets loose, he has lulled us into such a state of admiration that it truly is shocking. They told us he was a vicious killer and a cannibal. They tell us of what Hopkins did to that nurse just a little while ago biting out her tongue (Director Demme lets the characters see the photo of the incident but wisely hides it from the audience) Hopkins himself told us about eating the census taker's liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti. He is still a live wire so to speak, but we are so charmed we let our guard down as an audience which makes it that more believable when the characters on screen make the same error.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster's Oscar win was also well deserved. The script and director do her a dozen favors. The way Demme shoots his scenes reminds us just how small and vulnerable Jodie Foster is. The script has every character in the movie subtly (or not so subtly) hit on Jodie Foster's character. Even (or especially) her mentor Scott Glenn. Foster's relationship with Glenn has an undercurrent of tension whether he will risk approaching her outside of the professional bounds and honestly whether she, with her father issues, would be receptive to the same. This vulnerability makes the character work on a level rarely since in this genre. Foster's mastery of both the accent and the physical space add incredible dimension to an already fascinating character.<br/><br/>The Ted Tally's script based on a book by Thomas Harris cheats a bit in at least one memorable scene, and it is a testament to the strength of the story that instead of being annoyed by it I applaud it. The story is complicated enough to be interesting but told in a straight forward manner that avoids talking killers (Well except for Hannibal but that is after all his thing) and those last minute reveals. The entire production has that subtle, realistic midwestern sheen and color palate that reminded me of The Fugitive movie. The movie feels almost a documentary at times as its sense of time and place are so well grounded.<br/><br/>The Bad: Poor Ted Levine. He is the big bad in the best horror movie of the year, and no one remembers him. He was overlooked for an Oscar nomination in a year that wasn't exactly very strong (The best supporting actor category had two nominees from Warren Beatty's Bugsy and the winner was Jack Palance from City Slickers.). His flamboyant wild take on Buffalo Bill would have been the talk of the town in any other movie, but Anthony Hopkins took all the serial killer oxygen out of the room, and bluntly people forget there was another serial killer in the film.<br/><br/>The ugly. To make matters worse for Ted Levine his character was the target of some quite serious protests. To quote Screenhub ""Gumb has a white poodle named precious, dances around wearing women's clothes and a scalp, and has had a homosexual relationship with at least one male in his past. On the surface, it seems pretty obvious that the character is a negative stereotype of the LGBT community."" As the Los Angeles Times reported in their Oscar coverage ""Threats by gay groups to disrupt the proceedings to protest the treatment of homosexuals in such films as ""The Silence of the Lambs"" did not materialize. But outside the Music Center, at least ten people were arrested during a noisy protest by hundreds of demonstrators.""<br/><br/>Hollywood has a rich history of the gay or transvestite killer in movies from Psycho, to (1983 spoiler alert) Sleepaway Camp, to my personal favorite Gene Simmons in Never Too Young to Die. It turns out Silence of the Lambs seemed to be a breaking point for the LGBT community. There is even a story that Jonathan Demme purposely made Philidelphia after Silence of the Lambs as an apology to the LGBT community as if he was D. W. Griffith making Intolerance as an apology for Birth of a Nation.<br/><br/>There is only one person from the original production of Silence of the Lambs who still gets asked about such things in these enlightened times. Poor Ted Levine. Here he is playing a character that everyone forgot except those that were protesting it. That Screenhub quote above isn't contemporaneous. It's from a 2018 interview with Ted, and they treat him a bit as if he was Hanoi Jane or something. (Ted's attempt to explain how his character wasn't gay digs the hole a little deeper in all fairness but seriously leave poor Ted Levine alone.)<br/><br/>In Conclusion: The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best out and out horror films made. I know since it won a bunch of Oscars people like to call it a thriller but one character eats people, and another skins them alive and wears their skin as an outfit. I am going to go with a horror film for this one."

","It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice<br/><br/>Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins<br/><br/>I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it"
"CubsandCulture","7","1","2","31 January 2019"," Ultimately silly
","This film is a perfectly pleasant way to spend an raining afternoon. The film is engaging and fills the viewer with the requisite dread. Hannibal is a great monster. He conforms perfectly to the antihero archetype as he typifies the best qualities of humanity gone disastrously wrong. Hopkins chews scenery with the best of them. Clarice, especially in Foster's hands, is a strong character with buried psychological trauma that is fighting to get out. The interplay the two characters stands apart from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Part of the reason for that is the rest of it so much worse than the leads. Of note, Buffalo Bill's villainy is steeped in lazy cultural tropes. The screenplay bothering to distinguish between Bill and a ""real"" transsexual does not make it any less lazy to othering a male villain by feminizing him. The bread crumbs of the mystery are likewise rote and basic. A moth is used as a symbol of transformation! Riveting! LAMBS!<br/><br/>This is genre film that has been treated way too seriously. This is something of a bad joke."
"mshackletonchavez","8","1","2","1 December 2018"," Unforgettable.
","What a movie. Stark, cold and yet rich in character, development and suspense. Truly an achievement in all aspects.<br/><br/>Most notably I must praise the decorous performances from all actors. Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter is truly a performance for the ages, something to be remembered for its sheerly raw portrayal of such a twisted, crude, manipulative and frankly evil character. It could have very easily fallen into cliche and been corny and uninteresting, but due to Anthony Hopkins caliber as an actor and Jonathan Demme's masterful directing, it is truly a performance to which all others in its field must be compared for the decades to come. The audience feels the shrill and cruelty oozing from his every word, it is an archetypal career defining performance.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster was absolutely spectacular as Clarice Starling, once again. this is a career defining performance. It plays on par with Anthony Hopkins, as they spar between the glass, going to and fro between emotion, disgust, curiosity and fear. For they both feel these emotions to one another, and it gives the audience a true experience, unseen in many films. She plays the hard Agent Starling to near perfection, displaying her wonder and fear of the case, and her young naiveness but displaying that it is suppressed. A highly multi-layered character that very few actresses could perform with such gravitas and capability.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast must be commended, for they all deliver in their respective strengths. Most notably Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford and the other prison inmates. As well as Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, playing the confused, conflicted and disgusting character whose emotions and frustrations for not being let a sex change led him to take 'revenge' on women. I believe that Ted Levine delivers this moral inner conflict extremely well, most notably when he is silent, in particular the dancing scene where it is only him and a woman's scalp upon his head. Truly disgusting but absolutely masterful acting and film making.<br/><br/>The directing by Jonathan Demme very much shines through into the final product. Although I have not seen his other features, his style is highly distinctive as is shown within the film. When put in tandem with the cinematography, the extreme closeups on faces and the lack of many wide shots makes the feature feel constricted, like a lack of breathing space. This works to its advantage, as it adds to the fear, bemusement and harrowing nature of the subject matter. Then when it does pan into larger atmospheres, it indicates that turmoil is to come. Such as how the holding facility in Tennessee for hannibal Lecter is an open room, then it devolves into calculated chaos.<br/><br/>This clever use of cinematography works as great strength to the film, further aided by Howard Shore's distressing score. It truly compliments the film and does not dictate emotion, it heightens them. As it works with the film and not for it, this makes it stand out within the Horror/Thriller genre.<br/><br/>The more technical aspects, such as the sound design all are eerie to further heighten the distressing suspense and are great additions to the feature. The costumes are all well designed and help to compliment the character traits, most notably with Ted Levine and Clarice Starling they help to indicate their characterisation and emotional story, particularly where they start in the beginning of the film as characters.<br/><br/>Although I greatly enjoyed this feature, it has some weaker aspects. Hannibal Lecter disappears for a good portion of the film, and as he of such note in his long disappearance it actually somewhat detracts from the film. However when he reappears it is a exceedingly good moment. The film portrays the violence extremely gruesomely, which I understand it part of the narrative and genre but does not match up with my taste exactly, but I understand why it is as prevalent as it is and I cant criticise it as filmmaking since this simply a personal view of mine.<br/><br/>I felt as if some characters were only servants to further Starlings characterisation, although the scenes in which this takes place are effective, those other characters feel a little wasted, such as Anthony Heald as Frederick Chilton, although his characters final fate is highly effective, but also Jack Crawford felt a little too bland as a character and not developed as strongly as could have been, but this doesn't detract from the film much as his characterisation is present but not as strong as it had the potential to be.<br/><br/>On the whole I very much liked this film, the acting, directing, score, sound and screenplay are all great strengths to make such as stark and memorable film. I would definitely recommend this film and give it a truly good and firm 8/10"

","Everyone remembers Anthony Hopkins' delicious take on an epicurean monster and they should since its good enough to hold the whole the movie, near enough...<br/><br/>But asides from these startlingly well written little monologues it's remarkable what a bland movie this otherwise is. I have an issue with any narrative that at its centre just follows law enforcement tracking down a killer. It leaves very little room for any meaningful development of either the plot or the characters, no matter what the details of the case, it always treads a familiar path. A big part of a story for me is what motivates the main character but with these kinds of things the answer is ""it's their job"" and Jodie Foster laying on the Saccharine about a bunch of farm animals only strikes me as a contrived way to humanize a basic, taciturn character type.<br/><br/>The movie is obsessed with suggesting there is some type of spiritual connection between Hannibal and Clarice, but it is entirely an informed attribute.
The whole murder at its centre just feels like an arbitrary McGuffin as an excuse to get Anthony Hopkins out, so I guess I can't blame it."

It's one of those rare films where everyone is just cast perfectly — an amazing feat considering Al Pacino was considered for the role of Lecter (yikes).<br/><br/>It follows young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as she is asked by the head of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit (Scott Glenn) to interview an imprisoned, cannibalistic psychiatrist-turned-serial killer (Anthony Hopkins) who is believed to be linked to a killer they are currently hunting, known as ""Buffalo Bill"". Starling gets closer than expected to the doctor as she does whatever it takes to catch the monster at large<br/><br/>** SPOILERS! **<br/><br/>Jodie Foster's ability to portray Starling as both vulnerable yet commanding, young and green and yet self-possessed, giving sideways glances to the many men who attempt to hold her down or hold her back while adeptly sidestepping them, is one of my favorite parts about this film. She is repeatedly shown surrounded by men — in many scenes literally dwarfed standing alongside them — and yet she doesn't shy away. But the theme of women being used is pervasive throughout, from the blatant — Buffalo Bill torturing and ritually killing his female victims for their skin — to the more insidious — Glenn sending Starling, the young, pretty trainee, to get the information he needs from Lecter, all the while excluding her, dismissing her, casting her aside.<br/><br/>The cinematography, helmed by Tak Fujimoto, is intense and deliberate. Dr. Lecter is regularly shrouded in harsh shadow; the initial tour through Buffalo Bill's home is simple and unapologetic; symbolism is used with just enough subtlety, such as when Lecter is shown reflected and almost overlaid with Starling's face looking through the glass, or when Starling is grasping blindly through the pitch blackness of Buffalo Bill's home and world. Even scenes whose subject matter are grisly manage to carry a degree of fascinating beauty — Lecter, eyes closed, swaying along to the music, as we see the officers he just murdered with his teeth laying behind him; thick beams of light streaming in behind a body strewn up like an angel with arms outstretched; Buffalo Bill dancing, silk robe falling off his shoulders, tiny squares of light bouncing from a spinning disco ball.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the casting is spot on. There is no one I could imagine doing more justice to Lecter than Anthony Hopkins — he is chilling, calculated, vicious (""when your little girl is on the slab, where will it tickle you?""), fiercely intelligent. Jodie Foster as Starling is naïve and while not completely fearless she is determined. Their chemistry together is what really makes it — the entire scene with the story of the lambs is particularly incredible. Ted Levine as Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb will make your skin crawl while almost feeling a degree of pity, and his captive in the movie — played by Brooke Smith — does a particularly gut-wrenching job.<br/><br/>The music (by Howard Shore) is fantastic — from the very first scene, with Starling running, drenched in sweat, through the foggy woods — it is captivating and haunting.<br/><br/>It just so perfectly balances the themes of intelligent psychological thriller and horror. It regards such violence and depravity with a cool casualness that is downright chilling. The dialogue is brilliant. It is brutal and unapologetic while maintaining a neatness, an insistent intention, that makes the aesthetic quality impossible to ignore. And the tension is palpable throughout — you aren't bored for a second — but it reaches a deafening crescendo at the end, with perfect edits made to maintain the mystery and keep you on the edge of your seat. Buffalo Bill watching Clarice through night vision goggles, reaching out to almost graze his hand against her hair, has been imprinted in my memory as one of the scariest scenes ever since I first saw this movie as a kid. And let's not forget how much we're rooting for Lecter by the end, almost grinning as we watch him deliberately trail behind Dr. Chilton, hoping to catch up over dinner later<br/><br/>Brilliant. Just brilliant."

","The silence of the lambs was a movie I had been told to watch for a long time. Considering the fact that there are very few movies where I can see a rape scene and still like the movie, I had not watched it yet. I watched this movie and I had taken it all wrong. There was a few scenes that were hard to watch, such as the abduction of a young girl, but the movie was still worth watching. The movie was vulgar but who does not love a vulgar movie? I do. It was fun to watch the main character and Hannibal ""bond"" as he sort of got in her head and it was great to see how much the detective would take to be better at her job.

","One of my personal favourite movies! Anthony Hopkins is phenomenal and I honestly don't think anyone could have done a better Hannibal Lecter than him. The role was made for him. Very scary. <br/><br/>The two scenes that are burned into my mind is the scene where he has hanged the cop up like an angel from the ceiling. Was terrified when I saw that. The other scene is when the girl is in the well of Buffalo Bill and is trying to lure down the dog. I don't know why, but that scene was one of the most scary."

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a thriller and I am not a big thriller's fan, I like, but no more and this movie does not unfortunately derogate from the rule. Despite a very convincing and masterful Anthony Hopkins in the role of a Hannibal Lecter that we only see twenty minutes but which marks us, being fascinating while keeping a very disturbing side that defines well Hannibal Lecter but it must be said, Jody Foster in the role of Clarice Starling is also very good. Unfortunately I did not really get into the film, a shady atmosphere but that did not affect me more than that and scenes of Lecter can be too made to be ""shock"" and not psychological enough for my taste. However it remains for me a good movie and a cult movie that I will see again in a few years, with the hope of succeeding in entering this film which is worth only a 7/10 for me today.

","I have loved this movie for almost a decade that acting by Jodie Foster is superb, as she plays Clarice you get the feeling she is smart but has no clue of the pile she has stepped in. Sir Anthony Hopkins name goes without saying has breached past the form of acting and dove into characters on many occasions. While you are watching the movie you almost forget it isn't real. Hannibal Lector a character that even with the book didn't have enough character until played by Sir Hopkins. There will always be imitations but there is only one original.The combination of Foster and Hopkins is a masterpiece, so much when the red haired decent actor Julianne Moore was to reprise the role of Clarice I was utterly disappointed in someone trying to ruin what was already grand. I was proved true my disappointment was confirmed, although Moore is a great actor the part of Clarice has been sealed as Foster as well as Sir Hopkins as Lector."

"joshuafagan-64214","10","1","2","27 August 2016"," Still Frightening and Crisp
","Clarice Starling is the perfect name for the protagonist of this film. A starling is a bird, a little bird, that comes in flocks. A single starling by itself is weak, innocent, vulnerable. Clarisse is harder to define, but the long 's' sound makes it sound like a wind blowing through a peaceful field. When I hear the name Clarisse, I think of a rich teenage ingénue in a blue dress leaning dreamily on a white balcony.<br/><br/>No, Clarice Starling is not all those things, mostly because she is played by the gritty Jodie Foster, but that is the roll she is cast into at the beginning of the film. She manages to work her way out of her situation as the hunts the serial killer Buffalo Bill, but there is one man who can cast her back into it, one man who can turn her back into a ten-year-old girl and steal away all her personal secrets.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentleman, meet the man, the legend, Hannibal Lecter. Even you've never seen this or even heard of this movie, you've heard of Hannibal Lecter. When AFI released its list of the top 50 heroes and the top 50 villains in all of cinema, Hannibal Lecter was number 1 on the villain list. It's telling that Anthony Hopkins received an Oscar for playing this character despite getting limited screen time. Hannibal can strike fear into Clarisse Starling. He can certainly strike fear into you.<br/><br/>Humanity is afraid of smart people. Smart people can disrupt the current order of things, breezing by without breaking a sweat. Humanity is afraid of crazy people. Crazy people are unburdened by the moors of society, and have no problem breaking down boundaries. Humanity is afraid of stoic people. Stoic people can stand their ground even when the world around them turns to fire and blood, and so they can gain a leg up on their emotional brethren.<br/><br/>Hannibal Lecter is smart, crazy, and stoic. That is a dangerous combination. Smart people are normally not crazy, and even when they are, they usually make an emotional mistake. Crazy people are normally not stoic, and even when they are, they are not smart enough to pull off their schemes. Stoic people are normally not smart, and even when they are, they typically are not crazy enough to disrupt the entire order of things.<br/><br/>In many ways, he is the perfect villain. He even has the perfect villain name. Hannibal rhymes with cannibal, of course, but it is also the name of the famous leader of Carthage, who led elephants over the Alps in the Punic wars in an attempt to destroy the Roman Empire. Lecter, meanwhile, sounds conniving, due to both the combination of the 'l' and the 'k' sounds and its resemblance to the world lecher. It also sounds vaguely similar to the word 'specter', fitting considering his slippery, phantasmal nature. This film and the books that inspired it are great examples on how to create character names that vaguely allude to the character's personalities without being too obvious.<br/><br/>But Hannibal isn't really the villain, now is he? He's surely not the protagonist, but he's helping Clarice on her quest to catch the real villain of the film, Buffalo Bill, a character who is interesting in his own right, but is overshadowed by Lector and Starling. But in a way, his being in the 'hero's aide' role makes him a lot more unsettling. If he were just the villain, the film would still be great, but it wouldn't be as interesting or complex, and we would lose a lot of the Starling/Lecter interactions, which are the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>The ambiguous or outright villainous hero's aide has been done before, but usually the character in question isn't nearly as twisted or nearly as helpful. The character of Lector strikes a deep unease within the audience. His positioning within the story deepens this unease. It is not an unintended side effect that Lector's presence hangs over the story even when he is not directly in it.<br/><br/>As of date, this is the last film to ever win the Big Five Oscars- Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, and Screenplay. It was one of the first major films of the 90's, here to signal that the light and vapid 80's had come to an end. Foster and Hopkins both deliver A-class performances, and the writing weaves together with the direction to tell a perfect story. A frightening, towering, superbly entertaining spectacle, this one film you can't bear to miss."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","4 October 2015"," The Quintessential Suspense Horror!
","One of the most intense, bone-chilling & edge-of-the-seat experiences I've ever had at movies, The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece of suspense, sustained thrills & nail- biting terror that blends the elements of horror, crime & psychology into one tightly packed & smoothly narrated story, features precision level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and benefits immensely from exceptional performances turned in by its cast.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name, The Silence of the Lambs follows young FBI cadet Clarice Starling who's pulled out from her training and is assigned a new task that requires her to interview the notorious psychiatrist & cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter for his inputs can provide possible clues that may help them apprehend another serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill"" who likes to skin his victims. Things get interesting when Lecter takes an interest in Starling's life.<br/><br/>Directed by Jonathan Demme, this psychological horror introduces its chilling sense of dread right from the moment Howard Shore's score hits the screen, and it only gets more unsettling from there on. Demme's direction is top-notch for he really understands what this film is supposed to be, and leaves no stone unturned to make it as gripping as possible. Of all the films he's made in his filmmaking career, The Silence of the Lambs remains his finest effort to date and is one cinema he will be remembered for.<br/><br/>Ted Tally's screenplay also deserves a mention for the script packs in a tightly structured plot, fleshes out its characters amazingly well and never for once deviates from the main storyline. All the themes are smartly addressed, every character has a well-defined arc, the attention to detail is very impressive, each storytelling element is nailed to perfection and there's just nothing to complain about. Even the technical aspects are executed in a manner that's always in the service of its story & characters.<br/><br/>The sets pieces are wonderfully detailed & well-lit. The camera makes heavy use of close- ups which brings a creepiness of its own while the balanced colour tones & minimal lighting further enhances its dark ambiance. Each sequence is relevant to the story, the whole film is methodically paced and each scene sets up the next one in queue. Last but not the least, the background score by Howard Shore consists of tracks that encapsulate the whole story with a tense, foreboding atmosphere which further amplifies the entire experience by a considerable extent.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Silence of the Lambs features a terrific ensemble in Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn & Ted Levine. While Foster delivers her finest work as Clarice Starling, Hopkins' rendition of the brilliant psychiatrist & cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is beyond excellence and his spot-on chemistry with Foster turns every single conversation between Lecter & Starling into an instant classic moment. Glenn does well as Jack Crawford and Levine is just as good as Foster or Hopkins even if it often gets overshadowed by their inputs.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a timeless masterwork of smart direction, taut screenplay, splendid camera-work, tight editing, ominous score & stellar performances that exemplifies just how great a movie can become when all the right ingredients come together & work in harmony to form a complete whole. Absolutely deserving of all its accolades, immortal for its contribution to cinema as well as pop culture, and notorious for bringing on screen arguably the most cunning, charming & feared psychopath, this quintessential suspense horror comes very highly recommended."

","The first film in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy, one of the only films to win the Big Five of Oscars, generally considered to be one of the best films of all time and Anthony Hopkins's crowning achievement in acting. And that's only scratching the surface.<br/><br/>Everything in The Silence of the Lambs is cinema at its finest. The dialogues are crafted with perfection. These are conversation that simply ooze atmosphere and hint at backstories untold. They're also very memorable and quotable. The characters are out of the ordinary in just the right way. The protagonist Clarice Starling is normal enough, except for her past. But it's the villain that has imprinted himself so permanently to our cultural consciousness. This is a man that they would have worshipped as a god in ancient times. A dark genius, who fields both his smarts and his sophistication with razor sharp focus, always with a knowing smile on the corner of his mouth. He makes even the act of cannibalism look cultured.<br/><br/>The movie also deserves a nod for its technical qualities. The visuals and the music support the atmosphere and the mood perfectly and you'd never guess it was made with such a small budget. Money well spent indeed.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a thriller you must see to truly appreciate the genre. It shows that not all thrillers have to aim for hyperrealism to be successful, that there's room for ideas larger than life and that it's the characters that make it scary, not the amount of blood and dead bodies."

","Film is basically divided, unevenly, into three sections: Starling interviewing Lector, for clues about the identity of a killer at large, referred to as Buffalo Bill; Lector's manipulation of Starling, in attempt to escape custody; and the case of Buffalo Bill himself, a truly frightening villain, moreso than Lector himself, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Buffalo Bill holding the girl captive in the well in his basement are terrifying, especially when he speaks to her, referring to her as *it*. ""It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does that whenever it is told"", in such a booming, baritone voice, only makes it sound even more intimidating. He is one of the creepiest killers in film, vaguely similar to Leatherface, and leaves quite an impression, despite precious little screen time. I found him to be more intimidating and terrifying even than Lector, who, while also chilling, was more of a gentleman in his speech and mannerisms. Even when Lector was beating the guard with his nightstick, he did it with such elegance and finesse, he made it seem almost poetic. A counter to Buffalo Bill's crudity.<br/><br/>The climax was taut and suspenseful, as Starling gropes around in the pitch black basement searching for Buffalo Bill, a light, and a way out, but it was negated when he committed such an obvious, stupid mistake (loudly pulling the hammer back on his gun, and basically announcing his presence to Starling) Or, was that the purpose of that action, to show us he really wasn't a very smart man?"

Not too much not too little. The sky in the scenes is always gray and the atmosphere is cold and wet, which helps the audience to become absorbed into the gloominess of the movie. Moreover, I think a great movie livens up all the main characters within the given time and this one has achieved it. I think Ted Levine's acting was particularly supreme. I can't understand why he didn't win any big award for this role. And of course, Foster and Hopkins did an excellent job in playing those complicated characters."

He's in your head the whole time but when you think of it he's barely in the movie, he just has a few scenes that's how powerful his performance is.<br/><br/>The film is so smartly shot, they chose a petite actress, that can easily look frail, and they used some wide shots from above to show how small she is around the Men, and shows how small and inexperience she must feel around them. Jodie Foster played her character with sensitivity and a quiet strength that also elevated the film.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is over 20 years old but it holds up, you're drawn to this suspenseful thriller from the beginning to the end, and then it stays with you. @wornoutspines"

","Jonathan Demme's hypnotic adaptation The Silence of The Lambs, has a solemnity that's been entirely lacking in horror movies lately. Demme's film is frightening on both visceral and intellectual levels, inviting favorable comparison with unnerving classics of the genre. Ingénue FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is sent to interview, the profoundly mad yet seemingly sane psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to prise clues about another serial killer dubbed 'Buffalo Bill', who has left a rash of unsavory murders along his trail. The killer is abducting corpulent young women, then mutilating them and dumping their bodies. Clarice summons all her courage to face the sadistic shrink, but Lecter has a commanding presence. Relishing the superiority of his intellect, he instantly recognizes her true vulnerability, watching with a self-satisfied smirk as Clarice struggles to maintain her professional composure. Still, there's a glimmer of admiration as Lecter examines Clarice with his penetrating eyes. He offers to help catch the serial killer (who is now holding the daughter of a U.S. senator hostage) but to learn what he knows, Clarice has to engage in his dangerous mind games. Forced to confront her own childhood fears, she hangs on like a terrier until he imparts a vital clue.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a movie without unnecessary excess, with all its facets merging perfectly in the telling of the tale. Its ghastliness is more psychological than visual, but there is enough of both varieties to shake up almost anyone. It forces us to look at things we would rather not see but it continues to have a vise- like grip on us. But the true strength of the movie lies in its exploration of a place beyond physical revulsion - in the darkest corners of the souls of both the hunters and the hunted. Jonathan Demme exercises a great level of restraint in the midst of portraying madness, running the gamut of emotions while still capturing a clever wit and a searing intelligence. He implicates the audience, dragging us into a vicarious conspiracy with a murderer.<br/><br/>But no comment about this film is complete without a mention of the lead cast. Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter is a visual treat; a remarkably lucid portrait of lunacy. As the steely-eyed psychopath, Hopkins plays Lecter with such magisterial authority, that you can almost sense the actor relishing the part. What makes him more than your everyday villain is the piercing intelligence and irresistible charm he brings to the role. Jodie Foster imbues Clarice Starling with such humanity that one can't help but feel connected to her and her pain. It is a testament to her abilities that she holds her own against her scene-stealing co-star. <br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs remains in our minds not only because it frightens, but because it probes and penetrates, tickling our minds while also making our hearts race. A powerfully compelling cinematic experience!"

It's easy to cover up your head and pretend nothing is there but when you're faced with the reality of what's truly out there, the human monsters that can do the most depraved things to other human beings, that's when you truly understand what 'fear' really is.<br/><br/>I have long been a fan of Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. This movie was by far one of their mutual best. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves detective thrillers and depraved serial killer psychopaths, especially ones that are so profoundly intelligent that it makes them even scarier than their actions alone.<br/><br/>Seriously, make this one of your must-watch movies... you won't regret it."

His Dr Lecter extended way beyond convincing as he became this character and is considered by many to be the greatest movie villain of all time. It is very difficult for me to visualize any other actor in this role. Jodie Foster also turns in an outstanding performance as Agent Starling, an academy student seeking entry into the FBI.

They do have really good chemistry, but only share four scenes throughout the course of the film, with Hopkins only appearing in about 20-25 minutes of the movie. <br/><br/>Scott Glenn and Charles Napier give solid support in smaller roles. <br/><br/>""Silence Of The Lambs"" was only the third film, the other two being It Happened One Night and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay. It is also the first Best Picture winner widely considered to be a horror film."

","There are two types of worthy villains: those who are so despicable that we revel in the cold- blooded personality that we look at from the outside looking in, and the one that we want to identify with. That villain can appear socially intelligent, a cunning schemer and, at times, sympathetic. In Hannibal Lecter we get both. All else is a police drama that allows Jodie Foster to star with a dismaying West Virginia accent and a propped up set of credentials that places her in a position to be at the center of it all. For me, although Foster is always interesting to look at, it is Ted Levines' ""Buffalo Bill"" that encases the chilling nature of the film because we get a glimpse of the biggest reason we watch horror films. What drive the evil found in mankind. Levine gives us a chilling and fascinatingly demented killer and we see why he's doing what he's doing. We admire Anthony Hopkins ""Hannibal"" as a brilliant doctor who also happens to be self aware and just as evil."

","Young FBI trainee Foster seeks advice from all-knowing charismatic cannibal Hopkins in order to capture serial killer Levine. Second film to feature Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector; some might try to make a point that it's a pseudo-sequel MANHUNTER, but most won't agree. Film deserves props for the chemistry between Foster and Hopkins, as well as a chilling scene with Levin instructing his prisoner (Brooke Smith) to rub lotion on her skin ""or else it gets the hose again"". The ending is somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying, and it seems like a crime/drama/thriller wouldn't need a $19 million budget. Still, the replay value is practically limitless.

"thomas2193","9","1","2","8 September 2014"," Fantastic Thriller
","Spoiler alert: This review contains spoilers, revealing parts of the plot.<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a main character that both inspires and frightens you at the same time? That's exactly what Anthony Hopkins with his role as Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector accomplishes with his mind-blowing performance in Silence of the Lambs. This film is one of the most awe-inspiring thrillers ever produced on screen. It's deeply psychological, with a strong story. The most amazing irony that this movie delivers, is that you both respect Hannibal, but also despise him. He has an incredible role within the film and Hopkins certainly manages to portray Hannibal perfectly. All the credit to Hopkins for the amazing performance. Jodie Foster portrays the role of FBI trainee Clarice Starling, who certainly manages to put op a great performance as well. We've seen here role as Clarice Starling portrayed by other actresses in the sequels to Silence of the Lambs and none of them managed to outperform her, or even come close to her performance in Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>This film is a really exciting thriller, with a lot of strong moments that manage to keep up the pace, which is important to a thriller in my view. Clarice Starling follows a special FBI training, until her boss wants her to participate in a special task. He wants her to interrogate the dangerous Hannibal, who is in prison for his cannibalistic crimes. When she does, she seems afraid at first, but Hannibal shows his respect for her and she starts being intrigued by Hannibal. The main goal for the interrogations is to follow the trail of a murderer named Buffalo Bill. This insane murderer kills and skins young woman, because he's an insane cross dresser. They want Hannibal to help them with the difficult case, because Bill used to be a psychiatric patient of his. Bit by bit, Hannibal delivers some information, but he wants to hear the live story of Starling in exchange. Agent Starling offers him a fake agreement, put together by her boss, so Hannibal will give them all the information required. But the prison guard Jack Crawford, a rival to Hannibal, tells him it's a lie. Starling slowly starts to find out more about this mysterious Buffalo Bill. Hanibal the Cannibal has been locked inside a cage, but when two prison guards attempt to give him some food, he manages to escape and murders both men. He then manages to escape prison. Meanwhile, agent Starling ends up in the house of Buffalo Bill and attempts to rescue the daughter of the governor, but she gets trapped in a deep well, until the FBI discovers and they are rescued. Starling isn't afraid of the fact that Hannibal has escaped prison, because she knows he respects her and is too decent to go after her. The strongest part of the film happens in the last minute, when Starling receives a call from Hannibal and he tells her he's not going after her, because that would be a pity for the world.<br/><br/>Really strong performances by most of the characters. Buffalo Bill is an insane murderer and his role has been portrayed very well. Hannibal is really intriguing in Silence of the Lambs, which really adds up to the film's quality. I'd go on and say this is actually the best thriller that has ever been made."

","where do I start honestly?<br/><br/>I've never read the books, but if there as good as the movie then I will read them. The parts that had Hannibal and Clarice were the best parts of the movie I loved the whole movie, but the cat and mouse game was the best. <br/><br/>I love the way they make Hannibal Lecter, this ""monster"" but at the same time he doesn't like rudeness and when your ""disrespectful"" sorta speak.<br/><br/>I just love the Hannibal Lecter character in general and how they have Anthony Hopkins playing the character, honestly if it were anyone else I don't think I'd watch it. Anthony Hopkins just plays a very good psychopath.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster is amazing at playing Clarice starling. I thought her character was amazing as well. usually when you have a women as a detective or any other role they're very annoying and whiny, but Clarice is kind of a tough character, she doesn't let a lot of things get to her. <br/><br/>This movie is just the definition of excellent movie.

","The Silence Of The Lambs was the only third film to win all the top five categories in the Academy Awards and it's also the first horror film to win best picture and it won rightly so. Silence Of The Lambs is one of the best film I have ever seen.The writing is excellent you can tell that mainly by noticing that some of the clichés that other serial killer (slasher) films often use are ignored of in here the direction is superb but there is no doubt that what makes this brilliant film what it is it's the acting without the talents of the main and supporting cast The Silence Of The Lambs would be nothing. Jodie Foster brings the right amount of courage and vulnerability to the character of Clarice Starling and of course there is Anthony Hopkins who basically steals the show as Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter the brilliant psychotic cannibalistic and highly manipulative serial killer although he was not the first to play Lecter (the first actor to portray the character of Lecter was Brian Cox in ""Manhunter""-1986) but never the less Hopking is and always will be Lecter. The Silence Of The Lambs is gory, realistic, suspenseful, dramatic, dark and thrilling but it's not a ""slasher""."

As for a first time watch it was just awesome movie ; and every time i watched it again; i could feel the class and its thrill which will never drain off.

Hannibal the Cannibal as he is known best!Each second the fear builds up and the simplicity with which he evokes the feeling is quite wonderful an actor. With meagre 16 minutes of screen time ; Hopkins steals the show and most of the credit goes to him .Jodie Foster appears as the young ; attractive detective Clarice Starling . She is such a wonderful actress who is really flexible and I'm sure she did succeed enough doing any role . Ted Levine excels as Jane Gumb a.k.a Buffallo Bill ; Enormous amount of effort he has put in makes the movie go into some dark backgrounds where it finds brilliance and villainous nature of the character is so easily conveyed with his voice modulations and the actions . Scott Glen as Jack Crawford and Anthony Heald as the crooked minded Dr.Chilton has played his part and have made this movie a must watch spine chilling thriller experience . Music by Howard shore makes it gripping ; and the exceptional cinematography by Tak Fugimoto is worth notice. Ted Tally created the scenes with visual brilliance and the pulp of Thomas Harris' Novel is not lost being created in big screen. My favorite scene will be Agent starling's first encounter with Dr.Lecter ; the window scene which creates an aura of fear .

","In this multiple Oscar-winning thriller, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy whose shrewd analyses of serial killers lands her a special assignment: the FBI is investigating a vicious murderer nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kills young women and then removes the skin from their bodies. Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into this case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out. Lecter does indeed know something of Buffalo Bill, but his information comes with a price: in exchange for telling what he knows, he wants to be housed in a more comfortable facility. More important, he wants to speak with Clarice about her past. He skillfully digs into her psyche, forcing her to reveal her innermost traumas and putting her in a position of vulnerability when she can least afford to be weak. The film mingles the horrors of criminal acts with the psychological horrors of Lecter's slow-motion interrogation of Clarice and of her memories that emerge from it"
"livstrongeva","8","1","2","24 August 2013"," The collision between first impression and true identity in Silence of the Lambs
","Finally the time came and I decided to watch all of the Hannibal movies (because after the end of Hannibal's season 1 I was left with a void that only Hannibal Lecter could fill up). So I started with the famous Silence of the Lamb.<br/><br/>If you are familiar with this movie, you probably know the plot: FBI agent Clarise Starling plaeyd by Jodie Foster needs the help of an incarcerated prisoner Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins to catch a serial killer on the loose.<br/><br/>So what was most interesting for me is that people aren't what they seem from the first impression. Yes, we see Clarise training but that is because she is the character with whom we are growing together, the main character. She is running through the forest what might be a metaphor that she is trying to defeat evil as forest always was a gloomy and scary place where monsters were hiding. But that is not how she is viewed by others. There are various scenes where she is the only woman in male company and everybody is looking at her as if she is not capable of anything, but she proves them wrong.<br/><br/>On the other hand we see Hannibal as a calm person standing in his cell. You could not tell that this person is a heartless murderer who eats his victims. But that's what everybody knows about him. And that is why he is in the cell. Later we see his change when he attacks the guards, but I think more important is his entrance scene. It is just radiating with innocence, but you still have this feeling that something is wrong. Maybe it's not the cell, but most probably it's how he looks, how he smiles. But that you notice just a bit later.<br/><br/>So that's what I saw in this movie – the difference between first impression and true people's nature. It's a bit scary how wrong can we sometimes be. Maybe next time we will regard the innocent looking person with more care."

I think there could have been more twists and turns overall in the movie with this, though.<br/><br/>Of course, Hannibal's acting was great and one of the great things about the movie. The characterization of the main character was a bit lacking, and though it was touched upon a few times, it was never fully developed, and thus didn't live up to its true potential by showing her inner strife and history.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending was perfect, as one criminal was caught and the other free. This was a proper ending for Hannibal and I felt there would have been no other good way to tie up the endings of the movie."
"Aly200","10","1","2","17 January 2013"," Pure Thrills
","One of the iconic characters in horror is brought to us in this terrifying thriller and brought Sir Anthony Hopkins the 1991 Best Actor Oscar. Jodie Foster (who also won an Oscar) stars as naive FBI agent Clarice Starling on her first big assignment to capture the psychopathic serial murderer known as Buffalo Bill. To assist her in the case, Starling is sent to see the infamous cannibalistic psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins in a chilling performance), but she is warned that Lecter is adept at playing mind games with others and she mustn't tell him personal details. As Clarice comes closer and closer to the killer's true identity, she is thrust into a deadly game of cat and mouse with both Buffalo Bill and the sly Dr. Lecter. <br/><br/>What truly sets this film apart from other horror/thrillers is the performance of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, a man who is clearly homicidal but not in an over-the-top fashion. Lecter is presented as calm, cool, collected but still frightening in the sense of the fact we know he is dangerous and has killed people, yet we are drawn to him like Clarice and we are fascinated by his intelligence. This is a clever device to present us as the viewers with a killer who terrifies us mentally rather than being a raving maniac like Freddy or Jason."

","There is something about this film that will continue to haunt me forever. Perhaps it is the idea that someone like Lector could actually exist. That thought exists due to the phenomenal acting of Anthony Hopkins. While there are many actors whom I would enjoy the privilege of sharing time with, I think to this day if I were to meet Anthony Hopkins, I would like it to be in an open room with plenty of people. That is how convincing his portrayal of Lector strikes me, and I know many people who feel the same way. Scott Glenn's portrayal of Jack Crawford is cool and calm, exactly what you might expect of a senior agent and department head in the FBI. Jodie Foster's portrayal of the ambitious Clarice Starling is as compelling and haunting as Hopkins', which would account for both of them winning their respective Academy Awards. Demme and the film itself also received Oscars, as did the screenwriters of this exceptional film. The film itself is superbly written, perfectly cast, and splendidly presented in every aspect. Details are important to Demme, obviously, so important that filming was done at Quantico for the academy shots, using actual FBI personnel in the training sequences. Perhaps the most riveting quality of the film is the portrayal of Buffalo Bill, and the ability of Ted Levine to carry off that twisted and complex role. Ted shows us how innocuous evil can be, and presents it with such flair and elegance we can imagine such a man being in a rural town like that, hiding his crimes beneath a veil of anonymity and isolation. Rated R for violence, language, gore, and some partial nudity, this is definitely not a film for the kids or even the young teens, if you ever want them to trust your neighbors and you live in a small town. Collectible? Without a doubt, one of the finest dramas ever brought to the screen."
"oneguyrambling","9","1","2","3 February 2012"," A rare film that challenges the audience and finds both commercial and critical success.
","A number of Oscars and one of the more memorable psychopaths in cinematic history render any banal positive reviews of The Silence of the Lambs unnecessary. Therefore I will keep this brief and try to throw in a chuckle or two.<br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece in characterisation and lean filmmaking. If you think about it the characters portrayed are either vital to the story or mere window-dressing, there are no in between 'sorta' supporting roles.<br/><br/>This leaves rookie FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) free to hunt a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) on behalf of senior FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). With the all important support and guidance from super intelligent, clinical and fiendishly complicated Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).<br/><br/>Without Hannibal's input SotL might still be a solid FBI procedural 'go-geddim', it just wouldn't be near as memorable. Hannibal doesn't display many other signs of normal body language, he remains bolt upright and his arms and hands rarely move about. Hopkins' performance is all eyes – a steely gaze during conversation changes instantly to a wide eyed glare during times where 'you'd better listen'. His speech is quick, clipped and crisp, though he hangs on to the last syllable of every important sentence as if he's afraid that ending it won't allow time for another.<br/><br/>Even though Hopkins' screen time is very short he also gets all the best lines and is the core of the most memorable sequences.<br/><br/>After a perceived discourtesy to young Clarice enrages Hannibal he throws her a bone and her investigation progresses more rapidly. Along the way she learns more and more about Buffy B, and in a few solid scenes so do the audience, most notably the oft parodied 'self analysis' whilst wearing a lovely pink negligee.<br/><br/>Clarice begins the film as a nervous rookie in a grown man's environment, that of the testosterone dominated FBI ranks. She ends the film a seasoned pro who has seen things that 99% of the population couldn't possibly fathom.<br/><br/>Without labouring on the plot developments the final sequence contains a masterful misdirection that will shock and hook you in until the closing credits, and even though we now know that the sequels didn't really deliver you were definitely left wanting more of Hannibal at the time.<br/><br/>There are lots of close ups during dialogue scenes that demand that you pay attention, and given the gory and disgusting subject matter Demme wisely keeps a leash on the violence and macabre to save the impact for the more important scenes near the end. He does though keep reminding us of the thematic elements with the occasional head in a jar, skinsuit or my favourite, the unnecessary throat-moth.<br/><br/>I am not a director's aficionado. I subscribe more to the ""I don't know directing, but I know what I like"" motif, that leads me to follow the careers of certain guys more than others. But The Silence of the Lambs is lean, mean and memorable and obviously exceptionally crafted.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 9 / 10. Very rarely do truly challenging films find both commercial and critical success – especially if they contain 'unpleasant subject matter such as this. Silence of the Lambs managed both, on top of all that it is still as strong and packs as much of a punch some 20 years on."

","I'm not sure how anyone could disagree that The Silence of the Lambs is the greatest Hannibal Lecter film ever made. This is one of the highest quality horror films you will ever see. It's got an intense story, riveting characters, and incredible actors. The film takes place years after Manhunter. Lecter is still behind bars and he is once again called upon to assist in tracking down a disturbed serial killer. This time it is young FBI agent Clarice Starling who is assigned to talk to Lecter and with his information track down Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who kills young women and then skins them. But once again there is only so much trust you can put into a cannibal, and Lecter complicates things while at the same time giving subtle and vague clues to Clarice that might help track down Buffalo Bill. This is one of the most disturbing and psychologically grotesque films ever to grace the world of cinema, but it is made so well and with such expertise that it becomes a work of art rather than exploitation.<br/><br/>This is one of those films where every aspect falls into place so perfectly it is as if you are experiencing everything the characters are as it happens, rather than just watching this film unfold. Right off the bat the movie grabs you with its stern sincerity and you can immediately feel the tension that rises throughout the film. Through the beginning of the film we develop a perfect sense of the tension within the film and the dread within the characters. Then we reach Clarice's first meeting with Hannibal Lecter and the films true haunting intensity comes out. At that moment the film becomes a nightmare that grows darker and darker with each clue that leads Clarice closer to what she sees as the ultimate evil that she is going to face, Buffalo Bill. She doesn't even know that the true evil is Lecter himself, but he is behind bars misleads Clarice to think he isn't as threatening. We the audience of course know that he is a bigger threat than any Buffalo Bill, but somehow we forget this because we are so compelled to feel as Clarice, our innocent and tormented protagonist, feels. It is a sinister trick the film pulls on us because it works all too well.<br/><br/>This film relies a lot on shock value, making us remember every last disturbing image we are forced to witness during it. This film engraves itself into your mind and there is no way to escape the horror elicited by it. This is a movie that tortures you and makes you feel more than you've probably ever felt during a horror film. And yet it isn't a movie that draws out fear through cheap thrills. Every horrifying image you witness is meaningful and furthers the plot, driving us through the terror straight ahead to the film's explosive conclusion. This movie is what I consider to be truly scary. It instills true fear rather than just frightened amusement. It is masterful in its suspense building and ingenious in the placement and moderation of its thrills. We see a lot of grotesque things in The Silence of the Lambs but there are still things we don't see that make it even scarier.<br/><br/>Through its incredible script, excellent direction, and superb acting this film establishes itself as a masterpiece. What really makes this film is definitely Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. It is so perfectly haunting in a calm and sedated kind of way. There is nothing over the top or ridiculous about his character or Hopkins performance. It is totally believable which makes it that much more disturbing. It is easily one of the best film performances ever and a huge part of what makes this film incredibly terrifying.<br/><br/>I don't hesitate to call The Silence of the Lambs one of the scariest films ever made. Its tension and its suspense make it so terrifyingly gripping that once the film has a hold of you it doesn't let go. Few films can instill fear the way this film does. I have to commend it for actually scaring me while refraining from being an over the top film full of cheap thrills and easy scares. This film is a horror masterpiece."

Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the name brings you the shivers. The fact that he devours human flesh is horrifying itself.<br/><br/>No one could do it better than Anthony Hopkins! No wonder he got an Oscar for the role.<br/><br/>While Jodie Foster is busy finding a psycho killer Buffalo Bill, she is asked to take every aid she could get from the god of Psychos himself, Dr. Hannibal Lecter(Anthony Hopkins) who used to be a well known psychiatrist, who is a cannibal yet a genius at comprehending the human behavior. Pretty queer interests for a top class shrink, eh! He is ready to help her only if she lets him wade through her inner soul so as to assist her as well. She is forced to comply every now and then with his witty sarcasm as she has to win his confidence to acquire as much assistance possible to capture Buffalo Bill before he 'skins' another(Watch it to comprehend the patterns).<br/><br/>Everything about the movie was wonderful. The way Anthony studied his subjects; his sarcasm, his accent and vocabulary were all captivating.<br/><br/>The movie's screenplay is the most apposite screenplay ever. The pun like 'I'm having a friend for dinner' is one of the finest lines that I can bring back to memory.<br/><br/>The one directed by Ridley Scott(Hannibal), however, wasn't as good as those directed by Jonathan Demme and Brett Ratner(Red Dragon) but then again it was Thomas Harris altogether, so no comments there.<br/><br/>Awesome flick, the greatest thriller and suspense movie of all times. I'd be a fool if I wouldn't suggest you this one. Go for the trilogy today!"

","I wonder....<br/><br/>I see Jodie Foster so many times in the film, to the point that her presence begins to really annoy me. The real star of the film is Ted Levine who didn't win anything at all. All the hard work he put into the character of Jamie Gumb a.k.a. Buffalo Bill went to waste. <br/><br/>In short Ted Levine was robbed blind.<br/><br/>His portrayal of the character is very realistic. When he expresses his anguish and frustration to Catherine Martin that is the greatest scene in the film. Another scene is where he is in the nude and showing of his dress, wearing lipstick and blush and exclaiming,""I'd f*ck me! I'd f*ck me really hard!"" The background score to the scene is also excellent.<br/><br/>The other star is of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. But his characterization is dangerously misleading. Cannibals are passive. They never show emotion or anger and are quite normal-looking. It is this trait that enables them to fool their unsuspecting victim. In Michael Mann's film Manhunter, Brian Cox played Dr. Hannibal Lecktor beautifully. He was exceedingly soft spoken and polite. His victims were beautiful women who lured with his CHARM.<br/><br/>Now Anthony Hopkins portrayed his version as rude, arrogant and psychotic. Any Hollywood actor could perform what Hopkins did in the film. Take for example actors: Jack Nicholson, W. Forsythe, Brian Dennehy, Willem Dafoe, Ed Harris etc. The list is endless....<br/><br/>The reason why the film succeeds is mainly due to the clever direction by Jonathan Demme, photography By Tak Fujimoto and excellent music by Howard Shore. With these three in combination anything is possible.<br/><br/>List Of Serial Killer Movies: Manhunter(based on Red Dragon) 1986, To Catch A Killer 1992 TV, Dahmer (2002), The Secret Life of Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), The Gray Man (2007), Resurrection (1999), Bone Daddy (1997), Albert Fish (2007), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2005), Deranged (1974), Jack The Ripper, Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer (1986), and H.

","I watched this movie with my mom about a few months ago . . . And let me just say I was floored! I liked it, very intense & creepy, especially Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lecter . . . that mask . . . that voice . . . ""Closer, please. Closer"" . . . , as well as the chemistry between him and Jodie Foster as Clarice . . . no wonder people are still terrified! There are parts that may make one cringe, particularly scenes with Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill . . . but that is the whole point of the film . . . it's supposed to scare you! But not in the way one might think! Yet if you have seen it, there's one thing that makes you wonder: What would the BAU team of ""Criminal Minds"" think of these two killers? I can only imagine . . . wow!!!! Anyways, when I watched this film, I was stock still whenever Dr. Lecter appeared on screen (really!) He's downright scary. So . . . to bring this review to a close, I liked this film overall. But that brings me to one last question, movie fans, to quote Dr. Lecter: ""You wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, and hear the screaming of the lambs?"""
"Beauq81","7","1","2","24 January 2011"," A bit lacking, don't know what the fuss is about
","When this movie came out, I was just a kid, so it wasn't till years later that I saw it. I liked it, but didn't understand what the fuss was about. I found it quite lacking in many aspects, especially Jodie Foster's acting, which reminds me of a bad soap opera. I, simply, found that the movie was missing a lot of things.<br/><br/>Then, a few years later, I read the book and saw just how much the movie missed, mostly in character portrayal. The only person who, actually, did the role right, was Scott Glenn, but it was never explained why he was always so sad and melancholic (his wife's illness and death).<br/><br/>Ted Levine was also pretty good, I liked the way he played a psycho, especially since I've seen some of his more uptight and comic roles, eg., in Monk.<br/><br/>As far as Hopkins goes, I think that Lecter suited him better in Hannibal and Red dragon. It seemed that he was so relaxed in the role. In this movie, not so much, but I don't think it was really his fault, being a truly great actor. Like I said, the overall character portrayal was bad.<br/><br/>I, actually, don't like Jodie Foster that much, and her whiny Clarice is not much different from, say, Nell.<br/><br/>Demme did capture the gruesome atmosphere really well and I have to give him that.<br/><br/>Even though it is a good movie, it is not a great one and I certainly hope someone decides to do the book a little more justice some day."
"colebt33-780-179547","10","1","2","13 July 2010"," A hybrid of genre's that can only be described as perfection
","The1992 Academy Awards was a very specific year in the acknowledgment of great film-making, and all because of one movie, one movie that accomplished something that very few other movies have. Sweeping all five of the major Oscar awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay, Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a thriller, a horror, a psychological study into the mind of the serial killer, and a very powerful example of what film can turn out to be when actors, writers and directors are all at the top of their game.<br/><br/>Clarice Sterling (Jodie Foster) is a young FBI trainee who is pulled out of training and assigned the case of finding a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. She is sent to the mental institute to gain insight on the character by interviewing another serial killer, the notorious Hannibal Lecter, or ""Hannibal the Cannibal"", played by the great Anthony Hopkins. While Hopkin's gave one of the most chilling and disturbing portrayals I have ever seen, it's Foster's performance that keeps this movie rolling. Clarice has a troubled past, full of fear and repressed memory. Hannibal is the monster she is trying to learn from, but he is not going to give her anything without something in return, in this case, access to her deepest, darkest secrets. The relationship between these two figures is tauntingly fascinating. There's a certain poetry involved here and it's so provoking to watch. Some may call this chemistry, but I think it's just two talented actors with and an equally talented director playing their part, and doing one hell of a job.<br/><br/>Despite my gratitude for both actor's performances, if I had to choose which one I'd call my favourite, it would have to be Jodie Foster as Clarice Sterling. I fell in love with Foster after I saw this movie. Every time I think of her now I think of those old-fashioned clothes and burgundy shoes. I think of her amazingly delicate portrayal of a woman haunted by her past yet still trying to save the life of a teenage girl. Which reminds me, one thing that was really nice to see was that it wasn't a man trying to save the day for once, it was a woman. Almost every other Ameircan movie I've seen it's always been a man saving the damsel in distress. There was never a time where a woman got to have the acknowledgment or the parade, and I think Johnathen Demme picked up on this fact and expressed it as another theme to the movie. Close to the start of the film when Clarice was on her way to the office for her assignment, she walked into this elevator and she was surrounded by huge blokes, it made her like the smallest thing ever. It was quite funny, and I think it really said something. Clarice was a woman working in a man's world, guys would often chuckle or question at her presence, and occasionally even sexually harass her in mild ways. Witnessing all this it makes you think that there's something to prove here and that it was going to be interesting to find out how it would manifest into a final ending. <br/><br/>Jonathan Demme is probably never going to be able to do something like this ever again. It's possibly my most favourite film ever, but if not it's certainly in my top 3. It's perfectly acted, perfectly written, and perfectly directed. This is a top-notch movie that for me scores a perfect 10 / 10, no doubts, no regrets, AWESOME!"

","I watched this only because Ted Levine was in it and was pleasantly surprised. It's a very good thriller. Worthy of Academy Awards. I just thought Ted Levine was amazing in his role. It's hard to play someone like Buffalo Bill considering the fact that Levine is almost always a cop in his other movies. Anthony Hopkins was creepy. But cool. Jodie Foster was good. Southern accent. She deserved winning the Oscar. Anthony Heald was also very good. All in all, it was a good movie that was worth watching. Kept me at the edge of my seat from thirty minutes in.

","""Oh, he's a psychopath...."" exclaims Baltimore asylum boss Dr. Chilton (Heald) to both us and our lead as we get first wind of a certain imprisoned madman who'll hopefully help both her, and the agency she works for in the F.B.I., catch a killer at large. The first time we arrive at said psychopath's cell, it is en route through many-a door and corridor as Chilton describes in a chaotic and disorientating nature the rules which come with interacting with this beast – a final warning as the screen, drenched in blood red lighting, when a photograph of a deformed nurse harmed only recently by the inmate is displayed to her. The key item being that we do not see the picture, and along with all the hustling build up, must come to our own conclusions about the imminent interaction. Build up such as the above aids in making the man feel as if he's present more in the film than in actuality.<br/><br/>Such a sequence, or chain of events, goes a long way in capturing everything that makes The Silence of the Lambs so effective, that sense of talking about something and building it up rather than out-and-out showing it. The common place is that the first thing you jump to when talking about the film is the particular character the above dialogue refers to, and how their presence is both so very fascinating as well as rather frightening. The fact the film balances this well enough with everything else so that as to avoid ultimately overwhelm the film is an achievement. That character is of course a certain Hannibal Lecter, an individual played by Anthony Hopkins in what is a highly praised performance for his portrayal of the man, a victim of countless spoofs; references and imitations since. Lecter is both foil and mentor; both anti-hero and a (not THE) villain, psychotic enough to have previously killed and maimed, but smart enough to identify when genuinely coming across as helpful to a cause might aid in his own intentions. There is a degree of irony in the fact F.B.I. chief Jack Crawford (Glenn) attempts to exploit the mind of Lecter so much that his desperation forces him to turn to a young female rookie, something that ultimately stirs Hannibal's creative juices enough so that he may carry out what eventually happens in the film.<br/><br/>When our lead, a certain Clarice Starling (Foster), arrives at a heavily guarded entrance, the film is constructed through Starling's point of view as we observe security screens; an armed guard plus his arsenal of shotguns as well as heavily fortified steel doors protecting this little area all by itself stand tall, all before settling on the welcoming tone of an orderly named Barney. The film's first interaction between them plays out, and the film toys with all the prior material in having Lecter demand he have a ""closer"" look at her identification. But despite Lecter, it is lead Clarice Starling whom drives the film; heading on out into her own arc of self discovery within a circular journey; all the while with the slow burning memories and tragedies of years of old eating away at the back of her mind. Whilst the leads ponder Lecter as a tool, key for burrowing into a certain Buffalo Bill (Levine), a slight nickname for a serial killer in operation, it is Lecter that provides the burrowing into Starling and her own past for sake of us that proves just as interesting.<br/><br/>Most of the latter half of Starling's past, that is to say her childhood, reveals a sense of desperation to aid the helpless or a violent reaction to slaughter and murder and an aching lust to reject it in helping those that are victims of it. This, combined with her father and both his role and his fate, help in fleshing Starling out and getting to understand why it is what she is, something a little more than a nameless; faceless protagonist detective hired to take care of whatever case because the demands of that genre implore it. If American films of the action, thriller or detective ilk produced in the 1980s fed off an idea of the male lead and their body being put through a grinding process of harm and hurt, then The Silence of the Lambs toys with this in its opening segment when a yet to be identified Starling huffs and puffs her way through an assault course in rural nowhere, putting her body through the established test before someone intervenes and sends her on her way to an assignment which will ultimately lead her on her quest. Progressively, the film develops Starling as the agent she will become; observing tiny details such as having her describe what she correctly assumes Buffalo Bill to look like, a scene after we observe him for the first time in swiping his next victim.<br/><br/>The tie that binds Starling's world both inside and outside of the F.B.I. academy is a degree of sexism and individualism; exemplified when male trainees gaze at her as she jogs past but also when she is surrounded in an elevator early on, the colours of the occupants' jerseys getting across a sense of alienation. This, as Chilton's futile flirting plays out at the asylum; a moth expert's advances are rejected and an additional sense of astonishment contained within by local law enforcers when she orders out a room full of them whom are relegated to having to bear it occur. The text is aware of both its lead character's strength and gender, providing a number of instances in which the danger of getting knocked back down because of both role and gender is made aware but always rejected. The film is a powerful, well observed pot boiler as detectives race against time and a fascinating third element in Lecter ominously plans and ploys. In combining narrative with character study, Demme has created something remarkable."

And Jodie Foster did a fantastic job in Clarice, an FBI cadet who tried to catch a murderous serial killer. To do that, she had to face Dr.Lector, an even more murderous and psychotic killer. She maybe one of the bravest heroes I've ever seen, along with Indiana Jones (who maybe better, I don't know...). Dr.Lector and Clarice are unforgettable and haunted. You'll never forget them...<br/><br/>And I have have to say about the direction too. Jonathan Demme deserved his Oscar. For making his audiences' heart to jump out many times.

","An extremely clever and sophisticated thriller that is aware of its own absurdities and never loses its balance between subtlety and excess. The narrative moves swiftly to accommodate a rather uncomfortable storyline (there isn't a false note on either script or direction), the pace and characters give it an extra vigour (Anthony Hopkins's performance as Dr Lecter is chillingly mannered), and the movie treats psychopathology with a genuinely perversive delight. <br/><br/>It is also probably the only shocker that serves as a credible sociological comment. <br/><br/>In other words, an undisputed masterpiece."

","In the movie, Silence of the Lambs, the FBI is trying to catch serial killers and learn how his mind works. The FBI sends a trainee, Agent Clarice Starling, who is played by Jodi Foster, to interview the infamous, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is played by Anthony Hopkins. Lecter is a cannibalistic psychiatrist. The FBI's beliefs are it takes one to know one, speaking of Lecter, knowing how the serial killer mind works, in order to catch Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill is murdering women across the country. The theme develops as Lecter agrees to help only if Starling will feed his morbid curiosity about her own personal life. The director uses memory flashbacks to illustrate Starling's demons. As Lecter forces her to face her own demons in life, she begins to realize how diabolical Lecter is and how bad evil can be. Lecter gets in her mind, in her thoughts, and the evil is so strong she does not think she can stop it. Along with Lecter getting into Starling's thoughts, she gets into his mind as well. Lecter has a chance to kill her and doesn't and he even calls her in the end to congratulate her on graduating from school to become an FBI agent. Being one of the scariest movies ever put into film Silence of the Lambs, keeps you on the edge of your seat for the duration of the film. Unlike many scary movies there is little gore and shock value instances, there is more of the thought of real evil, things that really go bump in the night. The director, Jonathan Demee, uses several things to keep the viewer interested in the movie, to keep you wandering when something is going to occur. The movie keeps its intensiveness because of the lighting, off camera sound effects, and the design of the sets. Some specific examples start right from the beginning such as the music as Sterling walks to the cell of Lecter is intense making the viewer feel like something is going to happen as she walks. The laughing and yelling of the prisons as she walks away put off a nervous feeling making the viewer feel like they are there. The lighting in the prison is dark and dreary; the brick walls make it seem lonely and cold. There is rust on the heater making it seem unattended to. Lecter's dialogue is very well developed with his eyes so intense, so cold, evil, again keeping your full attention to the movie, making references to the way he ate his victims. The camera angels in close when there are conversations with Hannibal, The lighting is above him to put shadows on his face making him appear more evil. These types of preludes to the way the movie is going to unfold continue throughout the movie, making sure the viewer is on edge, scared, and nervous throughout the duration of the movie like the intense music during the abduction of the women. This movie reminds me a lot of the movie ""Kiss the Girls"" with Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, in it. The theme is similar as to serial killers abducting woman and a psychologist helping the police find the man who did it. In Kiss the Girls, Ashley Judd is the psychologist and she gets abducted, once she escapes she helps the police with the search, in turn finding another series of abductions further away with a similar signature. Both movies are suspenseful thrillers, although the director in Silence of the Lambs is much more successful in making the movie horrifying than the director of Kiss the Girls. He makes you scared, clenching to your seat, and makes you feel as though you are their."

","Braden Williamson Assignment 5-5 HUMN 246<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs has gradually become one the highest acclaimed thriller/horror films ever made. The film goes beyond the typical blood and gore of most horror movies, using dialogue and subjective camera angles to draw the viewer closer to the suspense. When Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is interviewing Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), the subjective camera angle makes the viewer feel as if they are in Starling's place and staring into the face of a psychopath. This cinematography makes the film feel like it has a first person perspective. The angles and subjective viewpoints also illustrate what it is like for Starling in a male-dominated profession.<br/><br/>The theme of The Silence of the Lambs is facing your fear. It faces the fear that Clarice has of the lambs that she hears in her head, the fear she has that she won't be able to save Buffalo Bill's captive, Catherine. There is also the fear that is felt when Lector or Buffalo Bill merely appears on the screen. The theme ultimately climaxes when everything is seen through Bill's night vision lenses and the audience is on the edge of their seats as Clarice may or may not meet her demise. <br/><br/>Although Hopkins and Foster are both A-list Hollywood actors, they both have an organic, real world demeanor about them which make the story much more believable because it feels like a real FBI agent is talking to an actual criminal instead of a starlet talking with a playboy. The on location scenes that were used for a majority of the film, according to the documentary that accompanied the film, made the FBI headquarters, the psychiatric facility and even Bill's home feel like actual landmarks in a serial killer's rampage. Nothing makes a movie feel more authentic and real than rough-grain film stock. The color of the film was not too bright, and with the shadows and lighting to keep the mood drab, dull, and depressing the film was able to really develop effectively.<br/><br/>The subjective camera angles, dark mood, and lighting set a tone that has made The Silence of the Lambs the great film that it is. Before this film was released horror films used physical suspense to scare the audience but Lambs takes the physical suspense and raises it to new heights by reinforcing it with suspense built simply through the dialogue between Lector and Starling. Many films since this one have tried to add multiple layers of depth in order to make the movie better but more times than not, it just isn't applicable to the film. Fear is something that is always around us but we try our best to avoid it, The Silence of the Lambs takes fear and forces us to examine the worst types of people through an empathetic view. This is what makes it such a great fil"

","The Silence of the lambs, the best picture winner of 1991, deserved it. It deserved the praise it got. Everyone of it's Oscars that it won deserved it.

Jodie Foster deserved the Oscar that she got too. The Silence of the lambs is all around fantastic. <br/><br/>Foster stars as FBI agent Clarise Starling.

"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","2","22 August 2009"," ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is, as you've heard, intensely frightening and off-putting, but more significantly in today's cinema, it's storytelling at its finest
","There is a fine line of similarity between Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Alfred Hitchcock's iconic thriller ""Psycho."" They were both notorious upon initial release for their surprising amount of violent and off-putting content that ultimately proved too much for some people and they are both incredible, visionary masterpieces. Demme's film, based on a very good book by Thomas Harris, is not only one of the creepiest films I've ever seen, but it's one of the two or three best horror films I've ever seen. It's frightening, it's unforgettably creepy, it's off-putting, but it's also well-acted, works around a terrific story and premise, and is overall, a great movie.<br/><br/>Purist fans of the original book by Harris will not be disappointed, for Demme's film follows the novel almost religiously step by step and sometimes quote for quote. Jodie Foster won her second Academy Award for her portrayal of an FBI trainee after a serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who skins his victims, and uses the psychological genius of a cannibalistic serial killer behind bars, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to track him down before his latest victim's skinless body winds up in another river.<br/><br/>Let me state off the bat that personally, I am not a fan of the horror genre and knowing that Gene Siskel himself was quite appalled by the film, I was a little cautious going into ""The Silence of the Lambs."" But I am so glad I did. I was freaked out, I was on the edge of my seat half the time, and there are some images in the film that I really don't care for, but underneath all of the frightening subtext, there was a true, beautiful masterpiece and a terrific story to keep me interested.<br/><br/>Unlike a truly awful horror film I recently saw, ""Mirrors"" (2008), ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not all blood-and-guts and no story. In fact, there's only five or six really creepy and gruesome moments in the movie and they are wisely spaced apart from each other so that the filmmakers and actors can work on developing the plot and the mystery, which is far more engaging. It's not just one brutal killing after another, which really gets tiresome. It's an engaging example of storytelling, but for those who love scary movies, you will not be disappointed, either.<br/><br/>Apart from having a well-written story, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has terrific characters and a great cast to boast about as well. The best performance in the film is Jodie Foster's, who is hands-down sympathetic and brilliant as the struggling FBI agent whose on this mission not to prove herself to her boss (Scott Glenn), but to save a young woman's life from the hands of a sick-minded monster. One of the few problems I had with the book was that I didn't like the Clarice Starling character; she seemed too vulgar and dislikable to me and more self-centered. I liked Foster's interpretation more because she generates the sympathy and remorse that an audience goes after. Quit the contrast to Anthony Hopkins's character.<br/><br/>Although he is a versatile actor capable of doing a great many other movies, this is the film that Anthony Hopkins is most remembered as and that's simply because next to or even above Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins, he's the most disturbing villain ever put on screen. Hopkins's entire performance is a brilliant visualization of what Thomas Harris dreamed up while writing the original books after hour upon hour of studying real-life serial killers and psychopaths. Hopkins speaks of a voice that's only uncannily familiar to his natural tone, he seldom blinks, he oftentimes stands perfectly still, and works with these well-written lines conceived by Harris and adapted by the screenwriter to present a disgusting, horrific monster of a man who does not serve as a role model and something that the audience fears and turns away from. We do not even see Hopkins for a good chunk of the way in and we spend the first part of the movie anticipating his arrival, preparing for this man who killed and then ate people for reasons nobody can really understand. A great strength of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is that it does not make likable characters out of serial killers. Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill, by contrast, are sick, conniving, and savage whom you do not want to come within a mile of.<br/><br/>But again, the movie is not ABOUT the fact that Hannibal Lecter eats people and Buffalo Bill skins people and it does not lead up to these moments. It's not ABOUT the notoriously shocking thrills. Many horror films today are—they follow it almost as if it were a formula. But ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is an exception. The thrills are used as they should be—as a service to the story that's being told. They strengthen it, rather than consume it."

","Before 1991 horror movies were less about psychology and more about the actual killing and monsters. The Silence of the Lambs changed the genre.<br/><br/>The story starts with our main hero, Clarice Staling (Jodie Foster), a novice FBI enforcer, being sent by her boss to an asylum, where she must talk to one of the most ruthless serial killers – Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). His alternate name, ""Hannibal the Cannibal"", sums up why he is so notorious. Dr. Lecter apparently has some information regarding Buffalo Bill, another serial killer, who gained his name because of his sick ""tradition"" of skinning his victims, all women, and who, unlike Hannibal, is on the loose. Clarice must find out where Bill is and stop him.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster is great as Clarice, playing the role of an average woman, who has wanted justice since she was little, when her father was killed by two thugs.<br/><br/>But the forte point of the movie is Anthony Hopkins, who won an Oscar for the role, the shortest Oscar-winning performance in cinema history. He's screen time is about 20 minutes, but the impression is beyond powerful. He managed to show both sides of Hanibal Lecter – the gentle, calm and yet diabolical Hannibal and the monster.<br/><br/>Ted Levine, who played Buffalo Bill, never got the same reputation that Foster and Hopkins got, despite giving life to a twisted freak.<br/><br/>The movie is part horror, part psychological thriller. Clarice is trying to do the impossible, while the clock is tickingThe Silence of the Lambs is an absolute masterpiece, recommended to all cinema fans.<br/><br/>Final Score: 5/5 or 10/10"
"dee.reid","10","1","2","7 June 2009"," The greatest thriller of all time? I think so.
","I don't think a movie has really been so effective in shocking the hell out of the audience. So let's be frank: movies like ""The Silence of the Lambs"" don't usually win very big awards, let alone Oscars (in all five of the major categories, no less, making it only the third film in history to do so).<br/><br/>With gruesome scenes of murder, autopsies and cannibalism, it's hard to imagine ""The Silence of the Lambs"" winning Best Picture at the Oscars, not to mention heaps of praise and topping numerous ""best"" lists since its release. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has also become a bona-fide cinematic and pop culture icon, introducing two of the most memorable characters in cinema history.<br/><br/>The film, an adaptation of the novel by Thomas Harris, concerns the FBI's hunt for a particularly brutal serial killer, ""Buffalo Bill"" (the creepy Ted Levine), who skins his victims, mostly plus-sized women, for reasons that are too gruesome to be repeated here. The FBI puts a young trainee on the case, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), and they have her, in turn, interview the deadly Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cunning psychopath who remains under tight lock and key at a hospital for the criminally insane. Lecter offers to help Clarice in developing a psychological profile in order to help capture ""Buffalo Bill,"" in exchange for her confiding in him, some of her darkest and most troubling childhood memories.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not a film for the squeamish; I already mentioned why. But even for its scenes of grisly carnage, it's not a horror film, nor an exploitation picture that revels in scenes of outlandish gore. Instead, the real terror is more psychological: we rely on the reactions of the characters for the effect. It's a technique that director Jonathan Demme found to be quite satisfactory (it was also put to effective use in the equally disturbing, and commanding serial killer thriller, ""Seven,"" four years later in 1995). Another technique that Demme put to great work here was having his actors stare directly into the camera, allowing us to become uncomfortably intimate with the on-screen action.<br/><br/>I'm not really a fan of Jodie Foster or Anthony Hopkins, really, but their work here is nothing short of legendary. Foster is stunning as the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling, an attractive but commanding young woman who, it seems, is an adult child still reeling it in from some deeply-seeded childhood traumas, and it is through her work on the ""Buffalo Bill"" case and her meetings with Hannibal Lecter that she seems to be able to get a chance to deal with her troubled past and get some closure. Hopkins is equally commanding as the manipulative ""Hannibal the Cannibal,"" who is able to probe the mind of his young interviewee with disturbing efficiency and ease, to satisfy his own twisted curiosities that I don't think are ever really explained (that's a good thing - it makes him even scarier). These truly are, two of the most phenomenal performances in a movie that is a phenomenon upon itself.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is purely the greatest and most terrifying thriller I've seen. However, my personal favorite thriller of all time remains ""Seven."" But the contributions that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" made to the thriller genre, and motion picture history, are not to be overlooked. If it weren't for this film, I don't think I would've gotten ""Seven"" all those years ago.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" was recently named the greatest thriller of all time in Britain.<br/><br/>I'll be hard-pressed to find a reason to disagree with that assertion.<br/><br/>10/10"
"vikramas1109","10","1","2","18 March 2009"," The American Nightmare
","So I recently had a conversation with a friend who is ten years younger than me about the relative merits of the new wave of horror thrillers and remakes (Last House On The Left, The Hills Have Eyes, Halloween, etc.). She is a fan of the genre but remarkably she hadn't seen this film. We watched it together and she was understandably blown away. ""That might be the most tense climax I've ever seen on film!"", as she put it. I figure moving into Hitchcock is the next logical step, but I digress.<br/><br/>It's still amazing to me that the Academy deigned to recognize a psychological thriller that opened in the first quarter of 1991, and not only that but made it the third film ever (and so far the last) to sweep all 5 ""major"" awards. But the appeal of Silence of the Lambs has little to do with its critical accolades. This is a film with deceptively subtle themes, a brilliant screenplay and superb direction, and two of the most outstanding performances in film history. All thrillers since owe a debt to SOTL and probably could learn a thing or two about the power of sustained tension and suspense from it, instead of the ""gotcha"" sensibility of modern horror.<br/><br/>The story follows Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a fresh-faced FBI agent with obvious ambition, as she becomes involved in the case of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. Bill has a predilection for skinning his victims, and other bizarre character traits which become apparent later. He is also exceptionally smart and due to a lack of evidence, the FBI can only glean a pattern of his crimes but nothing about the man himself. In desperation, her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) suggests that she seek insight from another notorious killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). And that's when everything is really set in motion.<br/><br/>One of the most overlooked aspects of SOTL is the buried symbolism of America. Director Jonathan Demme and his DP Tak Fujimoto use heavy reds, whites, and blues all throughout the film. Sometimes, the tinted effect emphasizes tension; other times, danger. Aside from the opening training sequences in Quantico, you'd be hard-pressed to find many well-lit bright shots. A key scene in which Bill takes another unsuspecting victim is foreshadowed by that victim singing Tom Petty's ""American Girl"". Location and colloquial dialects of many characters are extremely important in highlighting American culture. There is definitely an ""only in America""-type of recurring motif. If The Godfather represents The American Dream, SOTL is The American Nightmare.<br/><br/>Another brilliant choice that Demme makes is to use a lot of closeups with no camera movement on Clarice and Hannibal. He trusted that his two actors, with such compelling facial expressions, could handle the material and they don't disappoint. Much has been said about both Foster and Hopkins' work here so I won't repeat much, except to say that Starling's vulnerability vs. Lecter's unflinching, probing gaze is one of the fundamental reasons that the film sustains so much pressure and both actors are marvelous in some excruciatingly emotional scenes.<br/><br/>Finally, the screenplay elevates the material to that of a classic. Consider how strong a character Clarice is. She is not submissive to her superiors, who initially dismiss her talents because she is a female with no real experience. However, though she starts out as a timid, passive agent her strength of will and perseverance shine through and eventually HER efforts lead to the resolution. She also refuses to succumb to Lecter's psychological torture, and that is why he finds her so intriguing and continues to push her deeper and deeper into her rawest emotions. Rarely has there been such a well-developed, strong female lead in all of film history. On top of all that, the screenplay affords equal time to Buffalo Bill, a decision that makes him all the more interesting since we see and learn of his process, methods, reasons, and true brutality. The night-vision climactic standoff is so effective precisely because we truly care about Clarice and genuinely fear for her safety if she fails.<br/><br/>In short, instead of watching the high gore, low impact crap that passes for a good horror thriller these days, you could do much better and see one of the most effective and revered movies in the genre. With edge of the seat tension, powerful imagery and a chilling masterclass of acting by Anthony Hopkins (in only 16 minutes of screen time!) along with great work by Jodi Foster, Silence of the Lambs is rightly considered among the best of its kind. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm having an old friend for dinner..."

","""A census taker once tried to test me.

A break-through in the case can only be found through the interrogation of the brilliant yet outlandishly insane confined psychologist, Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter. Hannibal will only provide the information in exchange for Clarice to tell him about her own personal life which acts as the fantastic foundation for the title of this lucrative masterpiece.<br/><br/>The story was structured and shot perfectly. The film was constantly charged with suspense and tension, littered with thought-provoking dialogue oozing with intrigue. The performances were just awe-inspiring as the academy acknowledge. Anthony Hopkins was simply chilling as the twisted, genius that is Hannibal Lecter. Chills also arise through Ted Levine's frightening invention of the character of Buffalo Bill. Levine should have notched up a nomination for a best supporting actor at the Oscars due to the performance's flawless ability to chill and disturb. Also, Foster can not be forgotten as she played the multi-faceted character of Clarice Starling. Foster conjures an awesome balance of emotion to flawlessly invent the character of Clarice.<br/><br/>Overall, Silence of the Lambs is engaging, disturbing, chilling and holds it's ground as one of the greatest thrillers of all time."
"mrmoviefreak261-1","10","1","2","28 November 2008"," Definitely one of the greatest achievements in movie history
","Silence of the Lambs has Jodie Foster, a vulnerable, inexperienced FBI student with a mind as green as the terrifying Hannibal Lecter, the Cannibal whose cunning head helps the poor FBI find a missing ""big"" girl. What more can you ask for? This film is genius. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins together in a film as mature and sick as this? I was completely satisfied with the film because in general, it's a good film with a good plot, excellent acting and good story flowing. The acting and the atmosphere of the Cannibal really has an impact on you while you're watching and you can do nothing but shudder every time you see Hannibal, with the freaking smile and voice he has. This is also one the few films that actually scared me, mentally. Again, it's a mature film, with a sick and gross plot.

","The FBI thriller to end all FBI thrillers.<br/><br/>We can probably thank ""The Silence of the Lambs"" for the plethora of CSI shows bombarding our T.V. screens today, but don't hold that against it. This is one of those films that I never tire of seeing, and I can't come across it on cable without stopping whatever it is I'm doing to watch it.<br/><br/>""Lambs"" came out of nowhere in 1991 as the big film of the year, and the fact that it won the top five Academy Awards has given it prestige. But to look back, it's amazing that this film was taken seriously enough to win big. It's brutal, violent and traffics in all manner of psychopathic nastiness, from cannibalism to sexual deviation. Jonathan Demme's direction is tight but by-the-book -- it's first and foremost a plot driven movie. But the film's ace card is the performance by Anthony Hopkins, who chose to play Hannibal Lecter as a suave and polite Englishman rather than a raving lunatic. His scenes with Jodie Foster, as FBI trainee Clarice Starling, are mesmerizing, and it was a brilliant choice on the part of the screenwriter (and this probably came from the book, though I haven't read it) to make the film, under its grisly surface, essentially about a love story.<br/><br/>Foster's performance doesn't hold up well all these years later. She's mannered and unconvincing, especially later in the film as her character becomes more frantic. But Hopkins' creation remains one of the most memorable ever committed to the screen.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","This is a classic horror movie right from the start. Usually movies take about 20 years before becoming a classic, but not Silence of the Lambs. This movie has a very complex storyline but that works to its advantage. The music is not really eerie, but thats what makes it SO eerie. Hannibal Lecter is VERY WELL played by Anthony Hopkins. He is so evil, so sneaky, he tops most other movie villains. His mere stare is enough to make someone tremble. Everyone who stands in his way seems to have bad luck come to them. Hannibal is the most sophisticated, evil, possibly bi-polar cannibal to ever grace the big screen. 17 years later, this movie hasn't become any less eerie. My only complaint was Jody Foster, she did play Clarice very well but was sometimes over the top and seems to fall out of character a little. Unfortunately, since she's the main character, it was enough to knock this movie down a star. But this movie is still near perfect. Recommend to everyone who wants a good crime/horror movie. Fans of Se7en will most likely enjoy this. 9/10."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","16 February 2008"," A near flawless execution of a crime thriller
","Few crime films seem to transcend their genre. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of them. With incredible characters and careful, thoughtful direction, it's not a complete surprise that this film is among the many elite that call themselves Academy Award winning best pictures.<br/><br/>The film centers around Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster), an FBI trainee that essentially because of being young and feminine, gets assigned to work with a serial killer: the infamous Hannibal Lecter, one of the most chilling villains of all time played by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Eventually she finds herself thrust into another serial murder case involving ""Buffalo Bill"" and must seek the nutty Lecter's advice in order to solve it.<br/><br/>Starling and her struggle to ward off the sexist world of that surrounds her in this field is the film's centerpiece. Director Jonathan Demme does a great job focusing on Foster's strengths: her facial expressions, her constant nervousness knowing that this will make or break the career to which she aspires. Demme also does a great job making it clear, but not too overtly so, how the men in the film eerily gravitate toward her in every situation. It's bothering, but the fact that she is indeed the film's hero makes it somewhat empowering.<br/><br/>While little attention was paid to ""Buffalo Bill,"" an interesting character with a powerful metaphor and comparison to Starling in Thomas Harris' book, the focus is substituted with full attention to Lecter's scenes and his role becomes more pivotal in the film, which is clearly worth it given Hopkins' talent. It is then more about how he affects Starling and how they work together and form a unique relationship. It is unfortunate both could not be stronger, but there's is no arguing with the strength of this screenplay.<br/><br/>""Silence of the Lambs"" is not the kind of film that will move you, but it is an excellent example of how great characters can take an ordinary serial murder plot and make it something more than just a genre film.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site: http://moviemusereviews.com"
"HelloTexas11","10","1","2","15 January 2008"," a few thoughts on a classic
","One of the things that strikes me whenever I watch 'Silence of the Lambs' again is how different Jodie Foster looks at various points in the movie. I don't know if this is deliberate or just the way her face comes across when filmed from different angles and with different lighting. At the risk of sounding as though I'm only focusing on her physical appearance, she sometimes appears radiantly beautiful, other times cute in a tomboy-ish way, and sometimes downright unattractive. I mention this because there are a number of quirky details in 'Silence of the Lambs' that one only picks up on with repeated viewings, and they all fall together in such a casual, unforced way that it's easy to believe they just happened. But no film turns out this well by accident. The director, Jonathan Demme, might have gotten lucky with one or two shots but I have to believe nearly everything in this movie was calculated to create the exact effect each renders. Anthony Hopkins had, prior to 'Lambs,' never been a favorite actor of mine. I was never particularly impressed with him in any role. In fact, it would be hard to think of one part that Hopkins was really identified with. But if ever the actor and the character and the moment came together in perfect realization, it was in this film. Hopkins grasps the complexities of Hannibal Lecter and presents them in such a way that it is now impossible to think of one and not the other. Just as Thomas Harris does in his books, Lecter is on film depicted as a cannibalistic madman but so much more than that; he is polite, resourceful, intolerant of most other criminals, tasteful, sophisticated... not to mention a genius. Given what Hannibal has done in the past and has every intention of doing in the future, his character would seem the most unlikely to appear even slightly sympathetic to the audience. And yet he does. Clarice Starling is a more straightforward character, easier to figure out, but Jodie Foster embodies her in a similar way. She is single-minded, on an almost holy quest to achieve success as an FBI agent, to rescue the helpless and imprison the guilty. She pushes herself relentlessly though Starling is not typically reflective unless forced into it by Lecter. When he tells her during their first meeting, ""You're so ambitious, aren't you?"", he has her nailed, dead to rights. Over the course of the film, Hannibal Lecter begins to display other qualities that almost qualify as superhuman. He is immensely strong. He can apparently control and manipulate his body's functions to create false readings. He seems at times capable of both telepathy and empathy. Nothing supernatural is suggested, only such finely-honed skills of observation and reasoning that not even the smallest detail escapes his notice. And most importantly, he never fails at anything he sets out to do. By the end of the film, one is convinced Lecter could have escaped from that jail cell anytime he wanted. In fact, his escape from the cage in Memphis is so improbable that in retrospect it borders on magic. For everything to have happened in the order it did and with the precise timing it needed to happen beggars belief, to say the least. And yet it is so well-staged, and we are so convinced by this point that Hannibal is perfectly capable of pulling it off, the audience never questions it."

","One of the most celebrated films of the 1990's,THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a superbly made and acted adaptation of the novel by Thomas Harris,with excellent lead performances,script and direction.The story of FBI rookie Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) being put in a position of trust by her superiors to trace depraved serial killer Buffalo Bill,but with the help of the equally depraved but charming and intellectual Dr.Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) grips totally throughout it's duration,with cleverly judged moments of violence and suspense,with some outstanding and ingenious twists in the plot and construction of the film. <br/><br/>This was talented director Jonathan Demme's finest hour as a director,with deeply impressive performances by Hopkins as the warped psycho genius Lecter,and Foster as the somewhat naive,but courageous and gutsy heroine Clarice,one of the most vividly etched female leads in cinematic history.Their duologue's could have been rather static and stagy,but thanks to Demme's faultless handling and the great acting on show by the aforementioned,it come across as totally compelling and fascinating. Support performances by such venerables as Scott Glenn,Anthony Heald,Charles Napier and Diane Baker are also of the top rank,and arguably very few pieces of cinema have ever matched the relentless thrills,shocks and tension that THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS achieves so successfully. <br/><br/>If there is one problem with the film,it is that the details and actions of the depraved principals involved are so overwhelmingly ugly,nasty and repellent that one even questions the imagination and mental state of the writers and filmmakers to invent such horrid,gruesome events for our entertainment.The filmmakers are to be congratulated that THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is so brilliantly made that it takes away the feeling of bad taste,but with the sheer repulsiveness of certain story aspects,it is occasionally something of a struggle.The eventually seen character of Jame Gumb (aka Buffalo Bill) must rank as the most relentlessly evil,disturbed and unpleasant villain ever witnessed in mainstream cinema.Convincingly played by Ted Levine,he even makes the murderous antics of fellow nut-case Hannibal seem as relatively innocent and wholesome as a children's picnic! <br/><br/>Despite these reservations,THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a considerable success as a gripping and exciting horror thriller,which of course was deservedly rewarded at the Oscars.And if you can take it,it is probably one of the very best of it's kind ever made (if not the best).<br/><br/>RATING:8 and a half out of 10."

The haunting score by the famous Howard Shore also added to the suspense.<br/><br/>Other remarks: The film flew by with no time for dillydallying like many other films have a tendency of doing, and the story was solid with no plot holes. The editing was a little choppy in the first half hour, but there's no room for complaints there. Overall, this film, I consider is among the best movies ever made.

Clarice Starling is a young, inexperienced FBI agent trainee (with lots of emotional baggage) assigned to work the case after another woman/potential victim goes missing. Starling's only chance to crack the case is to enlist the aid of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant and manipulative psychiatrist now imprisoned for cannibalism. Startling, powerfully acted thriller is tough to take at times, but is brilliantly crafted, consistently gripping, and effectively explores the depths of the criminal mind. Not for all tastes, but a formidable and unforgettable addition to the genre that serves as a terrific showing for all those involved. ***Â½"
"GVarela","10","1","2","5 June 2006"," A rare cinematographic masterpiece
","The Silence of the Lambs is a cinematographic treasure hard to find in today's society. The work put into this grand film is spectacular. The chemistry between two Hllywood legends, Foster and Hopkins, is a rare characteristic in modern day movie making. What's great about this movie is it's honesty and incredible truth. What truly surprises me thought is it's wisdom, such a smart way to put it together, such a smart way to write it, to film it and to act it. A very rare masterpiece in the the cinematographic business. Though it is gruesome and direct, I can't help but to recommend this work of art to all those in search for the perfect film. It has action, drama, it's thrilling and just won't let you go, it will stay in your mind forever, as it stayed in mine."
"tohu","9","1","2","22 May 2006"," Hugely enjoyable
","There is very little one can say about this film that hasn't been said many times already. It exploded on to the screen as a complete surprise, and fully deserved the extraordinary level of the plaudits it received.<br/><br/>It is not realistic, but do all films really have to be? The central character of Clarice Starling is easily recognisable as the modern career woman struggling with something to prove, played to perfection by Jodie Foster. But of course she is overshadowed by the entrancing performance of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. At once terrifying, fascinating and slightly surreal, he lurks in the mind long after the movie ends, even though his time on-screen makes up a relatively small proportion of the film, and it is worth seeing for him alone.<br/><br/>It is hard to say that the film would have scored the success it did without this mesmerising performance. But as so often with films which are dominated by one single aspect, the fact that you are made to look closely at it reveals a number of other qualities. Tension is admirably maintained, despite the far-fetched plot, and at times it is genuinely frightening, keeping you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>It's a thrilling ride; one which requires you at times to suspend your sense of reality and go where the director wants to take you. Hugely enjoyable and largely ridiculous, there is no such person as Hannibel Lecter. Or is there?"

","This movie is something which I decided I would never watch again after I did first, but I did it many time afterwords - mainly two reasons - a blood-freezing story wrapped in a most delicate manner each fans of thriller adore, and outstanding play by Jodie Foster (which surely was embedding every woman we loved in a moment of her confrontation with evil) and Anthony Hopkins, which was impossible magnetic and very assuring. Thanks for this horror (to my regret continuation has not been equally powerful art, though probably exceeded the level of horror). I would rank this movie inside top 20.

Well what can i say about Anthony Hopkins he just was superb he played the part so well in the sense of keeping you intrigued of what he was going to ask or say to Clarice next. Also you could see that Hannibal Lecter loved Clarice in his own way. This film will go down in history as a classic and it will never get old or grow out of date, in my eyes it will always be remembered as absolute 10 out of 10 film."
"LuckyGraveyardBoots","10","1","2","9 May 2006"," a compelling portrait of human evil
","Wow. Just wow. The most deeply frightening movie I have ever seen. The plot revolves around Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, who, to track down serial killer ""Buffalo Bill"" (who kidnaps and skins women) must talk to another captured killer and psychopath, Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter. Her relationship with Hannibal evolves into something slightly sado-masochistic, and becomes a twisted version of the father-daughter dynamic - Clarice has issues with her father, and with guilt. Deep consideration of what constitutes ""higher"" and ""lower"" forms of being in a human, what exactly is psychopathic and what exactly is evil, and all forms of destructive being are taken into account, symbolized by the death's-head moth. The character Hannibal is extremely intriguing and multi-dimensional, especially compared with Buffalo Bill...while the latter knows that what he's doing can get him in trouble, he still doesn't perceive himself as psychopathic, but Hannibal does. He continues to do what he's doing when possible, to acknowledge it, to even use it to his advantage with the weapon of fear, and all the while functioning on a higher, very intellectual and thoughtful level. His morbid curiosity in Clarice's past runs parallel to the desire to consume another human being. By the way, did you know that there is a species of moth that lives on nothing but tears?"

"calixtakenyon","9","1","2","3 May 2006"," 3 feelings mingling
","3 feelings mingling, the indulgence in perversion in Buffalo Bill, the sense of precision in FBI, the madness of genius in Lector. These three feelings mingle like a recipe to form something all its own, a feeling greater than the sum of its parts, just as a clock or an automobile is something on its own and bigger than the brute sum of all its parts. The scene in which the movie tricks you into thinking Jodie Foster, also known as Clarice Starling, is in one house or approaching one house (I can't remember) when she's really in another is well done and has tricked me more than once, which means even once I had already seen the movie it had the ability to draw me in so that I forgot to remember that the movie was going to try and trick me. Also, though stating the obvious is often tedious, this is one case that warrants repetition"
"Hitchcoc","9","1","2","5 April 2006"," Maybe a Little Too Much
","Though there are few films so outwardly violent, the real gold in this film comes from the interaction between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. He prowls like a lion, back and forth in his glass cage, muzzled, dangerous. Foster reacts to him as you would someone who could kill you if you looked away for a second. Parry and thrust. As the film develops, a charming kind of standoff occurs. The FBI agent begins to see some humanity in this monster. She needs him, but she needs to trust him first. There are the scenes with the mask and the biting off of noses and other violence, but these show that he is in many ways a cunning beast. He is also a genius. As the profiling goes on, more and more layers of the mystery are cleared and the quarry knows the quarry. Hannibal Lecter is a celebrity brutalizer, and, of course, a cannibal. Hopkins knows few peers in contemporary cinema. His films are almost always worth the time. I doubt if he has ever created anyone like this before."
"PIST-OFF","10","1","2","10 January 2006"," A study in building up a character as a bad ass
","If silence of the lambs didn't do anything else right (in fact it did everything right) it would serve as the perfect example of how to build up a character as a bad ass. The secret is perfectly on display. All the rules are followed. Screen time for Hannibal Lecter is kept to a minimum, at just under sixteen minutes. This utter lack of screen time which build the anxiety necessary to the character subsequently was ignored in the sequels and the result is that Hannibal falls victim to the Freddie Krueger effect where your sympathies begin to cynically side with him, thus underplaying the currents of the movie. All great heroes and villains must follow this rule in order to be considered true movie bad asses. Think Darth Vader, or Clint Eastwood in unforgiven, or Micheal Madsen as Mr blonde in reservoir dogs. The second rule is to have you're bad ass doing things decidedly not bad ass, i.e. Eastwood getting beat up in unforgiven, and here Hannibal is mostly a caged animal. The third rule is to have other characters reference the potential violence your bad ass can unleash. Here, numerous characters talk about just how bad Hannibal is, and in a masterstroke, doctor Chilton shows a picture to Jodie Foster, that the audience never sees. This is like the scene in reservoir dogs, where the audience's imagination are encouraged to imagine the most horrific things. This movie follows all the rules and creates on of the all time hard core movie bad asses!!!!!! 10 out of 10"
"hans_moleman_31","10","1","2","4 July 2005"," The Scariest Performance Ever
","If Anthony Hopkins ever needs to present evidence in court that he is in fact a talented actor, he need look no further than right here. Through Hopkins' performance, Hannibal Lecter becomes more scary than Dracula, Wolf Man or any other monster in movie history. Lecter is the proof that the greatest horror comes from the mind. It is not the though of Lecter coming into our house in the middle of the night and eating us that is scary, its what he can do just by looking and talking to us. That evokes true fear. Hopkins is so affecting, he alone gives this 7 stars. But thats not to say the rest of the film is weak. Jodie Foster redefines the heroine as Clarice Starling. She is head strong and...............vagina sure? I suppose that would have to suffice as cock-sure. Starling is also weak though, and its a testament to Fosters' acting chops that Starling doesn't just swoon at Lecters speeches, but rather fires back equally acidic comments at him. However, Hopkins remains the star of this fine piece of film-making. Even though he's only in it for 18 minutes!"

The scene in Hannibal Lecter's cell when he stares at the pen with the hope of sabotaging a part from it to pick his handcuffs.  The camera pans back and fourth between it and the pen.  Brilliant.  Clarice Starling's point of view when she first lays eyes on Lecter.  The double murder of the guards in Hannibal's Memphis cell is probably the most terrifying scene ever filmed. Anthony Hopkins proves that quality and not quantity is the key to a best actor Oscar as his part is extremely small but effective.  Jodie Foster holds her own with him and you believe every second of her performance. Jonathan Demme's direction is superb and he stamps the film with a sure footed sense of style and chilling effectiveness.  And Ted Tally's adaptation of the book by Thomas Harris is entertaining from start to finish without one boring moment in the entire film.

"SKG-2","10","1","2","15 March 1999"," Unusual horror film
","I'm not an expert in the horror genre, but I do know the reputation it earned thanks to the ""slasher"" films which were so prevalent in the 70's and 80's, which could be described by the ""M"" word; misogynistic.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is one of those rare horror films(hell, one of those rare films) which features a strong heroine who's also believable.  And Jodie Foster is the perfect actress to play it, conveying all the strength, toughness, resourcefulness, and vulnerability of Clarice Starling.  And while ""Buffalo Bill"" may kill women, none of the women portrayed in the film, from Brooke Smith as the one in the pit, to Diane Baker as her senator mother, and Kasi Lemmons as Clarice's partner, are seen as just victims (even Smith, once she gets over her initial terror, tries to fight back).  It's one of those rare things, a feminist horror film.<br/><br/>Of course, Jonathan Demme and Ted Tally, working from the novel by Thomas Harris (the best thriller novel of the 80's) do remember this is a horror film as well, and give us THE most terrifying villain of the 90's.  No, not Buffalo Bill, though Ted Levine is effective in the role, but Dr. Hannibal""the Cannibal"" Lecter, played to mesmerizing perfection by Anthony Hopkins.  Hopkins said one of the ways he tried to create Lecter's effect was trying not to blink, and that certainly does the trick.  But he also uses his voice, his lack of body movement, and his face to create terror, and while he pretends to give away nothing, in fact, without meaning to, betrays feelings for Clarice (just look at the look of sadness he has before he tells Clarice Dr. Chilton has come for her before he can give her what she needs to catch Buffalo Bill).<br/><br/>Yet while Demme is quite good at the horror, he avoids the mistake most serial killer works have made today, and that's being too clinical.  People get so wrapped up in the science that they forget about the human beings who are turned into these monsters, and who are killed by them.  He also avoids being overly lurid; most of the actual violence occurs off-screen, and in the one case (the jail cell) where it doesn't,  we don't have big close-ups of the victims, but mostly shots of Lecter, which is frightening enough.<br/><br/>By the way, two misconceptions to clear up; first of all, this film does not glorify Lecter.  It merely recognizes that sometimes, when you have to fight evil, you have to confront it.  Secondly, when this film was released, there were complaints that it was a homophobic film.  Buffalo Bill is not gay, and it states clearly that he was rejected when he tried to have a hospital make him a transsexual, so his behavior, not his desire, is what is portrayed as abhorrent."

There is violence only when necessary or to accentuate a particular scene.  However, it is the manner in which the film is presented that intensifies the plot.  It is a mature drama.<br/><br/>All scenes are grim and eerie; director Demme is to blame for all the bold, creepy images and camera work.

"jhaggardjr","9","1","2","24 February 2001"," Brilliantly acted thriller
","Even though it's been 10 years since this film came out, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that I still can't believe won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1991. This is the kind of movie that Academy voters usually don't go for, and it was released in February of that year. Movies released very early in the year hardly ever win Oscar's top prize. But in another way I can see why this film went on the become the third movie in Oscar history to win the top 5 Oscars (the other two were 1934's ""It Happened One Night"" and 1975's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""). It's a very well made and brilliantly acted suspense-thriller. Jodie Foster has never been better in her second Best Actress Oscar-winning performance of her great career (following her first, 1988's ""The Accused"") as Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who goes to visit Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Best Actor Anthony Hopkins), a very smart man who has a nasty habit of eating human flesh (Yuck!). Starling hopes that Dr. Lecter can provide information for her and her FBI team in catching a serial killer who likes to skin his victims, and at the moment has kidnapped the daughter of a senator. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that is quite disturbing to watch at times. Some of the images are ugly and downright horrifying. But those two performances by Foster and Hopkins make this movie as good as it is. I couldn't take my eyes off of them everytime they were on screen. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" certainly held my attention, and I would have to say of all the five movies nominated for Best Picture of 1991 (the other nominees were ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Bugsy"", ""JFK"", and ""The Prince of Tides""), this one is definitely the best.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"

I like Anthony Hopkins as an actor but he was hamming it up as Lecter and made the charcter look cartoonish rather than scary. Jodie Foster gave a good impression of a woman trying to reverse out of a parking space.<br/><br/>
What surpised me most about this film was that it won several Oscars including best film. It's obvious to me now that the people at the Academy know less about film than most five year olds. Remember when Kramer v Kramer won best film, that was the year Apocalypse Now was released and who can remember the former?<br/><br/>I've learned my lesson since then and have avoided Oscar winners such as Titanic and The English Patient. Silence of the Lambs is an above average thriller but no work of art. The plot is also absurd and goes for cheap thrills with the usual gore and when Buffalo Bill gets his kit off you simply have to yawn, it didn't shock me. As for his victim in the pit, somehow you just wish Bill would end it for the poor girl and the suffering audience. <br/><br/>In summary! Not as good as Manhunter and not the best of Hopkins! 7/10"

"rmax304823","7","2","7","15 February 2008"," Surprisingly Effective Thriller
","Jodie Foster, in a fine performance, is FBI-trainee Clarice Starling. She is assigned by the chief of the Behavioral Sciences Division (Scott Glenn) to interview the brilliant and cannibalistic mad psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in prison and try to enlist his help in capturing a currently active serial murderer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who skins his victims and sews the patches of skin into a kind of integumental suit made of women.<br/><br/>When Starling first visits Lecter, the chief psychiatrist ( the eminently hatable Anthony Heald) escorts her down into the bowels of the institution and cautions her about approaching Lecter too closely, although they will be separated by a wall of bullet-proof plastic.<br/><br/>Lecter DOES in fact help her. Buffalo Bill had once been a patient of his. But Lecter wants something too, in return. ""Quid pro quo,"" he tells her, showing off his Latin clichés. For every hint he gives to her and to the FBI, he demands some sort of present, such as a room with a view and, most important, some personal details about Starling's earlier life, the events in her past that brought her from a one-horse town in Appalachia to the FBI. He gets it. And she gets Buffalo Bill. And Lecter escapes in order to carry on his own cannibalistic career, beginning with the eminently hatable Anthony Heald. (His last line: ""I'm having an old friend for dinner tonight."") It doesn't sound too promising, does it? Still ANOTHER serial killer on the loose? With a puzzling modus operandi? Which the FBI must figure out in order to track him down and shoot him dead? But I described this as an effective thriller, not an ordinary one that serves as one more opportunity for Stallone to strip off his clothes and bulge his muscles at the camera. It's functionally directed by Jonathan Demme, based on Thomas Harris's novel. Only one incident involves a stunt man. There isn't a car chase in sight, nor an exploding fireball, nor a slow-motion shot of violence. There is one lethal beating and only a single shoot-out -- with pistols, not Uzis or 40 mm. Bofors cannons.<br/><br/>The three threads of the story involve Glenn's avuncular relationship with the younger Starling, the flirtation (for that's what it amounts to) between Lecter and Starling, and the pursuit of the twisted Buffalo Bill. The stories mesh very well, and one scene in particular, linking the FBI's attack on a suspect's house to Starling's casual and apparently post-climactic ringing the doorbell of a house belonging to an old lady, is masterfully done.<br/><br/>Tak Fujimoto's camera work could hardly be improved upon. He paints for us a wintry Middle-Atlantic setting with ice-cold rivers and stark, bare deciduous trees. There is a scene with a decomposing corpse that makes your skin crawl, although it is handled matter-of-factly, or even in such good taste as such a scene allows for. Original, too, is the character of Buffalo Bill's last intended victim, a large young lady kept prisoner in a basement pit. With Bill still darting around in the shadows somewhere, the lone Starling yells down to her and tells her she's safe now that the FBI is here. We're wrong if we expect the captive to pull the usual response. She doesn't break down and sob with relief. She screams back, ""**** that, you b****! Get me out of here!"" It was a nice touch in the novel too, which is written in lean, functional, and artless prose.<br/><br/>All of the performances are quite good, with Hopkins outstanding as the crazy genius. The character became something of an icon in vernacular culture, which I guess is why audiences find it satisfying and amusing that he should be left on the loose to kill still more people. It adds a new dimension to films -- the serial killer who deserves to be let free because he's polite and has visited Florence. <br/><br/>The writers help bring this story above average. When Foster explores the house of an earlier, almost forgotten victim, there is a touching moment when she discovers some hidden photos the girl had taken of herself posing coyly in her underwear, although she's too plump to be conventionally attractive. A music box plays in the background while Foster goes through these pitiful remnants and we can sense the life behind the death. The direction isn't free of conventions though. Foster is blinded in darkness and the murder's hand reaches out from behind the camera and traces her contours without touching them. Every horror movie must have such a scene. And earlier, when Scott Glenn realizes he's sent Foster into a dangerous, potentially lethal circumstance without any warning, the camera moves in quickly to a close up of his startled expression as he says, ""Clarice!"" These clichés are available in finer B-grade slasher movies everywhere.<br/><br/>The conventions are aptly deployed though and the movie succeeds in what it's trying to do."

","This movie is just a mess from beginning to end. First of all, actors and actresses have a tendency to overact, so writers and directors will always try to throw realism out the window so that they can indulge themselves! While the character of Dr. Lecter is not technically impossible, it is highly unlikely. Sociopaths in real life are much more likely to be low functioning, impulsive, and not very good book learners. So this movie starts off with a bad premise. I'm not a very big fan of Jodie Foster movies to begin with, and her character is very annoying to me. The best part of the entire film is the Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) scenes. The idea that Lecter would give Starling such highly intellectualized clues is improbable, but I suppose I am being overly critical here. This is still less annoying than Manhunter, but not by much!!"

Call it morbid curiosity if you like; I always wonder if the story will survive the transfer from book to movie and if the director will be true to what the book does. Sometimes, the transition is better than other times. Lord of the Rings was spectacular. This moviewas not, I'm sad to say.<br/><br/>I think the fault does not lie with the actors, at least not entirely. Anthony Hopkins shone as Hannibal (how could he not?), but his scenes were handled badly. The scene that stands out for me as the worst in the movie was, unfortunately, the first meeting between Clarice and Hannibal. This is most unfortunate because that particular scene is one of my favorites in the book. I wonder if the director actually read the book this movie is based on. To the director: with all due respect, Hannibal is a gentleman. He would not shout for Clarice because gentlemen do not shout for women as if they were dogs. According to the book, he called her name repeatedly as she was walking away, and only her desire for advancement brought her back. Also, this scene was horribly abbreviated, as were all the other scenes between Clarice and Hannibal.<br/><br/>Part of the blame is on the shoulders of the director, but Jodie Foster in the role of Clarice must take some of the blame as well. There were moments when she made Clarice shine, and I saw in her face all the strength and courage that I loved and admired in the book. The final showdown, however, ruined it for me. Jodie may have won an Oscar for this performance, but I suspect that those who decide on those awards never read the book. Jodie showed good emotion, if the director asked for fear. Shaking hands, fast breathing, fumbling for bullets, the whole spiel. But that's not the character of Clarice. In the first place, Clarice was at the top of her shooting class; she'd practiced taking her gun out of its holster four thousand times (according to the book). She was smooth in her draw, not fumbling. In the second place, Clarice doesn't show fear. She's fully aware in the cellar that Buffalo Bill could be around every corner, and being a female and showing him fear is giving him the advantage. She knows that. According to all I've read in the book, she knows how to control her fear.<br/><br/>Now, I'll admit, I'm biased about this movie because I love the book. And there were moments when there was a definite shine in the movie: Crawford was brilliantly good, and while Jame Gumb was a little too retarded, he did well. But what made the book brilliant was sadly lacking. I'd never buy this movie."

","I know a couple who had actually saw the premiere of this film in Hollywood and actually walked out of it when it started and right past Anthony Hopkins! That alone tells you this is one disturbed film. Hopkins is perfect as Hannibal Lecter, a unimaginably smart and insane serial killer who helps Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster won an Oscar) track down another vicious serial killer named Buffalo Bill. The lines are some of the best you will ever hear and the acting is breathtaking. But it is ridiculously vulgar and sadistic. Not for kids under 18 or for the faint of heart or stomach to be more specific. Followed by Hannibal and Red Dragon also starring Hopkins."

No, there aren't any jump-scares or ghosts, but this film shows that the ones that you truly have to fear are the living. While the film is fictional, it is inspired by true events, and Buffalo Bill was created under the model of real serial killers (so the events depicted aren't too far from things that have actually happened). This information alone should send shivers down your spine. The film is beautifully shot, directed, and acted. The dialogue is also incredible. One of the few films that truly deserve an 10/10 rating. If you have not seen ""The Silence of the Lambs"", you are truly doing yourself a disservice.

The film has a gripping narrative throughout, with good and exceptional performances and a beautiful score.<br/><br/>The storyline follows an FBI agent in training (Jodie Foster), who has been sent to interview the renowned cannibalistic psychiatrist (Anthony Hopkins) in an insane asylum. I'm pretty sure almost everyone knows the basic plot, but what I found deeply gripping in this film is the way that both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins give such believable, raw, emotional performances, which really drew me into the narrative. The soundtrack compliments the emotional level to the film. <br/><br/>Overall, a truly brilliant film. Definitely one to check of the 'to watch' list if you've never seen it, or one to rewatch!"
"harryw-22205","10","1","3","25 October 2016"," A Sophisticated Thriller
","Silence of the Lambs is a crime thriller brought from page to the big screen by director Jonathan Demme and Is, in my opinion, his greatest film. It is by far the best film of the Hannibal Lectre series and picked itself up a total of five Oscars including best picture. <br/><br/>Jodie Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling is definitely for me one of the greatest female performances of all time. Clarice Starling had very intriguing character development from a sensitive police student to a proud detective who solved the case of the murderous Buffalo Bill, however we are still left to wonder whether the lambs are still screaming. Anthony Hopkins also knocked the ball out of the park with a very disturbing portrayal of one of the most infamous movie characters of all time: Hannibal Lectre. His soft cunning voice in contrast to his cruel vindictive words sent chills down my spine and injected a dose of anxiety into my veins. This film, for me, defines the careers of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins with both of them picking up Oscars for best actor and best actress. <br/><br/>One thing for me that stood out about this film was the fact that it did not rely on gore to progress the narrative which in hands of some directors would have been the case. The Silence of the Lambs contains great dialogue, specifically between Clarice and Hannibal to which really drove the narrative without it been boring. Not knowing whether Hammbial is speaking the truth or in anagrams was extremely gripping and seeing Clarice trying to maintain her professionalism was at times painful to watch ( in a good way! ). Antagonist Buffalo Bill, portrayed by the great Ted Levine, really stroke fear into my system and was an intriguing character to learn about. The pinnacle scene in which he follows Clarice in the the dark almost caused me to have a stroke, literally! I genuinely was unsure Clarice was going to survive and also the experience of seeing this play out in the POV of Bill was quite hard to maintain however a very effective decision from Demme. <br/><br/>There are hardly any negative criticism I can give towards this film except from the fact that I wish that it explained Hannibals motives in a bit more detail. Although he allowed the plot to excel and fulfilled his purpose of leaving chills in the spines of the characters and the audience, I wish that we could of had a little bit more context on him. Sure this is nit picking but I've got to find some sort of criticism. <br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a classic example of pages to the big screen done right and will always remain a classic in film history."

"Tweekums","9","1","3","18 September 2016"," Talk to a serial killer to catch a serial killer
","A serial killer, dubbed Buffalo Bill, has been murdering and skinning young women and the FBI are getting nowhere. Jack Crawford, the agent leading the investigation, decides to try something different; he sends trainee agent Clarice Starling to talk to incarcerated serial killer Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector hoping that he might provide some insight; it won't be easy though; Lector likes to play mind games with people and he is soon trying to get young Clarice to reveal some personal secrets. Soon another body is discovered then Buffalo Bill kidnaps another victim; this time the daughter of a US Senator; with the clock ticking before he kills her the FBI offer Lector a deal; unfortunately the doctor in charge of the facility housing Lector tells him the deal isn't realÂ… he then arranges another deal and Lector is transferred to Tennessee. Here Clarice sees him one last time and, after revealing details of a childhood trauma, is put on the trail of Bill and into a potentially deadly situation.<br/><br/>This is an impressive thriller that is still effective after a quarter of a century and numerous spoofs of some of its most famous scenes. While the story is ostensibly about the hunt for Buffalo Bill it is as much about the growing relationship between Clarice and Lector as he gets her to open up about herself; something she has been warned about doing but does to gain his trust. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are both impressive in these roles. The rest of the cast, most notably Scott Glenn as Crawford and Anthony Heald as Dr Chilton are pretty good too. While there aren't a lot of violent scenes those that there are are particularly brutal. As the story approaches its conclusion the tension rises until the conclusion that remains very tense even after several viewings of the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those wanting a solid thriller; just be warned it isn't for the faint-hearted."
"The Grand Master","10","1","3","7 June 2016"," An electrifying and brilliant thriller that is still an unforgettable cinematic triumph 25 years on.
","It's hard to believe that 25 years ago The Silence of the Lambs was a huge box office success that garnered a lot of critical acclaim. It also did very well at the Academy Awards ceremony, netting 5 Academy Awards for all the major categories (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay). Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have never been finer, and director Jonathon Demme was certainly at the top of his game. Based on the best selling novel by Thomas Harris, The Silence of the Lambs has done very well to uphold its stellar reputation as one of the finest thrillers of all time.<br/><br/>Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is an FBI trainee at the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia. She is specially handpicked by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit on the basis of her stellar academic achievements and performance as an FBI trainee. Crawford assigns her to interview the charismatic yet psychotic Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychiatrist turned cannibalistic serial killer who is currently incarcerated in a maximum security prison. Clarice Starling has been assigned to see Hannibal Lector to provide an insight into a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" aka Jame Gumb (Ted Levine), who kidnaps women and skins their corpses. Hannibal Lector agrees on the proviso that Clarice reveals personal information about herself and he is transferred away from Dr Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald) and housed in a more comfortable prison. As the mind games continue between Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling, the pursuit of Buffalo Bill becomes a race against time when he abducts and takes prisoner his next victim Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), who is also the daughter of US Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker).<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins turns in a memorable and chilling performance as Hannibal Lector which will never be forgotten. It is also no surprise Hannibal Lector has topped (or even rounded out the top 5) list of the best all time villains.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster is also brilliant as FBI trainee Clarice Starling who is tough, intelligent, but vulnerable. Having forged her career as a child actress, and then coming of age after netting an Academy Award for Best Actress as a rape victim in The Accused (1988), Jodie Foster firmly makes her mark as one of the finest actresses as well as receiving a well deserved second Academy Award for Best Actress. Also Clarice Starling earns a well deserved spot as one of the best movie heroines right up there besides Ellen Ripley from the Alien series, Sarah Connor from The Terminator series, and Princess Leia from the Star Wars series.<br/><br/>Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford also does a brilliant job. Scott Glenn is a very versatile actor with an extensive career and here in The Silence of the Lambs, he always does an efficient and faultless job.<br/><br/>Ted Levine is chilling and creepy as Buffalo Bill. Ted Levine is another versatile actor but he puts in a very memorable, though infamous, performance as Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>Director Jonathon Demme was an unusual choice after having directed numerous comedies including Married to the Mob (1988). Here he hits the ball completely out of the park with The Silence of the Lambs. Jonathon Demme has never been finer here, and this is certainly a movie that he will always be remembered for.<br/><br/>Writer Ted Tally has done a brilliant job bringing Thomas Harris' best selling novel to the big screen.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is an electrifying and brilliant thriller from start to finish and is still capable of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins turn in their most memorable performances, and Jonathon Demme has never been finer. It's no surprise The Silence of the Lambs was a critical and box office success in 1991 and 25 years later, it is still a unforgettable cinematic triumph.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10."

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a film that was about 2 hours in length, but it felt much shorter than that. It keeps itself entertaining, especially when the two brilliant main villains are on screen! Anthony Hopkins gives a awesomely creepy performance as the cannibal Hannibal Lector, and Ted Levine plays Buffalo Bill, in a mildly comic, but still quite terrifying performance with a subtle layer of sadness.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster also does a pretty great job as Clarice Starling, and deserved the Best Actress Oscar in my opinion.<br/><br/>The score by Howard Score is absolutely lovely. The moodiness and dreariness to the score really adds to the film's slightly sad, and highly disturbing nature. I think it may actually be his best score ever, and that includes the score to the LOTR trilogy, which is also quite magnificent.<br/><br/>The film is also very intense at times, mainly during the climax of the film.

I'm not even sure why they picked her: I remembered her as somewhat mousy, but boy, does she look like a secretary. Not only that, on repeated viewings, it's obvious her character was written much smarter than she is: out of the blue, she suddenly burps out something very clever, but you can tell by her delivery and the look in her eyes that she just would have been able to come up with that on her own. Very weird.<br/><br/>Another thing that occurred to me this time, how come the nurses in the asylum are so, I don't know, sympathetic to Lecter? At the very beginning, we're told that he gruesomely and cold-heartedly maimed a nurse (presumably female) while she was trying to give him an EKG. Granted, he always 'justifies' his killings (most of them patients of him, often revolting, like his cell mate), but still. I could never treat a man maiming someone who was trying to help him with anything except extreme contempt and caution. The nurses, they seemed OK with him.<br/><br/>Still immensely watchable, but I see a lot more faults now than I remembered."

"DavidSim240183","7","1","3","30 July 2007"," A good film, but falls just that little bit short of greatness
","The Silence of the Lambs is considered by many to be a modern classic. Even the DVD informs you its the thriller all others are measured against. Although I did enjoy TSOTL, I'm not sure if it has the components necessary to make it a true classic. Its not the masterpiece it's often made out to be.<br/><br/>Certainly you can understand its appeal. Its a story that comes with a rich premise ripe for delving into dark, psychological corners. Thomas Harris' novel was a wonderfully compelling page-turner. A tightly wound thriller that sent my pulse racing.<br/><br/>But the film skates over some of the things that made Harris' novel so wonderful. I'm not saying its a terrible film. Far from it. Jonathan Demme's direction is excellent, with lots of brilliant camera tricks. And he gets a superb performance out of Jodie Foster. Clarice Starling is the best thing she's ever done. She won a well deserved Oscar for the part. But still, the film doesn't always satisfy like it should.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the story. FBI trainee Starling is assigned to glean information from incarcerated serial killer, Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) concerning the whereabouts of another serial killer on the loose, Buffalo Bill. A former patient of Lecters, he's killed and skinned several women. Starling and Lecter's interrogation sessions become a slowly spreading invasion within the background of Starling's emotionally fragile psyche. All the while Buffalo Bill has himself a new victim, and Lecter is already planning his escape.<br/><br/>First I will praise the film's merits. Yes it does have excellent performances. The scenes between Starling and Lecter are electrifying. They're the high-point of the whole film. And Demme does superb things with his camera. I like the way he shoots many of Clarice's scenes from her POV, like when she descends several staircases and goes through several doors at the asylum until she finally meets Dr Lecter.<br/><br/>He stands straight. Perfectly still. Almost waiting in anticipation for Clarice. They lock eyes. He reads things about her. From her body language. The look of nervous anguish she tries to bury. Examining first her face. Then her temporary FBI badge. Sniffing her perfume through the holes in the glass partition. The only thing keeping them apart. He runs off a number of things about her personality. Capped by the surprising concern he shows when she's attacked by another cell-mate.<br/><br/>That one scene is quite wonderful. Both Hopkins and Foster shine in this moment, arguably the best one they share. There are times when you're not sure who has the upper hand. Lecter gets under her skin. But you can tell Starling hits a nerve when she questions his choices in life. Just listen to the sharp clang the steel drawer makes when Lecter shoves a psychological profile Clarice brought back in her face. That's more jarring than his infamous Chianti speech.<br/><br/>Although much has been made of Hopkins' admittedly impressive performance, Jodie Foster is the real star. She gives a perfectly balanced blend of tough resolve and emotional fragility. The way expressions play out over her face are easily decipherable and greatly accessible. She doesn't make any grand gestures. The pain of her troubled childhood and the growing horrors of her work are communicated in her beautifully expressive eyes. She's the heart and soul of the picture. Jodie Foster is one of my favourite actresses, and she inhabits the role of Clarice Starling so well, there comes a time when it stops being acting.<br/><br/>You could say the same of Hopkin's quietly sinister performance. Hopkins learned not to blink his eyes for extended periods. Something he utilises to great effect. I love the scene when Lecter is probing Clarice while she's talking about the time she ran away from home. Demme has the camera right in his face. Resolved. Implacable. Unrelenting. Its a frightening scene of equal manipulation and concern on Lecter's part.<br/><br/>The film is less successful in its supporting cast. Scott Glenn is OK as Jack Crawford, Starling's superior. But he's only designed to be there when the plot is moving along. Anthony Heald's Dr Chilton is purely one-dimensional. There's no depth to his character. And I was a bit disappointed with Ted Levine's Buffalo Bill. A transvestite making a coat from women's flesh. The film tries to craft a similar relationship between Levine and Catherine Martin, his abductee, in the same manner as Lecter and Starling. A killer and an innocent. But it doesn't work the same way. The chemistry just isn't there.<br/><br/>One thing I liked about the book was I got the impression Dr Lecter was pulling the strings from the comforts of his jail cell. I didn't always get that same impression with the film. Not to criticise Demme's direction. He keeps things moving at a brisk pace. But still, he throws in a few hackneyed ideas here and there, e.g. anagrams with hidden clues, to keep things moving.<br/><br/>And I'm not sure I believe Lecter's method of escape. It seems a bit ridiculous to me. And it makes fools out of real SWAT teams. The ending seems hard to believe too. I didn't buy for a second an FBI trainee would be sent into such a potentially dangerous situation, even if she thought it wasn't the home of the killer. Although it does build up to a tense, well sustained climax in the blacked out interior of Buffalo Bill's basement. Where we see through his night vision goggles, leering at a frightened and bewildered Clarice. Images of his hand reaching out for her are scary as hell, and reminds me of John Carpenter's techniques in Halloween.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is undeniably an enjoyable effort that occasionally digs into some dark areas. But it doesn't quite do the novel justice. Excellent performances from Hopkins and Foster. Superb direction too. But its lacking that essential ingredient, brilliance, to elevate it to classic status."

Jonathan Demme is at his absolute best here building suspense and tension into a blend of physical and psychological terror rarely matched in film.<br/><br/>But, the reason this film works and kicks so much ass has everything to do with its stars: Jodie Foster (Genius) and Sir Anthony Hopkins (Knight). The chemical reaction that takes place between these two on screen is so palpable and acidic you find yourself hardly able to watch.<br/><br/>Their dynamic is what sets this film apart from any other serial killer/horror/suspense/thriller ever made.

He is both a good writer and a clever writer: Plenty of good writers write novels about subjects that don't engage the general public, but are well written and deserve to be read. They write for a small audience and, if they are lucky, sales keep the author fed, sheltered and clothed until the next one comes out.<br/><br/>However Harris is also a clever writer in that he chooses the material of cheap thrillers (serial killers - zero points for originality!) and writes about them with the care and attention that is normally reserved for our friends in the former paragraph. The subject is taking him to the top of the ladder - not his care with words.<br/><br/>There is something slightly bizarre a-foot here. This is a film based on cheap thrills and tension, which I could live with if the reviewers (of all colours) weren't so precious about it all.<br/><br/>This film takes a lot of time and trouble over minor details and yet major plot lines are clearly S-T-U-P-I-D. Actors sit in on FBI lessons to learn technique and procedure then Agent Starling goes and visits Lector ON HER OWN!<br/><br/>(Yes isn't it amazing how quickly common-sense - no matter the FBI rule book - is thrown away when it gets in the way of an easy tension device!)<br/><br/>There is a lot right with this film and a lot wrong with it too. Thrillers have no other role other than thrill and thrill it does, but I hate the authors coded references that only he and a few PhDs/crime authors can understand. Private jokes are snobbery.<br/><br/>(I am glad that IMDb have a trivia section for this movie it answered a lot of my questions. With Harris every ""stray"" phrase has a story behind it.)<br/><br/>Killer Lector is a bit like Huggy Bear in Starsky and Hutch. He knows everything about everything and it is a shame he is not the policeman because all serious crime would be solved in five minutes! Yes we have to have some device for throwing these people together (however silly), but how does he know all this info from his well guarded cell. Is he on some private ""serial killer"" bulletin board?<br/><br/>(""Hey guys - that woman that was sliced up in to six pieces in Houston -- that was me...."")<br/><br/>A lot of people got a lot of enjoyment from this film and I thought it was quite good too, but it is also slightly sick. The subject matter is worthy of our attention, but I am uneasy about it being served up as ""great art"" and given Oscars.<br/><br/>This about as much ""great art"" as the musical Grease. Take away the horror movie stunts (or film them in a more benign way) and it would have flopped at the box office.<br/><br/>Also to be noted is that this is a ""strong woman"" picture - if Agent Starling was a man most women would have marked it a point or two lower than they have. I hope that isn't read as a sexist observation."

","""Silence of the Lambs"" is a great, solid thriller with superb performances by its two leads, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.  Yet I was not as thrilled (or as terrified) with it when it came out back in 1991.  I felt that its showering of Oscars and praise was slightly unwarranted.  I just don't think it's anywhere near being the greatest thriller of our day as some gushed.  With Hannibal Lector's story still breathing (in the new release ""Red Dragon""), I think that the first attempt at filming a Thomas Harris novel, Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"", was more suspenseful and interesting than ""Silence"". In all, this is a tight, well-crafted thriller.  Yet I just cannot tell you that it was worthy of being named Best Picture by the Academy...<br/><br/>Grade: B"

She awoke to some terrible screaming and in the barn found they were slaughtering lambs. Afterward she had dreams, and Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) wonders aloud if catching the serial killer, Buffalo Bill, will ""Silence the Lambs"" in her dreams.<br/><br/>Clarice is a student assigned to try and get Lecter to help figure out who the killer is, after he kidnaps a politician's daughter. Lecter likes Clarice, ends up giving her clues which allow her to find ""Bill"" and in a thrilling dance of death in the dark, she shoots him. Lecter had escaped as a result of police bungling, and in the last scene we see him talking by phone to Clarice, saying he's ""having an old friend for dinner"", then we see him following the dastardly Dr Chilton (Anthony Heald). I haven't seen the sequel yet.<br/><br/>Heald is now the unpopular assistant principal in the fine TV series ""Boston Public"", playing essentially the same character he did in this movie. Daniel von Bargen, that fine character actor, played one of the cops looking for Lecter right after his escape.<br/><br/>Right now ""Silence of the Lambs"" has an average Imdb rating of 8.5, and is listed as the #19 film of all time. It IS a pretty good thriller, and Foster and Hopkins are at their bests in this film."

I do not understand why they made the Dr. Chilton character such a broad, asinine media-hound; a psychologist of that high a level would be that stupid?  If he were smarter, it would make the characters who out-think him smarter.

"willcundallreview","7","1","4","8 August 2015"," A good thrill ride although feel it is overrated
","When you watch a movie considered an absolute classic, you expect to be thrilled and taken away, for me though, I just wasn't. Now I'm not saying this is bad far from it, but it just isn't for me what everyone cracks it up to be, it's good but I fail to see why it is considered a masterpiece. I would watch it again as it is enjoyable and a genuinely good thriller, but part of me feels it has maybe aged a little too much since it came out, but that doesn't doubt some of the performances.<br/><br/>The true star of the movie is Anthony Hopkins (or for some it is Jodie Foster, pick a side) and he seems to emit a certain eeriness about him, and to say he is in this movie for so little time and yet won an Oscar, well it is testament to his skill. As for Foster prefer her or not to Hopkins she is also a worthy actor here and some of the mind battles between her and Hopkins's Lecter are very fine scenes indeed. For me though the acting is where the slight overrating of this movie arrives and that is because people say about the performances as if they are what makes this incredible, but for me the acting although brilliant, does not make up for the entire piece.<br/><br/>And on the point here of the plot, well the story is sinister, devilishly put together but never too much like a basic horror movie. See the film has a way of being physiologically scary rather than gruesome jumpy scenes kind of scary, sure there are a lot of dark moments but it wouldn't give you nightmares. I found the story to be interesting, the whole thing about Clarice meeting with Hopkins to find Buffalo Bill is an interesting concept, and the whole plot about Buffalo Bill himself is also fairly interesting too. It is Buffalo Bill who makes this movie not like others, a crazed killer but who is calculated albeit mentally scarred, a fascinating look into the killers mind.<br/><br/>Jonathan Demme directs and he is OK, he never really made me think ""Oh wow this director is fantastic"" but nevertheless I did feel his job here was done well. As for the script well I have never read the original source material, but the adapted screenplay in any case is very nicely done, Ted Tally creates something that will live on in cinema history. The cinematography is also nice; the straight to face camera angles work well when people are having conversations and Tak Fujimoto's work all together is very nicely done.<br/><br/>The reason I think I didn't enjoy this maybe as much as others is that it could be dated now. The movie isn't the scariest; I didn't find it much frightening at all and although as I say Buffalo Bill is a fascinating character as well as Lecter, neither really sent shivers. That said the film is I believe meant to be more about the psychological side of these characters, and especially with Lecter, although we see his horrific side, we don't see a lot. There is no doubt Hopkins deserved his awards, same story with Foster and a lot of it's wins too, but for me best picture was not something it deserved, it just for me wasn't enjoyable enough, didn't engage me near as much as others say it did for them.<br/><br/>Overall I feel slightly disappointed after viewing this; I came in with high expectations but left having seen a good movie, but not a masterpiece. I just can't see why people believe this to be so good, maybe you have to watch this with your nose pressed against the screen but I will one day watch this again and reflect on whether I feel my feelings about this have changed."
"lucianomarzo92","8","1","4","21 August 2009"," The Silence of the Lambs
","This movie is very suspenseful and features incredible acting from Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal Lecter"". Jodie Foster was also great and played a very strong female lead as the FBI agent Clarice Starling. This movie has a very intriguing plot, which is what made me rent it. I found it very interesting that an FBI agent would interview a imprisoned serial killer who is a cannibal, to find out more about another serial killer on the loose. Hannibal is almost presented as the good guy in some scenes. Of course, he cannot be the actual ""good guy"", he sure is in contrast to that creepy Buffalo Bill. Clarice Starling is a unit agent of the law, and Hannibal is a being who defied it, but they are paradoxically, on the same side. This movie didn't disappoint me but was still creepy, but then again it didn't exceed the creepiness I expected. The Silence of the Lambs has very intense scenes mostly involving the autopsy of a filthy cut-up person, a kidnapping, and not to mention Hannibal eating a warden's face. It might be a good idea to watch out for these scenes before watching. I wouldn't really recommend that anybody under 16 watch this. The entire premise for the movie is very disturbing itself, with the movie becoming even more unsettling than the general plot. The Silence of the Lambs is still creepy, but I really felt like I was watching a movie made in the 90's. It really shows its age. It is well made for the most part, but I really think that it's too disturbing to truly be one of the greatest movies movies of all time, as IMDb votes would lead one to believe."

","This has got to be one of the most overrated movies out there. Although it looks into the fascinating and gruesome subject of the 'mind of a serial killer', the execution of the film in particular the acting and the realism portrayed by most characters makes this film just another action flick.<br/><br/>This is the first time I saw Jodie foster and the performance was a big let down. It didn't even come close to being real and the last part of the film (where she (an Fbi trainee, a 5 foot something woman) single handedly takes down the serial killer) was sooo unreal! I could not even make myself laugh! (Watch out for the way she shakes her hand in fear its one of the most, distant from reality acting caught on film). In my opinion she was a big miscast. And the accent was the most irritating thing in the whole movie. Crude. Somewhere from the US as Hopkins refers to it.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is a very good actor and plays this part like a poker player. But it was by no means great.<br/><br/>This movie was by no means great. A great topic but an average movie. I give it a healthy 6."

","I'm not downgrading ""Silence of the Lambs"" for failing to live up to its hype, for no movie could deliver on the amount of praise this one has received. I think it is an entertaining film, but it is hardly realistic and breaks down in several clumsy scenes, ones which were excessively convenient moments to advance the plot.<br/><br/>The movie functions as a capable FBI thriller (yet is still not quite as engrossing as something like ""L.A. Confidential""). What is engrossing about this film is kind of cheap: the fact that it is about a couple of very disgusting serial killers. These kinds of characters are absolute tabloid gold-mines. No wonder people are so mesmerized by this movie: it's a decent thriller that revolves around gruesome murders.<br/><br/>I give Hopkins credit for doing a good acting performance, but the character of Hannibal Lecter, PhD, is too over-the-top to be convincing. I get it -- he's a genius and a sociopath. He's a classier version of Maguyver (so classy he even appreciates piano sonatas!) who has no empathy but loves riddles and tooling people around. Entertaining but not entirely convincing. Really brilliant killers don't wear their gifts on their sleeve.<br/><br/>As I said, there were a few moments with supporting characters doing stupid, clumsy, unrealistic things to advance the plot. For one thing, nobody does their job clumsily when guarding super-brilliant cannibal serial killers. Sorry. And methodical serial killers (as deranged as they may be) are not clumsy when it comes to tracking someone in their own lair.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining and paces well. It is certainly engrossing, but the violence does seem over-the-top and unnecessary. Without the obscene gore factor, this movie would not be nearly as famous as it is, so it strikes me as a gimmick. The gore never carried any emotional resonance or impact on the storyline. It was at times almost comical for the way it suddenly shifted the tempo of the movie.<br/><br/>I will say I did like the Appalachian, rust-belt, mining-town motif that was prevalent throughout the movie and tied Jodie Foster's character, Clarice, to the story. The contrast between Clarice, the victims of the killer Buffalo Bill, and the seasoned murderer, Lecter, was pretty decent. And Jodie Foster was pretty good, she's always been a capable actress.<br/><br/>But let's face it: the kind of cinematic thrills the mainstream movie-going public desires cannot deliver realistic portrayals of sociopathic killers. I mean, ""No Country For Old Men"" is a little closer to the mark here, and at the center I'm thinking along the lines of ""Henry"" or the more humane and psychologically driven Fritz Lang classic, ""M"". Unfortunately, most movies about serial killers are all glossed up with shiny production and sensationalized fictitious qualities to the extent that they make these characters look glorious. (Even ""No Country"" did that a little bit) <br/><br/>The whole movie felt kinda like a Tom Clancy thriller, but with a couple of twisted serial killers as the focal point. But it was an archetype for both '90s films and serial killer films. So many movies copied this one in the '90s in pacing, aesthetic and so on. Pretty much every movie about some genius murderer is a take on this one.<br/><br/>It's mainly worth watching for Anthony Hopkins. There are (unfortunately?) some laugh-out-loud moments but he's not on-screen for most of the film. Still, I didn't find the gore in this to be as convincingly disturbing as most new episodes of South Park. This was just grimier and less funny."
"remikolk","7","1","4","6 August 2006"," An overpriced movie
","I saw the film a couple of times now, and I must say that I enjoyed each time. <br/><br/>But give me a break, 5 Oscars? Yes, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are outstanding, but the other 3 Oscars are way overpriced. No way it is in the league of One flew over the cuckoo's nest - both movies won 5 Oscars (film, director, script, leading actor and leading actress). It just doesn't compare.<br/><br/>So I began to search for a reason, and part can be attributed to the poorer quality of films produced that year. But the most part is the conservative attitude of the Academy itself. JFK was the big winner for me with all it 's thought provoking acting, lighting, filming and script. Other films overlooked are cape fear and the fisher king. Especially now that a lot of us are complaining that both directors (Martin Scorsese and Terry Gilliam) haven't received an Oscar yet.<br/><br/>-since my the original writing, Scorsese has won the Oscar for best director, the departed.-<br/><br/>And let's not forget the script written by Ted Tally. After reading the book itself I can't help thinking that he copied the book itself with a piece of tracing paper and cut some minor parts out. There is hardly any change made. But maybe this can be attributed to the writer of the book - Thomas Harris. Surely Talley's effort can't justify an Oscar. Incidentally: Ted Tally hasn't written anything that can support this ""big effort"", any guesses why...<br/><br/>The Camera style that Jonathan Demme uses doesn't seem to work for me. The straight in the camera that he uses to intensify the situation is just not right, it's just forcing the situation. He uses the same thing in Philadelphia, but to my opinion that film is overrated as well, although not as much as this one.<br/><br/>I give it an 7 out of 10. But this can mostly be attributed to the performances of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins."

","(EDIT: I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote this review. Just ignore it. I'll update it someday. This is a fantastic movie. My comments about the police force still stand, though.)<br/><br/>I think I will cover the things I liked about this film first, since it is a very short list:<br/><br/>--Jodie Foster's performance. She is very believable and deserved her Oscar. <br/><br/>--Ted Levine's performance. He is undoubtedly one of the sickest, most twisted villains to ever appear on screen, and, in my opinion, a lot more scary than Hannibal.<br/><br/>--The scene where Foster is being stalked by Buffalo Bill in his house. Now THAT was scary. It is a classic suspense scene.<br/><br/>Now, the things I did NOT like:<br/><br/>--Anthony Hopkins' performance. Too grandiose and over-the-top; not anywhere near realistic. Everyone talks about what a fantastic performance he gives, but I think if you NOTICE what great acting someone is doing, then they're probably overacting. Plus, his character comes across as being actually likable... a guy you'd like to sit and chat with. He is not scary, just mildly interesting. He apparently has superpowers, too, since he manages to pull off the most unrealistic jailbreak of all time. I don't know how he found the time to even THINK of a scheme like that, much less actually do it. He outwits the entire police force, which brings me to my next point...<br/><br/>--The total incompetence of the FBI. I'm not sure whether this was intentional or not, but it was ridiculous and borders on parody. The fact that a rookie like Foster is assigned to the case is unrealistic enough, but then she manages to crack the case All By Herself when she discovers a key piece of information: Buffalo Bill knew his victims. NO WAY!! My God, the girl is a genius! No other investigator with years of experience under their belt could figure this out, but Foster the rookie had a brainstorm and outdid them all. The local police are even worse. They are shown as a bunch of inept morons. During the jailbreak sequence, if it wasn't for all the human mutilation and whatnot, you'd think you were watching an episode of ""Reno 911."" <br/><br/>And finally...<br/><br/>--The movie is sick. Sick, sick, sick. Little sympathy is shown for the victims, and it feels like the movie is not showing these bizarre killings as a portrait of serial killers (otherwise they might have included actual motivations for Bill and Hannibal), but just for the sake of being disgusting. It's shock theater, plain and simple. I said I liked Ted Levine's performance, but his scenes were still unpleasant to watch. I doubt most people exited the theater thinking, ""Well, that was a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a psychopath,"" but more likely, ""WOW! Hannibal chewed a guy's face off! COOL!"" Really, what's the point? All the scenes with Hannibal feel more like a movie script than anything that could happen in real life. A realistic portrayal of a cannibalistic psycho would have been scary, but the majority of this movie, save for a few great scenes, is just corny and gross."

The reward of his efforts were the following ones: 5 Oscars in 1992 including Best Movie and a widely deserved blockbuster.<br/><br/>This is a movie that enjoys a performance of a high quality with, of course Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins who dominate the cast. The former is absolutely convincing in her role of ambitious trainee who gradually realizes that if she wants to nab ""Buffalo Bill"", she has to face and overcome her fears. All this with ""a little help"" from Hopkins who finds in this movie one of his best roles and offers a remarkable and especially unforgettable composition of his character: Hannibal Lecter. Besides, concerning this character, more than fascination, this is nearly liking that we feel for this monster. On another hand, his confrontations with Clarisse are the key-moments of the movie where we can notice a careful work on the light, the scenery and the framing.<br/><br/>In ""Silence of the Lambs"", Demme plays with the spectator's nerves, avoids as much as possible the bloody sequences and creates suspense the following way: throughout the movie, there's a constant tension that starts with the warnings given to Clarisse before her first meet with Lecter. Then, it becomes more marked with Lecter's escape and it reaches a peak with Clarisse's final dual with ""Buffallo Bill"". The whole is well-orchestrated by Demme thanks to a witty making. At last, even if the end reveals an inevitable happy-end, the very last sequence is here to remind us that one of the two monsters in the movie is still alive and he will keep on getting himself talked about (Hannibal, 2001).<br/><br/>A terrific and terrifying thriller.

","Silence of the Lambs is a phenomenal movie. May be it was Anthony Hopkins's best performance, or one of the bests, and the character Hannibal Lecter was unforgettable, phenomenal too. Besides those, there were a few scenes which deserve to be put in cinema anthology! However, this doesn't mean that the movie is a quintessential masterpiece. There is no problem with Jodie Foster, she shines in the movie and she is one of my all time favorite actresses. Her portrayal was so realistic in the movie. The first conversation between Starling and Lecter was epic, unforgettable. I used to watch this scene regularly, after I had bought the movie. And the famous jail scene... Brilliantly horrifying! Jonathan Demme shot this scene honorably, but this does not spread to the movie in general. At times, the movie feels like a TV episode. There are some chilling moments which also works like a real, pure detective movie, but then it turns into an ordinary drama again. There could have been more suspense or mystery. I found the climax of the film pretty weak and low key in a bad way for such a phenomenal movie, I had expected a powerful, absorbing, intriguing final, but there was none. And there is one more flaw in the movie and It is the character Buffalo Bill! He has no background, even no existence! I mean no character study which is weird for such a movie. He is not the focus of the movie, but also he is the key character of the movie. No real investigation, no cat and mouse game, no murder scene... Buffalo Bill seems like he is not an appropriate character for Silence of the Lambs, because it has no point rather than he is Buffalo Bill! Buffalo Bill might have been suitable for Friedkin's Cruising, for instance. Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter was an unlikeable character for me, but at least, it was a well portrayed character."

However, Clarice Starling isn't nearly as interesting as Will Graham. She thinks she's one of the big boys, but hasn't done anything to prove herself and actually shows herself unworthy of that recognition.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins, replacing Brian Cox, hams up the role of Lecter, taking away a bit of a creepy edge.

Scott Glenn is once again great in a small role.<br/><br/>The movie unwraps slowly, but without worthy characters, we don't find ourselves interested in what develops. The movie doesn't really pick up until the climatic confrontation.<br/><br/>A year after this movie's release, ""Basic Instinct"" was badly received for its perceived homophobic content. However, ""Basic Instinct"" only had a killer that happened to be a lesbian, where ""Silence of the Lambs"" creates an explicit link between the killer's killing and his sexual confusion, definitely making it the more homophobic of the two.<br/><br/>It's a good story of a young woman's growth, but it's not compelling or thrilling."

Like how even two really good pieces of music can sound jarring and stupid when played at the same time, the overall effect is of a disjointed movie that desperately required some rethinking of its plot direction. It's just goofy.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster's stoney performance as copper as the overzealous fed typically shows about as much emotion as my toaster. She doesn't feel like a person, just some crude character type that is just boring to watch and impossible to feel anything for. When she does finally show emotion it's like a daytime movie and she manages to help realize what is perhaps the most obnoxious, smug and heavy handed monologue in all cinema. Whoever wrote this seems desperate to convince the world that women in the work place are all emotionally sterile, hard to like nitwits making this movie a huge middle finger to feminism even if its bad guy wasn't a man who wants to be a woman. Or woman trapped in a man's body, I'm not really fussed.<br/><br/>There are so many moments where you really feel the classic this might have become but the movie it should have been is just a subplot. Make Lecter the protagonist, Clarice the antagonist and Bill just one of several killers uses and there's your movie."
"jacobjohntaylor1","3","1","6","5 June 2015"," overrated and not scary at all.
","This movie is awful. What most people don't know about this movie this that it is a sequel. This is based on the second book Thomas Harries wore about Hannibal L.e.c.t.e.r. His first book Red dragon was fist made into a movie in 1986. It is called man Man hunter. It is very scary. And this one is just overrated crap. The third one Hannibal is better. And that one is pretty bad. There is the Man hunter remake that people think is a prequel Red dragon. That is one of the scariest movies ever made. And this just crap. The prequel Hannibal rising is better. And that was not very good. For a movie that was supposed to be scarier Then A nightmare on elm street (1984) and Friday the 13th (1980) I was very disappointed. The best thing about this movie is that it is a precursors to Red dragon. This movie is badly written and has an awful ending. They was good actors in it and they wasted there talent being in this crap. The only reason any one a generation older me like is because of who is in it. Anthony Hopkins can do no wrong in the eye of a lot of people. This movie is not scary at all. It is just stupid. It is a pile of pooh pooh. Do not wast time and money. Don't see this awful movie."
"hnt_dnl","5","1","6","28 July 2011"," Uneasy mix of genuine chills and ""Hollywood""
","SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991), based on the major awards that it won (Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Actress) could be considered the most overrated film of the 90s. While the film has it's plusses, it fails for me in being a purely chilling horror movie, which is what I think it should be. I'm not as enamored of Jonathan Demme's psychological yarn as so many others.<br/><br/>First and foremost, SOTL is a boring movie! The first scene between Oscar-winning stars Jodie Foster (as FBI recruit Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (as imprisoned psychotic Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter) is definitely a keeper. Much as I don't like this movie, I DO really like that intense early scene! But everything after that just drags...and drags...and drags! Foster and Hopkins, while good, do not IMHO give Oscar-worthy performances. Foster's ""Southern"" accent is fairly overwrought and phony and Hopkins kind of hams it up too much as Lecter. They really don't embody their characters so much as they are just ""acting"". Foster is basically a made-to-order female hero for everyone to fawn over and Hopkins is there for entertainment value only.<br/><br/>Now, there ARE scary parts to SOTL, just none involving Hannibal. The real scary parts are of Starling's prey Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine in a genuinely creepy performance) and his latest hostage Catherine (Brooke Smith in an authentic performance). The scenes of Bill's dungeon are very unsettling. But everything revolving around the capture (the investigation, the dead ends, the MacGuffins, etc.) is the standard Hollywood storyline. It was obvious from the get-go that Starling was going to catch Bill, but the way it was done was extremely pedestrian.<br/><br/>SOTL isn't even the best film with ""Hannibal"". That honor goes to the superior Michael Mann-directed film Manhunter from 1986, which is much more involving, intense, and satisfying. It has a better, more believable hero (William Peterson's Will Graham), a better Hannibal (Brian Cox), and an even better antagonist (Tom Noonan's multi-layered Francis Dollarhyde). Manhunter was a police procedural, but also took the time to develop and delve into the psyche of it's characters. SOTL seems to be more interested in putting on a show. Then again, showmanship is what usually wins Oscars!"

"oni013","5","1","7","13 December 2006"," Watch this BEFORE reading the book, or watching Red Dragon
","Having read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, and having seen the movie adaptations of each (in that order), this movie was somewhat disappointing to me. My two major complaints are with the pace and with some of the acting.<br/><br/>To start, the pace of the movie as compared to the book is cut all to hell. Of course things would need to be shortened or refitted from novel to feature length movie, but much of the insight into several characters and their relationships is either rushed or utterly lost. Jack Crawford's personal back story, for instance, is completely left out; this leaves Scott Glen nothing to work with, though we know from past roles that he is at least an able actor Jodie Foster is contemptible as Clarice Starling. In T. Harris's well-written book, she is portrayed as frustrated and sometimes disturbed, but able, rebellious and determined. In this movie she is almost constantly falling apart and is barely able to keep herself together. Further, the reason for involving her so heavily in the case, while addressed in the book, is never properly explained here.<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, and ironically, the characters we are supposed to like least are the most believable, and provoke the most reaction: Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, Anthony Heald as Dr. Chilton and of course Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>With a change of director, and screenwriter Ted Tally's growth over 11 years, Red Dragon is much more reflective of its source material, much more insightful, has a much better lead actor and is simply better all around. One will enjoy this movie as a thriller IF one does not first read the book, or see the much more ably-handled Red Dragon."
"mortenkommen","5","1","7","29 August 2006"," an unworthy sequel to a great movie
","How this flick ended up on the top 30 list OF ALL TIME, is a mystery to me. Anthony Hopkins is in no way scary compared to Brian Cox (Lector in Manhunter 1986), who brilliantly captures the essence of insane, with a great subtle performance that, unlike Hopkins, dosen't try to seem like a deranged cannibalistic lunatic with a funny psycho-killer accent. IMO Hopkins is one big caricature of a serial killer which to me is funny - not scary. The visuals in Silence of the Lambs, is also dull and uninspired compared to those in Manhunter where there is lots of beautiful scenes often in deep marine-blue or other clean cut colors - that's art. Just like the audio. It may be kind of 80s with a lot of syntheziser, but it works perfect. Silence of the Lambs is not art. All it tries to do is tell a story, without trying to stimulate the viewer's senses. The story is all right, but you can't help but thinking it could have been so much better, had Michael Mann directed it."
"druryd","6","1","8","2 October 2003"," One of The Top Ten Overrated Movies Of All Time
","Silence Of The Lambs is an average movie that has been hyped to classic status. The superb performance by Anthony Hopkins is the only saving grace of this film.  Jodie Foster is terrible as usual, she has to be one of the worst actress of our time.  The biggest problem with the film is the absurd premise that a FBI student (She is not an agent) would be left alone to handle an investigation of this magnitude. Sorry but that just isn't going to happen.  This movie is worth one viewing for Hopkins performance and that's it.  It shouldn't even rate in the top 500 movies of all time.  5.4 on a scale of 10."

","It took me months but i finally finished this movie!<br/><br/>Why did i take so long?<br/><br/>The first five times that i opened it i passed out cause they all sound like they're giving lectures when they talk(and most of the film is people talking miserably attempting to sound poetic).
The fifth time i played it i just stopped cause It felt wasteful to watch a movie where everyone is guilible like a 14 year old, and Hannibal is like a 16 year old bully.... who hurts their feeling with his pointy words and makes them do very intelligent and not dumb at all things like... Convincing a guard to release him? Lmaooo whaaat (the funniest scene was when they strapped his body head to toe to a chair and he still managed to snatch a pen 10 feet away from him... like ok what, at that point I was checking if I was watching the parody version)<br/><br/>My imaginary girfriend made me watch it.<br/><br/>and i did a research to find out what was special about it cause i really wanted to like it man, cause i wanted to understand my imaginary girlfriend's taste... like i really hoped she didnt just like it cause it's mainstream... cause that'd mean she's stupid and id have to break up with her..... OR the second scenario is that that im blind to some element of art that 90% of people can perceive, which would be strange cause normally i'm only blind to the 89%.<br/><br/>So i went a head and did the research and ... apparently, what phases people is, hear this, ""the peculiarity of the characters"". you know? with the whole eating people and using almost 16th century theatrical phrases to describe simple things, that no one would use in real life.<br/><br/>So im like ok thats it!
THAT'S what im missing!<br/><br/>Im impressed by their words... Youtube comment sections have more resonance and cut deeper.
Not phased by their immorality......cause have you even see what animes are up to?? they make eating human flesh look like ghandi.<br/><br/>So basically this movie only appeals to snowflakes and feathers who are easily phased by immorality....<br/><br/>Maybe ill read the book, cause my imaginary girlfriend, even though i realized that ill have to break up with her now cause she follows trends, she's still not the least artistic person on the planet.<br/><br/>OH AND!! the serial killers are too scientifically incoherent in their behavior, which makes it hard to take them seriously... anyway the whole movie was a joke.<br/><br/>THANKS FOR LISTENING PEOPLE!"
"jcarlos-96740","8","0","1","14 April 2020"," A remarkable thriller
","This is without the doubt the one of the best thrillers that I've ever seen, the soundtrack and the camera angles especially when they are closing up on a character face really creates tension and the movie keeps you on the edge and intrigued of what's coming next the whole time. The direction is outstanding and really good. The acting is also top-notch especially Anthony Hopkins and Jodie foster, both well deserved Oscars! About the plot itself I consider that the visual experience is better than the plot and I personally figured out what the serial killer was intending to do before it was even revealed, that doesn't make the plot bad but I think the story wasn't as great as the visuals, it was a pretty interesting one but not worthy enough to be portrayed as masterpiece like many are doing. There are a lot of actions and scenes in this movie that set an example and where copied by a lot of recent movies so in a certain why this created a precedent.
It's definitely worth to be seen but I was expecting a deep story with great visuals, it got the second aspect but one the first one didn't pleased as much as I was expecting"

","On the one hand this movie has excellent acting, dialogue, and story. On the other hand it badly tries to be a 90s action thriller, with a bad script, and horrible editing.<br/><br/>For example, there is a lot of detail in the movie but the dialogue sometimes references events that are not clear as if the viewer would pick it up quickly. Another example is in one of the final scenes when the lead detective finds the empty house and realizes Clarice was in danger - but how could he have known. She merely stumbled upon the killer following up on an old lead in a cold-ish case, so I don't understand the reason for all the drama and that quick zoon in shot was horrible.<br/><br/>I think the novel is probably much better than the movie - the latter appears to have been hastily made. I do not understand why it got Oscars for best Movie and certainly does not deserve the best Adapted Screenplay. The acting was superb on both Foster and Hopkins' sides, with great delivery of the dialogue.<br/><br/>I taped this movie on the VCR and watched it a few times decades ago when I was a teen.

"sergiogold","9","0","1","3 June 2019"," The Silence of the Lambs captures the attention like no other and doesn't let go
","It isn't easy humanizing a cannibalistic serial killer into an engaging and charming person, but Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs accomplishes this and more. This is a thrilling edge-of-your-seat classic that is a must-watch for all film fanatics.<br/><br/>The film follows Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), an intelligent and driven young woman studying at the FBI Academy for behavioral sciences. She is given the task by FBI director Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of interviewing convicted cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a cunning and brilliant psychiatrist nicknamed ""Hannibal the cannibal"". The FBI is tasked with apprehending serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who has murdered and skinned five women before dumping their bodies into rivers. The FBI hopes that Dr. Lecter's perceptive mind can assist them in finding Buffalo Bill's true identity.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a great film even for those who are not fond of traditional horror movies. Director Jonathan Demme has a way of captivating the viewer's interest in the story through intelligent writing and an interesting plot. This is not a film with simple jump scares or supernatural creatures but instead other aspects are what make the film feel immensely suspenseful and thrilling.<br/><br/>What makes the film so captivating and gripping throughout is the brilliant cinematography work. The most effective shot that is used is the close-up shot which makes the scene feel chillingly still. Also, during the tensest action scenes, particularly the final climax, the camera work keeps the viewer on edge and guessing.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins performed terrifically and made the iconic Hannibal Lecter we know today. His composed manner added layers of personality and intrigue to the character. From the famous introduction scene in his cell, to his skillful escape scene, Hopkins is completely outstanding and leaves the viewer craving his appearance more. Jodie Foster delivered superbly and made Clarice Starling into a character the audience wanted to root for. Her character was strong, determined, and capable, but still showed she had flaws and vulnerabilities and Foster displayed this in a great manner. The acting across the board was a success making this film, at the very least, a watchable spectacle.<br/><br/>The score by Howard Shore is ominous and enhances the suspense of many key parts. He sets the tone throughout the film and provides a truly unnerving experience for the audience.<br/><br/>The way the film slowly reveals more and more information keeps the audience engaged. The way information is revealed leaves the audience to derive things out for themselves which feels rewarding. The film is also packed with deep symbolism and foreshadowing which makes the film watchable even after viewing it several times.<br/><br/>The film may not have been perfect: there were some parts of the film that unnecessarily slowed the plot of the movie, however, the overall story was quite easy to follow. The rare parts where the acting was somewhat lacking was during the scuffles in the action scenes. This shortfall, though, is largely mitigated by the outstanding camera work that the film provides.<br/><br/>This is a unique film that has created various iconic scenes and is deserving of high praise. One modern-day film with similar characteristics is M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"", however, The Silence of the Lambs still feels like a unique experience in its entirety. From the exceptional actors to the excellent staff behind the camera, this film has all the makings of a terrific thriller."

"liampobrien","10","0","1","1 October 2018"," A smart, and tightly directed psychological thriller
","This film is really about alot of things, things that affect people, how past experiences can affect people in the long term, how destructive in nature we become when we are stuck in horrible situations, this film is a lot more than just a psychological thriller/horror film.
on the surface this film is your typical thriller, with a frightening killer on the loose, Clarice (played by Jodie Foster) Is tasked with hunting down this killer. But,
If you look past the surface level there is a lot more hidden underneath the surface, besides the brilliant building of suspense that never allows our main protagonist or the audience a chance to breathe.
The thing that really made this film for me was Hannibal Lector, (Anthony Hopkins), who steals the show as this character, keep in mind that he doesn't get a lot of screen time, but with the screen time he gets, he uses it to explore the human mind and the destructive nature of humans, through talking to Clarice, these are the best scenes in the film for me, these scenes are filled with tension, and create a lot of insight into what makes a human, human.
On the technical side of things, the cinematography adds to the atmosphere and makes the film that much more claustrophobic and disturbing. The soundtrack adds a lot to the film, which again adds more to the incredible atmosphere this film has. 
Claire, (Jodie Foster), is our protagonist, she shows her struggle as a human, as she tries to leave her past behind, but realises that its not easy to let go of the past. This is created through the lambs. *Spoiler section now*, here we go. 
So during these scenes with Hannibal Lector and Claire, they talk out about the lambs, he says,""Have the Lambs gone silent yet?"", symbolising her past, and how it can never go away, no matter how hard she tries. Its symbolised this way because, Claire hears screaming in the middle of the night, she tries to let them out, but they just stood still, therefore, breaking down the title of the film and what it means. 
The Silence of the lambs challenges its audience with deep subject matter, while also presenting it in a much more unique way to other thrillers, it gives you hints to look deeper into the film to discover more about this film, with its deft direction, stunning camerawork, brilliant score and absorbing performances, The Silence of the Lambs is a great example of how to make a suspenseful, and creative psychological thriller.<br/><br/>10/10"

"tk-93740","8","0","1","18 September 2018"," Stellar casting/acting and great cinematography
","I thought Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster did amazing work with their roles in this film. One scene in particular I'd like to note is the last time Clarice talks to Hannibal in person, the framing of Clarice's face between the bars to make her feel isolated, and the intense zoom on Hannibal's face to make us uncomfortable was just done very well in my opinion. I also liked how Clarice sat in a chair when she talked to Hannibal to set that power dynamic, Hannibal towered over her when he spoke. Another aspect of Hopkins' performance I want to talk about is the stillness of his head when he speaks. I don't know if this is unique, or even worth talking about, but I loved how when he spoke, only his mouth moved. His eyes were unblinking and his head was still as stone. <br/><br/>I also thought Hopkins' appearance was absolutely perfect for the role he was put into. Great casting. <br/><br/>I didn't like the lack of depth put into Buffalo Bill's character, however. I feel like there was a very one sided approach to the way they showed us this story. We only really saw Clarice's perspective, we only saw Bill in like, two scenes really. The one where he kidnaps the senators daughter and the very few where he's talking to her (I can't recall her name). He was also portrayed as just being completely insane, but when the detectives were talking about him they seemed to believe he was intelligent and good at what he does, but he was just mentally deranged whenever he spoke to the senators daughter, so I feel like Bill's character is the weak point of the film that made me drop the rating a little bit. <br/><br/>Overall, though, I really enjoyed the movie. Great acting performances, I felt genuinely uncomfortable at times, which is great for a horror movie, and it worked very well as a thriller/horror movie."

"one-nine-eighty","9","0","1","1 August 2018"," Chilling masterpiece
","One of my favourite films of all time - which makes me a little bit strange in my family's eyes! The film tells the story of you young FBI Cadet/Trainee Clarice Starling's (Jody Foster) first big case. She's thrown into the wolves den and asked to interview an infamous cannibalistic serial killer, Dr Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Little does she know that she was chosen for ulterior motives, nether the less, she manages to extract information by forming a close bond with Dr Lecter - something nobody previously has been able to do. The information she is trying to get should lead to the capture of another serial killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who has previously cross paths with Dr Lecter. Currently terrorising the eastern states of the US, he's killed five victims and kidnapping the senator's daughter. Lots of psychological warfare is and will be used in order to get the required information and track down the killer before it's too late for the senators daughter.<br/><br/>Based on a Thomas Harris book of the same name this is actually one of those rare things, a film which doesn't ruin the feeling left by the book. Directed by Jonathan Demme the film is dark and tense, and acts as a benchmark for thrillers and horrors - proving you don't have to go overboard on gore or graphic visuals to make something haunting and memorable.<br/><br/>The casting is brilliant and believable but its Hopkins and Foster who really drive this film from start to finish. Hopkins in particular delivers a performance which is classy but scary at the same time and will forever live in cult memory. From the minute you first glimpse Lecter in his cell, watching the wide eyed Starling approach you sense that something isn't right with him - massive credit to Hopkins for this delivery, it's haunting and disturbed, a kin to a caged predator watching curiously to see what has just entered his cage and what he can do with it for fun. Ask somebody to quote a line from the film and 9 times out of 10 it's be a quote about fava beans and Chianti. The visuals are dark and dirty, Demme chose washed out, almost sepia, colours throughout the film and it really adds a lot of texture to the experience. It almost feels like you've got dirty by watching the dirtiness of what's happening in front of you. <br/><br/>I loved this film and would happily watch it any time I happen to catch it repeated. This is rare example of film which tests my ability to rate it - I refuse to give out 10's but that self-imposed rule could have been broken for this masterpiece so easily. 9 out of 10."

As I said, this is the first psycho movie to me so my criteria of the same kind of movies is based on this movie; super clever criminal, a detective of the sense of justice and of course creepy crime scenes but not too grotesque.
So far I know, this is the most balanced psycho movie; there are mysteries, actions, creeps and meaningful ending.

"doriandrost","9","0","1","12 November 2017"," A Masterpiece - but not in all facets
","Without doubt it is the first half hour, that displays the full thrilling beauty and astonishing furtiveness that makes the story of Hannibal Lecter one of the greatest serial killer stories of all time. Just from the complete beginning the audience is held in a mode of everlasting tension; in fact the first scene is one of the best in the whole movie. With its depressing atmosphere and tricky used camera movements, the thrill rises in just seconds to an extraordinary level and will not lower until the end of the movie. Of course the very best scene is the first meeting with Haniball Lecter himself. Here Jonathan Demme creates on of the greatest, most well-known and most impressive moments of movie theater - accomplished through Anthony Hoppkins astonishing play of the charming serial killer, as it is unique in modern role playing. Unfortunately after this scene the movie loses a part of its quality for quite a while. Putting the most remarkable scene quite in the beginning leads to a permanent comparison of it with the rest of the movie. The middle part for sure has its heights, but tends to lose itself in disinterest. However, due to the impressive character of Hannibal Lecter, the tension never falls and the movie leads to an remarkable height in the second half. It is Lecters breakout, that makes the climax of the movie with its impressive aesthetics and cruelty. Even the audience feels betrayed by the charming and cultivated psychiatrist. The excellent interpretation of Hannibal Lecter even compensates for some cinematic foolishness: While trying to trick the audience, Demme shoots himself at some point. Both the fact that the injured Guard is Lecter himself and that the police breaks into the wrong house are quite obvious - to obvious to fool the audience -, additionally the second scene mentioned is a cliché as big as the ending scene. In the end the ""Silence of the Lambs"" is on of the most remarkable and exciting pieces of movie theater at all. Only the fact that it often stands in it's own light, and that many parts of the movie can not measure up to Lecter himself (think of the horribly uninteresting Buffalo Bill for example) causes it to stand one step below untouchable masterpieces like ""The Godfather"" or ""Psycho""."

"mpkoks","9","0","1","28 October 2017"," Classic and worth it
","The Silence of the Lambs. The movie which Anthony Hopkins took for a children movie when first hearing it's name. It's a bit difficult to talk about the film considering how highly it's awarded and loved especially if you have to say something bad which thankfully is not the case with me except few small episodes. This is the first actual movie I have seen based on Thomas Harris novels featuring Hannibal Lecter and I know many remember it as a horrifying childhood classic but for me this was a first time seeing it.<br/><br/>So the work is based on the novel of the same name – The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. The plot figures around young FBI trainee Clarice Starling struggling to catch serial killer called ""Buffalo Bill"" by media – a sickly individual who skins his victims. However for this she needs to seek help from another serial killer institutionalized in a mental hospital – psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter and captivate his sympathy so he would be willing to help. Of course this includes a lot of mind games, riddles and uneasy psychoanalysis from Dr. Lecter's part including revelation of Clarice's most terrifying childhood memories about screaming lambs at the ranch waiting in line for the slaughter.<br/><br/>The movie has a very grim and unsettling mood which I feel is quite common in 90s cinema. I believe this is mainly because of masterfully crafted Howard Shore's soundtrack for the picture. I also enjoyed the post-punk tracks. Movie features some passionate violence scenes to Bach's Goldberg Variations - the kind of music which always fits movies like this.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved Jodie Foster portraying Clarice – her performance was very passionate, deep and emotionally enthralling. Anthony Hopkins' genius as Hannibal goes without saying – so intimidating, agile and elegant. No wonder they both won Oscars as ""best actor/actress in a leading role"" for their work in this movie. Though I was disappointed with Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford recalling in my mind Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus!) portraying the same character in Hannibal TV series. I can't say Scott acted bad but it surely did lack something. Continuing on not-so-good-things, if you will, I felt like Hannibal's character was a bit too overdone in some scenes and felt artificial (I don't think characters like this would always feel artificial) but I think it's more of a screenplay issue than Hopkins' fault.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs leaves mysterious and morbid aftertaste. There are lots of psychological concepts and ideas to occupy your mind in sleepless nights. Not forgetting deep symbolism like moth, lambs, forest etc. Hearing lambs screaming early in a morning is a very imaginative and horrifying image which is searching for a place in your mind to root in. The movie makes me think about how lives of other people can be so dependent upon one person and how big role human personality and personal sympathies can play in such matter. The movie is scored 8.6 in IMDb which I find disappointing and I would say it's stable 9 and perhaps a bit more. Somehow the film reminds me of David Lynch's Blue Velvet – it's quite different but I feel like they share some notion and feeling in common."
"cowfarm","8","0","1","25 May 2017"," Like it enough but not compelling sorry
","Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by- play between the two is a game in itself.<br/><br/>Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined- yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.<br/><br/>""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things."

","A classic and for good reasons. I'm a horror genre veteran and don't ""spooky easily"", much like our lead, Clarice Starling. However, I feel that both she and I felt somehow disturbed and almost violated by Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. Most certainly any casual moviegoer would feel the same. Though some moments are nearly laughable, such as the face scene near the climax of the film, his portrayal is consistently meticulous and blood curdling. <br/><br/>The movie is fast paced and utterly engrossing, but knows when to slow down to give the audience a bit of a mental break. However, it never drags and a two hour flick seemed to go by in the same length of time it would take to watch a 30 minute sitcom.<br/><br/>This movie has aged well and is a must-see for any crime drama fans out there, both old and young (but not too young)."

","This movie has aged quite well. More than 25 years ago it was released to acclaim. It was well directed and produced. An intelligent movie by all accounts. I would recommend watching the whole series of movies as I have just done...apart from the first movie Manhunter. I was informed that it was not worth watching as it was a poor movie in comparison. And besides it was remade as Red Dragon which is according to me the third movie in this series. The Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising. That is the best order to watch them I think. The order in Wichita they were made.<br/><br/>The two leads in this movie were outstanding, and really shined together with such great chemistry. I won't spoil any of the story for those that haven't stumbled upon this gem yet. I will just say that is an FBI vs Serial Killer gem. Well written, intelligently directed.

"b-68161","8","0","2","2 January 2017"," A great film that still holds up, encapsulates the time period
","I just watched this film an hour ago and I'm surprised that this film has not aged at all. <br/><br/>I watched a 1080p Bluray version of this film and although it was a little grainy (it is film stock, after all), everything looks sharp, clear, in focus and detailed, which is not something that could be said of many films of the era and even some films today. <br/><br/>The story is very interesting and even though I had seen the film before (and forgotten the plot) the unraveling of the mystery was quite intriguing.<br/><br/>One thing I found very interesting is how this film captures the time period on film, not just in clothing, language or technology, but in thinking. For example, when Starling and Lecter discuss a serial killer, Lecter says ""What does he do, this man you seek?"" Starling answers ""He kills women"" to which Lecter retorts ""No! That is incidental."" <br/><br/>It is incidental, but in this day and age, it wouldn't be. It would be seen as misogyny and that would be the profile they build on him. The fact or the conclusion that the killer is completely deranged and is sewing a vest out of the skin of his victims would never be reached. Hell, in this day and age this film wouldn't be made at all, since Lecter's glimpse-into-the-mind-of-a-psycho would be branded as ""mansplaining."" <br/><br/>This film, made in 1991, is the highest rated police/detective drama of all time, currently rated 23rd best film on IMDb's top 250. The fact that it hasn't been bested speaks a lot about how good it is (not just for its time) and how far we've fallen. Instead of getting more genre-defying films like this, we're getting more by- the-numbers police dramas and by-the-numbers slasher/cannibal films.<br/><br/>Before blaming Hollywood for the decline in the quality of its films, we gotta take a long, hard look in the mirror first and remember - we are what we eat."

","Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence Of the Lambs"" is exceptionally good film, perhaps this fine director's best. Demme has remained remarkably true to Harris' novel, although the ending has been altered to extent that it suggests the possibility of a sequel. The movie, scary and graphic to cause timid souls (such as this writer) to close their eyes at certain points, has a vise-like grip on the audience. The Silence Of The Lambs has an edge to it that's quite exceptional, but its central core is more memorable not for what it says but for how it says it. And here Demme's almost spiteful humour is at least as important as Harris' balefully brilliant seriousness."
"parry_na","9","0","1","11 August 2016"," Spoilers follow ...
","It is difficult to convey what a massive film this was on its release. It transformed second-billed Anthony Hopkins from a highly respected and well-known actor into an international superstar, caused a degree of controversy and cemented Jodie Foster's reputation as a major talent. Both won awards for this, and the film won several others.<br/><br/>It isn't difficult to see why. Starling's (Foster) initial meeting with Lector (Hopkins) has a tremendous build up – tales of Lector's legendary brutality, warnings and a corridor full of inmates leering (and worse) at Starling as she makes her way to his cell. The following scene alternately fills the screen with first Hopkins' face and then Foster', and – considering they are really explaining the plot to the audience - is electrifying.<br/><br/>Starling's isolation in her male-dominated job is nicely conveyed visually (without over-labouring the point) often simply by featuring her in scenes with men a lot taller than her. Her willful lack of vulnerability ensures we are instantly on her side. When we meet Lector, such is his beguiling magnificence, we find ourselves on his side too. A dilemma for the audience, but a fascinating one.<br/><br/>Among this terrific cast, it would be an error to overlook the contribution of Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill. His perversion is told to us at first, and revealed slowly thereafter, culminating in a scene in which he hides his penis between his legs and displays himself as a vision of what he believes to be divine beauty. Much of the original novel's detail regarding Bill has not been included in the film (how much more shocking – perhaps too shocking – it would have been to see him wearing one of his skinned female victim's breasts, as in Thomas Harris's story). And yet he still emerges as a deranged and frightening figure.<br/><br/>The double twist towards the end of SPOILER (a) Lector's ingenious escape, and (b) the realisation that Starling's back-up team have gone to the wrong house leaving her to face Bill alone, are perfectly handled. And yet for such a controversial film, there is little gore actually in it – it is the implied violence and Lector's relish in it that shreds the nerves. 'Silence of the Lambs' is thoroughly deserving of its acclaim."

","""The Silence of the Lambs"" took me by complete surprise, and that's meant in the best way possible. When the movie began, I wasn't expecting such a varied bag of tricks, but there was always some new surprise just around the corner. A genuine nail-biter, no question. And few movies can jack up the levels of dread and creepiness like this one; stalking camera movements, interrogations in uncomfortable close-ups, and that's not even touching the crazy messed-up stuff going on with Buffalo Bill (I almost can't believe that guy was on ""Monk""). And Lecter's escape was one of the most deeply unnerving things I've ever seen. I really liked Jodie Foster's character; Clarice Starling is in a league with Marge Gunderson (""Fargo"") - a rookie rather than a veteran, but no less self-reliant in a man's world. Doe eyes masking steely resolve. It's a great performance.<br/><br/>This is shocking stuff, and a movie that burrows itself deep within your brain.

","n this multiple Oscar-winning thriller, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy whose shrewd analysis of serial killers lands her a special assignment: the FBI is investigating a vicious murderer nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kills young women and then removes the skin from their bodies. Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into this case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out. Lecter does indeed know something of Buffalo Bill, but his information comes with a price: in exchange for telling what he knows, he wants to be housed in a more comfortable facility. More important, he wants to speak with Clarice about her past. He skillfully digs into her psyche, forcing her to reveal her innermost traumas and putting her in a position of vulnerability when she can least afford to be weak. The film mingles the horrors of criminal acts with the psychological horrors of Lecter's slow-motion interrogation of Clarice and of her memories that emerge from it."
"FairlyAnonymous","7","0","1","29 March 2015"," Two films in one!
","The Silence of the Lambs is two good movies... unfortunately it is packaged as one film. <br/><br/>I won't dive too much into the plot as I'm sure most of you have seen the film by now. But just in case: The film follows an FBI student who is following a case of a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill who skins his victims. The FBI student must use a locked up serial killer known as Hannibal Lector to help her figure out who the Buffalo Bill murderer is.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are all very good. Hannibal Lector is very intimidating, and Clarice is also well portrayed by Jodie Foster as a woman who is trying to prove herself, but might be slightly out of her league at times. These two characters are both very interesting and their interaction is very well-done... however, the film forgets that this isn't the movie's plot.<br/><br/>The movie is about finding Buffalo Bill. It is not about Hannibal Lector. This is such an interesting mistake that the movie makes because around 50% of the movie's run time is dedicated to learning about Hannibal and making him an interesting character yet... he only effects about 2% of the movie's plot. The movie has a whole escape sequence dedicated to him, only for him never to be seen again in the movie. The only thing that Hannibal does to effect the plot is this: He gives Clarice two hints. That is it. The movie forgets that just because you have an interesting character it doesn't mean that they are a relevant character. Hannibal Lector is IRRELEVANT to the movie's plot. If his arc would connect with Clarice's arc a bit more, then this would be excusable, but when such a large section of the movie is dedicated to him for no real purpose, it gets kind of... stupid.<br/><br/>I can see why people adore this movie, and it is because Hannibal is an interesting character. However, the movie DEDICATES itself to making him interesting but doesn't dedicate itself to WHY he is even in the plot... and the answer is: there is no reason. There is no real reason for Hannibal to be in the plot.<br/><br/>Regardless of the relevance of Hannibal, the movie's ACTUAL story isn't half bad. It is about an FBI student getting over her weaknesses and trying to prove herself. In the end, she proves herself and becomes a stronger woman. We see her confront fear in the face when at the beginning of the movie she would break down at fear. I would say that the character is better acted than she is developed. Her back-story and motivation is quite literally summed up in one scene of exposition. Hannibal basically says: What motivates you? Clarice: Screaming sheep. <br/><br/>This brings us to the last minor gripe of the film: Hannibal is a gruesome murderer and even kills multiple people during his escape, yet Clarice talks to him at the end as if nothing really happened. She doesn't even seemed concerned that he makes a pun about going to eat someone in a little bit. Just because he is an interesting character doesn't mean that he is excused for being evil. Clarice, who seems to have a strong sense of justice and knowledge, is out of character when she accepts this. Her character wouldn't accept that.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie's main story and ending sequence is pretty good. You probably know where it is going, but it is still well done. All of my gripes combined, it becomes quite obvious that this is two entirely different films: One half is dedicated to Hannibal, the other half is dedicated to the actual story. The two halves do not fully connect which then makes the film: broken. This is a broken film that doesn't know what it is aiming for. Regardless of it being broken, it is still well shot, well acted, well directed, and much better than the average. I have to give credit where it is due that this film is much better than the average film, but it could've been a great film if it knew what it was aiming for."

","This is a movie that really doesn't live up to today's hype of how classic and wonderful it should be. The cinematography is messy, the plot points are stitched together the same way somebody would sew a rip in a shirt if they forgot their glasses that day. The climax of the movie was predictable, full of jump scares, it didn't make me think it didn't intrigue me. The introduction of Dr. Lecter was very well done but from then on, what happened? Not ""what happened"" like i'm leading you somewhere with this so i mean it rhetorically. Now ""what happened"" in the way that would give the term literally meaning i.e. 'what happened next?' so i mean it in an investigative sense. ""What happened"" as in the bad joke people like to tell when they see baby pictures ""you were such a cute kid- what happened?"". I mean it in the way that your mom meant it when, as a kid, she told your to clean your room and she'll check in 20 minutes and she walks in to what she thinks will be your room being clean or you cleaning but what turns out to be you sitting on the floor distracted by a toy. Hannibal's character started out strong (inconsistent, a little. why would they let you have a pencil in jail? they would not) and when you needed the very core and basis of his character's backstory to come forward and grab you he was on the floor playing with toy trucks. That is not to say Anthony Hopkins performance was the same as his character's writing- not at all. Hopkins is a rare breed when it comes to acting. Everything he does is spectacular- even if he has a disappointing character he will deliver a great performance. I can't say the same about his female counterpart. After this movie, it's been so hard for me to like Jodie Foster. The whole concept of Hannibal falls so flat with this movie but you gotta give credit to the starter of the trends"

","In a college level FILM 240 course Fall 2014, we studied the film The Silence of the Lambs. What I suggest a viewer watch for during the film is American Flags. The purpose or reasoning behind the director's inclusion of it may be showing the failing of the American dream that America is not what people from different countries, who want to prosper here, think it is. That America is actually hiding more horrible things than you think. For example, the American flag is found over the top of a car that contains the missing head of a man who is a trans-gender male.

If you haven't seen this film yet, you owe it to yourself to see Hopkins at his most creative best and for some of his classic lines and scenes - especially his now-famous improvisation regarding his culinary desires. (You'll know what I mean when you see it.)<br/><br/>Jodi Foster is solid here, though her range as an actress is limited. Her face is largely emotionless unless it's showing anger - that's the one emotion she can amply express, for my money. I know I'm probably in the minority here, but I'm not a big fan of hers. She's like a female Tom Cruise. Great for action films, not so great for films requiring a lot of emotional depth. But she's good here.<br/><br/>The sequels? AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!!!

","Silence of the Lambs is highly acclaimed as one of the best films ever made into the thriller genre, and in fact deserves this title. There are plenty of films like these nowadays, so the formula may be a bit cliché in fact, but the film itself still unique in his own way. <br/><br/>Hannibal Lecter is a very intelligent man and at same time a dangerous psychopath, so normally the actor that would eventually take the role should put effort in bringing exactly what Hopkins's acting did. In Lecter skin, he looks like a creepy but classy individual, and one could argue that this kind of thing is very hard to accomplish. I found him to be almost an untouchable and invincible character, and if you watch the film you'll understand. I am not entirely convinced by 'that' scene(those who watched the film know what i am talking about), despite being very impressive. <br/><br/>I also liked Jodie Foster in the film. Her performance in this film is good, not one of the 'Greatest Ever' but very convincing. If the intention was to show a character that is slightly scared all the time so she did very well, because it was exactly my impression about her.<br/><br/>There are some harsh dialogs and situations in this film that may engross and even left the viewer uncomfortable, but still surprisingly tame for a film that explores the subjects it did.<br/><br/>It don't have that much accomplished in the artistic aspects, but the story-telling is very good.

"JamesHitchcock","7","0","2","31 January 2013"," A Big Fish in a Small if Overcrowded Pond
","""The Silence of the Lambs"" was the Big Film of 1991. It cleaned up at the Academy Awards, becoming only the third film in history to win the ""Big Five"" Oscars of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Writing, a feat which eluded many other Big Films. (The other two films to achieve the feat were ""It Happened One Night"" in 1934 and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in 1975). And yet, even though I can appreciate its many good points, it has never really been a favourite of mine. <br/><br/>The reason it has never been a favourite of mine is probably that I don't like serial killer films very much. More recent essays in the genre such as ""The Bone Collector"", ""Se7en"" and ""Copycat"" have struck me as very overrated and as having little to do with real-life crime. ""Zodiac"", which provided a fictitious solution to a real crime, was both dull and distasteful in the way that it branded a (safely dead) real individual as the killer. Each of these films revolved around some sort of gimmick; in the case of ""The Bone Collector"", for example, the gimmick was a brilliant but disabled detective, and in ""Se7en"" it was a killer who based his pattern of killing around the Seven Deadly Sins. <br/><br/>The gimmick in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the concept of one serial killer helping the FBI to capture another. It was not the first film to feature the character of Hannibal Lecter (that was ""Manhunter"" from five years earlier), but it was the one that made him famous. Lecter is brilliant psychiatrist who also happens to be a cannibalistic serial killer. Because of Lecter's insights into the criminal mind, the FBI seek his help in their pursuit of a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"", who kidnaps and murders women, then skins their corpses.<br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" shares one feature in common with ""The Bone Collector"" and ""Copycat"". All three films feature a detective who is for some reason unable to investigate the crime in person, so the actual leg-work is done by a keen but inexperienced female associate. In ""The Bone Collector"" the detective is physically disabled; in ""Copycat"" she is confined to her apartment by severe agoraphobia. In this film it is Lecter rather than Clarice's superior Jack Crawford who is effectively the lead detective, but as he is incarcerated in a hospital for the criminally insane the actual investigative work has to be performed by Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee. <br/><br/>The two Oscars I would not dispute are those which went to Jodie Foster as Clarice and Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. Scott Glenn is rather uncharismatic as Crawford, but both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. There are two sides to Hopkins's personality as an actor. On the one hand he can be excellent playing quiet, reserved or gentlemanly characters, like Dr Treves in ""The Elephant Man"", Frank Doel in ""84 Charing Cross Road"", C S Lewis in ""Shadowlands"" or Stevens in ""The Remains of the Day"". On the other, he can be equally effective as villainous or monstrous characters, like Lambert Leroux in ""Pravda"" or Crawford in ""Fracture"", and Lecter is undoubtedly his most famous creation in this vein. Indeed, Lecter has become one of the most famous villains in the modern cinema, a man who is undoubtedly cultured and intellectually brilliant, possessed of both a rather grave old-world courtesy and a savage low cunning, and morally quite insane, quite incapable of understanding why killing and eating people is considered morally wrong, although he is fully aware that it is illegal. He describes with lip-smacking relish how he ate one individual's liver ""with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"". <br/><br/>Foster's performance here is perhaps less obviously dramatic than those she gave in two other films from around this period, ""The Accused"" and ""Nell"", but Clarice Starling is a rather different character to Nell or Sarah in ""The Accused""- quiet, determined and professional, anxious to hide her emotions. She combines well with the more obviously flamboyant Hopkins as Lecter and Clarice start to play complicated mind-games with one another, each trying to get inside the other's head. (The film's rather obscure title derives from a traumatic episode in Clarice's childhood, which Lecter succeeds in worming out of her). There is also a good contribution from Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill.<br/><br/>1991 was not perhaps the greatest year in cinematic history; I doubt very much if ""The Silence of the Lambs"" would have scooped the ""Big Five"" had it appeared in the same year as, say, ""Dances with Wolves"" (the Big Film of 1990) or ""Unforgiven"" (ditto of 1992). My own choice for Best Picture in 1991 would have been Zhang Yimou's masterly ""Raise the Red Lantern"", but the Academy is notorious for its dislike of foreign-language films; all films to have won ""Best Picture"" have been American or British, apart from the French ""The Artist""- which contained no spoken dialogue. My favourite American film of the year would probably have been ""Cape Fear"", but in the early nineties the Academy was equally notorious for its dislike of Martin Scorsese. <br/><br/>""The Silence of the Lambs"" is well-directed; Jonathan Demme skilfully handles his material to produce a tense, exciting thriller. Yet despite this, and despite some fine acting, the film never really rises above the limitations of its genre, remaining a combination of Grand Guignol and gruesome crossword puzzle. (Sometimes almost literally so; Lecter shares the crossword compiler's weakness for puns, anagrams and word- games). It may be the best film ever made about a psychopathic criminal, but that only makes it a big fish in a small if overcrowded pond. 7/10"

Serial killer, Jamie Gumb aka ""Buffalo Bill"" (Levine) kidnaps a senator's daughter and keeps her prisoner in his basement. Clarice and Jack now work together with Hannibal's help to find the killer and his victim. Hannibal also confides in Clarice to tell him her personal life and worst fears. After Hannibal escapes, Clarice must continue to solve the case. I remember watching this for the first time and as soon as they showed Hannibal, I got chills down my spine. The cast is great in this as well as Howard Shore's score. I recommend this terrific film."

","Five times Oscar winner The Silence of the Lambs is a class act in many respects, but there are several factors—issues with the script that many fans seem to have happily chosen to ignore—which prevent me from finding the film such a wholly satisfying experience.<br/><br/>With a little suspension of disbelief, I can accept that FBI boss Crawford (Scott Glenn) might believe that Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) could help in profiling serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), but what are the chances of him knowing the killer's actual identity? Pretty damn slim if you ask me—almost as unlikely as Crawford assigning a rookie agent like Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interrogate a manipulative psychopath in the first place!<br/><br/>Swallow all that, and you'll probably have no problem with Lecter's escape, but I know I'm not alone in finding this pivotal scene far-fetched in the extreme. Even if I let the whole 'pen thing' slide (Hannibal's a master of sleight of hand and a whizz at picking locks–fair enough), I still struggle to believe that it is possible to fool an entire team of highly trained cops and medics by slipping a dead man's face over your own. Just ain't going to happen.<br/><br/>And then there's the ending, which after all of the slow-burn psychological games between Lecter and Starling, suddenly goes into over-drive, glossing over details in a hurry to get to the typically tense Hollywood-style finale: all of a sudden, the FBI have Buffalo Bill's true identity, Clarice Starling has tracked the nut-job to his lair, and it's all on for an exciting climax inside the pitch black, labyrinthine basement where the psycho skins his victims.<br/><br/>Thankfully, even with these frustratingly ill-considered moments taking the film down a peg or two in my opinion, Silence of the Lambs is still well worth a watch thanks to director Jonathan Demme's slick handling of the material, and career defining turns from several of his standout cast. Hopkins iconic performance as Lecter is mesmerising, the actor deeply menacing even behind a sheet of unbreakable glass or completely immobile, securely fastened to a trolley in his iconic face-mask; Foster is also memorable as Clarice, who unwisely allows Hannibal inside her mind to exploit her emotional fragility. But it is Ted Levine who steals the show: as sexually confused, mumbling maniac Buffalo Bill, whose goal is to make himself a suit from women's skin, Levine is absolutely superb, providing the film with many of its most memorable moments and delivering several of my favourite quotable lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>All together now: 'It rubs the lotion on its skin...'"

I don't watch movies again and again. But this movie needs repeated viewings. <br/><br/>It's very hard to shake out this movie once you have seen it. Each and every element is a visual feast for our senses. With many close up shots, music that doesn't belong to the film because it's poetic, powerful performances, surprise shots and beautiful cinematography, this film in itself is a perfect masterpiece. Although it's a mind turning movie, it forces you to think... The dialogs are classic. You will eventually end up reciting them and memorizing the entire movie.<br/><br/>(Spoiler) This movie did face a lot of controversy because the killer in this film is a transsexual. Various guy communities and all were hurt by this as this idea has been frequently been adopted by Hollywood. Please don't think wrong about this when you watch the movie. Frankly, I never even thought of this. I always thought the killer to be crazy because Lecter himself described him to be: ""he thinks he is a transsexual. look for severe childhood disturbances"".

","I think that the writer of the movie wants to say how sick it is when weak people have the power and low to control the superior people and to imprison them. So he exaggerated and drew enlargement picture for his major character. Dr. Lecter – the revolutionary man on this society has such system- hates rude people, he said to Claris (Now you're being rude, and I hate rude people)that means that he hates ordinary weak people who are being rude when somebody show them how weak and shallow are they. This movie is not just a fiction it is a scream in the face of stupidity that envelops our life. But I think that the movie is nothing without outstanding acting of Anthony Hopkins."
"moviesleuth2","8","0","1","2 April 2010"," One of the most infamous thrillers ever to take home an Oscar
","There are many films out there with a reputation of being able to scare the living hell out of a viewer, but there is perhaps none as notorious as ""The Silence of the Lambs."" This is a demented and frightening motion picture, and that's the bottom line.<br/><br/>FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to do a psychological profile of a notorious serial killer, the brilliant and insane former psychologist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Her boss, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) hopes that Lecter will be attracted to Starling's innocence, and help them catch a new serial killer, dubbed ""Buffalo Bill."" But Lecter won't do this for free, and the question becomes whether Starling is able to hold herself together against the evil doctor.<br/><br/>This film works as well as it does because it is crafted so well. Had the direction and the acting been pedestrian, this would be just another movie. However, Director Jonathan Demme is interested in exploring his characters and inviting us into the minds of these characters. People call this a horror movie, and that's not true. This is a psychological thriller in its purest form, and the violence and fear that the film generates is due to this exploration. To do this, Demme uses a lot of close-ups so that we can study their facial features, which allows us to understand their emotions on a physical level. This is applying to our basic instincts, and it works; it allows us a deeper understanding of the characters.<br/><br/>However, Demme's skill only goes so far; it's up to the actor's to take up the rest of the slack. And the performances by its two stars make a rather unique story into a legendary excursion into fear.<br/><br/>Everyone knows his name. Hannibal Lecter, or more by his nickname, Hannibal the Cannibal. Lecter is the personification of evil, and there is no character more frightening than the chilling psychopath played by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins uses his eyes (he seldom blinks) and his voice to chill us to the very bone. When he walks, it's slow and methodical. Being inside a caged cell does not stop him from looking at the person outside (which from the camera position, is usually us) feel like we are being stalked by a predator. Surprisingly, in this film, Lector is only on screen for 16 minutes, yet the impact of his performance is permanent. Few performances have been more justly rewarded than Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>His counterpart, Clarice Starling, is portrayed by Jodie Foster, who it seems doesn't know how to give a bad performance. Foster is brilliant as the spunky trainee. She's in over her head, but her determination to solve the case and keep her psyche in one piece makes her a perfect match for Lecter, something they both realize. Although Hopkins gets all the credit, Foster's brilliant performance makes him even better than Hopkins could by himself. Both of their performances compliment each other well, which elevates the project from solid into brilliant. The other actors are effective, but Foster and Hopkins are the ones that really make the film what it is.<br/><br/>This isn't a flawless movie; quite frankly, it's just not as frightening as its legend suggests, and the psychological explorations of the characters by critics and the actors make the film promise something that it doesn't have. This is simply a superbly executed thriller, one that relies on character to succeed instead of special effects.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film will scare you (the climax is genuinely terrifying). And it introduces us (to the definitive interpretation at least...Brian Cox played the role in ""Manhunter"" in the 80s) to one of cinema's most notorious characters. That alone is reason enough to see this film."

They were all confirmed.<br/><br/>Hopkins is awe inspiring as Lecter, Levine is disturbing as Gumb, the lighting is dark and creates a chilling atmosphere, and the score is as powerful as Lecter himself.<br/><br/>However, I have several gripes with this film. The biggest is the fact that after Lecter escapes, the film grinds to a halt. It takes a good while for the film to pick up again, but thankfully it does. Also, the reason why Lecter is taken from his original cell to the one he escapes from is not really clear.<br/><br/>But, this is a masterpiece of a film, disturbing, chilling and thrilling all at the same time, with a majesty that rivals and maybe even surpasses the master of the genre, Alfred Hitchcock."

","The Silence of the Lambs is a chilling story depicted through the dissection and analysis of a genius cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lector played by Anthony Hopkins. Director Johnathan Demme uses Clarice Starling played by Jodie Foster to play on Hannibal Lector's manipulating intelligence. Clarice is originally selected by the head of FBI's behavioral Science unit Jack Crawford to track down a notorious serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill. Crawford asks Clarice to meet with Dr. Hannibal Lector in order to find the whereabouts of buffalo bill. This constant interaction between Clarice and Dr. Lector makes for an exciting mind game played on both sides. <br/><br/>Director Johnathan Demme's use of dark emphasis on reality combined with Anthony Hopkins assertive and sadistic abilities as an actor makes for great chemistry. Jodie Foster's ""matter a fact"" persona is presented as a challenge to Dr. Lector. This relationship is established at the beginning and continuously unraveled as the story progresses. On one occasion Clarice meets with Dr. Lector who is sitting behind bullet proof glass inside his windowless cell. Dr. Lector finds is release through the analysis of Clarice's life. Clarice uses her disturbing past to compensate for links to Buffalo Bill. Dr. Lector eventually falls for Clarice's pursuit and gives her a clue that leads to one of Dr. Lector's past patients. From this point Clarice takes her findings back to Dr. Lector in hopes of finding Buffalo Bill who has now abducted Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin. With the severity of the situation on Clarice's back she is forced to come up with an answer. Knowing this she makes a deal with Dr. Lector's request of transferring to a different facility in return for finding buffalo bill.<br/><br/>Johnathan Demme brings a new definition to the word climax. Demme's use of scenery and dictation of characters like buffalo bill and Hannibal Lector seeks out an eerie pocket that most viewers are not used to experiencing. Camera angles and screen shots help to put you in the shoes of Clarice and buffalo bills hopeless victims. Although Clarice attempts to portray herself as a mentally tough FBI official we see Dr. Lector's tactics of recalling her childhood past begin to eat away at her. This struggle brings Clarice's true personality out which ties into a remarkable conclusion. Demme is attempting to bring you into the mind of mad genius. Through the harshness of reality seen in Clarice's past, Dr. Lector's actions and buffalo bills intentions we begin to think there is no hope. Demme brings you so far down into the plot that you begin to transcend your thoughts and emotions as those of the young lady trapped by Buffalo Bill. You have that real sense that you cannot expect a successful conclusion to the multi-dimensional plot as portrayed through multi-dimensional characters."
"lagriff05","8","0","1","26 August 2009"," One of the landmarks of the thriller genre.
","Everyone knows this one; it's a pop culture gem and an icon in the realm of detective/thriller movies. Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lector, an unstoppable pairing and a pleasure to watch - Anthony Hopkins' performance is amazing, and Jodie Foster is always smart, snappy and cute as hell. The supporting actors are okay, sometimes becoming a little hammy or whatever, but never distracting from the film.<br/><br/>I think the main selling point of this is Hannibal himself, whose psychological musings and mind games make this movie stand out from others of its kind. Just take a look at his talks with Clarice Starling in the mental asylum - that is chilling. The other inmates are kind of creepy, but they're more silly than anything, and are overshadowed by Lecter himself. The dialogue in these scenes is just great, worth the whole price of admission by itself.<br/><br/>The movie flows well, wasting no time and generally being solid in every area, albeit not truly astounding in any of them, either. The story is basically as solid a detective story as you'll get, with every scene making you wonder what is about to happen next. Perhaps the most exciting part of the movie has nothing at all to do with the whole serial killer deal, as it is when Hannibal escapes from prison. You have to see it to find out what I mean - it is truly electrifying and suspenseful.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this yet, you should rectify that immediately. This is a definite genre classic and certainly one any self-acclaimed movie buff needs to see. Recommended."

"TOMNEL","8","0","2","19 June 2008"," Disappointing, not to say this wasn't a great movie.
","The Silence of the Lambs won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1992, and though I did enjoy Beauty and the Beast more, I can understand this winning. It was the best of the nominated films and overall that was a weak year. This movie is highly enjoyable with well written and even better acted out characters, such as Anthony Hopkins who seemed to gain the fame that he had been searching for after years of acting with his portrayal of the psychotic Dr. Hannibal Lechter. The direction is good, and the situations, though horrible, are also believable. It doesn't seem to far-fetched that a serial killer would make a coat of human skin, does it? I think the problem here is a lack of true tension. Scenes trying to be suspenseful and tense came off almost as clichés, and weren't nearly as scary as they could have been.<br/><br/>FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is on the case of a serial killer who is known as Buffalo Bill, but in order to get information on him, she must go to incarcerated psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lechter, who was put away for killing and eating his victims. As the story progresses Clarice begins to learn more and Buffalo Bill continues killing and skinning his victims.<br/><br/>This movie is very good, not excellent, but very good. Many critics say this movie is so disgustingly violent, but that's just not true. Though violence does occur, none of it was over the top, and it occurred very infrequently throughout the picture. The acting is top notch, with as I (and anyone else who reviewed this mentioned) said earlier, with Anthony Hopkins pulling the most he could out of his scenes. Jodie Foster was also very good, and so was Ted Levine as the disturbed serial killer Buffalo Bill. The scary moments...well, for me there were none. Any scene trying to be scary fell flat. One scene involves a character being stalked by a man with night vision goggles in his dark house, and that scene should have had my heart pumping for the safety of the character, but it didn't. I found it clichéd and very typical of any slasher film. Another thing that just didn't work for me was constant flashbacks from Jodie Foster looking back at her traumatic childhood. It should have had real drama, but again felt contrived and clichéd. I also didn't like the musical score, which felt like something that belonged on an episode of NYPD Blue, or some TV show, and not in a good movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was great, and entertaining to watch, but it has some faults that drop it from a thrilling adventure I want to watch again and again to a very good movie, but a mediocre thriller.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 120 mins. R for language and some blood violence."

","At times it seems that there aren't words to describe ""The Silence of the Lambs"", it truly is an endurance trial of the mind. The film is dark and psychologically disturbing throughout while also dealing with issues of sexism and strength. Director Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris' best-selling novel swept across the globe in 1991, eventually winning five Academy Awards and becoming a prestigious topic of discussion among critics.<br/><br/>Its moody influence crept across the popular 90s sub-genre of 'serial-thriller'. This lent The Silence of the Lambs a growing reputation for being an adult thriller of horror ike capabilities. The mythically monstrous and deliciously manipulative Hannibal Lecter became an immediate household name and now remains among the most popular fictitious villains in modern cinema. Such a figure could only be played by one man (has it become unimaginable to picture it any other way?) that man being Anthony Hopkins, who slipped himself into the role with matchless prestige, therefore giving birth to a cultural icon of both literature and cinema.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is an FBI trainee, being called up from her classes to acquire information from a serial killer, Dr.Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), about a current killer known as Buffalo Bill. Bill is a man who wishes to be a transsexual but has been turned down for sex reassignment because of his volatility. Starling acquires a sort of cordial relationship with Lecter, who wishes her to divulge personal information about herself in return for his assistance with the case. The film is tense throughout. Scott Glenn turns in a pretty good performance as a director of the FBI division that Starling is entering. Lecter is chilling as he gives Starling information about Buffalo Bill and the Senator's daughter who has been kidnapped by Bill. The film is extremely suspenseful, I felt like yelling at the screen to tell me what was going to happen next. The suspense is most definitely on account of the film's taking you through out the twists and turns of your own psyche.<br/><br/>The acting is one of the most crucial aspects of the film. Since the film only revolves around a few characters a big cast of mixed stars in not necessary. Instead, the quality over quantity formula works exceptionally well. Anthony Hopkins got best actor award despite being confined to only seventeen minutes of screen time. He does his best in every scene and practically pours his heart as he makes such a realistic and haunting performance.<br/><br/>However Hannibal would obviously be a complete waste without Jodie Foster giving an equally impressive performance. She has a nice south American accent with a good amount of innocence to her. She is desperate to find Bill but has a weird relationship with Hannibal along the way. Ted Levine is the last major character in this film and probably the whole reason why everything happens. He doesn't have much screen time but still manages to put on a creepy and believable performance. He is somewhat humorous but still manages to remain sinister.<br/><br/>The Silence of the lambs works for a lot of factors. The cast plays a big part and so is the mood, setting, and cinematography. The movie is very dark most of the time and the cinematography complements this perfectly. The detail to the scenes works well as the setting is creepy and suspenseful. Hannibal's jail cells are nicely designed and contain a lot of aspects that show his character nicely. The movie keeps an excellent balance of suspense and drama. It is suspenseful throughout but has a nice dramatic element that is lacking in many films today. The climax is pulse pounding and the film has excellent closure that has it come full circle.<br/><br/>Even the DVD cover scares me. I would NOT recommend this for children obviously!!!!"

","This movie sets the bar. From the acting to editing, from the score to the cinematography, there isn't an aspect of the movie that I'd change, nor is there an aspect that does not stay with me for hours and days after I watch the film.<br/><br/>Hopkins puts on a clinic. The brilliance of his performance is his ability to captivate the viewer and Agent Starling with his gifts of psychological study and underlying aristocratic being while also delving ever so suddenly into moments of sheer lunacy. He lets the animal out of the cage so flawlessly and so momentarily that its just amazing to realize that its all an act.<br/><br/>Then there are the minute details, and side characters. I love Demme's underlying 'woman in a man's world' theme that he never overtly introduces. Instead, he just puts Foster in these great scenes, the best of which is just before she examines the body found in W. Virginia, where she is left in a room with a dozen W. Virginia state cops. Classic. Then there are the characters, like the moth experts or the latest victim's distraught father who lets Foster into his home to examine the victim's bedroom or the cops who try to catch Hannibal when he escapes in Memphis. All are peripheral characters, but they all resonate, they all somehow fit perfectly. I cant explain it, but nothing takes away, everything just adds to this movie, and it truly will be one of my favorites for as long as I live."

","(To Readers: I am forced to write this article for an English writing <br/><br/>assessment, I personally liked the FilM VERY MUCH!!!)<br/><br/>In recent years, Hong Kong became flooded by countless numbers of horror movies involving bloody and violent scene. If you are a fan of this, you might be in favor of this film directed by Jonathan Demme.<br/><br/>I personally liked horror (or more precisely , thriller movies, such as Stanely Kubrick's THE SHINING) films, which aim at producing a thrilling atmosphere, but not actually showing one. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is an excellent example of the kind of thrillers showing shocking scenes. The plot was fine and suspending. However, it was screwed up by the over-emphasis Hannibal Lecter's violence (the scene of the guard being disemboweled and hung on the wall was notorious for causing discomfort).<br/><br/>Another aspect we can take a look at is about the preproduction of the movie Maybe due to the over-emphasis of violence in the script written by Ted Tally, Gene Hackman an actor who was originally invited to become the director of the film, turned downed the invitation in the end. Even in looking for actors playing the roles of CLARICE STARLING and HANNIBAL LECTER has been a great difficulty for the production. Four actresses (including Michelle Pfeiffer, Kim Basinger, Emma Thompson and Meg Ryan) rejected the invitation due to 'the subject matter', as Michelle Pfeiffer said. Sean Connery was originally offered the role of Hannible, but in the end, he refused. Thus we can see from the responses of the actors and actresses that have refused to play a role in the movie, that it is focusing too much on violence.<br/><br/>In addition, some main features such as Hannibal's 'maroon eyes' and his 'six-fingered left hand', were missing in the movie. With such advanced technology nowadays, these special features can be made real without any difficulties.<br/><br/>Although I really did not enjoy the movie (probably the unforgettable bloody scene have created a bad image for me), I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy bloody thrillers, as the violent scenes will leave you nightmares lasting at least a month."

This lent The Silence of the Lambs a growing reputation for being an adult thriller (and drama) of horror-like capabilities. The mythically monstrous and deliciously manipulative Hannibal Lecter became an immediate household name, and now remains among the most popular fictitious villains in modern cinema. Such a figure could only be played by one man (has it become unimaginable to picture it any other way?), that man being Anthony Hopkins, who slipped himself into the role with matchless prestige, therefore giving birth to a cultural icon of both literature and cinema.<br/><br/>Disturbingly accurate in its portrayal of law enforcement, psychology and crime, The Silence of the Lambs stitches a tight, finely-tuned visage of the criminal psyche. Such a narrative instantaneously drags the viewer into the murky underworld of criminal investigation and dangerously murderous mind games. Jodie Foster performs as Clarice Starling, a trainee FBI agent, with extreme ingenuity and awareness. She is a feminist symbol and a woman rightfully fighting to succeed in the job she so deserves, but because of gender stereotypes she finds herself suffering from sexist reactions. Clarice gets employed by the FBI to question the captured serial-killer and ex-psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He is believed to hold the key to capturing the uncaught serial-killer, nicknamed Buffalo Bill. Unfortunately for Clarice, Dr. Lecter is not keen on extracting information easily and for personal amusement, manipulates and interrogates Clarice for every ounce of information she receives.<br/><br/>One of the most important aspects of Jonathan Demme's seminal thriller is its subjective vision. Much of the camera-work deceitfully places the viewer in the shoes of Clarice, while occasionally reverting to even the killer's perspective of the unfolding events. Yet the key behind the ability to frighten is when one becomes witness to the meticulously considered process Dr. Lecter executes before providing Clarice with the information she so desperately needs. From these scenes we begin to learn that Clarice is suffering from her own inner-torment and childhood anguish. Dr. Lecter is not indirect with his queries, but deviously confrontational, allowing Clarice to unknowingly expose her past to the audience. Many parallels are distinctly demonstrated throughout; an example being Clarice's loss of her parents, in contrast with Buffalo Bill's abusive childhood. The scenes filmed between the two central characters define ""mise-en-scène"", a film-making technique used to convey emotion through set design. In this case, the clinical-looking prison ward emphasises a character's isolated, but systematically secured state.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is and always will be an exciting cinematic adventure, not only for its knack of sending sudden bolts of shock through the viewer, but for its admirable talent to tell a story. There are plot holes and clichés littered throughout the surprisingly unpredictable narrative; nevertheless, it will not distract you from being more-than-momentarily immersed over the two-hour running-time. Much of the time is spent periodically conceiving a bundle of well-earned scares, while also allowing time for the audience to ponder the possibilities over what will happen next. Boasting a tremendously taut screenplay, some abrasively framed visuals and a lingering score by composer Howard Shore, this 1991 classic is a treat for film-buffs and casual cinema-goers alike. Even with those brief, glimmering compliments, it is the performances which are showcase material."

","It seems as if Dr.Lector is so devoid of emotion and empathy, so removed from human emotion, that he has 'quid pro quo' games with Clarice having her reveal emotional memories to him, with him sublimating them almost as a 'vampire' revels in drinking blood. Thus I thought it quite apt the a policeman asks Clarice if Lector is a 'vampire'. Indeed he is, but he doesn't want blood. Lector is so totally devoid of emotion, or suffering depression to such a desperate degree, that he has to resort to the most heinous act possible, cannibalism, to evoke any emotion, any feeling whatsoever. Lector is indeed dead inside - no good, no bad, no nothing - that is the ultimate tragedy of this empty shell of a man. Lector is played as a man who always has a quiet steady voice and even indulges in classical music as he commits acts of cannibalism. The scene in which Hopkins talks to the camera is nothing short of miraculous. Ted Levine as Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumbis also is nothing short of astounding in his portrayal of someone seriously lost mentally, a man who so despises his own flesh, that he adorns himself in the flesh of others, to achieve a feeling a normalcy. A great movie about sanity and insanity with magnificent actors at their best."

","I have always been interested in serial killers. How exactly they go through the process of killing their victim etc. Well, this serial killer ridden dramatic masterpiece was a very interesting attempt to tell of the subject.<br/><br/>The story has potential. Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee is sent by her boss, Jack Crawford, to Dr. Hannibal Lector. A former psychiatrist who murdered many people, eating them shortly after. Lector is held in an asylum in Baltimore Maryland, where he is dealt with very carefully. Lector's brilliance and genius are renowned and he is very dangerous, even behind bars. It will be a real advancement into the field of forensic science to be able to unlock Lector's mind. And a huge career advancement for Starling, but when she actually meets Hannibal, he attacks her mind with his strange workings and is only semi-cooperative. At the same time, another serial killer, Nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill' is on the loose who kills women to cut off parts of their skin. Starling takes it upon herself to get information from the reluctant Lector who directly knows the answer to the case, but he reveals it in hints, thus Starling must interpret them before Bill kills his next victim, who is being starved for several days in order for her skin to loosen up.<br/><br/>First of all, I would like to say that this movie's photographic quality is like someone trying to curl a barbell that is barely too heavy for them. The weight is almost lifted, but just can't be. The photography is weighed down from an acceptable quality.<br/><br/>This movie is overall very well directed however, the lighting is perfect, and the other artistic elements run together very well. The sets are well constructed, the score fits flawlessly, and the story is handled in a gritty, disturbing manner. The entire production is just amazingly well done, and has a very strong atmosphere.<br/><br/>But Hopkins really makes this movie. I don't see why everyone thinks that Foster gave such a great performance. As Lectr, he is sophisticated, yet quite psychopathic at the same time. His performance really makes this movie. Also worth mentioning is Anthony Heald as Dr. Chilton who runs the asylum Lector is in. He brings a vanity and villainy to the role that contrasts well with Hopkins's demeanor.<br/><br/>So overall, Silence of the lambs was a very entertaining and compelling drama. I fail to see any flaws except for a bad performance by Scott Glen as Jack Crawford. Silnce of the Lambs will be remembered as one of the better films of the 1990s"

","Why it deserves a spot: The Silence Of The Lambs is perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made. Definitely in the Top 10 of the past 25 years. In fact, it's one of the three movies that have swept away the five major Academy Awards; the other two being It Happened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975). Almost everything about this movie is fantastic. The only reason it's ranking being so low is because I don't consider it a pure horror film. On my all time list it ranks much higher.<br/><br/>The Acting: Wow. This is one of the best acted movies ever made. Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins deserved their Oscars. Ted Levine should have at least gotten a nomination. Without Anthony Hopkins this movie wouldn't be as successful. He recreated the character of Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>The Gore: There's not too much to work with on this movie. It didn't need it. There are a few scenes including cannibalism.<br/><br/>The Suspense/Thrills: This movie has tons of suspense and thrills. Almost every scene has something to be nervous about. The final scene in which Clarice is being chased by Buffalo Bill is almost unbearable.<br/><br/>Scary Factor: 6.5/10"

","This film would have to be the most suspenseful drama in years, right up there with ""Fatal Attraction"", and in the best Hitchcockian tradition. The tantalisation of scares that are not quite delivered, and the ones that are keep you on the edge of your seat from scene one. Jonathan Demme knows exactly when to use subtlety, and does it superbly. ""Lambs"" continually intrigues, shocks, disturbs and fascinates, and the subtle humour works well in a dark fashion.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster deserves an Oscar for her frantic, tense performance as an FBI trainee searching desperately for a serial killer. Even more deserving is Anthony Hopkins, who is disturbingly charming and chilling as Doctor Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter, who trades with agent Starling (Foster) for 'information'. All supporting cast are excellent in a film that delivers a knockout punch.

","There are a few items that perplex me regarding this film. First, a review posted in the IMDb on September 15, 2006 makes reference to ""too much nudity"" in the film on the part of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, yet there was no nudity in the film. That, in itself, baffles me... but I digress. The second is why the scene where the Deputy is crucified like a butterfly. Realistically, where would Lecter have had the time, and being that the deputy was a large man, where did Hopkins summon the strength? OK, with those two issues aside, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a good film. I think it was deserved of Best Picture for that year, 1991, as well considering its competition. I don't think it was a great movie, however.<br/><br/>I don't usually compare films with their novel counterparts, because films and books are really two separate beasts. Sometimes, such as with ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I make exceptions, but that is more the exception than the norm. Because I have seen many reference made to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" the movie versus ""The Silence of the Lambs"" the book, I feel compelled to comment. I read the book and I found the book to be very shallow. The film was far better. And that is all I have to say about that.<br/><br/>""Silence"" worked primarily because of Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) and Ted Levine (Jame Gumb.) Jodie Foster did an above average job as Clarice Starling, but there is just something about Foster that rubs me the wrong way in the film. I can't quite place my finger on it, maybe her attempt at a southern accent or maybe her masculine mannerisms and boyish looks, but she ""just didn't do it for me."" As I have stated in my review of the film ""Hannibal"", I found Julianne Moore to be far better suited for the part of Clarice Starling. Perhaps it is mere preference, and that is all.<br/><br/>As I initially mentioned, there were some mechanical problems with the film. Overall, the film worked, though. It is a very dark and disturbing tale, and the atmosphere stays quite faithful to that premise with it's dark color tones and macabre soundtrack. There are few characters that earn the eerie and sinister reputation of Hannibal (the Cannibal) Lecter, and as already stated, this is a credit to Hopkins. The film's conclusion is both suspenseful and darkly comical. Some find themselves frustrated by the open-ended ending, but I found it perfect, especially how it made for an easy transition into the sequel."

","Granted, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a great thriller. On a humanistic level, I prefer RED DRAGON, for its marvelous payoff at the end and for its humane characterization of the villain (played by Ralph Fiennes). But back to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Despite its grandeur, there is a huge flaw in the script. Yves Lavandier has expressed it well in his book WRITING DRAMA.<br/><br/>Remember. To help Clarice understand Buffalo Bill's mentality, her superior (Scott Glenn) suggests she visit another serial killer, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Lecter is reputed to be fiendishly manipulative. Clarice is warned by her superior: ""You tell him nothing personal. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head."" The warning is clear-you do so at your peril. Soon afterwards, we learn that Lecter has driven the man in the next cell to commit suicide. And it is very clear to us that Clarice will need to be extremely cautious. When Lecter, at their first meeting, asks her questions about her private life, we feel concern. When, at their next meeting, Clarice starts to talk about herself, we fear the worst. But nothing happens-Clarice opens up but suffers no consequences. Her superior's warning and Clarice's subsequent attitude do not lead to a payoff.<br/><br/>I was disappointed by this unkept promises since it represents a lost opportunity for further conflict. But there is more to it than that. If the writers had established a close link between Clarice's confidences and Lecter's subsequent break-out-the former contributing to the latter, for example-not only would the film have gained in rigour and unity of action, it would also have shown more clearly that in order to catch one dangerous psychopath, the FBI trainee has been obliged to allow free another, much more dangerous psychopath. In other words, the powerless of American society would have been demonstrated more convincingly.<br/><br/>Another missed opportunity."

He is highly intelligent but at the same time an absolute psychopath. He is in prison but still he is a permanent threat.<br/><br/>The Silence of The Lambs is the second part of the trilogy and by far the best. You don't need to watch Red Dragon before watching this movie in order to understand the plot but since Red Dragon is a good movie you might as well watch it too.

","The Silence of the Lambs begins with FBI agent in training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) being summoned to Jack Crawford's (Scott Glenn) office who happens to be the FBI's director of behavioural science. Clarice is told by Crawford that he wants her to travel to the Baltimore state hospital & interview the notorious serial killer Dr. Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to possibly help identify a current serial killer nick-named 'Buffalo Bill' (Ted Levine) who has kidnapped, murdered & skinned several young girls. Clarice meets up with the slimy Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald) who runs the hospital & has responsibility for Lecter, he tells her some basic rules & then she's ready. Clarice's meeting with Lecter goes O.K. & he gives her a few cryptic clues which leads her to a severed head in a jar, 'Buffalo Bills' first victim. Meanwhile 'Buffalo Bill' himself has abducted a young girl named Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) who is the daughter of a powerful Washington Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker). Lecter sees an opportunity to leave his miserable existence in his cramped brick cell behind & tries to strike a deal with the Senator in exchange for 'Buffalo Bills' name. As politics & greed begin to surface Lecter sets his plans in motion while Clarice who is now on the investigating team is determined to track 'Buffalo Bill' down, save Catherine before he kills her & put a stop to his grisly crimes for good.<br/><br/>Directed by Jonathan Demme (who also has a small cameo at the end apparently) I thought Silence of the Lambs was a solid horror film, & by the way if you listen to the documentary on the DVD everyone involved in the production refers to it as a horror film & nothing else! The script by Ted Tally based on the novel by Thomas Harris is a little slow & deliberate on occasion but for the most part it's very interesting & gripping. There isn't much in the way of on-screen blood or gore, in fact very little, but it's still quite a powerful film with Anthony Hopkins performance as Hannibal Lecter the obvious standout, although having said that he has very little on-screen time with about 15 or so minutes in total which is the shortest amount of time ever to win a best actor Oscar. I liked how Silence of the Lambs ended & in particular how things turned out for Lecter. Everyone else is good as well but I personally didn't really like Jodie Foster that much as she just got on my nerves after a while & I couldn't see her as a tough chick kind of character! Horror film directors (another indication that Silence of the Lambs was indeed intended to be a horror film before it became a big success & we all know horror films can't be successful so now it's called a thriller) Roger Corman & George A. Romero both have cameos. Technically Silence of the Lambs is competent but not outstanding, the music is O.K., the photography a little flat & the production design bland but with such a strong story I guess these things don't matter so much. There are some truly great moments throughout, too. Overall I liked it for sure but I did find it a little slow going during certain places & Jodie Foster just didn't do it for me as Agent Starling for some reason I can't quite explain, Silence of the Lambs is a great horror film but I couldn't see myself sitting through it again anytime soon & it's maybe not quite as good as all those Oscars would suggest you to believe. Definitely worth watching & deserving of my 8 out of 10 star rating but I do have certain reservations about it & believe it to be a little overrated."

","Having seen Hannibal before this and enjoying it, I really got my hopes up since this was supposed to be even better (after all, it won 5 Oscars). And in many ways it is. <br/><br/>Agent Clarice Starling has just joined the FBI and her first assignment is to track down a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. To do that, she enlists the help of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an infamous cannibal who is being held at a maximum security psychiatric hospital. From there on it is an excellent duel between Lecter and Starling, both delivering top notch performances (though unfortunately, we don't see too much of Lecter). As the FBI is closing in on Buffalo Bill, Lecter is growing over Starling. Though at first she was instructed to only 'get the goods and nothing else', she crosses that line. And from there it continues into the hunt for Buffalo Bill and the relationship between the two main characters. <br/><br/>This movie was above all a thriller. It was tense, interesting and included everything that one could hope for. However, despite being listed so, it is not a horror. There are a few remote and moderately creepy elements but nothing to truly send chills down your back. The direction by Jonathan Demme I would describe as competent. It is strong but in a few places I felt that he could have made it a bit creepier and maybe even bloodier.

","How can anyone call Jodie Foster a weakness at any time???  The woman is the best out there right now.  I dare you to suggest a better actress for the role, and I guarantee that such an (nameless) actress would not have been honoured by the Academy.  Get a clue!"
"Liquidus","6","0","4","2 July 1999"," Not silent enough !
","I don't think that this movie is as good as everybody says. Where are the silent lambs ? Jonathan Demme seems not to know what real silence is ! Sometimes reality turns out to be crueler than any fiction can be. Jodie Foster is a very good actress, but she is not tough enough. I'm sure that there are better actresses to play this part. To name them here wouldn't help, I guess. Anyway, the movie was very boring and I didn't get nightmares like a classmate of my son. The story would have been more appealing if some Russian agents had been involved. This would guarantee real SILENCE. Believe me, I have experienced real silence..."
"rsilva","7","0","3","12 October 1998"," good movie, but it glorifies a serial killer!
","The Silence of The Lambs has many things going for it: superb acting, cinematography, music, direction, and a tension-filled script, but I really have a problem in that it indirectly glorifies a serial killer. Hannibal Lecter has practically become a cultural icon, which I think speaks ill for the direction our society has taken, when a cannibalistic monster has the brains and the guts we admire (no pun intended)."
"DomiMMHS","7","0","2","28 March 1999"," Movie belongs to photography and actors
","The movie is a solid thriller, or I'd rather call it a crime story, but there's not so much that makes it special and I think all in all it's a bit overrated.<br/><br/>A good thing about it is that apparently much effort has been made to shoot it very beautifully, carefully and unobtrusively. I mean, you don't see any really brutal scenes. Basically, I really appreciate this. Nor is it up to shock effects and frightening scenes in any sensational way. I still hope it's possible to take away these features without taking away intensity... they didn't manage.<br/><br/>I wanted to get scared when I watch the movie but I didn't. (Nearly) All the scenes are good, the story isn't too bad, but it all lacks the connection, the fluent, flawless line. Thus we don't get worthy intensity, worthy suspense, worthy fright. After all, the movie is Jodie Foster, a bunch of other actors and beautiful photography.<br/><br/>I mention Jodie Foster because she carries the movie, if simply with her being Jodie Foster. I don't mention Anthony Hopkins because he is less a character and more the scenes he's in. The scenes are good and they are due to him.<br/><br/>The scene at the airport is given a flair of importance by the appearance of Diane Baker, the way she appears - that's for instance what I mean by the movie belongs to the actors - the surroundings - belongs to photography and yes, I guess I connect this to art direction.<br/><br/>It's a good movie. Its problem: 5 Oscars and a flood of highest praise. My vote: 7 out of 10"

"MovieCritic20497","7","0","2","11 April 2002"," A Different Kind of Film
","I think that this film was pretty different. It made me think of Lord of the Flies (1990). I don't know why. This film was kind of strange, but I really liked it. Anthony Hopkins did a really good job playing Hannibal ""The Cannibal"". I really liked how he ate that cop guy. But, I don't think that this film deserved Best Picture in 1992 in the Oscars. Overall, this a really good film, and that everybody should go see this movie. It is worth your money!"
"gstiger","10","0","2","13 June 2001"," In my opinion, The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made.
","It's not very often that a first class cast and a fine director come together to bring life to an absolutely wonderful screenplay as they do in The Silence of the Lambs. <br/><br/>Ted Tally's script is a brilliant adaptation to a good book. It is unmatched in its use of characterization. The story is simple yet it works on a psychological level, thanks to the infamous Hannibal Lecter and his mind games with Clarice Starling.<br/><br/>Jonathan Demme's direction is good. His close-ups of various actors' faces are well done and well placed in the film. Demme effectively creates some very suspenseful moments, in the film, through his direction and his use of the first person point of view.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins delivers the greatest, most riveting performances ever, as the psychotic Dr. Hannibal `Cannibal' Lecter. Jodie Foster also delivers a brilliantly subtle performance as FBI trainee, Clarice Starling. Ted Levine does a wonderful job as the disturbed Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb. Scott Glenn gives a commendable performance as Jack Crawford<br/><br/>Howard Shore gives a wonderfully haunting musical score that adds a lot of atmosphere to the film. <br/><br/>Tak Fujimoto's cinematography is also first-rate. His use of lights, especially red lights to make the audience uneasy, is very effective.<br/><br/>
The editing by Craig McKay is marvelous, particularly the intercutting between the exterior of the wrong house in Calumet City and the interior of the right house in Belvedere, Ohio. <br/><br/>All of these aspects make The Silence of the Lambs one of the greatest, if not the greatest film ever made."
"Anne_Sharp","10","0","2","8 June 2001"," That's girl power!
","Jodie Foster has said that she liked this story because the heroine got to be genuinely heroic--though sometimes in danger, she was never cast as a victim (a rule flagrantly broken in ""Hannibal,"" one of the many reasons why it'll never count as an authentic sequel to ""Lambs."") Clarice Starling is the most imaginatively realized female character in American film history, as well as one of its few genuinely believable action heroes. It's easy to forget how important Foster's Clarice is to the precision balance of this drama. Without a worthy adversary/love object, Hannibal wouldn't be quite so impressive."
"mattkratz","Null","0","2","7 June 2001"," unbelievably good
","This movie seems destined for classic status. It was very well made, and Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were well-cast in the leads. The movie delivers and provides suspense throughout, and was deserving of all the Oscars it received.<br/><br/>Hopkins' conversations with Foster are some of the highlights of the film, as he gives the impression of a psychotic yet suave and well-educated man.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"bringing-sexy-back","9","0","1","13 May 2001"," One of the best movies ever
","The Silence Of The Lambs is one of the best crime thrillers ever in my opinion. I'd heard a lot about it being great before I finally saw it last year (I had to search a lot to get a copy of it because, for some reason it's been deleted in the UK). The acting is brilliant and it's not too gory. A modern classic. Make sure you see it soon, I don't think it's possible to hate it!"
"Brian-272","6","0","4","8 February 2001"," Ready to explore the dark fringes of human behavior? And experience both enjoyment and terror at the same time while being educated by the world's best lecturer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).
","Finally after ten years I watched The, Silence of the Lambs for the first time and I must say that it is not as great as everybody had said. I can say that after watching it though I felt like I was educated by the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit! I love the script it seemed to have a real life ring to it. You have Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as an FBI trainee who wants to be a member of the behavioral science unit that studies violent crime and serial killings and once the brutal killings across several eastern and midwestern states begin all the work of ""Buffalo Bill"". Clarice enlists the aid of a former psychologist and now imprisoned sociopath (Anthony Hopkins) to help track the killer. And I must say that Hopkins gives a mind numbing performance he really made a great educated sociopath the movie explores the dark nature of life but mainly it proves all of us can receive a mind playing education just as Hopkins does so well with the Foster character as he brings out her dark fears and past mistakes such as the incident with a crying lamb as a child maybe we will later learn in the Hannibal sequel that a lamb doesn't stay silent forever you know Anthony's Hannibal will roar like a lion. The, Silence of the Lambs falls short of matching the gore and high drama of movies like Se7en but the script is so mind tingling and while the Hopkins character has the ability to know the future of all and any crazy individuals while he surprises himself and others with the rude nature and he can always play his own mind games to his advantage that is what makes The, Silence of the Lambs a classic. Let's hope Hannibal is this good."
