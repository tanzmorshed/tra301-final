"DJWinston","4","260","370","13 June 2020"," A Spike Lee Disjoint
","Much as I admire Spike Lee's talent and audacity, this film just didn't work for me. Too many preposterous plot points while the motivations (of everyone, it seemed) were never clear. The whole thing was just confusing.<br/><br/>And yes, disjointed."
"turicus","1","125","173","20 June 2020"," Had to reactivate my account to warn you about how terrible this is
","This film is an absolute mess. It starts out well, with 4 Viet Nam vets going back to find their dead buddy. And some gold that they hid. What gold? Never properly explained. But it's been buried just below the surface for 50 years, and no-one ever found it. One of the vets' son finds it when he goes to take a dump. I'm not making that up.<br/><br/>That's not the biggest coincidence though. They are found in the jungle by a group of mine-clearing activists they met in town before setting off. You know, after hiking through the jungle for days. And just as one of them steps on an old mine. Just, ""Oh hi!"" in the jungle. The mine clearers say that they can't clear mines, though.<br/><br/>One guy gets bit by a snake and sucks the lood out, then falls over, loses the gold, and just keeps walking without even picking up his rifle. Hardened vet with 3 tours under his belt.<br/><br/>Next up is one of the vets' ex-girlfriend who looks about 20 years too young to have been of age in the late 60s. And her daughter by said vet doesn't look close to 50 either. He also finds her house even though he hasn't been in touch. He doesn't even know he has a daughter. But walks right up, rings the doorbell and has dinner with her.<br/><br/>The firefights are some of the worst you have ever seen. Everyone is a terrible shot except the heroes. Even though they all fire on full auto with what seems to be 400 round magazines. And one of them shoots a guy in the head first round even though he just said he's never held a gun.<br/><br/>Then in the last 30 seconds a Black Lives Matter sequences gets tacked on, which sort of fits. But the film was shot in spring 2019, so it's obvious they just added a current events message to it. Which muddles the story about what the vets went through, their struggles and current lives.<br/><br/>In the end, nearly everyone is dead and the gold gets given away. By this point, you don't care, cause the characters have developed so little depth, and seem to be acting randomly.<br/><br/>What a disaster. Don't waste your time watching it! I thought Spike Lee was supposed to be good? How did this get a rating above 3/10 on any platform?"

","There's a lot of really cool stuff going on in this movie, but the directing and writing gets in the way. Ultimately, the movie tries to link the Viet Nam war and racism, and fails miserably. In trying to fight the two different wars, it loses a lot.<br/><br/>There's a lot of issues with the movie, but they come down to three issues:
1) It needs to decide which movie it's remaking. It basically tries to combine Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Apocalypse Now, and Three Kings and fails at it because of how different the three movies are.
2) The length; this movie could have been told much more effectively in almost half the time. I know it's trying to combine three movies, but that's no excuse for just taking too much time on things.
3) The over-the-top racism. I know this is a weird call, but the movie could have been a lot more effective had it toned down the racism. Also, some of the incidents involved contribute to the length of the movie without really adding anything.<br/><br/>The apparent lack of any military knowledge on the part of Lee (the sheer number of military gaffes, such as salutes and ammunition) as well as the obvious call-backs to movies involved keep throwing watchers out of the movie.<br/><br/>This had the potential to be an incredible movie, especially as the acting is incredible and the cinematography is gorgeous, but it's just too long and too many issues to be even a satisfactory movie."
"portermelissa","3","179","261","13 June 2020"," I wanted to like this movie
","I was so excited that a new Spike Lee movie was out and wanted to like it so badly, but at the end of the day, this movie is just bad. The plotline becomes as advanced as a Disney movie (but with more blood and gore) and some of the casting choices were absolutely awful. It was disjointed and the quality overall would be expected of an amateur, but not someone like Spike Lee. I still gave it 3 stars for its display of several mental issues that veterans suffer from, but I wouldn't spend the time watching this one."

","Spike has missed the boat again with this one! So, so bad. I write this as I'm two hours in, thoroughly convinced that it ain't getting any better. Poor script; in fact, an utterly empty script that does no justice to the real ""Bloods"" who lost their lives or left the best of their lives in the jungles of Vietnam. If I were to meet him, I'd ask, ""Why, Spike. Just why?"" The script is, again, so poorly written; it meanders and fails to ever find its focus and aim, engendering no reason to invest in the story nor the characters therein. The cast members are all great talents. However, they are tragically, criminally, wasted here. I was bored, my family too, by the thirty-minute mark, and it managed to even go further down hill from there. An utter waste of time. There is nothing, nothing redeeming about this disaster of a thrown-together film. Implausible and uninspired, it is, and I say all this as I true Spike Lee fan. Please, please, do yourself a favor and avoid this god-awful film! PLEASE! LIFE IS TOO SHORT!"

","This films intro was the best bit. It all went downhill from there. Two and half hours of predictable plot and awful unnatural dialogue. The cinematography was jarring for the wrong reasons with a colour palette that didn't match within individual scenes. The changing aspect ratio was a nice touch but I feel like this was an after thought as much of the framing felt off and was awfully wide for what felt like no reason.<br/><br/>The editing was rather lacklustre and felt like a soap opera.<br/><br/>I can see why this film is being praised due to its messages of inequality and awful treatment of African Americans throughout all of americas history. I would've appreciated these messages if they weren't served to me with a spoon.<br/><br/>I feel like the filmmakers in the editing room said ""apocalypse now was a great Vietnam war film. We should pay homage to it"" and with this in mind they added flight of the valkyries to the soundtrack. Poor taste and craft."

Watched this with my family and the moment with the battle scene at the beginning and the completely inappropriate music was the first time we all looked at each other with a wtf ??
Then the scene where one of them meets his old flame - again the music and script made us realize ahhh maybe this movie stinks.

"guyzradio","2","96","152","13 June 2020"," A bungled cocktail of messages
","A marketing executive once told me ""Advertising is like an arrow. The sharper the message, the better it sticks in the target."" By that logic, ""Da 5 Bloods"" is like throwing the quiver and hoping you hit something.<br/><br/>My first reaction after viewing Da 5 Bloods was it's important to separate the film from the message(s). A movie that attempts to explore the racial inequities of the Viet Nam war, the effect on friendships of worshiping gold, the importance of family, the merits (or lack) of the Trump administration -- what did I miss? -- is unlikely to do a good job on any of them.<br/><br/>Unlike ""The Green Book"" or ""Blackkklansman,"" which present narratives on racism effectively through well-crafted films, Da 5 Bloods is a heavy-handed, often preachy and disjointed commercial that self-dilutes the impact of what it tries to say. The end scenes of various organizations receiving huge gold-fueled donations includes Black Lives Matter, which seems to be presented as an afterthought. The story is predictable, and plays out like it was written for a high school literature class the night before it was due. All this is before even considering scenes, characters, and situations that qualify as goofs, anachronisms, and ""couldn't possibly happen that way."".<br/><br/>Da 5 Bloods goes a step beyond the old cliche about killing the messenger for the message, and lets the messenger mangle the message himself. I expected a better film from Spike Lee."

","On Metacritic it's labeled with ""must-see"" with currently 8,2 stars by 47 critics total.<br/><br/>Well, what a let down.<br/><br/>The importance of the topic is undeniable. There are some good ideas, legendary, beautiful music by Marvin Gaye and a great cast creating a few touching and funny moments.<br/><br/>Nonetheless the story feels too chaotic to be called outstanding! What's going on?! There are some cringe worthy, unnatural conversations, some Tarantino'ish bloodbaths and an Indiana Jones-like gold hunt, not in a good way. Also there is plenty of more or less known historical footage pressed in often too hasty, so it is necessary to pause every now and then to be at least able to read the text. I find this technique of film making for a fictional story quite lazy, especially if it's used so excessively often. (Other than with documentaries) It's too easy to make a film catchy by using real, uncensored footage of brutal events like executions.<br/><br/>At least I watched the whole movie, but not at once. Needed a break in-between.<br/><br/>In general I love the older Spike Lee's. After a long time and the high praise of the media I just expected a more genuine, profound, realistic, if too still artistic approach to this important topic.<br/><br/>Concluding the only clever and genuine thing were the scenes, which looked like flashbacks, just with the same old characters playing themselves at war back then...first it felt strange, but I interpreted it as dream sequences caused by PTSD. If it is so, I don't know."

","Whoa....this was a hell of a ride!
Now, if you are expecting Da 5 Bloods to be a movie in the sense of a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, it might not work for you.
I am not sure myself it worked for me but I didn't feel like I could just ignore it either.
This is like a pile of political, emotional and historical statements not necessarily linked in one single bundle. At times it ends up being a Tarantino-like mess, but with relevance.
It is surely timely, it is heavily politically loaded, it is emotional and intense, angered but also ironical and lighthearted at moments.
Maybe not to be judged, let alone rated, but just to be absorbed."

","Spike Lee proves he is the most overrated director. Intellectually a lightweight, his style has become lazier and more self-indulgent with age. He uses 70 year old actors, and the prostitute mother of one of their children is 62, but their child is no where near the 50 she would been. 1975 to 2020 is 45 years. Terrible mistake. And the device of using the old actors during the flashback scenes with a younger actor is a foolish device that stops the film every time it is employed. This isn't a film, so much as a polemic about race. I get it, and I agree, but who wants to be hit over the head with his ideology for 2.5 hours?"

The story was mediocre at best and the way the characters abandon their convictions over what seems like no reasons it made it seem like it wasn't done on purpose but just from lack of any kind of good writing.<br/><br/>I was expecting to see more around what it was like to be a black soldier in Vietnam but there was so little service paid to this topic it was literally a few guys standing around going ""Oh man it sucks to be a black soldier in Vietnam... which is where we are right now... in Vietnam... because they are just using us black soldiers. Hey man did I mention to you I am a black soldier in vietnam?"" This is such a HUGE topic that deserves a much better media outlet than this piece of trash.<br/><br/>Ken Burns does an amazing job of covering the war in his documentary The Vietnam War it is a bit of an investment though at about 20hrs to watch. BUT it goes into the details of it all (if you want to watch about the war). There are so many better movies depicting the struggles of Black Americans, like Malcom X, Detroit, Glory just to name a few. Don't bother with this movie it has NO redeeming qualities."

","I'm a longtime fan of Spike and we all know he has his own signature style of filmmaking, but I was let down by this almost Tarantino-esque flick. I expected alot more and the worst part was the casting. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, and Isiah Whitlock fan, but why Spike chose to include 50 year old flashbacks using the same 70-plus year old characters is beyond me. Chadwick Boseman plays a 20 something year old Vietnam War platoon leader of Da 5 Bloods, but Lindo and company are the same age the whole movie. It makes no sense and would it really have blown his budget to cast a few more young people to include in the flashbacks? Nobody with gray hair is running around the front lines of a war. And the whole treasure hunt was a cluster-F#@*!<br/><br/>I waited with anticipation for this film to drop being that my father is an army veteran of that era, although he luckily never had to go over there to fight.

","As a huge fan of Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman"", I was expecting big things - sadly, ""Da 5 Bloods"" is in no way; shape or form, on par with his 2018 blockbuster.<br/><br/>There are many positives to this film. The editing was smooth (transitions of aspect ratios), the archive footage spliced throughout added a layer of realism to the cause/message of the film, I loved the numerous digs at Trump/Fascism, the way the Bloods romanticised Stormin' Norman, the Hannoi Hannah segments & the films social/political commentary exploring greed & patriotism.<br/><br/>Several scenes are extremely tense & gruesome (the minefields/images of war atrocities), but once the men find their treasure the film begins to feel more like Indiana Jones (showdown at the temple & the double crossing) rather than depicting brotherhood/effects of war.<br/><br/>The redemption arc for Paul, a misguided Xenophobe with PTSD is quite touching, however, the Bloods are shown in a very masculine/aggressive light (Paul's son is the exception). As Lee refrains from giving them an ounce of vulnerability, their performances come off rather lacklustre (despite Lindo trying his dam dest).<br/><br/>Too often, the storyline goes off on tangents, the script repeats itself & the plot loses momentum. Lee overloads with too many ideas, leaving little room to explore issues such as the GI's fathering children with Vietnamese sex workers and the connection between Black-power politics & anti-imperialism. The film should have dedicated more time to actually detailing the war through the prism of black experiences, instead of simply implying it was hard.<br/><br/>The ages of the men in Nam & present day are the exact same (minus Boseman's character), TiÃªn looks 40ish (when Otis is nearing 70) his daughter looks 30+ (it's all a bit confusing).

The story line is intriguing but the character dialogue and development are both lacking severely. One of the main characters is erratic to a point where it's difficult to follow or stay interested. Delroy Lindo turns in a great performance, but his character was doomed by the writers. His constant state of back and forth personality makes it hard to develop an attachment to him as an audience member and subsequently has the same effect on the other characters. Flashbacks are frequently used throughout the movie but the interesting thing is that the director made no effort to show any of the main characters as younger versions of themselves (though the flashbacks would put them 50 years younger!). You can also anticipate just about every 'turn' the movie is going to take. The later in the movie you get the more the plot seems to just wash away. Really just a messy, confusing movie."
"Aziatik","8","91","181","12 June 2020"," A bleak Reminder Of What Memory Can Do
","Film Director Spike Lee is back in form behind the camera with another whiplash piece of Cinema. Da 5 blood explores four Black Vietnam veterans back on war soil to retrieve lost gold left by a fallen soldier played by Chadwick Boseman. In this Film, the use of flashback is what stings like a dagger forcing the viewer to ponder about how memory can be an affliction , especially in the context of War. Spike Lee sets the past in the present by having the main characters re-living war memories at their actual old age. This technique puts the emphasis on how war can be a never ending cycle even where the battlefield is absent. Fine acting also helps this movie get his point accross, but man, here, actor Delroy Lindo shines with his portrayal of a war veteran facing his demons. Different themes can be observed in this film, one element that caught my attention is the idea of how humans failed to love. Although Americans usually claim to be God fearing Christians who are buddy with The Christ, love clearly slipped off their hands by throwing themselves into war. The decision by the big wings to go to war was a decision that would mark humanity for ever. The film is well written, has a good score and a fine reminiscing use of music with a brillant use of Marvin Gaye's accapella. Spike also uses tactics of framing and re-framing which puts the viewer in sync with time and perspective.<br/><br/>If you love Cinema and respect an acute vision, do not skip this piece of Filmmaking, you will feel the love."

","Since his first true feature film She's Gotta Have It in 1986, Spike Lee has remained one of the most passionate and hard-working filmmakers in the industry, with each of his projects being born from the mind of an outspoken individual who isn't afraid to tackle issues and subject matters others would do all they could to avoid.<br/><br/>While this passion has made for some outstanding individual results and moments, Lee has also continued to be one of the most eclectic directors when its comes to quality control, with audiences unsure whether they are getting a new masterpiece or a genuine dud, such is the wide ranging variation of his projects.<br/><br/>For every Do the Right Thing, The 25th Hour or BlacKKKlansman there's an Oldboy, Miracle at St. Anna or Red Hook Summer, works of an artist that sometimes loses focus on quality control in his quest to tackle the often controversial material his bringing to life.<br/><br/>One of his most high-profile releases of the last decade, Lee's first feature since the Oscar winning success of BlacKKKlansman is his long time coming Vietnam passion project Da 5 Bloods, a well-cast Netflix production that shines a light on black service man in the Vietnam war, whilst also offering a thrilling treasure hunt plot-line with aging African American veterans returning to the battlefields of the war torn country.<br/><br/>It's an incredibly intriguing set-up and one that allows Lee to explore topical race related scenarios while also operating in one of his biggest cinematic playgrounds yet but this two and a half hour exercise is the type of let-down of a film that is littered throughout Lee's career, as his poor pacing, editing, story developments and intrusively scored effort continually disappoints throughout.<br/><br/>Loaded up with a cast full of talent with Delroy Lindo, The Wire's Clark Peters and Isiah Whitlock Jr, Jean Reno and Black Panther himself Chadwick Boseman all involved, Da 5 Bloods appears on paper to be ripe for the best type of Lee film but with a collection of mostly unlikable characters, long in the tooth scenarios and situations and an abundance of atrocious plot contrivances (hello gold discovery during a toilet break), Lee's exercise has too many flaws to overlook and more often than not feels amateurish, not the work of an Oscar winning writer.<br/><br/>It's not to say the film is bereft of good ideas or moments, there are numerous touching scenes exploring the effect of war on these man, particularly in how they returned to a country that seemed to not value their services or still continued to judge them by their skin color and some of the interplay between the experienced actors makes for both funny and heartfelt viewing but too often than not Lee is hammering his audience over the head with the films topics with all the care of a sledgehammer, instead of refining his product into a polished offering it was so desperately in need of becoming.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>A hugely disappointing effort from Lee, Da 5 Bloods may have found its share of critical acclaim but while its themes and subject matter should be commended, as a film; this Netflix release is as unpolished and unfocused as they come.<br/><br/>2 gold bars out of 5"

"kaneeddy","9","77","160","12 June 2020"," A Spike Lee Joint for the Ages
","Da 5 Bloods, feels like an awfully relevant film to release right now, providing some powerful imagery and showcasing immersive storytelling. The film has all the makings of a Spike Lee Joint from the high quality cinematography that makes use of a diverse range of film and adds something genuine to the story, as well as provide Oscar Worthy Editing that transitions through aspect ratios smoothly. Spike seems to be on a roll with making some of his most powerful films off the back of his superb Blackkklansman. The performances in the film are Oscar worthy making you feel empathetic to the cause as well as giving insight into the unfairness African Americans faced when it came to the Vietnam War, the two notable performances in this film being Delroy Lindo and Chadwick Boseman, I loved both performances and will be some of my favourites for the year, also Jonathan Majors gives a noteworthy performance as well. The writing for this film is powerful and when needed, builds tension, relationships and the conflicts the characters go through during this film. I will also say the use of real footage throughout the film is extremely powerful and adds an extra layer showing the problems that the USA has faced throughout its history right to this day.<br/><br/>If I were to pick out a flaw with this film it would have to be the score which was quite forgettable and at times didn't match the moment that was presented on film, and at times it could have a minor impact on the scene itself, which was quite disappointing as i found the Blackkklansman score to be memorable and matched the style of the film really well.<br/><br/>Overall, Da 5 Bloods is a film that is extremely relevant and powerful, showing that Spike Lee is still in great form as a director 40 years in and is maybe better than ever. The use of the Vietnam war felt appropriate and the characters felt authentic. The performances were fantastic, and most technical aspects to the film were at an Oscar Level. This is a film that everyone should try."
"Fiahm","3","138","300","12 June 2020"," Another Joyless Spike Lee Joint
","First off, let's remember once again that Spike Lee is not a good filmmaker. He's never BEEN a good filmmaker. The otherwise inexplicably boundless patience and goodwill the media and the industry have repeatedly shown his film student-level back catalogue can only be explained through a desire to be complimentary towards him simply because of his skin colour. Which is pretty demeaningly racist in itself, when you think of it. It would be lovely to have some great black filmmakers in the world (or even one) but Spike Lee is not it.<br/><br/>Lee is incapable of making compelling stories with believable, engaging characters in them, and everything wrong with his other films are just as wrong with this: 'Da 5 Bloods' is preachy, overlong, racially antagonistic, staggeringly self-indulgent and clumsily unbelievable in every way at every turn. Anytime any topic that could be considered even slightly political pops its head up, the scene stops and Lee starts sermonizing. The arrogance of Spike Lee shaming black people into voting (and thinking) how he wants does not seem that far off to me from Joe Biden telling them ""if you don't vote for me, you ain't black!""<br/><br/>But okay, enough about that.<br/><br/>The opening scenes, summing up the mood of the Vietnam War years, are powerful, if manipulative, and the use of Marvin Gaye's peerless ""Inner City Blues"" is well-used and welcome. But then the actual story begins and if it wasn't a black cast, we would all be talking about it as if it were a Chuck Norris/Steven Seagal straight-to-video turkey. The actual Vietnam flashbacks look like they came from an episode of The A-Team (with the same music).<br/><br/>Every non-black character is a prop, there to just perform a single function and then leave, with no insight into their inner thoughts, feelings, or desires. But the lead cast aren't any better: one of the guys is a Trump supporter, so he does all the bad stuff; the rest are largely interchangeable and instantly forgettable. Nothing memorable is said by anyone, and the script is third rate throughout. The best line in the whole damn movie is Jean Reno saying ""I thank you for this ignorant American one-sided version of World War Two"".<br/><br/>Even the scene where they find the gold is a catastrophe: I don't want to give any spoilers, but if you stop to think about the breathtaking unlikelihood of how it is hit upon, in the middle of hundreds of miles of jungle, it should tell you a lot about the rest of the reasoning on display in the rest of this disaster.<br/><br/>Lee has this amazing cast of black actors, who've all proven themselves unforgettable in other roles (with white filmmakers), and instead of allowing them to shine with complexity, nuance, wit and humour, he forces them to perform these dumbed-down stereotypes, fit for an 80s made-for-TV soap opera. Everything is so crass, unsubtle, haphazard and over-the-top.<br/><br/>This film could have been amazing: a profound, insightful, surprising and spellbinding take on adventure movies with a similar theme, like Three Kings or The Man Who Would Be King or Treasure of the Sierra Madre, from an all-black perspective. But to even mention those masterpieces in the same sentence as this is an insult. It's as dumb as a bag of rocks. Please stop giving this man money to make bad B-movies."

","'Da 5 Bloods (2020)' is engaging and alarming. It confronts its audience with some harsh truths and, at times, is an uncomfortable experience because of it. It's also an important experience, though, as it tangles with themes of exploitation, racism, post-traumatic stress and war with a surprising degree of nuance. Though the piece is an odd mix of black comedy, traditional action and shocking archive footage, it somehow comes together as a fictional tale that conveys quite a bit of truth. It's effective in almost all its aspects. The thing does feel long but that's principally because it's constantly unpredictable, shifting in tone and, even, genre often within the same scene. Its formalistic elements often catch you off guard, too. At times, it's truly horrifying; I mean, some of its graphic stock footage is the sort of thing you can never unsee. Its frankness is a part of its DNA, though. While it isn't necessarily a fun film, it is one worth watching. It offers a new perspective on an often misrepresented time-period. It rings true despite its fictional plot. 8/10"

"Thekeybaldemasterrises","9","46","92","14 June 2020"," Not Lee's best but still very moving and important
","Challenging, thought provoking, and downright chaotic. Spike Lee's new joint Da 5 Bloods is a wild one, and he does not hold back any punches here. What starts off as a road trip/reunion film about a group of Vietnam vets looking for the remains of their old comrade and their treasure, turns into something brutal and raw. It's a war movie, but it's a movie about humanity too. It doesn't just signify the cost of war and the effects it has on the individual, but the hate that's created from it. What I love about Lee is his insistence on making the audience a part of the film and not just the ""observer"". When he wants you to see an image he really wants you to SEE it, and boy are there a lot of haunting images in this film. I think what people have to understand is this isn't just about the black experience of the war, it's the experience of being human and the path we walk. The character of Paul is a symbol of someone who chooses to walk the path of hate and how they refuse to stop walking that path. I'm a little bummed that Lee decided to make that character a straight up Trump Supporter as I find that to be less subtle and more likely to trigger people into turning on this movie since that could ignite it into a more politcal conversation. It's like Lee gave up some of the subtle tactics to ensure the audience is receiving what he's getting at but I honestly don't think he neeed too, the dialogue and the characters are profound enough to get that message across. Showing a MAGA hat becomes a little too on the nose and I know people are just gonna trash all over this movie for that reason, but hopefully I'm wrong. This isn't Lee's best film, but it's a deep and interesting one. I love how he cuts between different aspect ratios and makes the flashback scenes look 16MM it made it feel that much more immersive. I think he could've trimmed down the first half as it's at least 20 minutes too long, but that didn't stop me from really feeling moved by what he did here. It's a hard watch, but it's a necessary watch, and it only adds to the conversation right now of the black experience I can't stress that enough. It's a disturbing, violent, and graphic film, but it needs to be seen. 9/10."

Everything he's done since Oldboy has been very bad, with the sole exception of maybe Blackkklansman which I thought was average.<br/><br/>This is his second worst film, only being outdone by the unwatchable ""Da Sweet Blood of Jesus."" (Similar titles ironically) And yet, his self-referencing that was cringe in the early 2010s is still ever-present. We get it. You're from Brooklyn, you went to Morehouse, you think Trump is the worst president ever... And yet you're still making these same points in a damn VIETNAM WAR movie without any care in the world about the quality of the story, characters, pacing, or acting. There wasn't a single redeeming quality of the movie. It was certainly the worst edited movie I've come across in awhile... I don't know what Spike Lee was thinking with the intermittent Ken Burns-style b-roll of history, but it was extremely corny and unnecessary.<br/><br/>I'm done with Spike. He's lost in his own ego at this point and a bunch of clueless liberal critics will just keep inflating it. Oldboy, Da Sweet Blood of Jesus, Red Hook Summer, Chiraq, the She's Gotta Have It series... And now Da 5 Bloods. I believe the strength of 1990s and 80s work was in his cast but either way, I'm certainly not wasting another minute with this type of cheesy nonsense.

","Vietnam war vets with PTSD plus post-war search for gold mashed with high level of politics.<br/><br/>We have seen war movies. We have seen soldiers looking for stuffs in war. This is the same with high themes & politics and comdey sprinkled around.<br/><br/>Gorgeous cinematography of Vietnam, the greenary was bursting out of my screen. The cast gets the job done but after hearing Spike Lee tried to get Samuel L Jackson, Washington Sr. & Jr. and Giancarlo Esposito, the movie could have uped its value much more for me. Delroy Lindo has already gotten oscar nom.<br/><br/>Yes the movie is a bit slow and drags in some cases but it works to set up the characters and flesh out their past. Due to it being slow it actually feels like I am there with da Bloods, going to bar, seeing new & improved Vietman. But this flow becomes inconsistent, for example when the first mine-boom bursted, everything started to rush and we were hit with multiple incidents and they happen very quickly. If the movie slowed down in those areas our emotions for those characters could have stayed much longer.<br/><br/>But man was it thrilling, that 1 2 3 scene was griping as hell. Well crafted. Speaking about crafting, the use of screen ratio for storytelling was a great idea.<br/><br/>Now politics. I love that Spike didn't tell an one sided story, even had dialogues multiple times of how Americans themsleves talk about their one-sided history. It didn't shy away from showing Vietnam's people anger & post-war situation.
Money/Gold destroys people, greed broke this group. Paul wasn't just some Maga hat wearing 1 note villain, his movitations, his guilt, anger, flaws were magnificently explored and explained. Why he choose this side and hated his son, hated site of Vietnamese were boldly explored.
Him getting mercy from Norm in his own mind was beautiful character moment.
Spike didn't shy away from gore & violence (I actually heard there was ganna be high blood-shed from critics and truth is, I was a bit disappointed for less amount of blood)<br/><br/>The movie taging everything with Black History - slavery, civil rights & BLM were connected perfectly and the theme of Black People, still getting oppressed, hits you hard multiple times. I know people with other agendas will have other things to say but I keep my agendas away from ART.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with the cast not getting de-aged for war scenes but at the end when they showed an old picture with de-aged characters it just shows the war scenes played in their head with Norm still being young and fit, and them being themselves.<br/><br/>Norm & Paul are Martin & Malcom and their views in opposite spectram where challenged and social commentary was explored perfectly.<br/><br/>Some small nitpicks, most comedy didn't land for me and it dragged a few times, didn't care about some characters. But I respect the hell out of Spike for making this film."

","First of all, this film is not ""pointless"", nor is it a waste of time. It's a film that not only pays homage to real life Black Soldiers who were used and abused during the unjust Vietnam War, but for film historians, there's a tinge of homage to the Treasure of Sierra Madre when it comes to how the plot unfolds. Furthermore, for everyone complaining that the music is misused.....you know NOTHING about the relevancy of black music in each era of American history because if you did, you'd know that not a single track used throughout the film was irrelevant to black reality in the Vietnam era. As far as the age discrepancies, fine, that's fair, but how many films have you seen in your life where age accuracy hasn't been on the money? As far as the acting is concerned, everyone did a fine job, especially Delroy Lindo. This is a quality product that deserves at least one viewing, and it's time to stop letting mainstream voices, who are not aware or sensitive to other cultures, dictate what deserves to be seen, and what doesn't. THINK FOR YOURSELF. PS, Spike Lee makes movies as love letters to his cultural base. So YES, he will incorporate historical facts, that are normally ignored by everyone else, into his love letters because that's what commemoration and celebration is all about. If you resent that style, stop watching Spike Lee movies. Are all of his films masterpieces? Maybe not. But whose are? Bottom Line....Da 5 Bloods was a respectable effort by all involved."
"Alexander_Blanchett","9","37","83","12 June 2020"," A Spike Lee Vietnam Joint
","A fantastic Spike Lee joint and his ideal view on the Vietnam war and its aftermath in some aspects. The film is in its essence a typical Spike Lee feature with many weird characters, unexpected story developments and all of that stands for something, some message he wants to provide, sometimes it is conventionally done sometimes really out of the box. This film has it all. It is still one of Lee's more conventional films but if you expect a straight forward Vietnam war drama you are in the wrong seat. This is not your Oliver Stone kind of ""anti war drama"". I loved how Lee created the characters as most of them stand for something that is not going too well in our world these days, and others stand for something more positive. Acting wise it was good. Delroy Lindo is great in the most central role of the film. And so is Clark Peters who is definitely one of the stand outs and the character you can root most for. A very important supporting role is filled by Chadwick Boseman who perfectly fits into the environment of a Spike Lee film and I hope they will collaborate more often in the future. Also Jean Reno has his moments, even if his character is rather unlikeable. The technical aspects of the film are more great, fantastic cinematography, wonderful editing and awesome score.
The creative decision to use the same actors in the flashbacks as in present is ambitious and something you have to get used to but in the end it makes sense, and works, even without digital de-aging.
A film that couldn't be more relevant for these days and a film I expect to go places."

","Then again, this isn't one of Spike Lee's most serious films, or at least it's one of his less angry films. For all its relevant commentary on racism, this is primarily an adventure film, and a damn good one at that. It is also a great tribute to all black soilders who fought in the Vietnam war. It's a story about unity, which I think it's something we could all use right now.<br/><br/>It's full of references to classic movies, some more effective than others.
It's perhaps a bit too similar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Many of its story beats are lifted directly from that film (of course they recreate the ""stinking badges"" scene), so having seen that movie did remove a lot of the tension, and made the latter parts of the second half somewhat predictable.<br/><br/>That landmine scene however is one of the tensest movie scenes I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>Also, I love how no other movie could possibly get away with having the villain straight up wearing a MAGA hat during a shootout. It would be painfully unsubtle if it wasn't such a hilarious visual."

The music and the cinematography is very good and the shots in Vietnam forest was very good. The performances of the whole cast was top notch and some deserves Oscar recognition.

Gaining friendships in such a predicament knowing they could die at any moment is harder. This is a psychological thriller.

","Gotta admit that I found the archival footage and some preachy dialogue to be very distracting and off-putting for most of the first hour of the movie. Regardless, Da 5 Bloods is, like many other Spike Lee's joints, a helluva powerful movie. Unlike what I've seen by Spike Lee though, this one is truly thought-provoking because it really has a multi-layered narrative that explores a plethora of ideas on a superficial level and also on a substantive one. Plus, this is quite possibly the only movie about Vietnam war that's actually insightful and informative. So, this is quite something, I guess. I really admired that Spike Lee doesn't shy away from revealing uncomfortable truths about the Vietnam war almost as much as he doesn't shy away from showing sudden, and shocking, outbursts of violence and blood. Using variety of aspect ratios and colour correcting techniques were also truly impressive. And oh, the editing, just masterful! What is most astounding to consider about this effort, though, is how brilliantly it is disguised as an adventure film. I mean, this is as entertaining and smart as a decent adventure film can get. So, you don't really have any right to find its two-and-half hour runtime daunting. Last but not least, Delroy Lindo definitely deserves an Oscar for his performance here. His character, Paul, is the type of protagonists that attribute to the story and its messages on almost every level, and Lindo really couldn't have done it more justice.<br/><br/>(7.5/10)"

","Let me first start off by saying that this movie has an amazing soundtrack. It takes songs that are very relevant to the topic of war, PTSD, and racism. The cinematography is also pretty good. There is definitely a style to this movie. Some parts of the movie are shot to look like it was actually footage of the Vietnam War. There are some moments of the movie that came out of nowhere and completely took me by surprise, and other moments had me on the edge of my seat. There are some very funny scenes too. But there are also scenes that make you question if you really want to watch the rest of the movie. For example, there is footage and images of actual deaths and dead bodies, one of which take place within the first 10 minutes of the movie. This can be very disturbing to some people, including me, as it took me by surprise. But past all that, there is a lot of good history in this movie too. One scene they talked about a kid who jumped on a grenade to save his friends, and they show a picture of him and tell you his name. The acting is fairly decent. Delroy Lindo did an amazing job. Fantastic acting on all accounts by him. The dialogue on the other hand, is sub - par. Many lines are badly delivered and cringey. Another thing is the run time of a little over 2 hours and 30 minutes. It is a long movie, and slow at some points. Then there is the political messages and other things trying to be pushed, but this is not very prominent and can be ignored. One thing that cannot be ignored and is actually a good thing is paying homage to the black soldiers that fought in the Vietnam War. All in all, I would say it is a good movie if you are sitting down and we in the mood to watch a movie."

","I actually expected a lot more here and especially after Blackkklansman. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I do not deny that it needs such films, what he wants to show is absolutely necessary, especially now. But unfortunately you notice at all parts of the movie that it is a Netflix movie and I try to overlook something like that, but it was too much that shows that you had no time for it or also no desire.
Everything you should learn from it and what is also historically deposited, are things you need to know. These things are the strongest parts in the movie, and they make me so benevolent with my rating. Unfortunately, a lot of potential was given away here. Since I prefer now again ""Dead Presidents"" who points to the same historical injustice, only much smarter."
"Anudeepsambaraju","7","7","12","16 June 2020"," Good movie could've been greater with editing..
","Pros:<br/><br/>Da 5 Bloods, shows the history of the Vietnam war through the eyes of four black people who fought for the USA which is uncongenial to them. Coincidentally, this movie so much relevant to what's happening now, it shows after nearly 5 decades, there is so much that didn't change for black people in America. Da 5 blood also has decent characters with different ideologies and how they changed since the war. As like Every Spike Lee movie, Da 5 Bloods, Daringly talks about different social issues, political conversation.<br/><br/>Spike lee choice to show real footage of a massacre of innocent Vietnamese people, the oppression of black people, Martin Luther's speech, so many real events relating to the issues of America is impactful and powerful. The changing aspect ratio for different acts is cleaver. Movie is 2hr 30min, with Spike Lee's amazing, captivating direction it doesn't seem long to me. The film changes pace in the second hour where the characters start the journey into the forest to find treasure, where it gets intense, emotional, violet, and spike lee brilliantly captured it all. The references to Apocalypse Now (1979) Movie and Marvin Gaye tracks are quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>The notable performance by Delroy Lindo is observing. He's struggling with PTSD and emotional performance is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>First, I love social messages in movies, but forcefully inserting many, without actually serving any purpose to the main story, seemed muddled and messy sometimes confusing, what's the movie about.<br/><br/>The same actors played in the present play their younger self 50 years ago, Without any visual effects, prosthetics why??<br/><br/>The background score doesn't sink with scenes, it felt like the orchestra team given the music without knowing the tone, emotion of the scene. And the worst part, for some scenes, B.G.M dominates the dialogue.<br/><br/>It's certainly not the beast spike lee movie, but still a good movie.

","Even if Spike Lee's unapologetically political style of filmmaking is not your cup of tea, his new film about four Vietnam veterans returning to their old battleground in search of gold that they came across on the tour of duty might be worth viewing. They are also intent on recovering the remains of their fierce commanding officer who motivated and inspired them. The story is spiked with powerful performances all around (led by an explosive Delroy Lindo) and laced with viscerally taut action sequences and a sterling soundtrack.<br/><br/>The timeliness of the film's message couldn't be better. The rage over how black America bore a disproportionate human cost in fighting the war in Vietnam, while at the same time African-Americans struggled to reach anything approaching societal and legal equality back home is balanced by a pained but ironclad belief in the undying honor of military service and loyalty to one's country. The film also has a ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" feel when it tackles themes of friendship, family and hunting for gold.<br/><br/>Although not always smooth, with an occasional narrative drift and a late undisciplined lapse into preachiness, the film has an awful lot to say about the overlap between United States foreign policy missteps and social injustice at home. Not all the main characters are given a solid introduction and backstory, but their group dynamic becomes quite clear. The actual war experience for these men is never conveyed in-depth, except in occasional flashbacks. Despite these flaws, this film has many suspenseful, poignant and hard-hitting moments. You will barely notice the running time. It's a punch in the gut, as it touches on several unpleasant truths about American history and goes down as one of Spike Lee's more challenging films. Recommended to those who are open-minded."

","In a time of turmoil and injustice, comes a very welcome freshly rolled Spike Lee joint, and man, it's got all kinds of strains in it. ""Da 5 Bloods"" is a huge canvas colored so richly it's almost hard to take it all in at once, painted by Spike Lee with his stylistic bravura and extraordinary cinematic shifts. It's not a flawless movie, but it is a beautiful one in its own right, a history lesson, a statement, an exploration and an amazing entry in the Vietnam War film canon.<br/><br/>We follow Paul, Otis, Eddie and Melvin, four African-American Vietnam war vets, who return to Vietnam in the modern day, seeking the remains of their fallen Squad Leader Stormin' Norman and the box of gold they buried together - return to a new (and same) war as they meet in battle with both man and nature.<br/><br/>Spike Lee sparks it up with a short documentarian intro, a substantial history lesson that'll continue throughout the film, about the Vietnam war, the race war in USA, about the social injustices, hurts and consequences in both places of the world. In the first act we get acquainted with the bloods as they land in Vietnam and prepare for the journey - this is where most of comedy is present, giving an impression that the movie, its both playful and raggedy, experienced characters, and issues and history at exploration will be presented in a warmer light. Little did one expect, the tonal shifts, like its story-telling and aesthetical style, is off the charts. And that's something I really loved about this film. During all acts, flashbacks from the actual Vietnam war are frequent, telling the story about da 5 bloods, completed with Stormin' Norman, shot on film, real old-school style. The second act is the most adventurous one, marking the bloods return to the jungle, positively adventurous, until it's not... Not only there are shifts in genre, but also in the morality of the film, which is indeed one of its points. The broad story Lee tells is infused with various cultural legacies, historical points of view, morales and emotions, and under the mass of themes, the focus on the main characters does not flicker one bit. The summary is perhaps a little inconsistent, lacking a tightly weaved plot and sometimes feeling more episodic than not, but it is also compelling, highly ambitious and profound. This guy dropped a tear or two.<br/><br/>What needs to be talked about are the performances, the whole cast does a great and admirable job, with the favorites undoubtedly being the five pivotal characters. But if there is a spotlight, I believe it's not up to much debate who it belongs to. I hope there is critical acclaim and awards coming to Delroy Lindo, who plays the movie's most complicated, conflicted and hurting character, and does so devotedly, inspiring awe. Under Spike Lee's direction, the veteran actor delivers an absolute knockout performance, worthy of remembrance. One of my absolute favorites of 2020 so far.<br/><br/>The visual side of things here are also every bit as amazing, though I can see how the sum of this can land on somebody's not so great part of critique. Throughout the 190 minutes, ""Da 5 Bloods"" go through at least 4 different aspect ratios, three different cinematography styles and a subtle documentarian touch all throughout. The sauce of all this is, in my humble opinion, chaotic in a good sense, well drawn together regardless of the choice of brush. It is likely that it adds an important dynamic for such a long movie. ""Da 5 Bloods"", when it gets down and dirty, is also explicitly violent and doesn't shy away from appearing realistic in terms of action. I was initially quite concerned about the runtime, but it proved to be well worth it, and the slower parts in fact belong to the first act, which I've always believed is better than to keep the milder, less engaging or intense bits for the second half.<br/><br/>""Da 5 Bloods"" is an important, socially and politically conscious and accomplished message, an exercise in telling parts of history that many are blind to - to this day. Additionally, it's a fiery movie that's equal parts entertaining and compelling. Regardless of what Your thoughts on Spike Lee might be, he has creativity and cool ideas stuffed in all of his pockets, a sound mind and heart in the right place. My rating: 8/10."

","Say hello to Spike Lee's worst ever film .<br/><br/>It's not only his worst film by a long , long way, it's an absolute Turkey in my opinion.<br/><br/>I totally get the underlying sentiment of the film. How a disproportionate amount of young black men were sent to Vietnam to fight for a county that treated them so badly ( and still does) but make it a film about that and don't wrap it up in an awful film about retrieving gold and fighting the locals and each other .<br/><br/>I'm not exaggerating when I say that at least an hour could have been cut from the film . When they found Storming Norman , I would have been quite happy if it would have ended there . In fact i would have doubled my score if it had but no , we get an extra hour of complete nonsense.<br/><br/>All the major studios turned this film down and it was only Netflix that picked it up . You can see why .
It's an incredibly lazy film .
The flashbacks look great with the grainy 16mm film but why on earth didn't they use younger actors ? It looks ridiculous with four pensioners fighting alongside Chadwick Boseman . They couldn't even be bothered to get rid of the grey beards !<br/><br/>Another problem I have is the horrendous soundtrack that overpowers the dialogue . It's like the backing music that should be on an epic like Laurence Of Arabia or blockbuster like Indiana Jones . It feels so out of place .<br/><br/>If it's a social commentary on the black history of Vietnam you want then you get get a bit of that but for the most it's about a group of so called friends who do nothing but argue with each other for two and a half hours . It gave me a head ache ."

","Bold storytelling, like in most Spike Lee joints, but 'Da 5 Bloods' goes off the rail about halfway through when the stories become disjointed and a bit unfocused.

Or that it's forcing us a black agenda. Or that this movie is made to put white people in a bad spotlight. Or that veterans suffering from PTSD wouldn't act this way in a million years. Or that it's a bad war movie. Or that it didn't have a message. There was even a review that said that this movie was made to disgrace Trump. Like wtf...<br/><br/>Every director has it's own style. Look at Nolan or Tarantino. And this movie shows us the style of Spike Lee.<br/><br/>This movie isn't forcing us a black agenda. It shows us the perspective of black men going on a journey.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't put white people in a bad spotlight. It showed us the treatment of white people (not all white people) and how it affected the Bloods. Some people are blind to see that this was normal back in the day, to treat black men like they were worthless.<br/><br/>Veterans suffering from PTSD experience it different than another. I know this to be fact because I know a lot of vets suffering from this (volunteerd to help & support veterans).<br/><br/>Just because this movie has war elements in it doesn't mean that it's a war movie. This movie is about something else.<br/><br/>Not every movie is made with the purpose to share their message. And some movies you just don't realize the message because you can't relate.<br/><br/>And also the movie didn't disgrace Trump in any way. Ok they said he was a bad president, but that was the opinions from the characters in a conversation, if you have ever been in a conversation you know that not everybody has the same opinion. But lets be honest the movie didn't need to put dirt on Trump's name, he does that himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Overall a great movie. Don't let the salty people influence you of not watching this movie. At the end of the day it's your opinion that matters. And my opinion matters too, so go watch it."

"morefaster","2","12","26","13 June 2020"," Black lives matter so this movie must be important
","I watched Da5Bloods based soley on the accolades it's received from a few major publications, and while I appreciate the relevancy it holds to the current racial climate, I don't think it's very cool to laud a bad movie just because of said relevancy. If this movie had a white director at the helm, with a white cast, it would have been panned and forgotten. It's just that bad.<br/><br/>Other reviews will go into details on the inconsistencies and errors within the film, but all that stuff aside, what I found most unnerving is that these major publications blatantly discarded any attempt at an honest critique, just to conciliate a particular demographic, i.e. black people! So not only are we scared to admit that Da5Bloods is a gargantuan trainwreck of a film, but we'll ignore all faults altogether, just to avoid any uneasy racial turbulence. Sure, why not. Who cares.<br/><br/>So yeah, IMO most of Spike Lee's movies suck, and Da5Bloods is no exception. It's sloppy, poorly written, derivative, and badly executed. Not much more to say. If you're looking for a good American war-time gold heist film, Kellys Heroes or 3Kings are much better movies.<br/><br/>If you want to watch an artful and challenging film by a black filmmaker, then Steve Mcqueen is your guy. He's a vastly superior storyteller in every way."
"lacatusalexandru","10","21","51","12 June 2020"," Da 5 Bloods-One of the best Vietnam stories
","Spike Lee did it again,he released another masterpiece from his Joint Collection and he again succeeded just like he did with his previous film BlackKKlansman to release his movie in a perfect time with what's happening in the present.
If ""BlackKKlansman"" explored the idea of what will happen to America if a racist yet powerful guy like David Duke or even worst Donald Trump would become the president of U.S.A,""Da 5 Bloods"" explored the theme/idea of not only the worst treatment the Black G.I. got during and after The Vietnam War but also the aftermath of Donald Trump's elections as the president of the U.S.A. and the riots whose people fight for the same rights the people from Black Power and Black Panther fought during the riots that happend in The Vietnam War.
I guess,you could say that in a way,""Da 5 Bloods"" could serve as a sequel or a spin-off to Spike Lee previous joint BlackKKlansman.
I really hope that this time,expecially with what's happening in America with the rights of all the black people,at The Oscars Spike Lee would get much more graditude for the work he has done and also some rewards to praise amazing movies such as his movie Da 5 Bloods.
In the end I advise you to watch Spike Lee latest film Da 5 Bloods because it is a great piece of history not only about America as a country but also the history of black people struggling to live in an America divided by racism and hate."

The character development was erratic at times and other times went about in crazy leaps and bounds. The plot was loopy in some areas.

Overall me and my family did not enjoy it and we are avid movie fans of all genres. This movie was just a big a$$ stretch, it really couldve done with more editing.

"dixi-d","2","5","9","16 June 2020"," Spike's Litmus Test??
","I'm a bit perplexed on how this movie even got made. Seriously, its pretty bad and not of Lee's caliber. Accordingly, it reminds me Stephen King and his ""Richard Bachman"" books from the late 70s and early 80s.
As it went, King created the ficticious author Bachman to see if his continued success was driven by his growing fame, or was the success authenticly based on his skill. King wrote several titles as Bachman, many which sold fairly well, including popular titles like Thinner and the Running Man.
With Spike Lee, if also wanting to do such a test to see if his continued market success is due actual talent or simply just his fame, then he obviously couldn't use a fictious name credit (it would leak since too many people are involed in a movie, unlike a book), so the next best thing would be to make the absolute worst movie possible that his producers would allow. Then, if this trainwreck movie was deemed a dud then it would be no suprise and he'd maybe feel that he should believe that the reviews of his other movies were at least honest. But if the trainwreck recieved sweeping acclaim by the mainstream reviewers, then it'd be obvious his ""success"" was probably based merely on his fame (or in the current climate, based on fear of racial backlash?),
So I hope for Lee, in a way, that this movie was his ""test"" (even though, judging from all the excellent reviews, he failed). Because if this wasn't a test, and this trainwreck of a Vietnam movie truely was the best that Lee could manage, then I really feel sorry for him."

The strangest thing thing and very distracting for me were the flashbacks and how they used the same actors with no attempt to make them look any younger.

As for production design and setting, it's rather cheap. Da 5 Bloods was made for Netflix and it shows. Not much care went into this film.

I know MOST of the areas in Asia where the film was shot, been there, seen them, even live near a few of them, but the way its shot is just awful. The real locations without Spike Lee filming them are far more beautiful, -- Lee either doesn't have the talent to know how to shoot the scene, or he made these areas look awful by choice. I'm surprised the locals on this movie allowed themselves to be used -- but it was extremely likely that they had NO idea who this man is and didn't care -- it was a ""Netflix"" movie so they jumped on it. Some of these scenes look like bad sets populated with bad actors, yet I know these areas where he shot and somehow he made a the real places look like Steven Seagal ran out of money during filming of ""Untitled Movie #129"".

The performances are passable, but the story is both unbelievable and predictable, while the script is dreadful. Really poor.<br/><br/>To begin with swearing does not both me much, but it did here because it seems that all of the characters only knew one swear word, and used it in every other damn sentance.

Damn it, if this was a white director I'd be accusing them of racism.

"LansTaylor","7","5","10","17 June 2020"," What an appropriate movie for this political climate
","Spike Lee could not have released this film at a more appropriate time given the protest that's currently happening.
If the Oscars were happening this year I would put my money on Delroy Lindo winning the best actor award. He was amazing in this and his acting and Spike Lee's direction was so good. Especially the scene when he goes off on his own in the jungle and was talking to himself.
What a rollercoaster this was. From the beginning they are all hugging and having fun at the club but it gets more and more grim from there.
My favorite scene was when they were on the boat going past all the shops and Paul gets offered a chicken. The tension was insane and the series of emotions that Paul and the seller goes through was intense. Paul went from simply saying ""no"" to saying racial slur to crying and admitting that he's been seeing ghost to getting everyone together.
I didn't really like how predictable some of the scenes were. When they introduced Hedy, I knew that the land mines were going to come up later down the road. Speaking of that, Eddies death was so expected; when they showed a wide shot to Eddie walking backwards away from the group, I 100% knew he was going to blow up. At the same time, I didn't expect Spike to show us the aftermath of the land mine explosion.
I love the fact that Spike Lee didn't use deaging in the flash back scenes. I feel that having the present day Blood in the flash back was a great use of how memory works; you always picture you current self in old memories. Also, because Norman died, they all never got to see him grow old so he is always young to them.
The scene that got me feeling emotional was when Paul sees Stormin' Norman's ghost one last time and Norman tells Paul that his death was an accident, it wasn't Paul's fault and he forgives him.
All in all, another great film by Spike Lee and the timing could not be more perfect for it's release. The ending with the gold being donated to great causes like children disabilities and Black Lives Matter was very sweet."
"zanderdoring","9","5","10","16 June 2020"," Spike Lee Excellence
","""Da 5 Bloods"" is a movie that has recently come out on Netflix and it is one of, if not, my favorite film of the year. Spike Lee crushed it with his most recent directed project; his choice of stylization, his handling of the story and characters, his implementation of his chosen message - all are used with spectacular results, and I couldn't envision a better way to execute these aspects. Acting is impeccable in this film, especially from Delroy Lindo; every character depicted feels like their own, distinct person, and could have carried the movie on their own. With an amazing latter finale, the first half hour is a bit heavy on exposition; however, that could be excused given that it makes the audience more attached with the main four characters who are portrayed as Black Vietnam War veterans who have been rejected by society. Ultimately for these reasons, I give this movie a 9/10 and an A- grade."
"elicornell-89188","8","5","10","16 June 2020"," Surprisingly stunning and unique. Disappointed in the end though.
","I hesitated watching a movie from Spike Lee, but the subject matter was an interest to me. The storyline was deep, impactful, and fluid. The cast was solid, but spattered along way were plenty of racially charged cheap shots costing me to respect the work as a whole. Then again spike lee has made his career creating racially charged cinema so should I have been surprised by his continued racial gaffs and cheap shot propaganda. Within the movie Trump is called a klansman, and George Washington is noted to have owned 123 slaves. Poor Spike, lest he forget the Moore's invasion of Italy and the pillage, plundering, and rape of its people. All races within humanity have done wrong to another race somewhere along the line. It's unfortunate that Spike Lee couldn't tell the story without racially inciting and continuing to heat and drive the divide.
Still in the end minus the incendiary racial provocations. When it's finished I found myself loving the story of this band of bothers brought together because of a common bond and interest."
"hedin_88","1","6","13","14 June 2020"," This is not a Spike Lee joint.
","On the heels of his previous film BlackKklansman that came out when it was indeed relevant, Spike Lee tries again, and fails miserably. The movie opens up at a hotel reception in Vietnam and some very bad dialogue that's too on the nose and practically gives the viewer a list of things that are of relevance without ever contributing something meaningful or intriguing the viewer as to why these men are relevant and whats to discover. In the next scene the characters are at a bar, dancing, (or rather just going through a crowd like they know everyone) and then sit at a table here again their discussions are perhaps relevant, but badly executed and without offering anything of interest to even better know and understand the characters, let alone to contribute to the entire film. Their personalities are relegated to their political views which are expressed so forcefully, it would be absurdist if it wasn't just bad writing.
In a short flashback we see whats the point of all this. Some gold and obviously, a dead body, a fallen brother. What throws the movie off its course is mostly the age of the soldiers. They are depicted appropriately as older in our timeline and the same age in the Vietnam timeline. There is no effort to relate them to one another, just put them in both scenes, its going to make it easier, nobody will notice and move on. When movies are so condescending to its viewer it produces a mode that throws you off the story. Coupled with the one character meeting a Vietnamese woman who was a prostitute and now shes a well off lady with a daughter, whose father is the soldier and who never know of his now 30 y.o. child. And two scenes are given to this, which bared so much weight on the character but remained undeveloped (if you're by now capable of calculating the age differences here.
The scenes from Vietnam are shot in the aspect ratio we all know from Vietnam footage and it sort of adds to the atmosphere of another timeline, but the way these scenes are filmed is so poor, its almost laughable. Spike Lee should have known that action sequences are something else. No direction, no orientation, who is who is where is irrelevant. Again, it borders with the absurd, reminiscing about Classical Vietnam movies which depicted whites in the same battle and even poses and dramatic deaths which bare no weight considering what happens.
They find the gold, a symbol of power for one and of freedom for the other. As the story progresses one of these four veterans steps on a mine because he delivers a pointless speech that started from a meaningless argument. He walks backwards as he speaks, the camera anticipates a sudden moment, making us anticipate it and in the anticipation the message is lost and the scene where one of the soldiers is killed by a mine in a horrible fashion remains uneventful. Spike Lee fails continuously as a director of action sequences and he fails in anticipation building as well. Then the son of one of the guys steps on a mine and remains standing not to activate it. Some guys that deactivate mines just happen to be i the same region and they cant help them. Did I mention they work with mines? (turns out they barely have any weight int he story, not as a love interest or a way to propel the plot). They tie a rope around the kid standing on the mine and pull it, and he survives, because they pulled him away before the mine exploded. Did i mention there is no point or explanation as to why the kid is there and what kind of relationship he has with his father, a Vietnam war veteran who later gets killed too.
The movie is on on hand a miserable buddy comedy, trying to paint these men as fun guys. Their political opinions are given, never elaborated on. At no point does the film utilize film as a medium, as Spike Lee has done many times before. At no point does the film leave food for thought. It is a poor execution of a hastily written film. The only reason this movie was made was to be as timely relevant as Blackkklansman, which it would have been if it was not written in a day and made the week after. Someone should have looked at the script.
Its a missed shot because it is so bluntly served its almost insulting to the intelligence of the viewer considering its timeliness. In time the films rating will drop as people re watch it and those who actually disliked it can say so. Spike Lee, do not stop making movies. Let film do the commenting."
"Jimmycakes","6","8","19","13 June 2020"," Slow start and very preachy but it grew on me
","I'm expecting to be preached to since it's Spike Lee but wasn't prepared in the bluntness of the messaging, I almost felt like I was being told I'm too stupid to know that African people have achieved things. Despite that it does work but it sets the tone of the film early on and gives it a comedic/less serious vibe and since I was expecting something deeper and more centered around the conflict perhaps it disappointed me in that respect. Once I got in to the rhythm of the movie I could accept it for what it is.<br/><br/>Overall I think it's a missed opportunity to show a deeper Vietnam war story and get the audience to understand further about what it was like to be an African-American in Vietnam during the 1960s. The action scenes are very comedic and Hollywood-esqe so there's no tension there. Chadwick Boseman is excellent and I wanted to see more of him, but his role is very much a cameo, I reckon if the movie had been more serious the audience could have really related and felt for that character. Delroy Lindo is incredible in this too, but again I wanted to see more of the two character's relationships that formed during the war to really feel and understand them. I had hoped the search for gold would be a sub plot to bring the veterans back to Vietnam but actually it's the focus of the movie with Vietnam as a sideshow/after thought.<br/><br/>The artwork, soundtrack, and message of the film makes me yearn for what could have been, a deep look in to the Vietnam war by a director that can tell these types of stories in a hard hitting way but it came across almost as a comedy with serious bits thrown in that I can't make sense of.<br/><br/>I don't agree with the ""black lives matter"" sloganeering at the end of the film either, I think if other races did that it would be unacceptable and it also places Africans in the predisposition of victim hood, of being in chains from the very start no matter what they do or who they are, of never shaking off their past and it enables other races to start their own similar groups. The movie also paints the picture, and many will believe this to be true as a result, of African-Americans being used as cannon fodder in Vietnam when in reality it was a class-based prejudice, a lot of poor white people died in that war at no choice of their own and just because they have the same skin complexion as the people running the war that doesn't make them the same people, they probably had more in common with the African-American they were dying beside."

","I thought the story had promise but wondered how they were going to pull off a story split between 1968 and 2019 (over 50 years). Not well is the answer.
The group should have been a minimum of 70 plus. They all looked early 60s (the actor indeed were). And they used the same actors for their counterparts from 1968, white hair, beards and all. It looked weird. The Vietnamese girlfriend looked 40 (actually the actress was a very youthful 62) plus their daughter should have been mid 50's played by a 39yo actress. It just kept throwing me out of the story.<br/><br/>Then flashing pictures from various historic moments made the story disjointed and they felt like fillers. It was badly written, directed and acted.

How much we have been through since the 16th Century in America. The wars we have fought in both abroad and here in our (forcibly) adopted country.
The script is terrible. The story Lee is trying to tell is one that needs to be told, but I was extremely disappointed how Lee told it. He mixes in history, attempts at drama and comedy, and a really nice soundtrack and the result is a very disappointing film. Lee preaches too much.

"view_and_review","7","4","8","20 June 2020"," Brace Yourself
","Vietnam War movies were really popular in the 80's. I think we were far enough removed from the War to talk about it, yet not too far removed where it was no longer relevant. Many of the vets were still relatively young in the 80's so it made sense to tell their story at that time.<br/><br/>We are now roughly 50 years removed from the Vietnam War and Spike Lee is revisiting it in his movie ""Da 5 Bloods."" The majority of the movie takes place in present day Vietnam, but there are some scenes from the Vietnam War and five Black American men who fought there. Spike Lee also threw in some actual footage and I don't think there are warnings strong enough to prepare you for some of the ""grisly"" footage that he added in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie follows Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), Melvin (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), and David (Jonathan Majors), with the first four being fellow soldiers and David being the son of Paul. They formed an unbreakable bond while serving in Vietnam as I'm sure many soldiers formed. Though they lost one of their fellow soldiers named Stormin Norman (Chadwick Boseman), they all reunited decades later to visit Vietnam one last time. Though it wasn't for nostalgic reasons, it was for some hidden gold.<br/><br/>Now, so many years removed from the war, the effects of the war upon them are more evident--and it seems that it affected some more than others. Like any Spike Lee movie, it is charged with poignant messages about race and the wide spectrum of beliefs and characteristics of Black Americans. This movie will require a strong constitution to deal with both: racial matters as well as bloody violence. War movies aren't for everyone, and Spike Lee isn't for everyone, so if you know what to expect from both, then I think you will enjoy this movie."

","Over the years, I have become a fan of Spike Lee. I think he has a singular vision as a filmmaker with his films putting a spotlight on the black experience and the prejudices and injustices that prevail.<br/><br/>DA 5 BLOODS - Lee's Vietnam War movie - is no exception.<br/><br/>Set in present(ish) day and in the memories of the main characters from their time ""in country"", DA 5 BLOODS tells the tale of 4 Vietnam Veterans who return to find the body of their squadron leader - and the gold that they buried under his body.<br/><br/>Part Vietnam war flick, part gold heist (and the cost of this theft on the hearts and minds of the participants) and part reflection on the treatment of the black soldiers, Lee reaches high to combine 3 separate - and complex - films into one (any one of which could have been a film of their own) and it is here that this films succeeds - and fails. For this film is at moments riveting, at moments unflinching and hard to watch, at moments confusing and at moments...surprisingly... dull. Spike had a lot of movie to tell and he took 2 and a 1/2 hours to tell it. He would have been better suited to cut some of this down to a more palatable 2-ish hour length. The film bogs down on itself at times.<br/><br/>But when it crackles - it crackles. Especially when the 4 veteran soldiers interact with each other. Led by the great Delroy Lindo (TV's THE GOOD FIGHT). I hope that this film gets a theatrical release sometime (to make it eligible for the Oscars) for Lindo's portrayal of MAGA Hat wearing, PTSD suffering Paul is powerful and captivating. I was riveted by his performance and I was willing to follow him to the ends of the Earth. Also standing out is Clarke Peters as Otis - the heart and soul of this group and Norm Lewis, the pigeon-toed Eddie who has a secret that he is hiding. Both of these characters shine at moments - but are not in the spotlight nearly often enough. The same can be said for Isaih Whitlock Jr as Melvin, a character that is undeserved until the end and by then I felt myself wanting more of him. (Side Note: Lee named these characters after members of THE TEMPTATIONS).<br/><br/>Lee makes an interesting choice in the flashback scenes of the war. Instead of casting younger actors or spending the $$ on ""de-aging"" the actors (Lee would say that the de-aging was ""cost prohibitive""), Lee chooses to have these old guys just play their younger versions of themselves just as they are now, claiming that these are not flashbacks, but ""memories"" of these soldiers - and I gotta admit that this tactic works very, very well - especially when these 4 older gentlemen are in the Vietnam War scenes with their Platoon Leader played, charismatically, by the much younger Chadwick Boseman. His character is killed in action and since these scenes are memories, it works well that he is younger (he never got a chance to grow old) while all the others are older. Boseman has a an attraction to him that helps the audience buy into the fact that all these years later these 4 men still hold him front and center in their memories. Unfortunately, the combat scenes looks to me like they were done on a shoe-string budget, so Lee has to use ""tricks"" to pull these scenes off and these tricks bring these scenes down a peg.<br/><br/>As I've stated, this film is really 3 films in one and the effects of the gold on the men is the most interesting part of this film for me, it touches on the desires of the human soul and brings some of the strongest acting and emotions.<br/><br/>This being a Spike Lee joint, this film is peppered with scenes from the black experience - from Martin Luther KIng to Malcom X to ""Hanoi Hannah"" telling the black troops that their country is abandoning them. These are important events in the lives and psyche of these men (and African Americans) and Mr. Lee is uniquely positioned to bring the attention of the public to these events, and he does it well.<br/><br/>DA 5 BLOODS in now streaming on Netflix.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","Da 5 Bloods was directed and written by Spike Lee, the man who brought us BlacKkKlansman back in 2018 and won his Oscar for best adapted screenplay. This movie tells the story about this group of four friends who set off on a journey to find the remains of their fallen brother back in Vietnam, and also to gather up the gold they promised each other they would come back for when the war was over. I never usually have to squint my eyes when I'm watching a suspenseful movie, but after one particular scene in the film I had to squint when ever i thought something bad was gonna go down. there were shocking scenes in this film that just honestly scared me, because, you never know when you're going to die, just one little miss step and its all over. I wouldn't be surprised if this film was nominated for best screenplay at the Oscars, let alone Delroy Lindos amazing performance. The script was amazingly executed, i was wondering why the film was a bit lengthy, but after watching it, it didn't feel nearly as long as it was. This film definitely isn't for the feint of heart because at the beginning, it shows clips from real life events from Vietnam, and near the end a really graphic picture of an infant. I do recommend this movie to watch."

"pal05052003","8","2","3","30 June 2020"," A unique and unconventional movie that full provides whole spectrum of emotions from suspense, humor, tragedy, to feeling good.
","Da 5 Bloods is hard to define by its genre but what stands out are the performances of Delroy Lindo and Chadwick Boseman, and that is compared to many great performances. I like how Spike Lee shows contributions of black soldiers in the Vietnam war, and how the Vietnam war is referred as the American War in the movie. Being a Cambodian, that is what we call it too. It also helps that Lee is able to show the different dimensions of the war, and how different sides view the war. He does this through the characters' speech. Though it seems unsubtle, it is seems real. I think he put a real effort to showcase famous black people by showing a black and white footage or newspaper picture of that person after any mention of them. For me, I actually liked that because I get to see more outstanding black individuals besides Martin Luther King , and Malcolm X. It may hurt the story but provides an interesting movie experience.
The movie begins as a story of elderly people meeting up and confronting there demons in Vietnam. The only person who never really healed and keeps getting worse is Delroy Lindo's character. Then it goes to thriller mode when tension boils after finding the gold. There are seemingly 4 wall breaking moments. Despite the unconventional approach, Delroy Lindo carries the movie perfectly. He is a troubled person, and despite his actions, we root and sympathize with him till the end. Chadwick Boseman, who plays the leader of the titular Bloods, Norman is very charismatic and charming. You really believe he could command the full faith of his squad. His death is as devastating to me as it is to the characters, and this takes a great actor to do that.
In the end, Da 5 Bloods is an unconventional movie that hops genres and provides a full range of emotions from thrills, humor, high octane action, sadness, and good feelings. It is a truly unique movie to enjoy."

That being said, don't expect a film well done as his other films such as Black KkKlansman.<br/><br/>Good:
<ul><li>Underlying messages. Spike has always been political and shoves it in your face. In this movie, I think it was well executed, especially with scene cuts to historical visuals and such.</li><li>Music. I loved the use of the musical scores in the film. Especially utilizing modified songs to fit certain scenes and emotions.</li><li>Themes/Topics. This could go under underlying messages, but oh well. I believe that Spike brought up topics that need more light shed upon them. Again, how he displayed these topics and issues was well done.</li><li>Visuals: It's not going to be lauded for its cinematography, but I did find that some of the frames to be well shot and the use of warm/cold tones was fairly well done. I especially appreciated the change in aspect ratio when cutting between flashbacks and present day.</li></ul><br/><br/>Bad:
<ul><li>Continuity: Every movie will have issues with this but certain aspects really irritated me. Chiefly, using the same cast to portray the characters during present day and Vietnam era. Ages don't line up. This may have been an after thought but it's disappointing as it is so glaring that it draws attention away from the better points of the film.</li><li>Dialogue: I did enjoy the cast and they did very well with what they were given. That being said, I think whoever wrote the script did it in piecemeal, and many times I found the dialogue to be iffy and not well done.</li></ul>-Plot: Just like the dialogue, I found this to be an issue. Spike tried to tackle several issues and unlike other films that can intertwine plots/ points well, Spike missed the mark. Several times I felt like an issue was being addressed and then a split second later, that topic was dropped in favor of advancing another issue.<br/><br/>
Overall, important topics were investigated but poor planning led to choppy execution and a lack of closure. Instead of a defined end, the film left me at a loss, wanting more development. You can't fit everything into a movie, but some aspects that this film wanted to discuss were not fully explored."

","A sprawling, Vietnam Vet, gold hunt, family reconciliation, Black Lives Matter opus from Spike Lee? Careful what you wish for.<br/><br/>Never know with a Spike Lee Joint, and achingly, in spite of a series of great intentions, and moments of brilliance, ""Da 5 Bloods"" drags, confuses, and eventually crumbles. It has a rushed feeling, as if Spike wanted to strike quickly to make a film for the moment, and who can blame him? Perhaps he'll revisit, edit and tidy this Disjoint into the coherent classic that lurks beneath.<br/><br/>There are moments though.<br/><br/>Delroy Lindo in an anguished role of a misguided, bullying, suffering Vet, is absolutely superb in a hallucinatory, Shakespearean monologue as he crashes through the jungle. Spike GoPro's his head for a distorted, uncomfortably close selfie experience usually reserved for skateboarding YouTube clips. It is sensational.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman, as a fallen brother and de facto group leader, appears in flashbacks as a young, virile black Jesus figure, commanding the screen as much as his comrades in arms.<br/><br/>Lee's alternating use of aspect ratios to time travel is a clever move that allows the film to flow seamlessly, bringing his audience into and out of the moment in proper rhythm. Sadly, it is a bit lost on the tiny Netflix screens this is streamed on. ""Da 5 Bloods"" screams to belong on a gargantuan theatre screen.<br/><br/>Besides a sloppy and convoluted plot line concerning some loot looting, the greatest misstep is using aging actors in both present and flashback sequences. It just looks er, goofy. Unfortunately secondary acting is also weak, even from the usually fine Jean Reno. A father and daughter sideline is not just awkward, but again, impossible to digest because of a faulty time line. And on it goes. Is this an important movie? Maybe, it sure has a lot to say, but Spike has handled this much better in the past.<br/><br/>At a watch-checking two and a half hours, this would work oh so well as a lean ninety minute adventure.

","When I saw this movie I was intrigued by the concept of a group of vets returning to Vietnam to reclaim gold that they had hidden away during the war. Knowing Spike I figured it was gonna be a gung-ho, balls to the wall exciting ride, with a lot of dope lessons & heavy black influence. It was some of those things.. sometimes.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a history lesson on the events of the late 60's to early 70's. The war, the civil rights movement, Watergate, etc., & mixes 'The Bloods' into the end of the montage. It introduces them by reuniting them in 'Nam & talking about their plan, then jumps into the war flashbacks. The same actors are playing them in the flashbacks.. still old, which I thought was cool. The action was very campy & stylized, &the 16mm filming enhances it, but after about 30 minutes, the plot dilutes itself in a very weird way. This movie didn't need to be 2 1/2 hours long.<br/><br/>The acting was terrible in some scenes, & amazing in others. Some of the actors would deliver an awful line in one scene, then an oscar worthy performance in the next. Delroy Lindo stole the show, he has always been one of my favorite actors, but a lot of the character motivations are too in-your-face & I understand if some of it was hard to act realistically.<br/><br/>Before this review gets too long, I should just say that it had some good messages sometimes, especially considering the events going on here in 2020. Spike was just too on the nose in some ways, & tried to implement too many ideas into this film, which made it very complicated in other ways. Both my friends I was watching it with went to bed before it was over. I wanted to like it so badly. I held out for some amazing finale, but it just never delivered in a way that was meaningful. I'm not sure if I could or couldn't recommend at least giving it a watch.<br/><br/>Also, there is no way Netflix didn't pay all of the critics to give this movie 8-9+ star reviews. I can see how people might like it, but seeing people saying it's oscar worthy is laughable. I love the actors, love the idea, & I love Spike, but he just didn't hit it out of the park on this one.<br/><br/>Last but not least, black lives matter, & shout out Marvin Gaye."

","Self-aggrandizing and pretentious. It veers you in the wrong direction, but the film creators think that's okay. It's not okay for people who understand history, racism, and Vietnam.<br/><br/>A movie about Black Americans subjected to war by White American political leaders that classify them as secondary citizens. The actors come out of the war with PTSD, losing themselves in the battlefield, and still feeling the pain that White America inflicted and still inflicts on them today.<br/><br/>However, it tackles the injustices that they've been subjected to with war provocations.<br/><br/>For example, the scene in the Vietnamese floating boat market where a poor boat merchant tries to sell the main actor a live chicken (how absurd, in a floating market, really?), and he refuses, calling him a ""Gook.""<br/><br/>The merchant replies, ""You killed my mother and father,"" and threatens to kill the black former GI for not purchasing his live chicken and calling him a ""Gook.""<br/><br/>I mean, how absurd is this? If you had an inkling of understanding for Vietnamese culture, you would know that Vietnamese people are not like that at all. The majority of the South population (where this movie is shot) is made up of people under age 40. In fact, approximately 70% are.<br/><br/>In fact, they love Americans. They love Western culture. Native Vietnamese people have opened up bars like ""Apocalypse Now"" for Americans. Vietnamese-Americans provide the largest amount of remittances to Vietnamese citizens. Americans in general are one of the largest contributors to their GDP. American business owners provide dollars to the booming textile industry.<br/><br/>This really hits me: Why would you shoot a battle scene in 2020 between Americans and Vietnamese?<br/><br/>One common theme: Americans are responsible for war crimes, and so are Vietnamese.<br/><br/>Please tell me how pointing the finger at someone promotes change.<br/><br/>How does this change racial division? It appears to stir it up.<br/><br/>So this is coming to terms with inequality: degrading and being condescending toward Vietnamese people?<br/><br/>The whole movie I found my blood pressure rising, and oftentimes wanting to close my eyes because the movie was filmed in Vietnam, and yet it failed to grasp the current state of mind of Vietnamese people, which are mostly forward-thinking.<br/><br/>When you group all Vietnamese people into what you perceive to be a Vietnamese countryside way of life: slow, poor, unable to move past war sentimentality, and always seeking retribution against Americans - you fail to understand Vietnam.<br/><br/>This leaves you with nothing but flashbacks of recorded history and old stereotypes.<br/><br/>I suggest you don't watch this movie if you fall under the following: 1) You're Vietnamese; 2) You've been to Vietnam and understand the culture, daily life, and way of thinking; and 3) You're not easily fascinated with creators that convey that they want social change in their own country, but show no cultural sensitivities when they arrive as tourists or filmmakers in other people's countries...."

And even better, he bends that formula even more by having veterans return to where they fought in Vietnam to both return the remains of their fallen friend, as well as the treasure they once hid all those decades ago. Lee also makes a few interesting choices in the flashbacks that grew on me after a while and in hindsight, clearly add to the dynamic the soldiers have with each other.

"Cineology","9","1","1","30 June 2020"," Only Spike Lee Could Have Made This
","The kind of movies I look for are the ones that inspire my being to pause somewhere amidst the curious happenings and force me to think, ""Spielberg made this,"" ""Tarantino made this,"" or ""Herzog made this."" In the middle of this purposeful, angry, at times moving and educational picture, I couldn't help but think, ""Spike Lee was the only person who could have made this"" because the work possesses so much flavor and personality, the experience leaps out of the screen to slap us and shake us; it is alive, humorous, tragic, ironic, and timely.<br/><br/>It goes beyond politics. There are jabs against Donald Trump, his presidency, and his racist remarks (and actions) against African-Americans and other minorities, but the screenplay by Lee, Danny Bilson, Paul De Neo, and Kevin Willmott is correct to treat it as a symptom of the malignant tumor that has been wreaking havoc within the veins of US of A since its inception. The plot revolves around four Vietnam war veterans who return to the country that, for better or worse, have shaped who they are. They wish to retrieve a case full of gold. But this being a Spike Lee Joint, this shiny thing is metaphor: of ghosts, of corrupted souls, of what has been stolen or denied by a country that used, abused, and sold slaves so it could become what it is-a world leader, a superpower, a bully, a mess... yet somehow still regarded as an ideal by most nations. It is a story, too, about contradiction and hypocrisy.<br/><br/>But foremost: it is a story about forgiveness. It doesn't seem at that way even already an hour into the picture. I admired that about it. Spanning about a hundred and fifty minutes, it takes its time to allow the pieces to fall into place. It invites us to look beyond the action and consider our world. It implores us to really look at it, to ask ourselves if we're proud of it, if we feel comfortable for children to live and thrive in it. So many mainstream movies these days, many of which are forgettable, settle for shallow entertainment. Nothing at all to say about the world around us, our history, where we're heading. As it has always been with Lee: To be political, to voice out injustice, to act as a megaphone is entertainment. He doesn't want us to turn off our brains; he wants us to turn it on, to push it, to challenge the system of oppression.<br/><br/>We meet Eddie the businessman who exudes success (Norm Lewis), Otis who left someone important in Vietnam (Clarke Peters), Melvin the conscience and pragmatist (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), and Paul the wild card (Delroy Lindo). We hang out with these men as they laugh, drink, and reminisce. The writer-director shows them looking at the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese looking at them. The camera pinpoints skin color, physical stature, hair, voice, how a person carries himself or herself within a defined space. It is an observant picture, certainly daring and willing to ignite fierce discussion. There is not one shot that comes across as a waste.<br/><br/>But how can there be forgiveness, healing, when so much injustice and anger remain? The film does not provide answers, but it presents a microcosm in the form of Paul mourning over a dear friend-someone he looks up to, one whom he considers to be a brother-whose name was Stormin' Norman (Chadwick Boseman). Notice the technique used during its flashbacks: Norman is shown as an ideal. A case can be made that we never truly get to know him as he was, only in the mind of Paul-the man whose body got to go home to America but whose soul remained in Vietnam alongside the corpse of his friend. Paul is such a shell, he finds he is incapable of loving his own son (Jonathan Majors). David looks at his father and he seems lost. They are tethered only by genetics. It is a sad sight to see and feel. Wonderfully performed by Lindo, Paul is one of the most memorable characters I've come across in recent memory.<br/><br/>Does the movie provide catharsis? Yes and no. There is catharsis on screen which involves shootouts, deaths (black, white, American, Vietnamese, French), and tying up loose ends by showing signed checks, hugging, solidarity, and people shouting ""Black Lives Matter!"" Perhaps I don't feel there is true catharsis because I am a person of color in America. That when I go to the Midwest, for example, I am not seen as an American but The Other. A second-class citizen. But sometimes it is enough that a film takes a shovel, dig deep, and further expose what has long been dormant. Or at the very least serving as reminder of what we have yet to work on."
"ValdSB","6","1","1","30 June 2020"," Too long
","This movie could have been 90 minutes. But it is overlong, due to the fact that Spike Lee fills up the movie with documentary style cuts, focusing on racism in America. But it just feels so out of touch with the overall arc of the story, which is actually very promising. I dont think that the racism-stuff should have left behind, but i think it would have worked a lot better, if they just toned it down a nutch, without jumping around. With that said, the second half of the movie is very good. Delroy Lindo is amazing, his scenes alone in the jungle are awesome. The final showdown is also very rewarding. But its just the first half that ruins the movie. More than one hour has passed, before something actually happens. And i think a lot of viewers will turn away in that time. I almost did so myself. 2hours and 45 minutes is crazy given a plot, that is very thin, and filled up with out-of-place stuff, that just contributes to lose the overall focus of the movie.

","There is no more prescient of a time for Spike Lee to put out a film. He's arguably the world's most important Black filmmaker and his latest movie, ""Da 5 Bloods,"" hits screens at a time when race relations in America are at their most pivotal point since the civil rights era.<br/><br/>Lee's films nearly exclusively center on race. To this day his debut feature film, ""Do the Right Thing,"" is not only dissected, discussed, and analyzed everywhere from the streets to academia for its filmmaking prowess, but also for the clarity and depth of what the film has to say about the Black experience in America.<br/><br/>Not stopping there, Lee set his sights on the life and times of Malcolm X, turning out a three-and-a-half hour epic that lays bare the noxious pretense of equality in America that existed during Malcolm X's lifetime, at the time of the film's 1992 release, and still exists to this day.<br/><br/>Lee's latest, ""Da 5 Bloods,"" is centered on four old war buddies from Vietnam who travel back to the country to retrieve a stash of gold along with the remains of their fallen friend.<br/><br/>The opening of the film is not for the faint of heart. It depicts real life photos and news footage of some of the more horrifying memories of the Vietnam War era, such as the burning monk or the captive Vietnamese man executed in the street with a bullet to the head. Equally repulsive is the notion that war, oppression, racism, and corrupt politics isn't some figment of our distant past but every bit as widespread then as it is today.<br/><br/>A number of scenes in ""Da 5 Bloods"" contain fun to spot Easter eggs or homages to its cinematic brethren. Some are rather obvious, like the ""Apocalypse Now"" writing on the wall of the dance club or the usage of the song ""Flight of the Valkyries,"" harkening back to the same movie. Others are a bit more meta, like the one-legged Vietnamese man throwing fire crackers at the feet of the protagonists, playfully referencing the terrifying ""Dance!"" scene in ""Platoon.""<br/><br/>But as much as Spike Lee might've wanted ""Da 5 Bloods"" to represent his own ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Platoon,"" it just isn't. Not even close. Far too many corners were cut while making the film for it to be considered in the same realm as such distinguished titles.<br/><br/>Just look at the blood spatter CGI used throughout ""Da 5 Bloods"" as an example. It looks no better than the stock blood spatter effect in Adobe. Matter of fact, it probably IS the stock blood spatter effect in Adobe. Why not spend that Netflix money and use squibs? Alternatively, if the effect is going to make the film look like a B-rated zombie flick, why use anything at all?<br/><br/>And what are the chances that someone looking for buried gold on the side of a mountain goes to dig a hole to take a dump in and his shovel hits ... gold. A million to one? A billion? Who cares because Spike Lee is an acclaimed writer and such mind-numbing coincidences should never make it onto the page, much less into the film?<br/><br/>The full list of frustrating coincidences found throughout the film is about as long as this entire review, so I'll spare you the details. The bottom line is simply that ""Da 5 Bloods"" isn't the film we all hoped it would be. Spike Lee is among the finest filmmakers alive. Kubrick is Kubrick because he never settled for ""just good enough."" Scorsese is Scorsese because he never settles for ""just good enough."" After watching ""Da 5 Bloods,"" I find it very disappointing at how many times Spike Lee apparently settled for ""just good enough."""

","Over the last 30+ years, Spike Lee has, invariably with a few exceptions, made films about Black identify in the US. These have been searing commentaries about the ways that that country has failed it's African American citizens. This time, he goes back and forth, between the present day and the 60s & the Vietnam War and gives us a POV of four Black veterans of that war, who return to 'Nam to take care of some unfinished business.<br/><br/>I really loved the screenplay, with its frequent allusions to popular as well as little known Blacks of historical import.<br/><br/>Delroy Lindo deserves an Oscar nomination and probably the statuete for his portrayal of Trump supporting, anti Asian, maniacal fighting machine. His intensity is frightening and he has the best written role. He lights up the screen and dares you to take your eyes away from him. Didn't know he had so much brilliance hidden inside. The rest of the cast is also spot on.<br/><br/>This is Spike Lee's most ambitious effort since the superb _Inside Man_ back in 2006 and it is great to see Netflix backing him.<br/><br/>Recommended."

The flashbacks of the war use the same actors who are in their 60s 70s and can hardly move, why not use younger actors.
Its just a mess a potentially good story used as a vehicle to promote racial injustice and even attaching the current BLM movement on the end.
I dont like the movie because of the casting or I would not of watched in first place but the constant political digs ended up being the main drive of this film which made you loose intrest.

","Spike Lee's excellent ""Da 5 Bloods"" opens with Muhammad Ali and closes with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., two legends who are inextricably tied to the Civil Rights movement and Black pride. Lee uses them to highlight another commonality: their strenuous opposition to the Vietnam War. For Ali, the objection cost him several productive years of his career and his heavyweight title; for Dr. King, this new focus was quite possibly the final straw that led to his assassination. The first words we hear are Ali's famous explanation of why he refused to enlist. The last words we hear are from a speech King gave on April 4, 1967, exactly one year before his murder, where he quotes poet Langston Hughes' ""Let America Be America Again."""

","I've been a huge Spike Lee fan for years so I was really looking forward to this film. The trailers certainly intrigued me and the premise seemed very interesting. Sadly this film does not deliver the goods Lee is known for. It seems like a jumble of important issues and ideas thrown together. The dialogue is poor and cheesy, the music completely threw me off, and I just couldn't feel compassion for the characters. The cinematography is amazing and there are some very poignant issues that Lee touches on but unfortunately it's not enough to really give the film the boost it needs. A film that had great potential but sadly doesn't pull through."
"danmelli","4","1","1","14 June 2020"," Overly long and underwhelming
","It's no secret that Spike Lee is an intriguing filmmaker. Throughout his career, works like Do the Right Thing and BlackKklansman have not only entertained us, but Lee has made his mark on cinema through the themes of these films. However, in my opinion, in the case of Da 5 Bloods, the standard we could expect from Spike Lee was not met.<br/><br/>Yes, the cinematography is decent. There are some nice shots and camerawork capturing the Vietnamese landscape. But there's nothing we haven't seen before, and the film's environmental features can only take it so far. This film is not so driven by war sequences, as the trailer would have you believe, but rather by dialogue - a LOT of dialogue. And unfortunately, it doesn't lead anywhere interesting.<br/><br/>Granted, Lee didn't write the film solo, so I can't fault him completely. But it seems almost as if he thought that making this film unnecessarily long would inherently make it good. No, not every movie is good just because it is 2.5 hours. And this one felt like every minute of its running time was dragging. I fount myself watching it in small doses, and at some points it actually felt like a chore to get through. The problem is, aside from a few timely lines about our current political crisis in the US, there's not much character development and the conversations become ultimately meaningless.<br/><br/>This isn't a war film. It tries to be a character study about friendship with some comedy and historical fiction, but really it doesn't engage the viewer enough with its thin story to fill its running time effectively. The main reason to watch it is for Lee's direction, but we've already seen better from him."

Whilst I did manage to make the end despite falling asleep before the halfway point (something the director also seems to have done) I cant say it's the best use of 2 hours 35 minutes which is far more time than they seem to put in writing producing directing and editing this film. The high points of the film came from laughing at the VC fighters death collapse on Stormin Norman (the almost mythical 1 eyed Willy of the film) followed by, I dont know how many rolls upon being pushed off the body by the character Paul and also Paul's snake bite ordeal where the rubber snake seems to have been looted from the Chuckle Brothers forgotten prop box. Seems the whole film was rushed to in to being take advantage of the growing global social upheaval regarding the BLM momentum in the hope of maximizing viewing numbers which as a point of motivation for release is a tragedy in its self as no matter how many news clips and quotes used the end result here is pretty poor

","I'm mixed on this Spike Lee portrayal of Black Vietnam vets. Portraying Black veterans as criminally-minded opportunists does not resonate with my Vietnam experience with my Black brothers-in-arms who were some of the bravest and most patriotic veterans I know, even today. Spike Lee intentionally, or hopefully unintentionally, paints Black Vietnam vets with the broad brush of being morally vacant criminals. I realize this is just Hollywood entertainment, but Spike is tarnishing the excellent service records of all Black Vietnam veterans with this movie theme. Hope Spike makes another film depicting the REAL heroism of Black veterans someday."
"subxerogravity","7","14","43","13 June 2020"," Black Lives Matter!!
","Not the best Spike Lee joint ever, but a great movie, especially for the times we are living in.
This was the first movie I watched snice I noticed that Netflix put up their Black Lives Matter recommendations and Spike does not disappoint.
Very complex story about four black Vietnam vets coming back to Vietnam to find the lost body of the one that did not make it home 50 years ago, and the gold he's laid to rest with.
I feel like Spike is trying to make up for Miracle at St. Anna. A movie about black soldiers in World War 2. This was a much stronger portrait of African Americans fighting an American war.
Although watching this I see how Spike went wrong with Miracle at St. Anna. Da 5 Bloods can be a little clunky at times as if Spike did not have as much insight on the topic. I get that, as he is not a vet of any war (except the semi-Civil War he faces as a black man in America which allowed him to perfectly craft movies like Do the Right Thing and Blackkklansman). Sometimes the information just seem tossed at me like a documentary, which maybe is what he was going for, but it did clash with a scenes where he was laying down the knowledge with an emotional narrative.
I'll say this. It was a beautiful movie. Spike has an eye and this film shows that eye. You could tell he's getting into more technically film tactics to make it look like Vietnam during the 60s and 70s when he has to and Spike is always really good at making the film feel warm.
An amazing ensemble cast of actors helping to bring life to Spike's movies. It's hard to pick out just one cause literally everyone truly help to movie this tory along.
Overall, this was definetly a treat."
"blott2319-1","9","11","32","12 June 2020"," Brilliant, thrilling, and timely
","There is so much to love about Da 5 Bloods, and I think it has something to offer several different audiences. Let's see if I can break it all down for you:<br/><br/>If you're looking for a film that feels like a war movie, and has action and excitement to spare, then I think you'll get just what you want out of Da 5 Bloods. I was thrilled by all these sequences, and often couldn't believe my eyes as the violence escalated. It was a truly remarkable and downright disturbing thing to watch. Whoever handled the effects on this film did a masterful job at making the violence feel real and horrifying, even in the times when the blood splatter was clearly CGI. Spike Lee also knows how to film the action, so even in the chaos of battle, you can keep a tab on where people are and what is happening to our heroes.<br/><br/>However, if you're looking for a film about the bonds of friendship forged in war, Da 5 Bloods has that in spades. We get to see these men who have grown close over the years, and on this journey they find common ground and discuss the past, present, and future. It didn't take long before I felt like I knew these men and could see what brought them together and what threatened to come between them. It's not always smooth sailing and we get to see how they all deal with conflict. It's a heart-wrenching journey at times, and I was close to tears more than once. You start to realize that, even with all the crazy stuff happening, it's the bonds of friendship and love that are the most vital.<br/><br/>Finally, if you're looking for a film that talks about the history of racism in both America and Vietnam, then look no further than Da 5 Bloods. Spike Lee opens the film with one of his patented montages of news footage from the past that details some of the things this film will address (or puts certain aspects of it in context.) Throughout the movie he will even insert shots of news reports or printed media when someone references a historic moment from the past, as if he wants to make it clear to viewers that this movie may be fictional, but the events they are discussing really happened. There is symbolism in other ways throughout the film that calls back to the racial themes.<br/><br/>There might be even more to Da 5 Bloods that flew over my head, but these are the three most obvious genres you'll find when watching this film. Now I'll admit, some of the more political stuff that he addresses would turn me off in some movies. It serves as a distraction from the plot, and I don't enjoy when a film-maker takes extra time just to hammer home the themes instead of addressing them in an organic way in the story. However, there's something about this moment in history that made me forgive Spike Lee's choices here. This doesn't seem like a time to be subtle, and perhaps Da 5 Bloods is the slap in the face some people need. In every other way I loved this movie, and it's one of those rare films that I want to watch repeatedly so I can analyze and pick it apart to see what I missed the first time. It now claims the title as my favorite Spike Lee film."

He has his own incredible stylish direction, with beautiful framing work to really set the tones throughout this unpredictable narrative. Just by this piece of art Spike created, you can not only feel his pain, but also the pain from the injustice to people and returning war veterans. Spike did a really good job clearly stating his beliefs, without jamming down his one sided opinions, making it more political than it needed to be.<br/><br/>When your actors really bond with the director, you are destined to get art like this every single time! You can tell there was absolutely no drama or anything behind the scenes, all great ideas being bounced off one another. Between Kim Coleman's casting & Spike Lee's intelligent & powerful script, these characters all stepped up to the plate, and hit a homerun! Every single character put their heart and soul into their roles, you can just feel the passion in their voices! Spike Lee crafted these beautiful emotional scenes, that just sucked you in closer to all of the characters. The chemistry between the main characters is nothing short of seamless!

The only character left without much story here is Melvin. But otherwise, while other movies speed ahead, treating their characters like prop dolls, Spike Lee always devotes time to characters like the Bloods. Otherwise the historical cutaways would make his movies feel more like documentaries. I love how Spike always does right by his characters, almost excessive with the varieties of situations they end up in. And giving characters time to interact with the viewers, talking to the camera, makes Spike Lee the best kind of crazy."

","One of Spike's best, to my mind, done in the style of great war movies (Longest Day, River Kwai, et al.)
5 distinct personalities, each contributing a different aspect of the black experience in Nam and beyond, amplified by news footage of the time.
Delroy Lindo tears it up as the Madman (Oscar worthy), maybe a little too much-not his acting, but maybe his long rants added up to too much screen time, relative to the film overall, throwing the rhythm off a bit. That said, no question that his character was rightfully the focus of the story's intentions.
And flashbacks required 60 year-old actors to play themselves as youths, an unfortunate distraction, but probably better than cgi-ing youth on their faces, which would have been even more distracting.

Lee directs this film in a really great way that develops the characters over the course of the movie. There are also great scenes of flashback of the war with gun fighting. The cinematography in this film is beautiful and the soundtrack is great. These guys go on a crazy adventure searching for this gold and it is a great ride. Well directed with a great script.

"johnterrell-67238","7","3","6","21 June 2020"," A Mixed Bag (yet still compelling)
","Da 5 Bloods is the new movie by director Spike Lee. The film has been very divisive since its release as I've seen some people claiming it as the best film of the year, and others claiming it is just plain pretentious schlock. Me, I would fall into around the middle of these two, feeling just a bit more positive to the movie, but not loving it.
The movie is about 4 Vietnam veterans as they go back to find the gold they hid so many years ago. They also go back to find the body of their old friend (Stormin' Norman) who was killed in the war. The film explores themes of racism in the Vietnam war, and much more social commentary within it as well.
I will say that this might be Spike Lee's most ambitious movie as it delves into so many themes and different genres. However, the movie falls under its own ambition far too much. Due to how many things Lee is trying to do, some of it feels very unfocused and jumbled together. The first half of this movie is another thing people are really criticizing as well. I actually enjoyed the first half to a certain extent, but it is extremely heavy handed and it was frustrating that Lee felt the need to tell us everything the characters were feeling and every message he wanted the audience to receive. It's not even really a case of a movie ""telling not showing"" because here the movie is doing both. It's showing us enough for us to understand the characters and the themes but it decides to add a unneeded monologues that explains it to us. The first half of the movie does set up quite well for the second half.
For the most part I do think the protagonist are pretty good. Two of the main 4 protagonist however are kind of underwritten (Eddie and Melvin). They are given minimal character qualities...especially Eddie. However, Otis and Paul were very interesting the whole way through, especially Paul played in glorious fashion by Delroy Lindo. Even though there hasn't been very many movies to release in 2020, so far as of June 2020 Delroy Lindo is my choice for best performance of the year. He dominates every second of his screen time and Lee uses this great performance to his advantage and it is a real reoccurring highlight in the movie. I also really like Clarke Peters' performance as Otis. One thing that kind of annoyed me however is that the characters don't always react naturally to some events that happen in the film. The scene that kickstarts the second half of the movie (I won't spoil it but if you've seen it you probably know the one I mean) should've gotten a bigger reaction from the characters but they never really mention it after the sequence is over. This happens to a smaller extent multiple times within the film as well.
I have been criticizing it a lot so far, but there is definitely a lot to like in this movie. I really like the second half of the movie for the most part. It ramps up the intensity to full volume and we lose the heavy handiness from the first half. There is also an extremely touching scene towards the end with Chadwick Boseman's character (Stromin' Norman) and Delroy Lindo's character (Paul). The scene is pretty beautiful and I've already found myself rewatching that one scene. That's another thing that's really good about the movie, just Chadwick Boseman in general. They hype up the character of Norman a lot, and his performance makes us believe why they were so connected to him. Towards the end we also just start getting a lot of really good scenes. The climax I do find to be really generic. The antagonist who is revealed towards the end is just plain cartoonish. The resolution I find to be okay. It's not bad but I wasn't completely satisfied or anything.
By the end of the film I was just kind of mixed. I liked a lot of things about it as I was interested in most of the film. I also really liked the thought provoking themes (even if they were a bit heavy handed). However, there is a lot holding this movie back. It feels decently unfocused most of the way through, and at times feels like multiple genres and multiple movies at the same time. I don't know exactly what to feel about this movie as I think I like the movie enough, but it's frustrating to see what could've been a great movie just turn out kind of decent.

","I've never seen more of a master of division than Spike Lee. This film has good cinematography, but very predictable, hate-filled story line. As in most Lee films, America is the root of all evil and white people are racist. No context is given. No mention of unity. His films are all predictably made to do one thing...Tell black people white people hate them and are the reason for all problems. God forbid black people were told the full truth...Spike Lee would be out of a job."

","This is a pretty good war drama film. Its definitely a Spike Lee movie, it brings all the good and sometimes bad that Lee brings to his movies. The casting of the movie is very well done, as with most Spike Lee movies. I'll get to the bad later in the review.<br/><br/>Of particular note is the portrayal of black soldiers in Vietnam and what they went through as opposed to other soldiers. From everything I know, its fairly accurate and shows well what they went through. Also, the portrayal of the different levels of PTSD that the vets still have and go through is very well shown.<br/><br/>The bad in this case is the length of the movie. It drags in places and could have used some editing to help with pacing and storytelling. It never drags enough to break suspension of disbelief, at least it didnt for me, but it definitely could have been a little faster paced in parts.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie. It tells a great story in a way that is interesting and most importantly not predictable.

","Four African American veterans return to Vietnam to hunt for gold and the lost remains of their fallen leader, Stormin' Norman. From the beginning it is clear that this is no return to glory, but a story of unfinished business.<br/><br/>The film jumps through time creating a dichotomy between what the Bloods were fighting for and what they've been left with. A very affecting scene sees them listening to Viet Cong propaganda, sympathetic to the injustice towards Black GIs. Any sense of patriotism or American glory normally found in war films is conspicuously absent. Lee instead shows the war as a complex mess, reflected in the lives of the four men.<br/><br/>Lee's imagery of Norman is particularly powerful, as he teaches his comrades about black history, encouraging them to use the gold to advance black liberation. He is an almost mythic figure (strong parallels are drawn between his death and the assassination of MLK), and when in his company the past, ironically, feels safer for the Bloods than the present.<br/><br/>Lee inserts real footage and photography of Black activists, soldiers and icons. While the film has moments of levity and a sense of adventure the constant presence of history reminds the audience that this is not a work of fiction. It gives a huge weight to the film; the Vietnam war becomes a single moment in a struggle hundreds of years old. The Bloods do not seek to defend America but fight for the America that does not yet exist.<br/><br/>A timely and a timeless film. As entertaining as it is informative and emotional, bolstered by consistently strong performances. Lee directs with his usual flare and style, but with a driven sense of purpose. An inversion of the war genre, changing Vietnam from a mindless horror to an obvious injustice."

Beautifully shot and well acted, there's little for me not to like.

But, all of the great directors seem to not shy away from the length of the film. They all seem determined to tell their story and not be limited by the length of the film. I watched the Spike Lee interview on Apple TV+ afterwards which helped put the length in perspective. Spike Lee reminded me that he wants to tell his story. I respect that. Not just in Spike Lee but in all of the great Directors. It seemed to me that after he made the movie he decided to splice in some history lessons then tie the movie to current events but, Spike Lee would have to explain if that was indeed the case. I am sure that eventually someone will ask Spike Lee that question."

","I really enjoyed this movie. Say what you want but I don't think that there is a more relevant film to what is happening to our world today and what has been happening for a long time. I have to give Spike Lee credit for making a movie that is definitely not a crowd-pleaser. Many people will be put off by the heavy-handed imagery and symbolism, but if you can get past that, you might enjoy this movie. The actors were great. Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, and Isaiah Whitlock Jr. played off each other beautifully. They had great chemistry and I truly believed that they were brothers that went through some tough deal in the war. Chadwick Boseman was great but he isn't a big character as much as he is a big presence and device that moves the story forward. The marketing team really made a disservice to the story that is really the driving force of this movie. The music was good, the cinematography was excellent and very unique with the whole changing ratio according to the time period thing. The editing is weird at times but I got over that rather quickly since I was so interested in what was happening. The CGI is straight-up bad and it's even worse considering that Spike has the authority and probably the budget to make practical blood squibs. The green screen is very noticeable at times but still, I ignored it in tried to enjoy myself. Still, I found myself predicting many of the events in the films a long time before they happened. I am going to give it a 7/10 because I did find many flaws and the plot got kind of predictable at times. There were some heavy-handed symbolism and an exposition scene that I dreaded. I will still recommend it to anyone that asks me about the film."

","To everyone complaining here: not using digital ""de-aging"" effects or younger actors to play in the flashback scenes was a CREATIVE choice by Spike Lee and it works really well.

It took me a little bit of time to get used to it in the beginning, but once I did I really appreciated this decision.<br/><br/>A few things in the film don't work such as casting an actress clearly too young to play Otis's former lover.<br/><br/>The weaknesses in the film are overcome by strong performances by all the leads."

Didn't get tired of it at all from start to end, the story is very compelling. But all that unecessary politic s**t... Paul, the guy that goes nuts and kind of betrays his fellow bloods, voted for Trump and wears a MAGA hat. The Jean Reno character also betrays them and proves to be a piece of s**t, and, of course, he supports Trump and wears a MAGA hat. It also sometimes mentions some black historical figures completely out of place just to show black pride i guess, like in that rope scene. But, eh, it's Spike Lee so i don't know what i was expecting really. Overall, great acting. Especially from Delroy Lindo, i think his acting is on pair with Henry Fonda on Treasure Of Sierra Madre. Great Cinematography, it borrows some shots from Apocalypse Now but overall it is awesomely shot. And a great writing as well, although i have to say that scene where the guy goes take a dump and happens to go do it right where all the gold is is kinda ridiculous, but i guess that part was supposed to be more comedic than serious.<br/><br/>TL;DR Awesome movie ruined by politics and activism"

The acting is great with Delroy Lindo delivering a fantastic performance. Clarke Peters is also amazing along with Jonathan Majors. The story comes across a muddled to me at some points. There's not a lot of characterization for anyone except maybe two or three of the characters. The film sort of keeps going after a while when it should've stopped like an half hour before. There's also some subplot regarding a girl and her friends that have some sort of organization that searches for land mines which is pretty stupid and only serves as a way for there to be a character death and for there to be an action scene.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it though for the most part. Again the acting is top tier. The social commentary is well done and is subtle for the most part. The first hour and half was enjoyable and it sort of drags itself to the end after that.
I'd recommend it though and it feels great to actually a film that has some love behind its film making."

Da 5 Bloods is his perfect return, the film tackles various subjects and has the perfect adventure scenes to keep you engrossed.<br/><br/>The 154 minute runtime is definitely felt during some scenes and certain characters were underwritten but the visuals, setting and performances by Delroy Lindo and Clarke Peters make up for it. Having Delroy Lindo play as a Trump supporter was a great decision, he eases the role and is definitely a contender to look forward during the awards season. Chadwick Boseman appears only for a combined 15 minutes in total despite being the central character.<br/><br/>The usage of historical speeches and images when narrating certain flashbacks gives us a new type of narration which we have never seen before.

How is that that Spike Lee is ALWAYS around when we need his films most? ""Da 5 Bloods"" is the timeliest of timely films in the world we are currently living in. We need more stories about black vets; why isn't this happening? HOLLYWOOD MAKE THIS HAPPEN! Every one of ""da bloods"" deserves an Oscar nomination, but Delroy Lindo deserves a Best Actor win, hands down. Lindo has always worked best under the direction of Spike Lee and this is his career defining performance. Lindo's portrayal of a vet with PTSD soars throughout but in the latter part of the film, his decent into madness fuelled by greed is astounding and unforgettable. Anyone else notice religious allegories in this film? No spoilers. Of course Lee's longtime music collaborator, Terrence Blanchard's score is yet again on point and the choice to use tracks from Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On"" album is majestically haunting. ""Da 5 Bloods"" is without a doubt the best film of 2020 and I can't stress enough how Spike Lee is one of the most original and daring filmmakers of all time. You must see this film.

"alindsay-al","6","5","14","13 June 2020"," An Above Average dramatic film
","This film hit Netflix yesterday and I have now seen Da 5 Bloods and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Four African American Vets return to Vietnam to find the remains of their old leader and the gold that they hid together.
Main Character
Delroy Lindo plays the most fleshed out character and he is amazing here. He owns every scene he is in, there are times where you can't take your eyes off of him, he is the one most affected by the war and he does a really good job of portraying this. He is the most interesting character in the film and I thought he was the best part of this entire film.
Supporting Characters
The rest of the crew have good chemistry together, but there is no doubt that I didn't care about them anywhere as much as Lindo and I felt like as the film progressed I cared less and less about them. Chadwick Boseman is in this film and does a decent job when he is on screen but he doesn't really have much of a character, we are told all these good things about him but we never see him so it makes you question just how good he is. The rest of the cast didn't do much for me whether they were protagonists or antagonists they were pretty dull and generic.
Story
This story has an interesting premise to it, as you see these guys hunt for this gold you see how it affects them and how there lives have changed and it is done well. Also this film has plenty of moral and political questions to ask and some of it was handled well, others not. This film has too many side plots that feel pointless and it takes up a good part of the first act making it pretty much an hour in before they actually go on their journey and by then I was a bit bored. Also this film tries to mix real life issues with this film and I thought it was handled very clumsily, it feels like Spike Lee the director was trying to send a very clear message but in my opinion it took away from the movie and felt like he was just was trying to tell the history of black culture which is obviously important but I am just not sure if it was needed in this film.
Script
The script has some really grest dramatic dialogue, it has some really memorable moments and builds the tension really well. The humour used here didn't really work for me and I think that will be a subjective thing but I think it also had something to do with how it was used sometimes leading to a clashing of tones.
Style
The film as mentions does a great job in building suspense and tension, there are some really uncomfortable scenes and this film did a great job with it. Also there are a few good shootouts here when they happen and this film is filmed really well with a unique style to it. But I can't help but mention that the pace is just off, the first hour is so slow and with the film being 2 and a half hours it needs to grip you early but for me it just didn't.
Overall
Overall, this is clearly a passion project by Spike Lee and there are some highlights for sure mainly being his style and the lead performance. Though, I don't believe this will be remembered as one of his greats as sometimes his beliefs overpower the story and this is a longer film then it needed to be. If you are a fan of war films then this might be for you and it is a decent watch but I wouldn't say it is one to rush to see."

What kind of person is this movie even made for?? The movie plays out like a really uninspiring treasure hunt, mixed with nightmarish stills from the vietnam war. Images i guess Only Spike lee himself see some deeper meaning in. when there is Only pure evil and madness. What is the purpose?
I really dont know. Take this as a comparison, youre watching a ordinary movie then suddenly see stills of autrocities from ww2 pop up. Its just all over the place and movies that tries to be weird for the sake of being weird but also just simply trash."

"JRodFilms","8","3","7","19 June 2020"," Delroy Lindo Shines in Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods
","Da 5 Bloods, the Spike Lee film exclusively available on Netflix, premiered in June of 2020, and lately I have been somewhat lacking in the film reviews because I think if I don't tackle it right away and put a review up within the films premiere that it's essentially old news. And I almost felt my review as old news as I started writing it. I became uninspired and quit the review altogether.<br/><br/>But then I scrolled through some movie forums and became inspired again, especially when I thought about the performance of lead actor Delroy Lindo, who plays Paul; one of four living Bloods who return to Vietnam to retrieve lost gold, where it is buried along with the remains of the deceased Blood, Norman, played by Chadwick Boseman.<br/><br/>Da 5 Bloods begins in a at times awkward first act, opening with all 5 Bloods in Vietnam and the ensuing helicopter crash which sets up the forthcoming adventure to seek the gold. We are then shifted into present with the four living bloods, Paul and his 3 other Vet buddies Otis, Eddie, and Melvin, played by Clarke Peters, Norman Lewis and Isiah Whitlock, Jr., respectively, arriving in Vietnam and begin to get re adjusted to their surroundings. Paul is later surprised at the hotel by his son David, played by Johnathon Majors, who appears throughout the film wearing Moorehouse attire.<br/><br/>Before Da Bloods head out on their adventure, some unfinished business needs to be settled between Melvin and a former lover, meanwhile Paul and David make a decision that David will get the deceased Blood's share of the gold if they are to retrieve it.<br/><br/>Da 5 Bloods gave me feelings of Apocalypse Now from the opening movie themed dance party, to the nostalgic soundtrack filled with songs from Marvin Gaye and others, to the technical aspects of the film: including shifting aspect ratios between the present and flashback footage of the younger Bloods in Vietnam and most importantly the powerful performance from Delroy Lindo, which evokes a often times 'decent into madness' as I like to call it, that needs to be mentioned along with other great performances.<br/><br/>With as much as I did like I did find some flaws with this film, as I mentioned before, the first act felt awkward to me. I would recommend having some patience, to give the story time to build. Spike Lee recently praised the composer of this film, however I felt the score, especially at the beginning of the film did not fit, it just jumped out at me and not in a good way.<br/><br/>I felt the flashback scenes should have had younger actors, with the only one being Chadwick Boseman. The makeup was not convincing, and as great as the performances were, it was another thing that jumped out as pretty noticeable to me.<br/><br/>For the flaws the film does have, I feel is redeemed by the end of the film. And most importantly I felt the film grow as it progressed. And when most of the time I feel, that films fizzle out especially during their middle act, Da 5 Bloods actually kept getting better and better. So thats why I say give the first act a chance because I feel it pays off in the end,<br/><br/>
Spike Lee has been in an upward swing lately with Academy Award Winning 'BlacKKKlansman' from 2018 and 2020s Da 5 Bloods, which sees him tackling current political commentary and being able to blend it with past history grievances so well that even if you don't agree with his politics, it is impossible to deny his talent as a storyteller and filmmaker."
"kosmasp","9","3","7","18 June 2020"," They got five on it
","Spike Lee is outspoken. He does not make it a secret that he is not a fan of Trump at all. Now in the time we live in, that may make his movies a no go to some (yes political views seem to matter to some more than the actual quality of the movie they might or might not watch). In this though, Spike Lee tells a story and does not just give us a history lesson.<br/><br/>A story that is complicated, with regrets, with PTSD, with hidden treasures, with mental issues and more. There is a lot that can be discovered here. One of the things being who the characters are. Including one Black Trump fan - missguided you say? Well the position of Spike is clear on this, but the movie has more to say than just that. And the soundtrack helps boosting that, even though I'm not sure the placing of the ride of the valkyries was the best. But that's just me and how I experienced it. You may feel it's completely apt.<br/><br/>Now Spike does not hold back and there will be blood, there will be violence in this and there will be quite the weird relationships and how they play out. Sometimes the ghosts of the past do not let go. Even if they never meant to keep you down. This is complex, yet intriguing, suspensful and entertaining to a degree, while very informative too. Social injustice and social equivalence has not been achieved yet - if you don't confront your past, you can't be living your future!"
"vncntobyrne","1","3","7","17 June 2020"," Garbage
","The acting and storyline in this was really dire. So many plot holes. It was like watching a train wreck over 2.5 hours. Excruciating stuff. The worst entry in celluloid depiction of the Vietnam conflict... spike lee definitely jumped the shark with this one. The trailer seemed so promising but it's just a collection of poorly executed set pieces and the themes important themes are handled in a clunky earnest manner. Don't let this be your legacy Spike. Take a hiatus and a break and please return with something approaching your earlier on point work"
"webcrind","1","3","7","16 June 2020"," Sloppy directing and script
","Many of the dialogues in Spike's new movie are lifeless and feel wooden, the plot is utterly ridiculous since it makes no sense to stash a treasure as a young man only to wait 50 years until you are an old man, and by old I mean very old, to finally claim it. A similar plot, but more relatable, was used in Three Kings. But what really killed the quality of the movie for me was the following scene: 4 old men are talking about their past and this dialogue leads to a scene that would be commonly defined as a flashback. This flashback brings us to a moment in time in the Vietnam War, inside a helicopter, staffed with some old men, and by old I mean very old. Yes, Spike Lee thought it was a good idea to have several actors, all in their 60s and not necessarily in good shape, play 20 year old soldiers. Why?
There are a lot of references Spike Lee inserted into the story-line that were taken from other movies that are, to a movie buff, needless and counter productive. Why?<br/><br/>This is a bad movie with uninspiring dialogues and cheaply produced action scenes. If Spike Lee wanted to transmit a message dealing with current issues, he could have used 140 characters."

"CinemaClown","Null","3","7","15 June 2020"," 'Treasure Of Sierra Madre' Meets 'Apocalypse Now' In This Latest Spike Lee Joint
","The Treasure of the Sierra Madre meets Apocalypse Now in this latest Spike Lee joint. Da 5 Bloods is an attempt to capture the African-American experience in an immoral war they were funnelled into despite a larger crisis brewing at home and argues that unlike their harrowing time in Vietnam, their battle for survival in their own country is still raging and is far from over.<br/><br/>Directed by Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing & BlacKkKlansman), the opening scene slaps the viewers with the horror America has caused over the years, both inside & outside its borders, and aptly portrays the scars & remnants of Vietnam experience they and the natives never recovered from. The film is gripping & interesting for the most part but not all its moments hit the sweet spot.<br/><br/>The first action segment is diluted by a score that doesn't fit at all. The monologues are more or less ineffective & unnecessary. The change in aspect ratio is smooth & productive and the fluid camerawork & rich colour grading add more vibrance to the imagery. Performances from the entire cast is top-notch, the group dynamic exhibits a sense of unity & brotherhood, and Delroy Lindo easily stands out.<br/><br/>Overall, Da 5 Bloods is crafted with vigour, told with intensity, and expertly merges the politics of then with now to point out the African-American struggle that's been ongoing since forever. A tension-fuelled & emotionally charged cinematic ride that intertwines social commentary with genre thrills, Da 5 Bloods is as relevant as it is timely and although erratic & messy at times, it is amongst the better films of 2020."
"Calaverasgrande","4","3","7","14 June 2020"," Great message, poor execution. We needed this at this time.
","This movie had a lot of potential. Both in the story to tell about black men's experience in Vietnam. And also the systemic racism in their home country of America.
The movie fails pretty badly.
There are a lot of great poetic juxtapositions of the story against historical events and statements by historical people like Rev.Dr Martin Luther King jr, Angela Davis etc. But there is an in ability of the editor (or the director leaning over the editors shoulder) to cut a scene when it has told it's story. Many scenes run minutes past when they should have concluded. One scene towards the end runs about 10 minutes past when it should have wrapped up and gotten out of the way!
There are also a few problems with the plot that are hard to ignore. Character motivations and behavior just do not make sense.
Also, I have to say this is not the first movie by Spike Lee where the non-black characters are reduced to cartoonish stereotypes. It's odd because elsehwhere in the film Spike goes to pains to show the famous quote by Muhammad Ali about Vietnam, and have his characters repeat words to the same effect multiple times. That VIetnamese and Black people have more in common than not.
Yet the Vietnamese characters in this movie are at the least mildy stereotyped. At the worst, played for cheap laughs.
Then there is the ending. I will not spoil the ending except to say, be prepared. The movie ends about 10 times in a row. Just stay in your seat until the credits roll. It will trick you!
I think Spike operated under the mistaken assumption that this being a straight to Netflix release meant he did not have to worry about running length. In a normal release they may worry that a running length longer than normal reduces the number of possible screenings a day. So it will be harder to recoup investment.
Of course watching at home on Netflix, we are all conditioned to expect 45-50 minutes of entertainment. Stretches longer than that have us longing for the pint in the icebox.<br/><br/>Basically I find it hard to imagine this is the same director of She's Gotta have it, Do the Right Thing, and Clockers.
Those movies had pacing, character development and plot. This movie doesn't."

"saadanathan","8","5","15","14 June 2020"," Well achieved film 8/10
","Spike Lee is known for his political movies, sometimes I like them and sometimes I don't know what to say about them. I believe in every movie if his he has to criticize America and everyone's action. Even at the end of the movie you see the movie focuses on today's events in America which i would have preferred to put aside and focus on the story itself. Not politics. With that being said I loved this film. The script was genius and original. Characters who feel real and audience can identify with them. Chadwick Boseman's character Stormin Norman is probably the best character Spike Lee wrote. Cool, leader, brave and smart. The heart of the squad. Without him the group felt lost and you can see on screen how lost they are without his guidance. Another problem I found with this film was the flashbacks to the Vietnam war: in those flashbacks, the group of veterans are seen fighting along their leader Norman. But Norman is young while the others are still old just like in the main timeline. It's like watching ""The Irishman"" but with no de - aging. There are no young stunts playing the characters and no makeup, nor CGI in order to make them look young. I don't know if it's on purpose but it affects the movie really bad. There are a lot of other characters in the movie that don't have much value and so you're not surprised that they are dead. Overall I loved the movie, Paul, Otis, Eddie and Melvin are great and funny characters that fans could identify with easley. A fine cast of actors and good cinematography along with nice editing with footage and videos of the past."

"adeckofcards","7","5","15","13 June 2020"," Read between lines
","Over the years, Spike Lee has earned his place as one of the most important contemporary directors. Mainly recognized for dealing with racial issues in his films, a key that he plays again with 'Da 5 Bloods'.
The film tells the story of four Vietnam veterans who years later return to find the remains of one of their companions and also a large amount of gold that they hid during the war. Basically that's the storyline in the first half because then Spike Lee makes such a sudden and implausible turn in the story that it doesn't stand on its own. This twist is probably the worst thing that could have been done to continue the story and if it were just that, the movie would be completely disposable. Fortunately, it has a lot to sustain itself through social criticism, the characters it includes and the background of the film, which ends up being really interesting.
It is not the best Spike Lee movie at all, but despite its weak plot, the message behind it and that unfortunately goes to the background, is the best. Although to get to it you have to read between the lines."

","Spike lee does it again with another great film. The performances from the main cast is fun and the chemistry is great.Delroy Lindo deserves an Oscar nom for his performance. It deals with unique subject matter and perspectives. For the commentary and how the film explores racial issues regarding to veterans in particular, I give da 5 Bloods a 10/10. My problems with this film are more minor but still bugged me . The cinematography did not feel confident throughout the whole film . Some shots look great with a distinct style and vision and some shots just feel lazy. For the most part I actually enjoyed the way the plot turns out. It does feel a little Tarantino esc at times but thats a good thing. Some of the minor characters that appear in the film really bug me and I don't understand their purpose. They gave good performances but just they're presence in the film hurts the tone and kind of took me out . Their parts of the film doesn't have much relevance and I would say a good 20 minutes couldve been chopped out of the film.
Overall it's still a great movie ðŸ‘Œ Like always spike lee dives deeper into civil issues than you can find from almost any Hollywood director. There is a ton to take away from this film and it is entertaining through and through. I can understand why some people wouldn't enjoy this film but it is undeniably a great one."
"meurernick","9","4","11","15 June 2020"," Spike has done it again!
","While the movie is a bit long, that's the only problem with the movie. Da 5 Bloods is about Vietnam, but the way Spike directed and wrote this, it seemed very relevant to today. Using clips throughout history, as well as pictures was a fascinating way to show the how African Americans have been treated in American history. Even though he wasn't in it for a long time, Chadwick Boseman still left an impact on the film. Everyone did great acting wise, definitely gonna be a SAG ensemble award contender. Paul (Delroy Lindo) and David (Jonathan Majors) are definitely on the road to numerous award races. The editing was fantastic to show the switch between current day and back in the 70s. From the clear picture, to the more grainy video. So good. We have a big contender for the Oscars and so many more award races."
"cjamesdueck","7","4","11","14 June 2020"," Spike's charm saves it
","I'm not a huge Spike Lee fan- I think his large output has been very hit or miss, with little in between. But now in his later years that might be changing. With BlackkKlansmen and now Da 5 Bloods, he seems to have hit a stride with these relaxed, fun, perfectly enjoyable films.<br/><br/>While I find Spike's activism admirable, I don't like preachy films. It's lazy to beat an audience over the head with your message. This movie is very guilty of that laziness and it is eye-rollingly hokey at times.<br/><br/>That said, Delroy Lindo was hilarious and it was a pleasure to see him and Spike collaborate again. The techniques used such as changing aspect ratios and fourth wall breaking monologues only work when the tone isn't restrictive. I'm not blown away by this movie, and I wasn't moved by it, but as a comedy I thought it worked well enough."

It distracted also from the emotional connection of seeing before and after. It would have given a higher reaction to the ending revelations. Crazy how it turned out but fitting.

"minhphuong-47398","2","0","0","8 July 2020"," I really really wanted to love this film :(
","Maybe I set my standards too high before watching the film and that is why it was a deception to me, but I really wanted to love this film. From the Vietnam war theme to the Afro-American point of view on this conflict, I was to eager to find out how Spike Lee would tell us this story especially after watching the trailer that only got my expectations even higher.<br/><br/>However, after 20 minutes of film, it was really difficult for me to finish it (but I did force myself !). Which is really a pity. It is such a waste of good ideas. There were lots of elements that were in the film and I was very pleased to see them there but... how to say this? It is like having a very good story to tell but telling it in a way that is cringey, cheesy and almost boring to people...<br/><br/>So in favor of this film, I would say that it had good ideas : the theme, mixing the historical facts in it with authentic clips...<br/><br/>But the way the story was told...
In the trailer, it was a juxtaposition of historical clips and present day film and it worked ! It was entrancing, I wanted to know more about these people, what did they do exactly ? How important were they in the conflict?<br/><br/>But in the film... It was the same as if I was shown powerpoint slides on these same people and it lost its charm. You know, it's a bit like sometimes, some teachers at school make you love some subjects, while countless others make you feel very bored with endless slides even when the subject is actually one of your passion. This was the same thing for me.<br/><br/>Another major thing in the film I didn't like is the fact that there were no dimension to the supporting characters. I mean, yes it is literally called ""supporting characters"", but I felt so clearly that the other characters were just a ""tool"" for the story to move forward. Let's take for example the Vietnamese guide Vinh. Of course in the Vietnamese culture, people try to not be resentful towards American citizens and even forgive the GIs that killed Vietnamese people and among them their brothers, sisters, parents, children...Because it is in their culture to do so. But even if that's the case, they are still human. How could someone be as calm as if it was someone else's story when someone insult you or say really bad things making you the one that killed their comrades while your own father went to the same war and lost his brother and maybe his arms and legs?<br/><br/>And this is not all with this character, in the end of the film he is just there to help the main characters as if he didn't have his own opinion. Or maybe he is just really greedy but he didn't hesitate even a second when the ""bad"" Vietnamese came there to shoot everyone and take the gold, he immediately shot them back.
He knew on which side he was. But in reality would that decision be so easy to take ? Or would he rather flee ? Or beg the other Vietnamese ? Because it was not his business after all, he didn't owe the main characters anything. And facing death, I wonder if this was a realistic portrayal of human emotions.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the dialogues... They were so flat...and cheesy. Especially the ones involving a Vietnamese or more. I have to recognize the effort of putting grammatically correct and well pronounced Vietnamese language in the film. The dialogues though are like a ""google translate"" version of a western dialogue. And when these original western dialogues are already cheesy, you know that it can't get better with a translation to another language.
Indeed, each country has its language and culture. And the language is like a way to express how people behave according to their cultures, beliefs etc. People in Europe don't show their emotions or talk like people in Africa, and that's the same thing with every country we can find in the world. So when you know some of Vietnamese culture or East Asian cultures, you will know that there are some things that people don't say because of their cultures.
It is really really rare for example for a mother to say to her daughter ""I love you, good night"" as if it was something said every nights and then kiss on the forehead. Words have weight. Especially in this culture. While this seems normal for an occidental family situation, in a Vietnamese family, when a mother says ""I love you"" to her child... there is something wrong : they will never ever see each other again, or for a long long long time, or the mother will die in 5 minutes...And this result in some cringey feelings for the people that understand Vietnamese cultures. What I want to say is not every culture show feelings and emotions the same way. When some American would tell their daughters they love them 3 times per day, a Vietnamese mother will show her love by making her diner for example or doing some small services.<br/><br/>A last thing that annoyed me are the references they tried to put in the film. Like the Ride of the Valkyrie reminding once again Apocalypse Now when they go into the jungle for ""the beginning"" of the adventure.... I don't know why but that was really cringey :/ . I think what annoyed me is that they wanted to relate (too much?) to the audience which knows in majority this soundtrack and where it comes from. But it seems too forced upon me.<br/><br/>To end this ""rant"" ^^ (I am sorry if I sound really negative) I was so disappointed with the storytelling of the film. It had good elements but the way it was directed, the dialogues, the editing, were a sad no for me. Artistically, I was not convinced."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","8","0","0","8 July 2020"," Won't convert non-fans of Spike Lee, but I thought it was one of his best yet
","I've never disliked a Spike Lee movie, but I'm often a little mixed (Black KKKlansman for example had some great stuff, but I couldn't quite get it to 4/5 personally).<br/><br/>This one surprised me by how much I liked it. It's impressive because it doesn't feel like a movie made by a man in his 60s- there's a real energy and vibrancy to it. I haven't seen all his movies, and might need to reflect on it a little more, but this is second only to his classic Do The Right Thing, in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's very well-paced for a 2.5 hour movie, with an opening third that is comparatively slower (but still important as far as setup goes), it's beautifully shot (a couple of slightly clunky CGI effects shots aside), the acting is amazing, and on top of having the political and societal commentary one expects out of a Spike Lee film, it's also just a very engaging, oftentimes very intense, character driven story.<br/><br/>It satisfies very well as both a piece of entertainment and as a work of art intended to give its audience some food for thought.
I could see complaints against a lack of subtlety- however, he's highlighting many issues that shouldn't still be cultural problems, so maybe that lack of nuance is somewhat justified.<br/><br/>And it's not a criticism, more a warning that it is a particularly violent war movie. There's some brief Vietnam War footage in the opening and then also about 2/3s of the way through, that is definitely intended to shock and disturb.<br/><br/>The length and confronting themes/images mean it's not for everyone, but for fans of Spike Lee- or anyone wanting to see something dramatically satisfying yet also sometimes quite unconventional- it's a must watch."

","Da 5 Bloods<br/><br/>It is bad. Really bad.
I am seeing a Spike Lee movie after decades. It makes me wonder, has he lost his touch. Or was he always a mediocre director.
Every scene seems so very contrived and uncomfortable.
When he plays ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as the boat makes it way up the river, trying to parody the famous scene from ""Apocalypse Now"", it did not evoke sardonic humour, it just made us realise how very pathetic this movie was.
What is most comical is the corny soundtrack. During each moment of drama, the corny John Wayne music comes on, destroying any poignancy of the scene.
I would have given up an hour ago, but I plan to see it to the end, just on account of da bro Spike Lee.

","Da Five Bloods is the new Spike Lee film on Netflix. I have a bit to say about it. There are some very poignant and powerful messages , images and information in the film that are told in true Spike Lee fashion. The main message is that Black veterans fought in Vietnam for freedoms that they didn't even receive in their own country. However, the film seems to take a bizarre road from a very obvious point about halfway through. Suddenly it turns into some Chuck Norris and Dolomite low budget Vietnam Blaxploitation movie with a script that is so horrendous and corny that it's absolutely hilarious. This extreme shift in genre left me with such mixed feelings , because I was laughing at a film with such serious messages which worked so well in Jo Jo Rabbit but it just didn't work half as well in this film. This is a Vietnam action adventure satire with strong political messages. I'm sorry to say that I'd have to give this film only a 2 Star rating but saying that , I'm really glad I saw it. This is Apocalypse Now, Jewel of the Nile, Chuck Norris (Missing in Action), The Expendables , Dolomite and The Room all rolled into one film. Absolutely horrendous and hilarious with an important message thrown in and some really graphic images and real footage. What a roller coaster of a film. The strangest film experience I've had this year ðŸŽž"
"Lilu33","1","0","0","5 July 2020"," Watch a documentary instead
","I wanted to like this so bad. Unfortunately I was left quite angry at how bad it was.<br/><br/>If you want to learn about black soldiers in the Vietnam war I would advise watching a documentary and learning about black history and culture. This is so badly done that it will more likely turn people away from learning more on the subject, not because of any of the message itself but because the entire film is so awkward and unwatchable that anyone open to learning about the subject will instead run for the hills due to this clumsy story.<br/><br/>Also please don't lower yourself to believing that people who don't like this film are all racists or don't understand the cultural references. Cultural references don't make a film good to watch alone, you need cultural references AND a good script, characters which pull you into the story and accurate details especially when it's a film about war.<br/><br/>The military details need to be on point. If these details aren't in place then it makes them completely unbelievable as soldiers which distracts from the entire film. I can't comprehend why when making a film about war, it's directed without any effort being put into this part of it. This is such a basic of filmmaking that it almost feels insulting to the military and to soldiers of any race. This is an equally important part of the film, they are black SOLDIERS and yet the director completely lets them down in making them believable soldiers. This is just one of the many issues plaguing this film as well as wooden acting in some parts, badly scripted in many parts, terrible action scenes, lazy plot such as randomly stumbling across the gold and then asking if they are in the right coordinates, then agreeing this is the exact right place. If this was the right place and you've been following the map then you would already know you have reached your destination, I mean you're military men so you would know right? A quick look at the map and oh yes we are actually in the exact right place. The music was culturally significant but used in a way that distracted from the scene rather than enhanced it. Most decisions in the film in fact had this effect, distracting rather than enhancing making it very difficult to like even when trying so hard to like it all the film all the way through. I think this is why I was so angry by the end. I kept giving it chances and it just kept throwing them away one by one.<br/><br/>I advise for anyone thinking about watching this that you may well regret it. However, please watch it and make up your own mind. Some people may like the feel of the film but I know many won't because there are so many issues distracting in every scene that it's very difficult to sink into. Many parts are so bad that I can only guess that they must have been done on purpose to create a certain sort of feeling. If so then fair enough but understand that the feeling it actually creates is very cringey, disconnected and boring to sit through for most people. If you're going to take a risk like that then don't insult viewers by calling anyone that doesn't like it racist. To do so is disgusting especially if it's been made to be purposely clumsy and awkward for the viewer. People are allowed to dislike a film regardless of the subject matter if its filmed in such an odd way. It was also comedic in parts, so much so that it took away from the weight of the more serious parts. Even when people are dying it has a strange comedy element to it in a way which completely distracts from the gravity of them dying but not enough to make in genuinely funny. This mixed with the historical clips flashing through the film make for a really crap vibe for the film as it was constantly floating in limbo with no clear direction as to what the film is itself, even though the message was there. The gravity of the clips and the history were the best parts as was some of the acting but unfortunaltely they felt wasted in the confused feel of the film and couldn't make up for all the negatives.<br/><br/>All this is why I would recommend watching a documentary instead. You would learn much more and have a more interesting 2.5 hours just being told the real facts of the war rather than watching this bizarre film. All films are subjective so please bear in mind that people who have a different opinion aren't necessarily doing so because of an agenda. I found it difficult to believe at first that anyone could have genuinely enjoyed the film and weren't giving it 10/10 because of the background alone and not based on the film at all. However everybody is different and they obviously enjoyed all the things I hated, that is human nature for you, ones trash is another's treasure so just watch for yourself and don't worry about what other people think of your opinion on the film. You are allowed to like or dislike it without it saying anything significant about you as a person."
"joneskee1911","1","0","0","3 July 2020"," I Want Netflix's Money Back for Their Sake
","I reactivated my IMDB account because I was so utterly disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>I don't even know where to start, honestly. As an Black veteran, I was really looking forward to this movie, but had to end the movie after 1 hour! Spike Lee had no direction in this movie. He and the writers try to tackle *way* too many issues. There is the issue of PTSD in veterans; the issue of Vietnam veterans getting no recognition; the issue of racism in the Vietnam-era US military; the myriad of issues surrounding the civil rights movement in the US; the issue of MLK Jr.'s death; the issue President Trump; the issue of landmines left over in Vietnam; the issue of reconciliation with an enemy from 50 years prior; the issue of Black history being underrepresented; the issue of 'the ugly American' and I am sure a few more would have popped up if I continued the movie.<br/><br/>The issues Spike Lee should have focused on should have been: getting unknown and better-known actors to understand the objective of their character; ironing out the story line, GETTING YOUNGER ACTORS TO PLAY THE CHARACTERS when they went to their flashback scenes--if it is supposed to make an allusion to the idea that Norman will always stay young because he is dead, so be it, but at least make the characters look a little younger (Spike Lee used the same actors for the characters in their flashback scenes as when they are in old age as though they were some weird Benjamin Button/Twilight characters). Oh, and we get it Spike Lee, you don't like Donald Trump--P.S. a lot of people don't--but having a scene where a character literally calls Trump a ""Klansman"" while standing up at a table full of people in a bar while holding up his right hand is not even a little bit clever. Spike Lee may as well have broken the 4th wall, inserted a clip of Spike Lee saying ""I hate Donald Trump,"" to the audience and it would have been less cringe-worthy than that scene.<br/><br/>The acting is god-awful. Actors are stepping on each others' lines, constantly betraying what their character's objective and emotion is, and very rarely act with any real deliberate movements. Delroy Lindo had played very good roles previously, but Spike Lee clearly did his career no favors with this ""joint"". Delroy Lindo's acting during a scene when he is supposed to be having a PTSD-induced panic attack left me very confused about what was actually going on. Spike Lee clearly did not consult any military or psychology professionals while making this movie. I am not sure if you can even blame Delroy Lindo since it is the director's (Spike Lee) responsibility and duty to say 'hey we missed the mark on this take, let's do it again but we we need to do...instead.' or even 'hey, maybe this PTSD scene in the floating market will be too difficult and expensive to pull off, let's rewrite the scene to when we are on land and where it is cheaper.'<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of the movie was the few little snippets of information about black history. I have seen better movies made by college film undergrads than this movie. If anything this movie was rushed to screen during the most recent protests as Netflix's sad attempt to virtue signal and gain more subscribers. Ultimately, this movie will go down as Spike Lee's worst movie. How he went from BlackKklansman to this is beyond me."

","I was left confused after watching this movie as critics were praising this movie. It had some good moments but it was also all over the place going from good scene to boring, by the book scene. The highlight for me was the reminder of how pointless the war in Vietnam was. Showing some of the brutal violence and atrocities it feels like a bizarre wake-up call of what is really happening in the world. As the war was before my time I remember only seeing the protests and talks about it on television. The gravity of the situation didn't really hit me until I watched this movie. So it definitely was eyeopening.
What added to the weirdness is that the war which seemed so important then seems so pointless and ignorant in 2020. Made me think about how many of the recent wars will eventually be looked back on as being a foolish mistake.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is plagued by all over the place directing and a movie that is too long. A few good scenes, an especially memorable scene by Delroy Lindo and some powerful history but the movie is also drowning in an abundance of boring, by the book scenes.

","Delroy Lindo is due an Oscar for his performance as Paul, the angriest of the 'Da 5 Bloods'. This means the film is much better than some of the low rankings I have seen on this site. Its strength is its allegory about black men who came of age in the 1960s and the lessons it can teach a younger generation. Paul (Lindo) has anger management issues and is ill-informed, of the three other Vietnam vets one takes opiods, one is a drunk and one a businessman who lost his fortune from spending foolishly. Spike Lee gives each of them redemption, but the redemption he offers Paul is off the charts, a truly moving scene (I think his name is a nod to St Paul). The film's weaknesses are well documented on this site; Lee suspends incredulity again and again with simplistic plot devices and cardboard cut-out side characters. But, Delroy Lindo (and Spike Lee's direction of him) saves the film."

","A group of Vietnam veterans (Bloods) go back to the jungle to retrieve a cargo of gold, that they had secured during the Vietnam war. They are also there to retrieve the remaining of Norman, a lost member of the Bloods, to give him a proper resting place back home. Conflict arises when a group of Vietnamese gunmen find out about the gold.<br/><br/>The fact that i can write the synopsis without the word ""racism"" bothers me. It feels like Spike Lee's social commentary was added in, after the script was already written. This doesn't make the commentary less true, it just feels less connected to the narrative and the central conflict. It feels like the social commentary can be stripped from the movie and you would still have a simple action story that works. About Vietnam veterans going years later back to the ""dangerous"" jungles of Vietnam. That said I think it's an important message and something that is not talked about a lot, I myself was not aware of the racism that took place during the Vietnam war. Racism, a problem that is still present all over the world and especially in the USA. I just wished the movie showed more of the racial inequalities during the Vietnam war, instead of only talking about them.<br/><br/>Spike Lee is not someone who shies away of making his point clear and being direct. One example of this is the real life imagery of the Vietnam war, this made me think. Is it morally wrong to use real imagery of the war, in a film that is more concerned with telling a generic action story instead of telling a realistic story. A realistic story about the horrible things that happened there and the innocent lives that were lost. To be clear, I have no problems with graphical imagery as long as it serves a purpose, like in a documentary. Here the imagery only seems to function as shock value, it has no function in the overall narrative. It is not connected to the central conflict in any way. We don't get context so it's not really informative. Where ""Do The Right Things"" felt like one coherent movie because its themes and social commentary were concerning the central conflict of the movie and the final choice of the protagonist, this just feels like an action movie with an important message slapped on. This ""action movie"" feeling is most apprehend in the final shootout scene, it felt a bit over the top for a movie that was trying to say important things. Why is the conflict of the movie, that has a message of anti-violence, resolved with violence. This movie could have said so much more.<br/><br/>The movie is technically good. I enjoyed the different aspect ratios for different time periods. I enjoyed the cinematography overall. Acting, editing, sound and mise-en-scène were good, but nothing really standing out.

"elicopperman","8","0","0","23 June 2020"," PTSD from the POV of Scarred Black Lives
","PTSD comes in all wavering factors, whether from psychological abuse, or childhood trauma, or especially fighting in a deadly war between countries. In the case of the latest Spike Lee joint, Da 5 Bloods, this flick really delves into how the effects of the Vietnam War can screw up the lives of individuals, specifically African Americans. The fact that this film was released when a jingoistic arrogant prejudiced white man is still in America's office pretending to run things adds into the hypocrisies commonplace in the land of the free. Just when we think a war is over, it comes back in ways we would never expect.<br/><br/>The story centers around a group of aging Vietnam War veterans who return to said country in search of both their late squad leader and a treasure they buried while serving there. From the getco, the movie is driven just as much by its characters as its plot, maybe a little more so, mainly due to their individual personalities. Although these veterans served in the army, they all came out differently, such as Otis (Clarke Peters) having a more lenient soft spot for the country personally, Eddie (Norm Lewis) having achieved success after his time, or Melvin (Isiah Whitlock jr.) being the sardonic jokester of the group. However, the biggest standout would have to be the aggressively ill-tempered Paul, elevated through an all-star performance by Delroy Lindo. In addition to having a rocky relationship with his son David (Jonathan Majors), who tags along on the crew's journey, the amount of anger seethed inside him from serving such an unnecessary war practically poisons him into becoming his own villain. You know a cast is intriguing when you debate whether to root for these elders or not.<br/><br/>But what would be a solid search movie without a good amount of foes to add into the tension? In the case of Da 5 Bloods, for every trustworthy component like the group's guide Vinh (Johnny Tri Nguyen), and Otis' former flame Tien (Le Y Lan), there are the more shady opponents attempting to be in the way of them. For instance, the shady French businessman Desroche (Jean Reno), plays up the heist well in manipulating the men into their journey under false pretenses of payback (th French were also fairly ruthless in Vietnam mind you). Along the way, the group meet up with foreign experts like French woman Hedy Bouvier (Mélanie Thierry), Simon (Paul Walter Hauser) and Seppo (Jasper Pääkkönen), who all seem superfluous until the film's latter half raises up the violence and stakes to frightening results. All throughout the feature, these side characters play key factors in either playing along the main group's goals or trying to do anyway with them, emphasizing who to trust and who not to trust in an otherwise divisive traumatized pack of veterans.<br/><br/>Throughout the feature, Lee cleverly intertwines stock footage to emphasize the tangents in the main story and the media brought during the war's period. Whether it'd be used to parallel the speeches of famous icons like Martin Luther King or Muhammad Ali between the poor Vietnamese citizens vs the poor Blacks, or to add in to how little has changed since these disgusting war years, this footage can often come at the expense of making viewers, based on their race and class, think long and hard about the effects that this period had on America. Another fascinating filmmaking choice is shooting the flashback sequences of the group and the aforementioned Norman on 16mm and without making the actors look young, possibly indicating that the Bloods never truly left Vietnam (as Vinh pointed out) due to how much it came back to haunt them all. If there is any notable flaw in the movie, it's that perhaps the 2.5 hour runtime can be rather tiresome depending on the viewer's interest, and the few moments of humor don't always mesh well with the overall serious tone.<br/><br/>It's not often when a war film really goes into the harsh realities of American citizens who were affected by its country through a pointless battle worse than others. Da 5 Bloods stands as a bold and brutally honest feature about America's perception of Blackness that seems to have lingered on since 1619, ""whether in heroic situations or human ones,"" (Odie Henderson). Whether you're a Spike Lee fan, a war-movie buff or are interested in viewing pro-black media during these crazy times, this is right up your alley. After all, what does it really mean to be a war hero at the end of the day?"
"Sycamorish","5","0","0","23 June 2020"," An honourable failure
","I really love Spike Lee and probably subscribe to 90% of his politics but this film didn't work for me and didn't seem to succeed on its own terms. I think it deserves praise for aiming quite high and taking creative risks and there were scenes and ideas that were effective and stayed with me despite the issues. Hence, it's an honourable failure.<br/><br/>Firstly, as noted elsewhere tonally this film leaps a lot. I think this is deliberate as a way of showing the way the characters relive and misremember their wars. It's probably the most post modern war film I've seen in a while. One very interesting device is swapping to the cheesy soundtracks, grainy look and aspect ratio of an 80s action film. It's constantly reminding us how Hollywood retconned Vietnam with it's own myth making.<br/><br/>That would be fine in itself if there wasn't also the attempt to go one further and juxtapose the Hollywood dream version with really graphic documentary footage of the sort that Ken Burns used unflinchingly in his Vietnam series. I was most struck by a lingering shot of a small child with their face blown off and could see that Lee wanted this to have a huge impact. I think Lee wanted the audience to ask what we wanted to see - violence as entertainment or something darker.<br/><br/>The point is if you're going to go there, you need to handle the rest of the film as seriously or at least succeed absolutely in balancing elements of farce and exploitation with real life atrocities.<br/><br/>And this is where the flippant nature of the action adventure stuff undercut the serious themes to the point where it started feeling disrespectful or exploitative rather than challenging. The most glaring example was introducing the mine removal squad when they did which basically took any of the pathos out of the jungle walk as it became all about ""who will step on the mine"", and even played it up by having a character make a big campy speech while walking back into the undergrowth to meet the inevitable splatter. This was so telegraphed as it HAD to be played for laughs, but then immediately followed by a gory aftermath and a tense situation where another character had to escape the same fate. Despite being a film about PTSD, minutes later everyone (even the non vets) were apparently over the horror.<br/><br/>I do think this cutting between modes of telling the Vietnam story is deliberate and overall the film probably works best when seen as a collage of impressions of war, trauma and entertainment but that does mean it's pretty much the antithesis of good story telling."
"bornthespian-08995","7","0","0","23 June 2020"," Forced Production..?
","Just seemed like it wasn't a genuine Spike Lee film. Don't believe Spike used his ""go-to"" production team. Signature camera angles, dialogue, and score seemed very forced. It was a decent forgery. Spike may have been behind the wheel, but it was definitely Netflix that financed the boat and it's crew. Nevertheless, it's worth a watch. Lots of entertaining moments and the message is there, as Spike would always have. And no, Spike Lee isn't ""losing it"". Because the BlackKKKlansman was the real deal and that flick was very recent. It's just that Netflix productions are hit or miss, doesn't matter who's attached."
"julesfrench","6","0","0","22 June 2020"," Entertaining and fun, but oddly flawed
","I enjoyed this film, but it had an oddly rushed/throwaway quality to it. BlackKlansman, Spike's previous film, is far superior, and yet it's only 7.5 vs 6.7 for ""Bloods"" in IMDB. This film was 30-45 minutes too long. The interaction between the friends strained credulity--very warm one moment, at gunpoint the next. the pigeon-toed guy who footed the bill for the trip...he never would've made it in the Army. 4-F, no doubt! You don't traipse aimlessly around certain fields once you KNOW they are dangerous.and the flashback sequences seemed faxed in. So....not really believable, and yet it was a fun, entertaining film. It's interesting that the characters are named for the Temptations. It does convey the idea that those that served continue to live w/ their experience in Vietnam. Still, it has a made for TV feel to it that has me confused. As a Stones fan, I'll made the analogy that comparing Da Bloods to BlackKlansman is like comparing the Stones' classic ""Let it Bleed"" to enjoyable modern Stones albums like ""Voodoo Lounge"" Fun, but not much magic."

","I've always taken user reviews on IMDb with a pinch of salt. Too often people have watched a film that is not up to their taste or intellectual interest. They then post a destructive and equally misleading review out of annoyance. Before watching Da 5 Bloods I had quick look at the downbeat opinions of this film and thought, yes more of the same uninformed trashing, or even trolling, of what should be a smart and thought provoking movie. Sadly, on this occasion they were right.<br/><br/>Like others here, I too have great respect for Spike Lee and was expecting a film equal to his honest and outspoken political views. But this isn't it. As has already been said, it's a mess. It is entertaining in parts but there are too many ideas, at least two too many subplots and a lazy expectation that the viewer will accept weird concepts such as the main protagonists looking exactly the same before and after fifty years have passed. Or that a war-baby daughter born circa 1970 would be around twenty-seven years old now in the time of President Trump. That along with the all too obvious ad-libbing going on between the otherwise brilliant cast underlines the kind of lack of discipline that the younger Spike Lee would have scoffed at.<br/><br/>Earlier Vietnam War films were referenced in criticism or homage; Rambo, Apocalypse Now. But a prominent, and completely unnecessary, plot twist actually reminded me of Tropic Thunder; a film which blatantly satirises Hollywood's sidelining of black actors (in the shape of Robert Downey jr's character's outrageous use of black face). In that film and this a remnant if the past is triggered in exactly the same way and the cast are sucked into a mini re-run of the Vietnam War complete with bloodthirsty Quasi-Vietcong stereotypes on their tail. I don't feel good making that comparison this is a Spike Lee film after all!<br/><br/>There is a good movie in there, it just needs a really good re-cut!"

","I expect more from Spike Lee. Multiple themes and genres overlapped. The main characters are (mostly) relatable, but the conclusion left me wondering what Lee had hoped I would have taken from the story. Certainly there was the point that America (White America) was horrible to black American soldiers, let alone Vietnam people who are, as always (although apparently not believed by enough people), just normal humans, like us. I would (unfairly) characterize that as the ""Black People Suffering Racism from White America"" theme. But there were other theme/genres that fought to be remembered. Vietnam War biopic. Adventure/Action guy movie. Bad father/Hurt son drama. Documentary on non-American NGO work to clean the mess America made. Boy-girl will-they-won't-they.<br/><br/>It was a soup of a Spike Lee Joint. Sometimes soup is what you need. But with a world-class chef, you'd hope the soup would have something that makes it memorable. This one... well, I wish it had less in it, so that it would have had more."

","Director Spike Lee's latest offering focusing on four Black Americans who served in Vietnam.

I must say that this film is not one of Lee's best but the performances are great especially Delroy Lindo, who has to confront his demons. It's not a good experience for all of them. As in this time of the Trump Age, racial tensions and the Covid, it does point out that we have alot to do and a long way to go in the 21st century. We have a long way to go. As well for the other veterans (Clarke Peters, Jonathan Majors and Norm Lewis) They're willing to risk anything to recover the hidden treasure. It's fight for survival. Great cinematography with Lee appreciating Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic. Apocalypse Now (1979) and you do see it. With using Marvin Gaye tracks from his ""What's going on?"" album, you can relate as you view the film. To conclude this, I do like this film though are few flaws.

","This is an opinion piece, I realise that some movies and opinions accompanying these - are often judged in the context of American identity politics. As I am uninterested in these matters, i will try to judge this movie on its merits and only refer to political issues when they are included in the movie itself.<br/><br/>Those of you familiar with Spike Lee will know exactly to expect - subtlety, depth and nuance is not part of Lees storytelling arsenal.<br/><br/>Instead he opts for a very simple and effective emotional way of telling his stories. His protagonist are, for the most part, poor oppressed victims while his antagonist are one-dimensional bigoted ignoramuses.<br/><br/>Lees movies aims to tell you what to feel and when to feel, by pitting 2 visually very diffrent groups against each other. Like Camerons Avatar (2009) or most of the formulaic 90s sports movies, the audience are never trusted to do any interpretation on their own and the bad guys are never given any motivation, beyond being evil for the sake of being evil.<br/><br/>I was very excited when I heard that Spike Lee was to make a film set in Vietnam, following a group of American vets and that the film was to be presented to an international audience on a global streaming service.<br/><br/>Would this well established director have a diffrent approach when telling a story set on an international stage presented to an international audience. Or would he stick to his simple brand og good vs bad story-telling. Train-wreck or masterpiece I was in for a uniquely entertaining experience - or so i hoped.<br/><br/>I was excited to see :<br/><br/>1) If Lee would depict an occupation force, who executed, raped and burned the population alive - as the good guys. A tough sell regardless of the pigmentation of your main characters.<br/><br/>2) Would the countless factions involved in the conflict be depicted with any nuance. A tough task for a filmmaker who usually equates physical features with motivation and character traits.<br/><br/>3) Who will the antagonists be - and will they have any motivation beyond loving money and hating the disenfranchised.<br/><br/>4) Would Lee be able to keep his on the nose comments on the current political landscape in America distract on a level where they weren't distracting.<br/><br/>A great scene involving one of the main characters (Paul, brilliantly played by Delroy Lindo) is confronted by a local man and his agressive sales tactic in one of Vietnams floating markets.<br/><br/>As the salesman gets more intrusive, Pauls demeanour changes to the point where gets up and screams a derogatory term used during the war, at the salesman.<br/><br/>The salesman recognise the term and recognise Paul as a G.I. The scene explodes when pinned up rage is released, the scene is incredible well acted, well constructed and thoroughly informed by the characters and the war they are both haunted by.<br/><br/>For the rest of the movie most Vietnamese are depicted as a faceless mob for our protagonists to mow down in a glorious Michael Bay-like glowing CGI-blood carnage.<br/><br/>Later on we are told how that Pauls rage and frustration is caused, not by the atrocities done to the Vietnamese, but by him accidentally shooting a squad-mate during the war. The guilt of this is he's motivation for returning to Vietnam, he seemingly want his fallen friend to have a proper burial back in America.<br/><br/>This motivation changes suddenly and without any explanation. And his motivation aligns with the rest of the main characters. Go back to Vietnam to retrieve a cache of gold for themselves, gold ment to pay the wages of their allied Vietnamese soldiers.<br/><br/>Beyond the faceless Vietnamese mowed down in flashbacks to the wa -r and at the movies climax. The main antagonist is a double-crossing, moustache twirling, Luger-carrying cartoon villain.<br/><br/>Finally a bit about Spike Lees political stuff. As I have no horse in the race, when it comes to American identity politics, I would normally refrain from commenting on this.<br/><br/>But as this is a Spike Lee movie, I find it impossible to review the movie without mentioning it.<br/><br/>To be clear, i much prefer the transparency of Lee´s on the nose commentary to the way soulless marketingteams, try to sell horrible lazy remakes by slapping on some trivial social justice message, after the fact.<br/><br/>But some of the things introduced here is a little jarring. Lee introduces a MAGA-hat early in the movie, anyone wearing the hat is brutally gunned down in a sea of red glowing CGI-blood.<br/><br/>There seems to be no consistant traits or ideology between the men wearing the hat.<br/><br/>The movies big cathartic moment is meant to be when our surviving protagonists smuggels the money out of Vietnam, and make a huge donation to the organisation Black Lives Matter. And what might to be a fictional french-owned minesweeper NGO.<br/><br/>The sequence concludes with a videoclip of Dr. Martin Luther King, and a crawl with information on his murder.<br/><br/>Some people might think that equating Dr. Kings peaceful movement with the BLM organisations activities is poor taste.<br/><br/>My conclusion is this, Spike Lees brand of simple moviemaking does not translate well to more nuanced settings and stories. One or to characters get enough screentime to be interesting - as a result of their strong acting-performances not the writing.<br/><br/>Most of the characters very hard to care about, as they are one-dimensional and have seemingly no motivation for their actions, beyond money.<br/><br/>A few interesting ideas are introduced, but are quickly abandoned.<br/><br/>Introducing a reallife organisation and suggesting that stealing money to fund their activities, feels problematic. Equating BLM with the peaceful work of Dr. Martin Luther King, feels like a misrepresentation of his movement.<br/><br/>Spike Lee still have an original voice, that alone makes this movie more entertaining than most of the sequels, prequels, soft reboots, genderswap reboots and generally bland entertainment released by Hollywood these years.<br/><br/>Strong performances elevate the material. But with its myriad of issues I fear this title will be forgotten as soon as Netflix remove the title from their slider."

","I personally really wanted to love this movie, the Vietnam era is great with its music and changes in culture. Some of the best films ever made have been about the Vietnam war. So I was readily anticipating its release.<br/><br/>The characters were interesting and you could feel the chemistry between them, Delroy Lindo was especially good playing the conflicted Paul his monologue into the camera was unusual and made you feel uncomfortable as if you had become a part of his mind. I also loved the change between the Vietnam war and present day in camera, colouring and the change in aspect ratio.<br/><br/>I don't understand why people hate the fact that the characters were not de-aged in the war, I think it helped you get attached to them and not separate them as two characters as who they are today was made in the war.
I thought the scene were David, Paul's son, was stuck on a mine was particularly good, drawn out and riddled with suspense.<br/><br/>However, the film is too long some scenes could be shorter and it could've been edited a lot better. My biggest pet peeve with it was how they discovered the gold, I mean what are the chances David would dig on the exact spot a gold bar was, it seemed too far-fetched.<br/><br/>Da 5 bloods is an interesting story, riddled with political messages but the themes don't resonate through as strongly as they should've and the ending scenes seemed disjointed from the rest of the film. It's an interesting watch, something that has to be felt instead of understood."

","This movie actually could have been much better, but because of its racially motivated theme against the ""white man"" and his white army this became boring and incredibly far fetched. It is very popular in our country right now to beat up on white America so Spike Lee doesn't disappoint in jumping on in the band wagon. It paints a picture that pretty much only black men died for their country's , and no white men were drafted and had unfortunate circumstances when it came to Vietnam war. I understand it's supposed to be a black power type film but that can be done without being so blatant towards the hatred for the white man.
Other than these racial points the film as a whole seemed very lazy in the writing and acting. It's not an incredibly original story at all, and towards the end of this marathon movie that became way to long it fell flat on its face. I think that the action scenes were not very well done and again very unrealistic. It was supposed to be an adventure type film but didn't quite hit its mark. I am usually a big Spike Lee fan , but this was one of his worst."
"lopresti-46927","6","4","12","13 June 2020"," Not Spike Lee's best but watchable
","So in terms of what I liked about it it had a decent story, most of the characters were well casted. I loved Paul (Delroy Lindo) and the other Bloods. They had good chemistry. The story was decent and pretty well written. The end with Stormin Norm and Paul really got me. Probably one of my favorite parts of the movie. The production value was good. Spike Lee knows how to make a good, visually pleasing movie. The sets and shot locations varied from bars and modern day shops to serene jungle locations.
What I didn't like about it was the pacing in the last 45 minutes, some of the characters, and the overall character development/arcs. They definitely could have shaved off about 15-20 minutes off the runtime. And I'm not talking about the 5 or so minutes of film from various famous African-Americans from history and the events that shaped their culture; there's a point behind that. The attacks by Deroche's men on the road and the temple were too drawn out, it could have been compressed by 15 minutes. Secondly, before I said I liked most of the actors, but I didn't think they should have casted Chadwick Bosemab as Stormin Norman. His American accent wasn't good. In terms of character development I didn't see much until the very end. For example, Paul was pretty much the same up until that memorable moment with stormin' norm.
All in all like it says in the title not one of Spike Lee's best but it is still watchable."

","""Da 5 Bloods"" sees Spike Lee continuing the late-career success that he began with ""The Black Klansman"" (2018). Like the previous film, this film comments upon American racism ""then and now"". Though this is Vietnam film, it is set mostly in present-day, with few flashbacks to the actual fighting. 33% of the American soldiers who fought in Vietnam were African-American, but they have been largely ignored by history. The film states this quite frankly with the black characters discussing the narrative of ""Rambo 2"" (1985). Lee's film honors the black soldiers, but also attacks the system they were sent to fight for. It is a fascinating picture that dodges simplified readings.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of four black Vietnam vets (Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis & Isiah Whitlock Jr.), who re-unite in Vietnam in present day. They have all been traumatized by the war to a different degree, especially by the experience of losing their commander (Chadwick Boseman) who served as a role model for them. The guys have been sent to locate his body, but they also have another motive for returning. I will not enclose more details about the plot, since there are all sorts of twists and turns here.<br/><br/>Spike Lee was inspired by both ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) and ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"" (1948) when making this film. The influence of both is very detectable, sometimes painfully so. I like Lee very much, but often it seems he is a director who needs someone to occasionally tell him ""no"". This film is like so many of his, partly great, but pushed down by sloppiness and bad choices. For instance, Lee makes several direct references to before-mentioned films, like playing ""Ride of the Valkyries"" without any point. I would like to enjoy the film as it is, but sometimes the signature style of the director just inserts these bumps to the road.<br/><br/>I think this film really shines in the depictions of the four leads and the African-American experience. One of the four is a Trump supporter, and Lee has plenty to say about that as well. I like the way this film, as well as ""Black Klansman"" tied themselves to present-day affairs, which made them feel more necessary. Here is a thing Lee's style is very good for, as he can stop the film and show you a documentary clip to keep you informed what the characters are talking about. Yet this film is also a tad overlong, and in the latter half strays in different narrative/thematic directions, which made the whole seem less focused. Also, this film starts off as an ambitious piece of cinema, but towards the ending tries to become a more entertaining action film almost. I didn't really care for this turn of events, but mostly this was a nice watch.<br/><br/>While this is nowhere near as good as ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Sierra Madre"", or ""Do the Right Thing"" or ""Malcolm X"" for that matter, I would recommend this to cinephiles. It is a film that will spark a hundred interesting conversations."

","I hadn't seen any of Spike Lee's films until BlackkKlansman came out in 2018, and I really enjoyed that film. I was excited for Da 5 Bloods just based on the synopsis alone, and it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>I usually talk about my positives first, but I have one negative and I want to get it out of the way upfront. The first half is way too long, and it contains a lot of filler which didn't need to be there. Nothing was bad, but a lot of it was unnecessary and it ruined the pacing. Thankfully, it really picks up in the second half and this issue was no longer present.<br/><br/>The acting is truly exceptional across the board. I wasn't too familiar with any of the actors, apart from Chadwick Boseman, but they all did a fantastic job. The characters were extremely layered, and it was nice exploring how past torments were still haunting them to this day.<br/><br/>The screenplay on the whole was wonderful, and Lee did a great job in the director's chair. I was never bored, and the narrative was constantly compelling. The musical score added to the tone in a fitting way, and the sound design was also something special.<br/><br/>Da 5 Bloods contains a lot of powerful messages, some of which are more relevant today than ever before. The interactions between the group were complex and often humorous, but it always remained realistic and I quickly grew to care for them and sympathise with what they had been through in the past. There were a lot of surprises throughout the film, and it all built to a gripping and emotional finalÃ©.<br/><br/>If the film had been trimmed down in the first half, I might be describing Da 5 Bloods as 2020's first masterpiece. It doesn't quite get there, but it's still an extremely high recommendation.<br/><br/>SCORE: 86%"

The most interesting thing about it are the clues that the French also had their Vietnam war and there's some French history left behind there.

"ksdouglas-23618","8","3","9","14 June 2020"," It's Basically 'Tropic Thunder' 2
","To be honest, this movie wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. I'm skeptical when it comes to Spike Lee movies, some aren't always his best. But this one is pretty alright. It held my attention from start to finish, and of course, it's loaded with overdramatic scenes of battle, which I felt was very deliberate in the first place.<br/><br/>As for the story of 'Da 5 Bloods' it's heavily reminiscent of 2008's 'Tropic Thunder' 1999's 'Three Kings' and it wouldn't surprise me if Lee got some inspiration from those movie. Despite being a comedy, 'Tropic Thunder' still sits as one of the best parodies of Vietnam War movies. But back to 'Da 5 Bloods, ' overall the story has that Shakespearean vibe to it that is common in some of Lee's films. Everything is purposely overdramatic but never melodramatic. The action scenes are parodies of 1980 Vietnam war movies. I think the runtime was unnecessarily long, but again, I think this was a nod to 'Apocalypse Now' with its ridiculously long runtime.<br/><br/>Everything put into this movie is a nod towards previous films, but at it's core, Lee showcases the trial and tribunals of the black soldiers who fought during the war. Of how their relationship with the war coalescent with social inequality back in the States, something black soldiers had had to juggle with since the Revolutionary War. It's a glaring and interesting dynamic.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel 'Da 5 Bloods' is a good Spike Lee film to get into."
"Cineanalyst","5","3","9","13 June 2020"," History Now
","""Da 5 Bloods"" is unmistakably a Spike Lee joint, but what is with Netflix and macho action movies set in a war-torn foreign land and featuring a heist or extraction of some kind. I mean, they comprise a significant block of their original releases of late and usually include a star taking a break from superhero flicks: ""6 Underground"" with Deadpool, ""Triple Frontier"" with Batman, ""The Red Sea Diving Resort"" with Captain America, all 2019, ""Extraction"" with Thor earlier this year and, now, here's Black Panther in Vietnam where his friends, fellow veterans and ""bloods"" are in search of gold to plunder. Oh well, credit to Lee and company for making a better movie than those prior ones. Unlike the others, ""Da 5 Bloods"" doesn't have the feel of merely exploiting an exotic locale and racial others, as it largely focuses on the Black veterans detestation of having fought in a war supposedly for freedom while lacking freedom back home, while a couple of the younger characters speak of choosing careers to assuage their guilt for their respective privileges. Moreover, there's a glimpse of modernized streets in Ho Chi Minh City, McDonald's and an ""Apocalypse Now"" themed club included, before the brothers in arms proceed into the jungle, with more than token representation throughout of Vietnamese characters, including interracial relationships, as well as of the French, the first Western colonizer of Indochina. Yet, evidence remains that this scenario was originally a predictable action-heist screenplay (the way one character conspicuously walks backwards in one scene--telegraphing what's about to happen especially bothers me) before Lee and company rewrote it for Black protagonists and introduced some rather unpredictable social commentary.<br/><br/>Indeed, Lee's racial didacticism is all over the place, ranging from Crispus Attucks to Martin Luther King Jr. and the present-day Black Lives Matter movement and the inclusion of a MAGA-hat-wearing, Trump-supporting member of the Bloods, but this scattered approach is somewhat supported by the premise of the characters revisiting their pasts, as well as by the historically-minded ones played by Chadwick Boseman and Jonathan Majors. As with much of Lee's oeuvre, as well as that of others, I'm less interested in simplistic lectures than in how such morals are supported stylistically. To my mind, such was the redeeming feature of Lee's last joint, ""BlacKkKlansmen"" (2018), which I found more interesting as a conflict between racist epics ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915) with ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939) against the Blaxploitation flicks of the 1970s, from which Lee paid homage with his film's style, than for any historical racial conflict or commentary on the Trump administration.<br/><br/>Something similar is done with the look of ""Da 5 Bloods"" sometimes resembling that of footage from the era of the American-Vietnam War, with images at times consequently appearing soft or colors overly saturated. Characters also use their own 8mm motion-picture and a still-photography cameras. Apropos to its subject matter, then, the style, from 8mm, to 16mm, to 35mm and still photographs, is all over the place, as are the shifting aspect ratios. Rather incongruent, however, is that the same actors play their younger selves without the sort of de-aging technology employed for Netflix's ""The Irishman"" (2019), although I don't much mind this otherwise if one understands the flashbacks as past episodes as remembered as opposed to being from the perspective of a hypothetical objective observer. Of course, there are also the usual Lee trademarks of raving monologues and double dolly shots (as well as the relatively new addition of casting Isiah Whitlock, Jr. to recite his catchphrase from ""The Wire"" HBO series). Meanwhile, the greater cinematic relfexivity of ""BlackKklansmen"" is replaced here in part by music and radio, with a Marvin Gaye-infused soundtrack and stinging radio propaganda from Hanoi Hannah (Veronica Ngo). While some critics will be concerned with how Lee captures some current zeitgeist, especially given the film's release during the protests currently taking place across the nation and the world as of this writing, ultimately more interesting methinks is whether this historically-minded film, as with his past work, will stand the test of time."

"shabanavdulaj","8","5","19","13 June 2020"," First of the biggies of the year and it didn't let me down.
","I loved the first half. The first half it's calmer than what comes after it. In the first half the dialogue it is solid, it is slow paced, it requires you to put some effort into holding on to it, but it was interesting because Spike knows how to write rich characters, so even though slow I didn't found it boring at the slightest. I liked the way the film is structured. Spike wanted to make something special, and he has made something special, it's just that the way that some scenes are presented in the second half really disappointed me.<br/><br/>The second half, and my problem with the film, it could have been so much better. Some scenes are so naive, they stand out from the overall tone of the film and the worst part yet is that I think that those scenes could have been handled in a better way with so ease, and I'm mad at Spike for not seeing that. I'll put it like this, the first half it has the seriousness of let say Apocalypse Now (minus the eerie tone) and in the second half you find scenes to the level of dullness you would find in a movie like Tropical Thunder. It's not to make such a big deal of, because the film works fine, but I really would have liked for those scenes to have been executed in a different way.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of the film it's the writing. Here is another proof that Spike is a better writer than he is a director. It felt so comfortable watching this war veterans talk and interact with each other and that's because Spike and his buddies knew how to write them and make everything look natural and organic. Both the score and the songs work perfectly for the tone of the film, they are the best part of the film next to the writing.<br/><br/>This is easily the best film so far this year, even though that's not saying much taking into account the low amount of films that have been released this year so far."
"andrewroy-04316","7","2","5","28 June 2020"," Da 5 Bloods is exactly the type of ambitious, cluttered, anything but subtle movie you'd expect from Spike Lee
","Much as I felt Once Upon a Time In Hollywood was pure, unadulterated Tarantino, Da 5 Bloods feels like pure Spike Lee (though granted I haven't seen nearly enough of Lee's films to say anything holistic). It's a tense, action-filled film that is filled with modern and historical commentary, not just in themes but by Spike using archival footage as well. The best and clearest point Lee makes in the film is the experience of black soldiers in Vietnam. As with all the other ideas in the film, they're explicitly thrown at you in dialogue, but there is so much to dig into in regards to the intersections of war, race, and the way history propagates forwards. I am fully on the Delroy Lindo train along with everyone else, as he is fantastic in every scene, and also love Jonathan Majors as his son. I really liked the way the historical flashbacks had a narrower aspect ratio and emphasized the way the men still feel like they're in the war mentally. At the same time, the events in the film did feel so ham-fisted and strange at times as to limit immersion. The character interactions are just non-stop fighting, and obviously the struggling vets with PTSD will have their moments, but this is also a team that cares so much about each other that the complete inability to work out situations reasonably was baffling to me. Lee hits us over the head with how greed influences their decisions, but we don't get enough of a sense of their modern lives to understand why they care so much about the gold. It didn't bother me as much when I watched it, but thinking about it now I do also see how the Vietnamese people were painted with very broad, stereotypical strokes and Lee doesn't combine his racism-related points with imperialist-related points. It's certainly entertaining and has lots of ideas, but all of those ideas were shoved at us with no nuance and the character development outside of Lindo's Paul was mediocre. Worth watching, and overall a good film, but not a memorable one."

Chadwick Boseman is subtle and pivotal Delroy Lindo is memorable and Jean Reno cameos.

However the film is so focused on the gold, the brotherhood element which seemed core to the story ends up being fitted in where appropriate to fit the narrative.<br/><br/>The inclusion of 'reality' within the film does help set the tone, but ultimately creates a confused jumble from flitting between being a history lesson to a piece of fiction, not helped with some of the odd editing choices.<br/><br/>There's a lot of praise for the acting - in particular Delroy Lindo - but there is also some really poor acting which again creates another imbalance throughout.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie is going to have a much greater impact given the timing of its release and what is happening in the World right now, however this doesn't detract from it being an uneven, overlong and disjointed watch."

"hrishikeshbade","5","4","15","12 June 2020"," da 5 blood review
","In Spike Lee's latest instalment we follow 4 Vietnam War veterans on a quest to retrieve the gold they had hidden and stored away during the war. This film is filled with an incredibly talented cast and a very powerful social message.
This movie explores the effects war on the African-American soldiers , the racial injustice they suffer, the sacrifice they made for the country that they Want to believe in, for equality and the brotherly bond they have formed because of the war.
The cast does an absolutely excellent job with the material they're provided with, Spike Lee explores Vietnam in a very interesting way, we are shown the old as well as modern Vietnam and how it has risen above the adverse effects of war.
The movie makes a point to show the important and prominent figures of the black community and their achievement and the effects America had on Vietnam, we are shown pictures from the past of ppl injured, killed, and tortured in the war. The movie also showcases the psychological effects of war on the soldiers , they suffer from depression, PTSD, anxiety which is showcased with really good acting.
The very powerful cast consisting of Chadwick Boseman(Norman), Delroy Lindo(Paul), and Jean Reno along with many others show very compelling characters and act very well, the action scenes are decent enough and the actors try their best , we jump back and forth a lot and the older characters don't seem young in the past scenes convincingly, also there is very little shown of Chadwick Boseman around 10 mins perhaps or 15 mins of the runtime.
The film does drag a little near the end with an unclear motive, where a certain decision is made which is odd. However this movie is decent and achieves what it aims for, it is very powerful with its message on black communities and the effects of war and racial discrimination.

","This movie was announced shortly after Blakkklansman came out, and I've been waiting a year-and-a-half for it; so after such a long wait, I suppose it's only to be expected that I would be somewhat let down. This is Spike's second war movie, after Miracle at St. Anna (2008) (which amid all the slog, inaccuracy, pacing issues and flaws did have good scenes), and I hoped Spike would've learned from all the criticisms of that movie and presented a more polished war picture, but no such luck. Same trappings, 'present day' framing device intercut with flashbacks, melodramatic presentation present in half his movies, beating you over the head with the same exact Spike Lee-isms (we get it, Spike, you've been making the same point over and over the last 35 years), and, as usual, Zero attempts at subtlety (the in-your-face abrasive attitude worked for Do the Right Thing and Blackkklansman, but falls flat everywhere else). Seriously, it wouldn't kill him to show some restraint. The movie is over-long as well, clocking in at an unnecessary two-and-a-half hours, when two or so would've sufficed - the set-up alone takes an hour, with some unnecessary scenes and plots crow-bar'd in there.
The few action sequences there are are pretty typical Hollywood shootouts you've seen in countless action videos, and essentially the movie tries to present itself as an anti-Rambo, while at times coming close to sorta boiling down to a black version of Rambo. The plot centers around four vets who go back to Vietnam in present day to dig up a dead friend killed in combat, and more importantly, find a cache of buried gold a la Treasure of the Sierra Madre (they find the body, but then kinda just leave it there?). The references abound, most noticeably Apocalypse Now, which he fully embraces, and Delroy Lindo's death towards the end reminds me of the ending of The Thin Red Line, though that may have been unintentional; also, that was a jarring moment that threw me off - Delroy wanders thru the jungle, comes to terms with his friends' death, then abruptly cuts to him digging his grave at Vietnamese gunpoint. I was hoping for more of an 'epic', especially given the running time, but instead it's essentially a repackaging of Miracle at St. Anna, with the same themes and all (also, a Vietcong chick on the radio telling them they're country doesn't give a damn about them, exactly like the radio Nazi chick towards the beginning of St. Anna), and it ends with a shootout in a single location while they're pinned down and injured, exactly like St. Anna. I didn't hate St. Anna, but I was hoping for a different war movie this time around. What we get is Spike stuck in his ways."

I'm sure as hell that no American is able to casually bring a gun into the country, let alone carrying it around and shooting people. The Vietnam war was a terrible past with a lot of blood spilled from both side. We, as the Vietnamese, have been trying so hard to make peace with the past in order to move forward into a better future.

I like the way the screen is framed, the format changes from small screen to tell you things about the past and wide-screen to tell you things about the present and then full screen to focus just on the present. The story focuses on how black people have suffered over the years with racism and discrimination, the movie teaches you with relevant historical characters that have fought for the rights of people.
Now, the bad things. What's going on with the edition? I can't believe that an acknowledged director like Spike Lee has very basic problems of it. Sequences that have no connection at all, one minute all the characters are fighting to try to tie the hands of three ""intruders"", a lot of tension, and one minute later everybody is walking including the ""intruders"" without tied hands, what was the point of that tension. Another problem, long sequences of dialog or monologs that lead to... nowhere.

","A movie with so much potential, a story that really needed to be told.<br/><br/>But not executed well in this film. Way too many themes; father/dad relationships, lost father/daughter, the gold story line, trump/against trump, racism, greed, redemption and what not. This results in a messy, badly written and fragmented film with flat characters.<br/><br/>The art of film lays in showing, not telling. Way too much dialogue, not enough to see.

"nyxstrix","7","1","2","23 June 2020"," It was a strong film, and a timely one too.
","The plot is loose, but the themes of fraternity, paternity, the neverending legacy of wars and racism portrayed with great depth, realism keeps this production tight.
Spike Lee continues in his great tradition of introducing a novel technique or touch to his works. In this case having the same actors play themselves 50 years in the past without the use of any special effects--at least I have never seen that before. This adds to the film's ethereal and timeless aspects.
Encasing soulful Marvin Gaye tracks sometimes brought to screen by Hanoi Hannah and sweeping, beautiful shots of HoChiMinh city, the Mekong and the jungle, this film is a joy to watch and behold. Even as it packs a punch to the gut of America about her treatment of African Americans despite that tribes long history of sacrifices for flag and country."
"ronakkotian","5","1","2","21 June 2020"," A mixed bag of feelings
","Spike Lee is one of the most interesting filmmakers out there. His films have a lot to say and he isn't afraid to voice his opinions. I thought BlacKkKlansman was pretty good but this film is definitely a step down from that.<br/><br/>Da 5 Bloods is about four soldiers that return to Vietnam years after fighting in the Vietnam War and try to find their fallen squadron leader and the gold they all hid.<br/><br/>This film really put me on the fence. There are parts of it which I like and other areas which I didn't like. I get what Spike Lee was trying to convey relating to African Americans in the war and the problems with it but I feel his execution of the subject was lacklustre.<br/><br/>A few things I did enjoy were the four main cast members. At the very beginning of the film I really felt a sense of camaraderie between them and I especially liked watching Delroy Lindo's performance throughout. The use of archival footage added to the realism of the film with some creating a very intense and uncomfortable feeling to the viewer. I thought the changing aspect ratios worked for the most part. The war scenes that were shot in 4:3 seemed like footage that was actually filmed long ago.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the film is flawed. A huge technique which bothered me throughout was how Lee wanted to tell the audience the film's themes. There are many moments where the characters just talk about the film's themes without us trying to figure it out ourselves. It gets to a point where it feels preachy. Clearly subtlety is not a strong factor in this film. There's a sequence where a character miraculously finds something which seemed way too convenient for that to happen. The dialogue was pretty bland and I wasn't a fan of some of the editing choices. With a runtime of 2 hours 30 minutes, it could've been cut down to be a tad shorter as some scenes drag.<br/><br/>I don't think Da 5 Bloods is as bad as some people say it is or as good as some critics say it is. There are good parts to it but it's unfortunate Lee took a few bad decisions to convey a story that had potential. You can watch it if you want but I would skip out on this one."
"BigBeatFromBadsville","2","1","2","17 June 2020"," Bludgeoned by THE MESSAGE
","OK, cards on the table, I'm a middle class white male in my 40s living in London. I don't profess to fully understand 'the black experience' but i'm educated and empathetic enough to at least appreciate the countless misdeeds done to black people over the course of centuries and for which 'justice' (whatever that actually encompasses) has yet to be realised. Anyone with a heart and a brain would be horrified by the murder of George Floyd and many others that have died in similar ways at the hands of the authorities.
However, I have now read a number of reviews from respected film critics praising this film and lauding the director and can only conclude that they either haven't watched it or are so terrified of being called a racist and publicly shamed online that they feel pressured to kowtow to the mob.
Let me be clear then - this is a poorly written film with a derisory plot,. It is far too long and is so lacking in subtlety that it feels like you are being hit over the head every few minutes with THE MESSAGE (that black people have suffered countless injustices).
We know that Spike and trying to shoehorn this in at every (in)conceivable juncture is just tedious,
Finally, (SPOILER ALERT) can anyone explain to me why the Vietnamese gangsters near the end of the film wish to make a deal for the gold in exchange for the landmine chap when they are pointing AK47s at 'da bloods'? I give it an extra star for that for making me laugh out loud!"

If Spike had just focused on the first part this would be a great movie because the cast is fantastic, especially Delroy Lindo even though he is hampered by some terrible dialogue.
A missed opportunity to shed light on a part of history that was constantly overlooked by the glut of Vietnam war movies in the 80s."

","Da 5 bloods
2020
15
Director: Spike Lee
Starring: Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, Isiah Whitlock jr, Melanie Thierry, Chadwick Boseman etc.<br/><br/>Overall rating 100/100<br/><br/>Da 5 bloods is about four black Vietnam war veterans, who return to Vietnam many years later, in order to find the remains of their deceased squad leader and to the millions of dollars of gold that has been hidden for many years. Wow what a masterfully crafter movie, with such powerful moments let's start hyping up this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, I loved the cultural references and the powerful and emotional beginning. I loved all the different movie references that were scattered throughout the movie. Whether it was Rambo or Apocalypse now I loved the nods to many classics that were linked to this particular films set of characters. I also loved how powerful and emotional the opening was, I loved Spike lee's direction here, having real life footage and flashbacks, of the history of racism and the horrifying things black people as a race have had to go through really hit me hard especially with the Black lives matter movement, so this resignated well with today's issues.<br/><br/>My next two positives would be the chemistry between the characters and the humour. I thought the chemistry between all the actors here was perfect, you instantly believed their friendships as soon as they were on screen, they were all infectious to watch, and their friendships were believable and felt natural considering what they had been through together, and the humour between all the characters was also great, the dark humour, and the brutal honesty between everyone was infectious to watch and just made the characters even more likeable.<br/><br/>My next two positives would be the clever links between past and present and the fantastic action with a tense tone. The movie cut between past and present with the main characters, they spent a perfect amount of time between tenses, it really made you understand the characters more and what they have been through, and whenever there was a loophole in the present between the characters or within the plot, it was explained in detail in the flashbacks to the Vietnam war. The action was also excellent, the movie also had excellent action sequences, showing the nightmare that the soldiers had to go through not knowing when they were going to be ambushed, the gore despite being hard to look at was also well executed and added to the impact of the scenes. The movie also executed a very tense tone, the film had you on the edge of your seat throughout a lot of it's action scenes or sudden plot twists, when the main characters were trapped in a mine field it was incredibly tense not knowing when something would go off, showing that I cared for the characters due to Spike Lee's masterful character work.<br/><br/>My next few positives would be the surprising plot twists and added depth, the performances and character development. The film had excellent plot twists, that I did not see coming at all which really surprised and made me enjoy the movie even more, the fact that Paul (Delroy Lindo) had such severe PTSD because of the guilt of killing the squad leader in Vietnam played by Chadwick Boseman was an incredible twist that I didn't see coming, it made you understand why he was acting the way he was and added so much more depth to the film, there was also so many surprise deaths that I didn't see coming. The performances from everybody was also fantastic. Delroy Lindo was absolutely fantastic, his acting was so realistic that his slow mental breakdown was incredibly uncomfortable to watch which proves his performance left an impact, all the main characters were great as well, Chadwick boseman also played his role perfectly and his performance was powerful, proving he can have an acting career outside marvel. The character development was fantastic, the character work was just excellent. There was an equal amount of depth and development to all of the main characters which is very rare in films. You understood all the characters and what they were going through, so the film masterfully developed all the performances and characters to make you deeply care for everyone involved.<br/><br/>My next two positives would be the cinematography and the deep and powerful themes and messages. I thought the films cinematography was excellent. Some of the shots during the flashbacks to the Vietnam war were stunning, with excellent use of colour to make the scenes pop out on screen and this same craft was used throughout. The films themes and messages was extremely powerful as well, the subject matter of racism was tackled very well, and Spike was not afraid to speak his opinions on the subject and the leader of America which I respected. The movie was really educational especially for what's still happening in todays society, so this was very important for the black lives matter movement, but the movie was also about brotherhood, which became more and more the central theme alongside racism which I loved, as you cared for all the characters to much after what they went through together, I really connected and loved the brotherhood that they all had throughout even in death where they died protecting their country and to save each other.<br/><br/>My final two positives would be the films incredible script and powerful and moving ending. Wow the films script will stick with me for a long time, the powerful lines tackling issues with racism in the past and to this day, all the characters with their fantastic performances delivered them perfectly, and the script was moving and powerful. The ending was extremely powerful, as they changed the main theme to brotherhood, it was extremely emotional and heart-warming that everyone was honoured for their service and sacrifices. And the fact that the only surviving character Otis (Clarke Peters) gave his sum of the money to his daughter that he never knew he had, and the rest was used to support the black lives matter movement which was very powerful, and despite this being filmed before the sickening events recently it's almost like Spike Lee knew that this movement would come to light so hats off to Spike for making a powerful piece of art.<br/><br/>Overall, Da 5 bloods is a close to perfect that you are going to get with a movie. Masterfully written script and character work. Fantastic performances, as well as being educational and empowering the message of what the black lives matter movement is all about."

Delroy Lindo is almost unwatchable. A full blown psycho as he portrays him would not have lasted the 45 years since the end of the war. Why did they wait until they were 65-70 to reclaim the gold? So many plot holes! Spike should not have used the geriatrics for the flashback scenes. In a lot of scenes it was almost like Spike got tired of filming and directing and settled for mediocre, I would've said amateurish but Spikes been at it too many years.
Is it time for Spike to retire? Maybe take up writing?"

"hypestyle","10","2","8","21 June 2020"," ""Da 5 Bloods"" is Spike Lee's Magnum Opus
","""Da 5 Bloods"" is an action drama highlighting a fateful reunion with a quartet of Vietnam War veterans in modern-day Vietnam. The cast is led by Delroy Lindo, Chadwick Boseman, Jonathan Majors, Isiah Whitlock, Clarke Peters and Norm Lewis.<br/><br/>This film explores the broken promises for Black American soldiers after their war experiences. ""Miracle at St. Anna"" was one of Lee's first to tackle a story that mostly takes place well outside the United States. Given his initial pedigree as a ""New York City Stories"" auteur, this is an obvious change of pace, but it is well worth more than one viewing.<br/><br/>Four of the veterans reunite in Ho Chi Minh City to attempt to find the remains of fallen soldier/field leader ""Stormin Norman"" (Boseman). What neither the US or Vietnam State Departments know is that the four men also plan to find a hidden trunk full of gold that was lost in a CIA plane crash in the Vietnamese Jungle back during their original tour of duty.<br/><br/>All four surviving men have been scarred by the war to varying degrees. The most deeply disturbed is Paul (Lindo), who in the latest manifestation of his bitterness and discontent has become an unabashed supporter of President Donald Trump: this makes him the object of caustic ribbing by his buddies, but Paul is resolute: He feels absolutely cheated of his due respect and reward for his bodily and mental sacrifice: both as a soldier and as a black citizen enduring Civil Rights-era turmoil and social tumult.<br/><br/>To varying degrees, all of Paul's friends agree: Eddie, Melvin and Otis. Paul's adult son David is a surprise, and initially unwelcome tag-along: he wants to finally find a way to bond with his long-estranged father, but Paul isn't about to make it easy.<br/><br/>The explorations of these men provide an intriguing alternative point of view for 2020 audiences: Vietnam-based dramas have been produced for decades, but scarcely few have done a deep dive into the point of view of what Black soldiers went through, much less how they fared in the years after the war.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel is top-notch. Lee's direction is assured; the visual atmosphere is alternately cool, warm or hot and intense in other parts. There are four credited writers, including original writers Paul De Meo and Danny Bilson.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes linger longer than they should. Some of the tribute/easter-egg dialogue will be obvious to people who are familiar with certain war films or heist films. Delroy Lindo should get major acting award nominations for his performance. His Paul is a firestorm of macho belligerence and deep emotional woundedness all wound-up in a man who feels abandoned and guilty. Clark Peters should get supporting actor nominations. Maybe the conceit of using the same actors to play their younger selves is off-putting for some, but this viewer managed to get over it.<br/><br/>Given the already 2-hour-plus running time of the film, I don't know that there was time to go deeper into the philosophy of how people of color can be used as tools of white-driven colonialism and hyper-capitalism against other people of color and indigenous communities, the influence of Black-derived pop culture in Asian countries (Motown played at nightclubs, or even modern K-Pop music) or the contemporary contexts of Black-Asian relations in the United States. Paul's confrontation with a fellow trying to sell him a chicken updates the spat between Bill Nunn's Radio Raheem and the Korean-born shopkeepers in ""Do the Right Thing"". Paul's occasional rants about ""illegals"" and the rest of the crew's attempts to calm him down is about as far as it goes.<br/><br/>Whatever the technical faults of a director like Spike Lee, he has earned his right for due consideration in taking on a conceptually risky project. ""Da 5 Bloods"" delivers the gold, but at a cost."

"kjproulx","10","2","9","18 June 2020"," An Emotionally Riveting, Essential Piece of Filmmaking
","When it comes to Spike Lee films, I've now come to expect a film that's at least good. Do the Right Thing is one of my favourite films of all time and BlacKkKlansman easily made my Top 10 list of 2018. It's very clear when you're watching a Spike Lee joint (as he likes to call them). Da 5 Bloods is his most recent directorial outing and streaming seems to be the saving grace for a lot of movies this year. Netflix has recently released it for all subscribers to view, and although a lot of the subject matter may be a lot to take in, I believe, especially due to the timing of the release and how it relates to society today, it is an essential piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>After losing one of their own in war, four American veterans return to where they lost him in order to uncover his body, as well as try to find the gold that they hid away. After this film sets the overall story in motion, it becomes a long, slow journey from beginning to end, but it's very much worth the investment. Becoming close with what seems to be new allies, a new plot begins to unfold, adding a huge layer of reality to the movie as a whole. It was very hard not to compare the notions throughout this film to that of the ones we're dealing with today, and for that reason alone, I believe this film is even more impactful than it already was upon completion.<br/><br/>This film begins with real images and footage that are incredibly impactful and eye-opening. Throughout the movie, real images are cut to in order to exploit the harsh realities of certain things. That small aspect of the movie alone will be too much for some to handle. There are some horrific images that are not recreated for the movie, but rather just blatantly displayed on-screen, conveying some of the most emotional messages I've seen in a film in quite some time. On top of that, this movie relies heavily on the characters at the forefront of the story and if you don't buy their chemistry and their history together, this movie would've been a mess. Thankfully, there are some award-worthy performances here from everyone involved.<br/><br/>In particular, as most viewers have been proclaiming, Delroy Lindo as Paul delivers one of the very best performances I've seen in a while. His screen presence here is electric and if any of the awards shows were coming soon, I could even make the argument that he deserves to win. He truly brings his A-Game here and I've never seen him better. Granted, this is the most acting I've ever seen from him, so it left quite an impression on me. In addition, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Norm Lewis, Clarke Peters, and the eventual joining of Jonathan Majors, all played off each other as if they were real-life friends. The acting in this film is off the charts.<br/><br/>Written by Danny Bilson, Kevin Willmott, Spike Lee, and Paul De Meo, it was very clear that this was a collaborative effort. This film came from the heart and I was most surprised to see Paul De Meo's name attached. He's had his hand in writing video games in recent years, but in terms of feature films, his last notable screenplay was for The Rocketeer in 1991. I really hope to see him return to feature film screenplays in the future. From the way each character interacts with each other to the long monologues given (particularly by Lindo), this movie had me glued to the screen.<br/><br/>In the end, Da 5 Bloods is an eye-opening film, to say the least. The story itself is very telling in its own right, but when you compare certain elements to our daily lives, this can be a huge lesson for some viewers. As I said, certain imagery will be too much for viewers to take in, so be wary if you're either squeamish or know that certain things will be stuck in your mind forever. Filled with a stellar cast, backed by superb direction, and written with a lot of care, Da 5 Bloods is a must-see. It's now streaming on Netflix and I highly recommend checking it out. It's also quite possibly the best movie that will be released for a while as well."

But for me, it felt so out of place and made it uneasy to watch. In particular the action scenes.<br/><br/>The flashbacks (constant cutting between past & present) were very distracting. At the beginning, I was enjoying the present day storyline with the present day characters. The frequent flashbacks instead felt like a nuisance.<br/><br/>There were a couple of nice surprises thrown in and I appreciate the message it tries to convey.

"coconutkungfu-30704","8","1","3","25 June 2020"," Another Great Spike Lee Film
","Though it isn't as good as Lee's masterpiece Malcolm X, Da 5 Bloods is still an expertly directed film with engaging characters. The film has a 2 hour and 30 minute runtime but it never drags and is excellently paced and nicely edited. The acting is absolutely great, especially Delroy Lindo's performance. As a viewer I really felt that the four main leads had a genuine connection and ended up caring about all of them. The film effectively alternates between time and place (and aspect ratio) and the use of Marvin Gaye songs is very fitting. There are a few moments that feel a bit too serendipitous and not all characters are given the same depth and care as the leads, but Da 5 Bloods is still highly recommended! Give it a watch on Netflix."

The concept is strong and you get a glimmer of hope that it might be good.....then the first 45 minutes ends. I truly wish I would have turned it off. The movie's constant reminders of the wrongs done to African Americans completely dilutes and disrupts any rhythm the film could have gotten and makes the entire movie well.....confusing. The script is flimsy and the dialogue is childish and comical (not in a good way), but we're supposed to be entrenched in the seriousness of the topic....or topics.

Give me a break.<br/><br/>I really don't like Spike Lee, but I had high hopes for this movie. I am a big fan of Vietnam era movies and even though I knew the ""white man racist, Donald Trump bad"" themes would be pushed, I tried to be open minded, but this movie just was not good.<br/><br/>You have a group of great actors with really bad acting (I was extremely disappointed with Chadwick Boseman's performance). A treasure hunting plot that has been done successfully dozens of times before absolutely falls apart here. An unbelievably predictable story. Poorly written characters (Paul & Otis seem to be the only one with story arks, everyone else is just there for the ride) and a bizarre soundtrack.<br/><br/>The flashbacks where all of the characters are the same actors that play their older selves also seemed really lazy too. A grueling 2.5 hour run time also made the movie feel like a chore to watch instead of something enjoyable. Lastly, the preachiness that I mentioned before became the punchline to the film but I suppose that is what Lee was going for anyways.<br/><br/>The reason I gave this film 3 stars is because there were times when I felt that the film COULD redeem itself, but never did. I like that it touched on PTSD and mental illness, as well as inequality and civil rights, but that was it. Just a touch. No resolution. No answers. Just a quick nod.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: the film had potential to be a good story while also addressing important social issues, but ultimately fell flat on almost all fronts.

","OLD PEOPLE: THIS MOVIE ISNT FOR YOU
First quickly to those writing reviews: Just think about Hollywood and all its history of sensationalizing white history in America, while simplifying a majority of opinions of ethnic minorities to whatever cultural stereotype is convenient. 5 black or brown leads in a big budget historical action flick is not very common, but look at America today... why shouldn't it be?? Why can't it be??<br/><br/>As far as the film goes it brings that free-spirited sixties aesthetic to life but with all of Spike Lees clever thematically educational explorations of race, identity and responsibility. Additionally, the tension in this film is incredible and on par with (or perhaps better than) any suspenseful Tarantino scene. The sharp, cynical wit of Spikes writing crackles to life in the form of the titular Bloods played brilliantly by the haunted Delroy Lindo, the honest Clarke Peters, the loyal Isiah Whitlock Jr., the humble Norm Lewis, the heroic Chadwick Boseman and the loving Jonathan Majors. The cinematography is breathtaking, the visual transitions seamlessly flow between time periods, and the atmospheric sound design blends together with the many Marvin Gaye song cues (Inner City Blues and What's Going On stand out) to put us in the minds of these men. Those who want to start this movie looking for an old-war-buddies-kick-ass-and-reminisce action epic will get what they came for, and those who want to see racism in America and abroad unflinchingly confronted in a historical and modern context will be satisfied as well.
Apart from the uniformed trolls and BLM-deniers who reviewed and rated this film poorly simply because they think they are doing something useful (i.e. short, angry, 1-2 star reviews that don't have specific points about the actual content of the film and seem written in a rush), I think that some people will not like it as it moves quickly between genres and was advertised as a fun, action-packed thrill-ride which it generally is, but there are some shocking images and moments that are purposeful to the story and emphasize the brutality wrought on the innocents by the tragedy that was the Vietnam War, and they can be very jarring and unsettling to the average movie watcher. That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, Spike has an intention with his filmmaking to tell stories that are unknown or under appreciated in American society and he absolutely nails it with this one. You can learn so much about past and present history from this film if you wish to, but if you want it be Apocalypse Now in the vein of Treasure of the Sierra Madre, simply about gold and it's power to corrupt the minds of even the most good-hearted people, then you can have that as well.
Can't say enough about this film so I'll end it here but PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO THE SHORT, ANGRY AND SMALL-MINDED REVIEWS!!"

Started strong. By the end it grew disjointed and messy and started to lose my interest.<br/><br/>Second Act:
When they found the gold it started to pick up, but that carried on way too long.<br/><br/>Third Act:
Was pretty good, but Spike Lee tried to do too much.<br/><br/>It seems from the way he edited the movie that he was trying to be more like Oliver Stone with his cutaways and obscure references.<br/><br/>I would have much rather have seen more of the ""Bloods"" in Vietnam serving on missions as heroes to solidify their story even further.
Instead Lee felt he had to tell the story instead of show it.
In a movie.....a visual medium...always show it instead of tell it if you can.<br/><br/>Then, as Spike Lee does...he got preachy especially in the end.<br/><br/>You don't have to be overt with your symbolism. There is a way to convey a message in a movie without beating the audience over the head with it.
Lee is not good enough of a writer or director to know how to do that.<br/><br/>This could have been a great adventure film.
There is great potential there, but Lee just tried to do too much.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS:
Most of the acting was just okay.
The conflict resolution was over the top for most every character arc except for Otis.<br/><br/>Delroy Lindo did a good job. He wasn't Oscar worthy.
I liked the subtle work that Clarke Peters (Otis) did in the film.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman was wasted. All of the talk about his character and his heroics, but Lee never showed enough of that.<br/><br/>The son was a wasted character. He was unnecessary as were the LAMB people.<br/><br/>
Too long. About midway through I had to check to see how much was left.<br/><br/>
Lee simply should have shown the Bloods in Vietnam fighting together, and then cut back and forth to them on their heist juxtaposing the two. Absolutely not enough Vietnam shown.<br/><br/>It was average. Spike Lee is quite overrated as a director and writer."

","I watched this movie because it sounded like another great plot about the Vietnam Conflict, the soldiers who lived in it, and (for whatever reason) the ones that returned. It sounded like an simple tale with great analogies about the lives of black people that never seems to change. Spike Lee probably wanted to offer an enlightened take on black people in Vietnam by comparison with black people today in the US. But it seemed to me that he took this movie and edited in references that belong to another script: This movie has it good points and it's finer moments, but Spike Lee is a lazy director who can't seem to ever escape the cliche formats of student films. Archive footage forced upon out-of-context direction just to amplify current events. If you want to speak about Black Lives Matter then why would you not make a film about Black Lives Matters? Why take a completely separate script and edit in bits & pieces of things that have little meaning to the plot?<br/><br/>Secondly, the end of the film (without spoiling anything) has these beautiful shots; straight out of a museum quality landscapes, whereas there's a complete lack of that in the actual movie. This film had a $35-45 million budget. It is among Spike Lee's most expensive films and it looked cheap ... dirt cheap. I will admit, I have a bias with Spike Lee, but it's because he is so demanding of award for his accomplishments and yet he's only got 4 good movies in his 31 year career. I'd say, 'Do The Right Thing', 'Malcolm X', 'BlackkKlansMan', the 'Old Boy' remake are his best work. Yet he complains every single Oscar Season that another crap movie of his wasn't nominated and he blames it on being black in Hollywood. People don't cater to excuses in this business, Mr Lee. They want results.<br/><br/>Anyway ... 'Da 5 Bloods' is decent enough, it's not great, there's a lot of predictable happenings, but it is watchable simply based on the actors. Delroy Lindo is one of my favorite actors and one of the few actors with the ability to have a famous face and still draw you into scenes with his character performances. Clarke Peters is in so many of my favorite tv series, I was incredibly happy to watch him have a role to flourish in. Norm Lewis, who I almost didn't recognize, but is a profound Broadway actor - in fact Mr Lewis is the first African-American to play the lead of The Phantom on Broadway. Isiah Whitlock Jr. who I'm not familiar with but do remember him popping up on 'The Chappelle Show', he was equally funny and genuine in this role. I appreciate the use of older more refined actors in movies, specifically when it comes to the portrayal of friendships or comradely. Watch this movie just for the acting, is my best suggestion for this film."

The older actors are not playing younger versions of themselves, they are the same age as in our present time because they survived the war, while Chadwick Boseman's character did not. That's just stupidity if you don't pick up on that. I've been a harsh critic of Spike Lee for the longest time because he as been so damn uneven in his directing, but BlacKkKlansman turned it around for me (one of the best movies of the 2010s), and that's his best movie since Do the Right Thing IMO. In Da 5 Bloods he keeps going strong, and this is yet another fantastic movie. Not as good as the previously two mentioned, but still pretty damn good! Excellent acting, especially by Delroy Lindo, who has a tendency to play unlikable characters, and he ALWAYS does a fantastic job. Keep it up, Spike!!!"

","Spike Lee's second war film ( Miracle of St. Anna, 2008) is one messy message picture featuring Lee's sloppy attempts at coherence. A brother bonding film of rage and self pity with more than its share of insipid dialogue, Lee attempts to inject history into the story with his occasional bias cheap shot. Scattered in every way, Lee's focus remains haphazard as he pontificates ham fistedly into nearly every scene which trail's off rather than resonate as this diffuse mess wanders from Crispus Attucks to BLM to make his point achieved so much more powerfully, summed up in one scene and decades earlier in Apocalypse, Now. Lee drags us through two and half hours to get to his. Speaking of Now, he does one of his heavy handed homages and manages to botch that as well.<br/><br/>A quartet of four Viet vets return to the heart of darkness to retrieve their fallen leader and a huge gold supply. An abrasive but basically altruistic bunch they have to enlist some shady characters which leads to conflict while they sought out their inner one.<br/><br/>As in many of his films we get the loose cannon threatening to upend everything and DelRoy Lindo does an excellent job here as the tortured veteran with the short fuse. Pursued by inner demons from the past he brings power to all his scenes, something lacking in the rest of Lee's bland undeveloped cast delivering banal dialogue. Lee utilizes his usual go to crutch of pop music well and the documentary footage in the early going really revs matters up but it quickly devolves into another Lee one note mantra as his band of brothers rumble through the jungle in a funk with the occasional burst of automatic weapons fire to keep the audience awake. Da 5 Bloods is a passionate but diffuse mawkish mess, unconvincingly told."
"ontoson","Null","0","1","29 June 2020"," Failed attempt at documentary-dramedy-crossover!
","Spike Lee is a great director. Some of his movies like 'Do the Right Thing', 'Get on the Bus' or 'Chi-Raq' are true masterpieces.<br/><br/>This is not one of them.<br/><br/>Lee always has been a moralist, which is to a large extent an understandable stance for an African-American director preoccupied with slavery and the black cause in the United States, and often this stance is not detrimental to Lee's overall artistic conception. Still, I believe it is fair to say that there must be a point when the urgent moral message 1) becomes just too cheap or redundant to not play the viewer for a fool and 2) becomes the altar reasonable storytelling and character development can be sacrificed on. This is unfortunately the case in his latest work 'Da 5 Bloods'.<br/><br/>One the one hand, the movies tries to be a quasi-documentary about the crucial role of black soldiers in the Vietnam war. While this might by an important one, this is certainly not a new piece of history, i.e. a piece of history that you wouldn't know if you just knew a little bit about the war vis-à-vis e.g. the well known story of Muhammed Alis conscientious objection.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is the drama of four retired soldiers trying to recover a sack of gold and the body of their lost comrade from the Vietnam jungle. This is an interesting idea for a plot. However, the end result is miserable. There's not a single character in this film that disposes of non-stereotypical traits and thus rises above the level of types and transportation vehicles for moral or political sound bites. Most of the dialogues seem artifical and inanimate. The further the story advances, the more frequently it edges ludicrously on farce. First, I thought this might have been a simple lapse by the director. But it might've been the director's intention to take this humorous turn. In either case, this artistic choice is for me as intelligible as a slapstick comedy about Auschwitz - and as unfunny.<br/><br/>The fact remains, as with Lee's previous, likewise astronomically overrated movie 'Blackkklansman' that I come not even close to fathom how many critics arrived at their assessment of this film. Has this something to do with the politically difficult times (wink, wink, wink, wink!) we live in? If it does, I can only say that in my opinion the importance of movements like Black Lives Matter and social justice in America are no good justification to confabulate reasons for a chorus of praise for every single movie made by a black filmmaker"

"sirenebern","7","0","2","26 June 2020"," Moving film, timely themes, a little convoluted
","Overall, I enjoyed ""Da 5 Bloods,"" Spike Lee's newest film made for Netlifx. The cast includes some veteran actors in engaging performances, particularly Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters and Isiah Whitlock, and Chadwick Boseman in an all-too-brief appearance only in flashback scenes. The movie follows four Black Vietnam War veterans as they return to Vietnam on a trip that is, on the surface, a reunion/nostalgia experience combined with an effort to recover the remains of their fallen comrade, Norman (Boseman). However, the four men have a secret mission: to locate a CIA gold stash they discovered and buried decades ago.<br/><br/>Lee's bold directorial style shines in the flashback scenes most of all, where he switches to a nostalgic look and narrower screen reminiscent of early '70s movies. ""Da 5 Bloods"" combines humor and action with some poignant, sad scenes that explore the lingering emotional scars of the veterans and the impact this had on their families and relationships. Some of the film's flaws may be that it's a bit too long, with a plot that seems convoluted at times, as if they threw too many things into one script. A few of the minor characters, such as a smuggler (or maybe corrupt official? I couldn't tell) played by Jean Reno, don't ring true. The movie can be preachy at times, but I think that's the point, and there's a lot of chemistry between the four vets. I couldn't help wondering how it may have looked and sounded on a big screen, though."

"Shazam-O","9","0","6","26 June 2020"," Masterpiece With a Masterful Performance
","First and foremost, Delroy Lindo gives the performance of not just his lifetime, but of Hollywood's. With no hint of hyperbole, it is one of the best performances in film history.<br/><br/>Lindo's performance aside, this movie sure does get a lot of hate. Obviously, anyone giving a movie 1/10 should just be ignored outright. People giving this film a 3/10 were most likely expecting ""Missing In Action 5"" or ""Da 5 Rambos"". They probably gave Extraction 10/10. Those giving the film around 5 or 6 may have missed the nuance. And this movie is ALL nuance. Given it's 2 hr 40 min runtime, if you're not following the undercurrent it must drag on like a row boat down the Mekong. The film takes hard turns between genres, so it is not a film for heavy eyes. Nod off for a second and you may wake to think you're watching a different film. And that's a good thing. It's a wonderful thing. It's no secret that Spike Lee likes to sprinkle his films with an homage here and there. Da 5 Bloods is no exception and he does so brilliantly. Every piece of historical footage, every character's action, each line, camera angle, and film style choice (and there are many) come together in a celluloid collage feeling somewhere between free jazz and the proverbial American Quilt. If you're looking for an action film, a buddy film, or a nice n' tidy linear story like BlacKkKlansman this ain't it. If you're looking for Spike Lee's magnum opus, you found it."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","25 June 2020"," What war does to us
","Spike Lee's newest film is an exploration of war, missed chances and modern day politics. In it a group of Vietnam War veterans return to Vietnam to look for a treasure they buried there during the war. On their journey we see flashbacks of their war experiences and explore their many, many regrets, losses and hindrances. Plus talk about what it means to be black back then as well as now.<br/><br/>Spike Lee is a powerhouse behind the camera. This film is superbly shot. The story is told marvelously. Every scene felt necessary, every scene build on top of another. Likewise, the actors gave it their all and I liked the variance in the characters they portrayed. Each had scars from the war, but they all had dealt and were dealing with them differently.<br/><br/>That being said, this film is political. It's really, really, really political. To some, that's one of its strengths. Lee does not pull any punches. He tells you what he thinks, as straight as he can. To some that means a lot. To me, a Nordic white man in my early 30s, it doesn't mean quite as much. Although I don't mind it. I didn't find it distracting nor did I find it unwarranted. It simply wasn't one of the cornerstones of the film.<br/><br/>That being said, I can imagine that to Americans this film will have an impact. But even if you're from outside the US, the film has a lot to offer if you're looking to understand America as it is today and how it came to be like that. Especially when it comes to its black population.<br/><br/>I can recommend the film. I can definitely recommend it."

","GRADE: B<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Well acted but rambling story about five soldiers who come together for some closure.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Streaming directly to Netflix and avoiding movie theaters which are still shuttered anyway, Spike Lee's war drama. Da 5 Bloods, takes moviegoers on a long and rambling journey back to the traumas caused by the Vietnam war to our vets and our country. The story may not always be successful in its execution, too much of a Black History 101 lecture, but it does delve into a dark chapter of America's history and makes very relevant points about racism, greed, and honor that we need to continue to discuss during today's harrowing times.<br/><br/>Five African-American Vietnam vets, dubbed the ""Bloods"", reunite in Ho Chi Minh City with a personal mission: to bring back the remains of their fallen comrade and friend, ""Stormin' Norman"" Holloway (Chadwick Boseman). An honorable quest, but there is also an ulterior motive: They also want to retrieve hidden gold bars that these soldiers had buried on a previous operation. While there, these five men will deal with their own personal demons and encounter many obstacles and physical hardships along the way.<br/><br/>Clarke Peters plays Otis, the leader of this band of brothers. He visits his former girlfriend, Tiên, who helps him make contacts with a French businessman, Desroche (Jean Reno), who will ensure their safety and buy the gold from them. Also on this mission is Paul, (a wonderful Delroy Lindo...more on him later). Paul is Otis' close friend who suffers from PTSD and carries the guilt and anger of a nation with him. He is a widower who has an estranged relationship with son, David (Jonathan Majors), who came along to Paul's surprise. Paul becomes the catalyst in this multi-layered story and provides the conflict within the Bloods. He is a Trump supporter and his many debates with the others spring from his opposing point of view and set up the tension.<br/><br/>As the film goes back and forth in its narrative from 60's war-time Vietnam to present-day, the journey itself becomes a tad strained and far-fetched, with some secondary characters, such as three crusaders from a organization dedicated to clearing landmines, popping up unexpectedly (and all too conveniently) to advanced the plot. Their roles cause the story to stretch plausibility, as do some of the film's other intruders. The screenplay simply needs more clarity and some of the other supporting characters are sketchy and not as well developed, specifically the other remaining soldiers, Eddie and Melvin (Norm Lewis and Isiah Whitlock Jr.). However, the film's many monologues are always very literate and thought-provoking. After all, with Mr. Lee, it's the message that is of the upmost concern.<br/><br/>The director's trademarked continued use of archival footage effectively shows viewers the turbulent era of the sixties for African-Americans, both here and abroad. He chronicles black life and the poor treatment inflicted by the U.S. government. While the assassination of Martin Luther King back home created civil unrest and racial divides, these men were still expected to fight for a country that treated them in second class servitude. Yet sometimes the newsreel montages interfere with the main story and begin to overstate the message, choosing to sacrifice the movie's narrative and plot.<br/><br/>The acting is solid throughout the film. Mr. Peters is quite convincing as the troubled Otis who tries to negotiate between all of the bickering. Mr. Boseman, as the doomed soldier, creates a strong impression, although he has less screen time than the others. Mr. Majors is very memorable as Paul's forgotten son and he has some tender scenes with French actress Mélanie Thierry as one of the volunteers that register. One wishes the talented Mr. Lewis and Mr. Whitlock were given more to do with their characters, even though both actors bring needed depth to their perfunctory roles. But it is Mr. Lindo who creates a complex and beaten man just trying to survive. His Paul is haunted and haunting. This excellent actor is outstanding, especially in his lengthy tirades about injustice and his delusional conversations with himself. His performance deserves Oscar recognition.<br/><br/>Mr. Lee directs with his usual flair, but the story itself is a jumble at times. The ending seems too glib and uplifting. Its storytelling lacks a true sense of irony, anger, and gravitas which the film wishes to achieve. Still Da 5 Bloods is fine filmmaking, very worthy of your time and support, but my expectations remain higher for this great filmmaker and his vision."

","As shown in an archive photo turning up in DA 5 BLOODS, this isn't the first time Delroy Lindo goes to Vietnam. In MORE AMERICAN GRAFFTI he has a quick cameo (credited as Army Sergeant) and now, forty long years later, he's basically the only character in Spike Lee's current joint that means anything...<br/><br/>Consisting of four really old African American Vietnam Vets returning to retrieve their deceased leader's/mentor's remains and many bars of gold, BLOODS is a hybrid of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE for the hunt; UNCOMMON VALOR about a group of returning vets (ten years later/thirty years younger); and COCOON, where some cranky old-timers get a second wind of sorts...<br/><br/>So there are the usual old-codger clichés, like aching muscles and pain pills. And by having the men be the same old age in flashbacks, the primary focus is on the only young person in their group, and who puts the 5 into 5 BLOODS: a character called ""Stormin' Norman"" played by Chadwick Boseman, learned more about through present-time adoring exposition than during those war scenes that, exactly like MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI, are filmed in 16MM to resemble war footage as opposed to your average war movie -- although the grandiose RAMBO-style Gung-Ho score is as popcorn mainstream as they come, clashing with the attempt at a documentary feel...<br/><br/>Making the best element of DA 5 BLOODS also the most lazy and predictable... Which is the far-too-easy hiking-trip adventure searching for the gold, and, like TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE had first-billed Humphrey Bogart go bonkers while turning on his fortune-seeking partners, Lindo holds that edgy wild card...<br/><br/>And not so ironically, he also wears a MAGA (Donald Trump's Make America Great Again) hat that winds up not only angering/irritating his friends but a Vietnamese soldier and Jean Reno as a French antagonist, who ends up part of a final shootout more suited to cable than the big screen (yet this IS made for Netflix)...<br/><br/>There's also a partial love interest, and she too is from France, flirting with the second most important character being related to Delroy Lindo's Paul. Like Patrick Swayze in UNCOMMON VALOR he's a younger non-Veteran: And Jonathan Majors as David also provides most of the levity with bouts of attempted light humor banking off the old dudes -- but nothing really loosens up his intense father, who holds a secret that becomes a pretty decent 11th hour twist.<br/><br/>And so, during this current climate of nationwide (even worldwide) protests following the murder of George Floyd, Spike Lee will definitely get nominated and might just, for the first time, win his coveted Oscar -- but it's not deserved since the direction and editing are the most awkward things going...<br/><br/>Including random photos and interviews popping up not only before and after the story but during, seeming tacked-on by an idealistic sixth-grader who just wrote an essay on Barack Obama. Meanwhile, the flashbacks and present time stories don't connect all that well. Either way, It's Lindo who should win an Oscar for a performance that goes against all the corniness and preachiness his director constantly throws in...<br/><br/>Including a few annoying allegations that fellow white soldiers in Vietnam hated black Americans as much as their North Vietnamese enemy; as if this were the first Vietnam flick involving black soldiers...<br/><br/>Growing up on APOCALYPSE NOW (parodied here a few times), Laurence Fishburne and Albert Hall (who both worked for Spike Lee) were as embraced by fans as Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest...<br/><br/>And one of this film's most suspenseful scenes involves the younger character stepping on a landmine without being able to step off. Which is straight out of THE BOYS IN COMPANY C where African American Stan Shaw turns in the kind of tour-de-force performance that a breezy melodrama like DA 5 BLOODS couldn't begin to capture, or restrain...<br/><br/>But Lindo... God love him... does try his best: despite the interruptions."

","I was pretty excited to watch the new film from Spike Lee and I was a bit dissatisfied. Let's go over the things I liked, I really liked the style of the film with the aspect ratio change and the cinematography. I also like that they used real archive footage from the Vietnam War, and the acting was decent. What I disliked of the film was the bad CGI during the action scenes, it was pretty distracting and took me out of the experience. The dialogue was pretty bad at times and it felt forced. For example, earlier in the film the characters are walking in the streets of Vietnam and then one of the characters just starts talking about a guy that fought in Vietnam and saved lives. The film also drags at times and I felt like it was too long. Overall it's an ok film, if you like Spike Lee's films then I would suggest it to you so you can form your own opinion whether it's good or not. If you dont follow Spike Lee's filmography then I would probably tell you to skip this movie."
"lreese-1","6","0","1","17 June 2020"," It's OK...Not GOOD
","How this got such rave reviews from critics is a testament to their mindless devotion to culturally popular directors.
The character development is thin. Tough to understand their motivations. They change then change back for seemingly no reason..The script is uneven as if written by committee.
There are some interesting plot points, the basic story idea is good..But the script does not tell a good story. The added bonus pictures strewn in add nothing to the story. They just distract and chop things up.
The cinematography is nice. It's filmed well... The special effects were fine in the battle scenes. It was pleasant to watch.
The acting was good. It was a good cast.
If you think of it as just another war movie, rather than a Spike Lee movie, it's ok I guess.
It's a movie that is not worth watching unless it's free and you've got nothing else to do....Probably be better to watch ""She's gotta have it"" again instead!!"

","Like the majority of Spike Lee's work, his political stance is right at the forefront, even if it gets in the way of the story. His stylish way of filmmaking also allows him to skip from real life footage to the film smoothly, which helps keep the film from feeling jarring (which in a lesser directors hands it would be). Also, had this element of the film not been present, the film would have suffered and likely been marked as just another cliche 'Nam' film.<br/><br/>The visuals (lots of aspect ratio changes, film stock effects and locations etc) and the performance of Delroy Lindo being the standouts of the film. Delroy's character, Paul, is an exceptionally written character and whilst not being sympathetic, he is who we're most interested it. The story contains enough action to keep interest, and whilst could defiantly be shorter, doesn't sag pacing wise.<br/><br/>The story however is where the film looses the marks that could have made this a truly amazing film. There are just too many conveniences and plot points that don't lead anywhere, characters that either have nothing to do or such as specific role it's so blatant that it takes you out the movie. A quick examples that springs to mind (that won't spoil anything) are when the group are looking for an item, find it, then realise it isn't where it should be. It's then found right next to it. Raising the question of why not just have it where it should be if this doesn't create any conflict? You also get the sense that some of the characters could have been removed and the story would have been strengthened and the fact it's set in the modern day (2019) means that some of the Vietnam/American tension feels a little contrived. Some of the political points made are also rather ham-fisted.<br/><br/>Overall it's a very watchable film, even despite its flaws."

The story is completely implausible and the acting awful. This had all the ingredients of a good adventure film with historical information to enlighten the viewer (the historical education was the reason I gave it a 2 and not a 1) but instead you got a film that didn't know what it was, I can't believe the writers could do such a bad job. How over half of the IMDB reviews give it 7 or more is beyond me, anyone giving it more than a 5 has either never seen a good film before or likes films that are so bad, you can actually laugh at its poor quality and enjoy it."

It's a great premise, and a good build up. The little link to ''The Wire'' was cute, but the moment I saw Clay Davis, I knew it was coming.<br/><br/>Finally, during flashbacks to their past days in Vietnam - The four main guys looked exactly the same, grey hair and all.

","The timing of the release of this movie is almost perfect, right at the height of the 'Black Lives Matter' protests and the continued racial injustices enacted upon black Americans. The story highlights somewhat the disproportional numbers of black GI's sent to Vietnam to fight for the same country that treated them as second class citizens and yet put them in large numbers to the front of the of the war.<br/><br/>The articulation of the story gets lost somewhat and the plot gets weak a few times. Delroy Lindo plays his heart out on his role but he is let down by the weak plot and carry through of the story. I was entertained and disappointed at the same time while watching this movie and maybe as a long time Spike Lee fan and I am a bit biased in my review.

"MackMonMay87","6","0","2","16 June 2020"," Spike Lee's Latest Bleeds Out a Bit, Great at Times, Confusing at Others
","I generally enjoy Spike Lee's films, and consider many of his movies to be required viewing for any contemporary film buff. I loved 2018's Blakklansman, so I figured that Da 5 Bloods on Netflix would be right up my alley.<br/><br/>The story of 5 black Vietnam vets returning to their former front, now-tourist-destination is sometimes charming, sometimes powerful, but all the time uneven.<br/><br/>There are some outstanding performance moments here, especially from Delroy Lindo, who I haven't seen in anything for a while, and the always charismatic Chadwick Boseman. There's interesting filmmaking touches, like all the other members of the Bloods being their current-day ages as they relive the combat memories, with only Boseman's character remaining young in the memories, as he never got a chance to age.<br/><br/>The 4 remaining alive have definite chemistry with each other, and in some of the comedic moments of the movie, had me in stitches with their jabs and insults at each other. There's occasional tense, confrontational moments that the vets have with Vietnam locals, and those scenes are taut and engaging because you can imagine that underneath the surface, there's still underlying resentment amongst many Vietnamese people towards the military and Americans in general. Those scenes flow well.<br/><br/>What doesn't work is when the movie brings us in with a comedic, almost Hangover-like vibe (I think Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicolsohn were in an old-guy version of The Hangover not too long ago, right?), and it lingers on this portion of the movie a while, also introducing elements like Otis' long-lost half-Vietnamese, half-black lovechild who he's never met, that he then has no other significant interaction with until the end of the movie. An entire film could've been made about him reconnecting with his estranged daughter, and they don't even get much dialouge together.<br/><br/>After they begin their treasure hunt for the gold that they stumbled on during the war, the movie turns towards a thriller-action vibe, stretching the limits of believability when the Bloods are still able to mow down modern Vietnamese fighters (although not without sacrifices on their end also). The intensity and extreme gore come out of nowhere, and the movie wasn't really marketed in this way, so it's pretty jarring.<br/><br/>Delroy Lindo's character, a black Trump supporter, is a commentary on many aspects of modern American society and how our country deals with its vets, however some of his jaunts off by himself, speaking to the camera, get awkward and sometimes unintentionally funny because of how blunt they are. To be clear, what he's going through or what he's saying *isn't* funny. The way that it's framed and displayed, with zero nuance or subtlety, is what made me laugh.<br/><br/>There's a lot of dialouge towards the beginning of the movie where The Bloods are getting guided around Vietnam, and they casually drop multiple black-history facts to one another in a very detailed and educationally explicit way. I have zero problems with a film displaying an angle of history that's too often left out of mainstream education. One of the reasons I enjoy Spike Lee's films is because of the perspective and the power he can convey from his experience.<br/><br/>However dialouge between fictional characters still has to sound like what people would say to each other, and I have a hard time swallowing that these grizzled old vets would be trading historical facts with one another in such a plucky way. If it was a scene of them educating or speaking to an ignorant white person? Their grandchildren? Sure, that could be powerful. But as it stands, this dialouge and a few other moments in the film where the characters speak so bluntly and openly about history in situations where you wouldn't go into that much detail; take you out of the film.<br/><br/>If Spike Lee wanted to make a documentary about black soldiers in Vietnam, I would watch the hell out of it, but if it's historical fiction, then commit to that.<br/><br/>Again, it's not all a mess. A scene where Delroy Lindo's character saves his soon from mortal danger is especially tense and very moving. Almost every scene Chadwick Boseman is in is touching. There's good chemistry amongst the leads, and Spike Lee knows how to move a camera, he's a cinematic master, so in terms of visuals, the movie is smooth and stylistic, with a choppy grain used on the scenes from the past, but not to the point that it looks distracting.<br/><br/>There was potential for a truly powerful story here, but I think Spike Lee should've chosen between a Nam film entirely set in the past with a young cast, or refrained on the amount of flashbacks with an aged cast, and gotten to the tension quicker.<br/><br/>I would say that if you're a Lee fan or a fan of the cast, then it's worth checking out. But in terms of Black History, Vietnam films, or other works from Spike Lee if you're a casual fan of his, then there's other works you can go towards other than this one, which clocks in around 2 and half hours."

We were supposed to believe this was a tight knit group, but I didnt get the feeling they were really friends at all.<br/><br/>Also, and maybe I missed something: why were the younger versions of themselves played by the same actors, looking almost the exact same as they did in Vietnam, as if they hadn't aged in 30+ years?"

","There's some good stuff here, some good scenes of atmosphere and tension and some exploration of PTSD (although nothing that hasn't been said about Nam before). But overall the film is unfocused and the story doesn't hang together well. Most of the characters feel unreal and lacking something. There's also a weird, mischievous tone to the violence - Tarantino-esque - which jars with the more serious subject matter. A weird one, all told. If you're expecting something like BlackkKlansman, you'll probably be disappointed. Try to go in without those expectations and you might be entertained."
"Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","8","0","3","14 June 2020"," Da 5 Bloods Completes the Mission
","Spike Lee has written and directed some movies that were timely when they debuted and have remained relevant throughout the years. Do The Right Thing (1989) is 31 years old, but it could have been made right now and it would feel like it was ripped from the headlines. In a way, that's quite devastating, but it is great to have such an important talent thoughtfully creating work today. A new Spike Lee joint, Da 5 Bloods, premiered on Netflix this weekend. Let's see how it fits in Lee's stacked filmography.<br/><br/>Da 5 Bloods is the story of four Vietnam veterans returning to the country to retrieve the remains of their fallen friend after almost 50 years. Delroy Lindo plays MAGA-hat wearing Paul, who seems the most affected by returning to Vietnam. His anger is palpable and there's anxiety at the surface on every interaction with the environment. David, an unexpected tagalong, is Paul's estranged son played by Jonathan Majors. Clarke Peters plays Otis as the steadying force with the logistics of the excursion mapped out. Norm Lewis is Eddie, jovially masking the pain of a life lived after war. And, Isiah Whitlock, Jr. rounds out this outstanding ensemble. There is also a limited performance by Chadwick Boseman as Stormin' Norman, the fallen soldier and erstwhile leader and moral center of the 5 Bloods. While there is an additional motivation for the remaining Bloods in the plot more than the simple conceit of recovering their friend, the importance of the Da 5 Bloods is what Lee has to say about African Americans in war for the United States and the continued discrimination that African Americans are subjected to in America. Like many Spike Lee films, come to Da 5 Bloods ready to be entertained and educated.<br/><br/>As a film itself, the best assets are these veteran actors who put their hearts and souls into embodying these characters. Delroy Lindo gives such a full-bodied performance that he fills up the screen whenever he's around. It's very visceral and engrossing. Clarke Peters and Jonathan Majors also stand out as contrasts to Lindo. Peters is soulful and steady with every moment. I'll also mention that Marvin Gaye plays an important role throughout. Each song selection that plays drops us right back into the thick of that time - in such a complicated era. The soundtrack provides just that extra touch of atmosphere. For a movie that's two and a half hours, it doesn't feel like a long slog through the jungle.<br/><br/>My issues with Da 5 Bloods are just some strange choices that either will bother you or they won't. There is a decision made about how to depict these characters in the past. It is jarring at first, but it makes sense why Lee made the choice, I guess. Also, I initially questioned the budget of the film when watching the first battle scene and helicopter aerial shot. It was distracting, but overall, not totally detrimental to the film. Lastly, there seems to be a tense between what the plot necessitates and what the film wants to say. They two work together in some parts better than others, which makes the film a mixed bag.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I would say sit back with a bowl of popcorn and let the mind of Spike Lee take you back to Vietnam with Da 5 Bloods. I don't think you'll regret giving this film your time."

Non of it really even fitted in with the rest of the film. If it had just been a film about old war friends going back to Vietnam to find gold it would of been a lot better movie. At some points in the film the tone just didn't feel right, there were parts that felt like it was a comedy almost.

"Mike_O_Dwyer","6","0","7","13 June 2020"," Jumble In The Jungle
","There's a rushed feel to Da 5 Bloods, as if everything was thrown at it as fast as possible and put together without waiting to see what sticks. 4 old black guys go back to Vietnam, the son of one of them tags along, to search for the remains of a fallen colleague and maybe find some lost gold bullion. So far, so good, in an Apocalypse Now meets Three Kings kind of way.<br/><br/>Everyone meets up and enjoys a night out on the town before heading into the jungle on their quest, which is all fun and games as the characters are introduced. Delroy Lindo is the big MAGA man, a forceful my-way-or-the-highway presence who doesn't need or want anyone's help. Clarke Peters is Mr Sensible, the smooth that holds everyone's rough edges together. Isiah Whitlock is the joker in the pack, and Norm Lewis is the flash guy. Obvs, they all have their faults which have to get exposed, because that's the kind of film it is.<br/><br/>The trouble starts once they head into the jungle. everything looks like they walked along a trail to get to a spot to shoot, and then took five steps into the trees. It really looks like they're on a camping holiday and decided to shoot a movie while they were at it. They don't ever seem to endure the hardships of outdoor living so much as potter around slightly of trail for a bit before being cheaply rewarded by a hackneyed plot device - eyes roll rather than heads.<br/><br/>Because they complete their objectives so easily there's nothing been invested in their struggle. There's been no drama at all other than a few flashbacks to Chadwick Boseman, his righteous charm guiding them to victory over an ambush before the inevitable befalls him and sets in motion the 50 or so years wait for his buddies to go back and find him. Yeah, it's a hokey AF premise.<br/><br/>After the gold is found things kick off like a rejected Chuck Norris script. There's bad guys who can't shoot straight. There's good guys who spray bullets everywhere randomly without much by way of a need to conserve ammo. There's CGI puffs of blood that stand in such stark contrast to the real life footage shown earlier of Nguyen Van Lem being shot in the head, and how death by gunfire really looks - it makes Da 5 Bloods action sequences look like a COD video game in comparison. Awful. If you're going to use real world documentary footage of what actually happened to help set the tone of your story then tonally you need to have some grit, not cheap fluff.<br/><br/>There's too much going on and none of it feels particularly well thought out to be anything other than a first pass at what could have been something with depth.<br/><br/>On the upside, Whitlock and Peters are as watchable as ever - Peters is the glue that holds this all together. Lindo desperately needed better dialogue to get his acting chops around as he had the most showy bits, that he elevated what he had to work with to where he got to says more about his skills than that of the writers.<br/><br/>Everyone else in the movie is a plot device, there to be used to create a reason for something to happen rather than to breathe life into situations.<br/><br/>Maddeningly disappointing."

","Da 5 Bloods is one of the best and most powerful films I've seen in a while. It's not a perfect film but it's really close to being one.<br/><br/>It tells a story relevant to everyone today, it has some of the best performances of the last three years. It's got a tremendous screenplay and brilliant cinematography.<br/><br/>I got to talk about the performances first because they are sublime. Delroy Lindo gives a career-best performance as Paul. Lindo steals every scene he is in with his ferocious and sometimes vicious performance which will stay in the front of your mind for weeks after the film is over. There's something so haunting, yet beautiful about this performance and this character. I seriously doubt there will be a better performance this year, the academy better get this blood his oscar. In his limited screentime, Chadwick Boseman is terrific. His performance is empowering and it wouldn't surprise me if his character grows to the iconicity of Radio Raheem in the future. Some of the supporting cast, unfortunately, isn't great, especially some of the Vietnamese and French characters. They don't deliver their dialogue with the slickness that other characters do and it makes them stand out in a film full of great performances.<br/><br/>The screenplay is a haunting and somewhat upbeat statement about war and love. The film reminded me of Radio Raheem's iconic speech about love and hate in Lee's most well-known and praised picture, Do The Right Thing. The screenplay is brilliant if not a bit messy, but I can forgive the messiness for the bigger picture that the film is trying to convey.<br/><br/>The cinematography is bleak and disturbing. I'll say off the bat, there is a lot of bloodshed in Da 5 Bloods, all of it is terrifying. I've never seen a film where death is shown in such a real, graphic and terrifying way. It almost makes you feel like you're back in the war, like our main characters. When entering a flashback the film changes its aspect ratio to one commonly seen in the '60s. I am a huge fan of this choice and it adds to the style of the film.<br/><br/>In finality, Da 5 Bloods is a really great film. Aside from its flaws, it is a truly great film that will spark a shit-ton of conversation."
