","If you understand Lonely Island you will love this movie. It may not be for everyone, however I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you don't know what Lonely Island is google them and watch them on youtube. This movie perfectly set the stage for a world were the lonely island crew had massive fans, but in reality their fanbase is rather small.<br/><br/>Still the movie has massive laughs, the references are on point, and some of the songs are actually pretty good parodies of other genres.<br/><br/>I give the movie a solid 9 out of 10. If I wasn't a Lonely Island fan I would still give it at least a solid 7. It's entertaining and fun, and a nice divergence from the Super Hero dominated world we have today."
"coreyjdenford","8","39","50","25 August 2016"," He just never stopped
","This is my review of Popstar Never Stop Never Stopping (spoiler free)<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>Cast: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows<br/><br/>Plot: The life of superstar musician Conner4Real (Samberg) appears to be a charmed one, filled with groupies, screaming crowds and sacks of cash. But trouble is on the horizon in the form of a scheming rapper (Chris Redd), a disastrous merchandise deal and a swarm of killer bees.<br/><br/>The spirit of This is Spinal Tap looms large over the latest comedy from the Lonely Island Crew. Like Rob Reiner's masterpiece, it's a mockumentary and a fun one at that with laughs coming out of the whazoo. It follows three likable idiots as they navigate the choppy waters of the music biz. There is even an update of Tap's 'Sh*t Sandwich' scene, as Conner4Real (Andy Samberg in possibly his funniest role ever) checks out reviews of his new album: rather than showing a star rating, Rolling Stone awards it the poop emoticon. Happily, rather than coming off as a pale imitation, Popstar: Never Sop Never Stopping squeezes laughs out of its tale like juice from a plum. However if the music industry was silly in the 1980s this certainly shows how silly it was but it's even daft now, and Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer gleefully go to town sending up its absurdities. Conner4Real is an ear studded jackass, whose humongous entourage includes an eyebrow specialist, a scarf caddy (that's a real thing) and a guy who punches him in the nuts to remind where he came from. <br/><br/>Weirdly he has an army of personalized holograms that caper around the stage. Conner is a narcissist who uploads daily videos to Youtube, and who his best friend Owen (Taccone) to wear a deadmau5-like helmet that emits a terrifying light beacon and makes an ominous sound that is likely to deafen anybody that passes by. However Conner, is an attention seeker and there is nothing that he won't do to get attention – a trait that is consistently hilarious – and, given Miley's twerking and Kanye's tweet-based rants, it is all too plausible today. Hot Rod, which is the Lonely Island's film about a wannabe Evel Knievel, was at times hysterical, but lumbered with a weak narrative that really let it down. Popstar's set-up is simpler and more effective and won't fail to make you laugh. It turns out Conner4Real used to be just Conner, a decent guy who formed a boy band with Owen and his other buddy Lawrence (Schaffer) just because he wanted to see what it was like to be famous. When he got a taste for fame, he became a monster: Owen became his Dj-slave and Lawrence retired to a farm to whittle woodcarvings but unfortunately he hates that job but anything to get away from the monster. <br/><br/>The story, as Owen attempts to reunite The Style Boyz which was the name of Conner's boy band, hat bit is surprisingly engaging. What they have added to the film are the inspired cameos peppered throughout the film mainly from the worlds of music (Arcade Fire, Justin Timberlake, Seal) and comedy (Will Forte, Bill Hader oddly with very long hair), and finally both (Weird Al Yankovic). On a weird note there is also a penis, which if reports are to be believed, belongs to an A-list director. This is Spinal Tap, of course was pinned around several gloriously bad songs, but they were enjoyable much like this the music is stupid but it's enjoyable even if some of it is offensive. But This is Spinal Tap lampooned around different genres of music. And Lonely Island certainly know their stuff because they know their way around a big juicy hook, which is what a song needs as anyone who has watched their Saturday Night Live videos can attest. Highlights here include Finest Girl, a sex jam with relentless references to the assassination of Osama Bin Laden, and Equal Rights, a paean to gay marriage filled with assurances that the singer is heterosexual. The tunes in this movie are whip-smart, quick-witted and stupendously dumb but that's a good because the hook makes them catchy that you'll be singing the hits well after the credits roll. <br/><br/>In conclusion this is a quick-witted and well written comedy that will make you laugh out loud and even produce tears from your eyes. This is certainly a Lonely Island movie and probably one of the best of their movies it's completely relentless even the greatest comedy kings and queens will love it. <br/><br/>Verdict: An absolute blast, with a frenetic strike-rate and songs that will worm their way into your ears for days. Like Conner, this comedy's for real. <br/><br/>8/10 incredibly funny"

"matthewssilverhammer","8","59","86","10 June 2016"," Made My Face Hurt
","The excessive world of modern pop is so soulless and pretentious, it's ripe picking for drama. The mental breakings of stars like Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson and others show an inherent flaw in how human beings are turned into oblivious money-making commodities, and then unceremoniously spit-out when their glimmer dies. Popstar, the brain child of the YouTube-turned-SNL stars The Lonely Island, touches on these things enough, but mostly it's just fantastic jokes. A timely and lightning-fast musical mockumentary, I could barely catch my breath from laughing. The story works as a parallel to the careers of the three Lonely Island guys themselves. Conner4Real (Samberg) is an international popstar who has grown beyond the popularity of his two Style Boyz partners (Taccone, Schaffer). While it uses that parallel effectively, it never becomes overbearing. Instead what shines are the original songs, a staple of these guys past endeavors, including their groundbreaking ""SNL Digital Shorts"" segments. Each one is an instant classic (i.e. ""I'm So Humble"", ""Things in My Jeep""), played ridiculously as if they have influenced real musicians, many of whom make hilarious cameos. For those of you old enough to remember the comedy classic ""Spinal Tap"", this format may seem somewhat familiar. However, a distractingly blatant rip-off this is not. It uses its 30-year separation as a way to point out the modern massive difference between actual artistic influence and silly cultural nostalgia that permeates the musical landscape. And while it doesn't quite reach Spinal-Tap-heights of greatness, if you're looking for a perfect friends-night-out, this is a comedy you will be happy to visit and revisit over and again."
"tvoth88","10","55","81","19 June 2016"," Excellent Satire
","Great movie!! I absolutely love the way its a documentary with such famous musicians and rappers adding to the satire. The story is so true and attacks the song writing skills of today's music. If you have a good beat, throw in a bunch of catch phrases with a cool voice, add another famous singer to back up with a couple of lines and you got a new hip hop/rap song. I was completely entertained and recommend this movie for anyone to sit back and enjoy great comedy. Love the fact JT dominates the nerd entourage cook and has the ability to be humble and have fun with this movie. The swearing can be a little intense but the movie stays true to the creators. Hope everyone else enjoys as much as my laughter filled evening."
"esgaril","9","39","56","23 June 2016"," Great movie about a lovable idiot and his friends
","Let me start with this: the movie is NOT, nor was it ever intended to be an SLN skit. I've seen a lot of reviews around the net comparing it to their digital shorts, but it's a huge mistake and if you went to the cinema expecting an extended digital short, you have only yourself to blame for the disappointment. Another type of complaint is that it's not critical enough of the pop industry, but it's also a false expectation, it was never intended to do that. If you know The Lonely Island even a little bit, you have to know that they are true fans of the music industry in general and they don't drag people. Hell, Andy didn't do it when he was supposed to, just watch his roast of James Franco. He said he wasn't comfortable with insulting people and Akiva and Jorma share this sentiment. As Kiv said in an interview: they don't throw shade, they throw sunshine. <br/><br/>So now that I cleared up that what this movie isn't, let's see what it is. It's a fake pop documentary about popstar Conner4Real, played by Andy Samberg. It's fake in the sense that obviously Conner is not a real person and the shenanigans he gets into are over the top TLI style, but other than that it's an actual documentary with famous people commenting on the events every so often. I don't want to spoil anything so I'm gonna be vague: the boys make fun of the ridiculous situations and circumstances that goes with being someone in the center of a lot of people's attention, they point out the absurdity in the popstar lifestyle, but that's only the comedy aspect of the movie. Underneath that, this movie is about a lovable, sometimes childishly oblivious and out of thouch with reality kinda guy, who never had a normal life, so he doesn't know how to deal with it when things don't go his way and we follow his journey to learn and grow as a person. Conner may be a fictional character, but he's not a caricature, neither is anyone else in the movie. The characters might be a bit over the top sometimes which provides the comedy elements in the movie, but the friendship between Conner (Andy), Owen (Jorma) and Lawrence (Akiva) is real and touching and THAT's what this movie is about. While obviously it's a comedy, there are a few real, emotional moments in there that made me tear up. I won't tell about the story more, but I have to mention the music briefly: the songs are amazing (though I'm not a big fan of Hunter's bits) and Conner performing ""Finest girl"" on stage is just hot damn!<br/><br/>In conclusion: I really liked the movie, I think the boys have every right to be proud of it, and if you don't go into this with false expectations you'll enjoy it very much too! Mark my words: it's gonna be cult classic!"
"Red_Identity","Null","23","32","3 July 2016"," Very entertaining
","For a satire like this to work, it needs to have its heart in the right place. I was hesitant when watching the trailers, but fortunately the film doesn't lose track of the bigger humanization with these characters and it wears its heart on its sleeve. But perhaps that's also why it didn't go as far as it could have gone, and when all is said and done, perhaps plays things a little too safely. Still, it's vastly entertaining and the performances are aces. Andy Samberg excels at the comedy but also on making the lead a very likable protagonist, no mater his flaws. It's very easy to root for him. As a whole, definitely go seek this out and recommend it to your friends. Very underrated film that deserved to be bigger."

","Same erg is one of those actors whom is relatively unknown here in the UK. And to be honest, the most famous thing he's probably famous for on the shores of the UK is the Sandler Movie That's my Boy.<br/><br/>But if you go a little deeper into his body of work, his movies are consistently funny, full of pop culture references, and with Schaffer at the helm, we not only have a wonderful satire on the state of celebrity with cameos from a plethora of stars whom are not ashamed to be self deprecating, we also have one of the funniest films of the year.<br/><br/>But the most ingenious thing about the movie is that you can't point the finger to which celebrity the writers are parodying. <br/><br/>One would instantly say Bieber, given the title. But Connor4Real isn't really a hateful character, in fact, he's just a product of the system, and has been spoon fed everything he has been given since his fame.<br/><br/>But when his second album fails, the cracks begin to show for him, so he becomes desperate to save his popularity, and goes to the extreme to do so.<br/><br/>It all sounds very much like Get Him To The Greek, and while movie too is funny, and from the house of Apatow also, Popstar just has that left-field wit about it.<br/><br/>For example, the equal rights song is funny anyway, with Connor stating every second that he is straight, but then it goes over the top in the right way, showing a copy of Predator, and him randomly saying Hot Wings, to not let his millions of adoring fans that he is a full blooded male.<br/><br/>And every celebrity cliché is thrown into the mix. From stupid product decisions, to relationships for the sake of status, rather than love. It sounds pretty perfunctory stuff, but it's handled in a way that doesn't treat the audience as they would need a joke explaining to them, the writers treat them with a bit of intelligence.<br/><br/>And this is from a movie where Seal gets not only attacked by wolves, but states that he's been in that situation before.<br/><br/>The references come thick and fast, and in my opinion the Tony? Scene is one of the funniest scenes of the year.<br/><br/>Like most comedies that are original and fire all cannons to begin with, it runs out of steam before the end, but then they have a secret weapon up, their sleeves......<br/><br/>Michael Bolton.<br/><br/>Highly original, consistently funny, but treating the audience in a way that most comedies don't do these days (Dirty Grandpa, Bad Neighbours 2), Popstar: NSNS is as stupid as it is brilliant.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing"
"tjgoalie13","8","29","43","8 June 2016"," A Little Formulaic, But Admittedly Funny.
","Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping never looked all that appealing to me, but I must say it was surprisingly better than I expected. Seeing the trailers I thought the film was another in a wave of ultra dumb comedies, but up front, it's really not. Popstar is a little formulaic, but is admittedly funny, and finds a way to even be witty. Even more impressive, although not all that surprising is that some of the songs in this movie are actually pretty catchy, albeit mock-ups.<br/><br/>For those who love This is Spinal Tap and other films of that nature, this film is a little derivative. That being said, it's not as if this is just a rehash of other better films, that entire genre does require modernizations every few years. Because this film is spoofing not only the musicians of today, but everybody in the entertainment world. That being said this film does list as another Judd Apatow film and does have some formulaic moments that appear in all of his films.<br/><br/>The most notable ""Appatowism"" in this film is the overdone comedy trope of today, where the film lingers on jokes far longer than they should, under the illusion that lingering over a joke makes it funnier. It's kinda like when a goofy kid makes a great joke everybody laughs, and then the kid gets confident and keeps pushing the joke until everybody around is just wishing he'd shut up and go away. That being said, the film doesn't live off the annoying lingering joke, and succeeds at being genuinely funny, all the time. It's not the funniest movie this year, and it may not even be hilarious, but the film is consistently littered with raunchy funny jokes, that often deliver.<br/><br/>The film was marketed poorly, in my opinion, because it came across as an ultra dumb comedy, and in reality isn't half as dumb as it comes across as. The film occasionally wanders into the dumb comedy area, but often finds it's way back into the land of witty comedies, making it somewhat of a mixed bag. For instance, the songs are catchy, they are witty reflections of our pop stars, but they are also a little too on the nose, making them come across as a little dumb. That being said, underneath the thin exterior of a dumb comedy is a really witty reflection of our current music industry, and the pressures, idiocracy, immaturity, selfishness, and chaos commonly associated with it.<br/><br/>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is filled with cameos from famous musicians and comedy actors, some of which even lend their singing talents to the musical pieces. At times it feels like the entire music industry is in this film, as they play along on a mockumentary making fun of them. However, the film is never really mean spirited, or all that damning it just grooves along, spoofing everybody from the musicians to the fans. For those who like the lonely island, you'll love this movie, and for those who are seeking a funny comedy, regardless of rating this is also a movie you'll love, but there should be a note, this movie really isn't for kids or the weak spined."

","I am not in the target audience for ""Popstar"", as I am a guy in my 50s who has no interest in rap or anything written after about 1985. So, the fact that I enjoyed this is something...isn't it?!<br/><br/>In many ways, this film is very much like ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" as well as ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby""....along with a heaping helping of pop music and rap. Just like Ricky Bobby, Conner (Andy Samberg) goes from the top of the game to total loser very quickly...and only by learning humility and appreciating his friends can he once again be on top. And, like ""Walk Hard"", it's a mockumentary about the music industry...and it's very crude at times and has some genitalia. It is NOT a film for kids, that's for sure! <br/><br/>Overall, it's a clever an perceptive film...making fun of the stupid antics MANY modern musicians engage in as well as tickling your funny bone in the process. Enjoyable and worth seeing...provided you are an adult and have a relatively high threshold for the offensive."

","Funny as F**K, From the hilarious monologues, To the amazing celebrity cameos, To the outright offensive song lyrics which leaves you crying with laughter, Pop star: never stop stopping is a must see for any lonely island, Andy Samberg, comedy or even just music lover! I definitely recommend you see this and buy it because the lonely island need to be making more movies if they turn out like this. Go see this movie now, I just can't recommend enough. Though nearer the end of the middle act some of the jokes became dragged on a little bit, also the ending was a little predictable but to be honest i think the film was designed to be predictable, as it is parodying various musical artists. Apart from that the film isn't far from a perfect comedy."
"ramcamcole","9","31","57","8 June 2016"," A surprise hit in a unique genre
","While we've seen plenty of mockumentaries before it's not every year we see a new one. It's a genre that goes mostly unexplored, especially in mainstream cinema. From the trio of The Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer) we get Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. Popstar follows Samberg's Conner4real, a Justin Bieber-like performer with A-list celebrity status, from his time with the boy band The Style Boyz to his solo career. On the verge of his negatively received new album and a world tour Conner must cope with the potential decline of his career and his celebrity status. The film works as a hilarious satire on the music industry while also being a parody of the concert tour documentaries we've come to see from various artists such as Katy Perry, One Direction, and The Jonas Brothers. Comedy veterans Sarah Silverman and Tim Meadows make supporting appearances and Chris Redd has fun with a potential breakout role as Hunter the Hungry, a fellow musician who's on the way up while Conner is on the way down. Not every joke in the movie hit, but the ones that did had me nearly falling out of my chair in laughter. The Lonely Island are known for their super catchy and occasionally raunchy songs and Popstar delivers in that department. So much so you'll likely have the songs stuck in your head in the following days. Popstar is an overall fun time at the theater. Also, be sure to be on the lookout for the plethora of celebrity cameos Popstar sprinkles within it's 87 minute run time."

The 117 leading ""song artists"" making cameo appearances here obviously are taking great pride in delivering their spoof lines of Palavered Drivel with straight faces. The funnier thing is that you could read the same sort of Pompous Pontification in any issue of Rolling Stone and its competing Zines including self-styled ""music reviews,"" and the pretensions on display would be even greater assaults against Common Sense and Rational Thinking. Since the advent of Autotune, your Uncle Fred and Aunt Ethel could be the equal of any ""Pop Star"" selling out stadiums, as long as they are limber enough to simulate obscene body positions (something within the capabilities of any individuals still able to use the toilet by themselves). The definition of ""Pop Music"" always has been anything that will make someone older than yourself (or the reviewer) cringe. ""Pop Music"" is NOT fully accessible to pop drinkers, or to people exercising their better judgment. As Brian Wilson had it, BURP SOUNDS better expresses the Essence of Pop.

","In 2007 a small-scale comedy with little hype and eventual disappointing box office returns and reviews appeared on our cinema screens, that film was Hot Rod.<br/><br/>Featuring the trio of comedians that would eventually become a popular singing group known as Lonely Island, Hot Rod introduced Andy Samberg, Jorma Tacone and Akiva Schaffer to the world and while initially it seemed like the gangs feature film foray may've been a mistake, in the years to come Hot Rod has become one of the great cult films of recent memory and a beloved comedy staple that continues to be enjoyed today.<br/><br/>On the back of Hot Rod's eventual success and the heights they've reached with Lonely Island, it's a shame that many cinema-goers failed to jump on board with Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping as what we have here is a mockumentary look at modern day music and fame that could very well be our modern day take of This is Spinal Tap.<br/><br/>It's a big call, and one that is perhaps overly optimistic but Popstar with its clever mix of industry lampooning, cast of colourful characters, downright hilarious faux songs and high percentage of joke success (even though the often immature and low common denominator humour will absolutely not be for everyone) certainly stands as one of recent memories best mainstream comedy films and a further win for the Lonely Island collective.<br/><br/>Recruiting a star studded ensemble that features cameos from a huge collection of stars both from the movie industry and music scene, led by Samberg as the self-absorbed Connor, the film offers the trope a great playground to deliver their large swag of jokes that are on consideration a lot deeper than you'd gather at first glance and with a near endless stream of content coming at the viewer, as was the case with Hot Rod and key to its lasting success, Popstar is a comedy that will likely continue to find wins on repeat viewings thanks to the various hidden jokes and references that may take keen eyed viewers a while to fully discover.<br/><br/>In a genre that has largely been floundering of recent years, Popstar against all the odds stands as an against all the odds shining robot headed beacon of the mainstream Hollywood comedy factory and a likely new favourite to many that will discover the film on home formats, just as Hot Rod did when Rod Kimble found his audience at home after an initial lacklustre reception.<br/><br/>4 sick turtles out of 5"

I guess it could be about a lot of artists in the business but they have said that it is loosely based on Justin Bieber. Andy, Jorma and Akiva grew up together as best buds in a boy band-The Style Boyz-and had minor success, before Andy decided to go the solo route. Sarah and Tim work for Andy in a manager type capacity but Andy doesn't seem to become as popular on his own, as he thought he would be. There are lots of cameos from the music and entertainment world; one of the funniest is Justin Timberlake as Andy's personal chef. Most of the real music cameos will praise Andy and mention how much their lives have been influenced by him. There are a few funny parts but overall, it was like a SNL sketch that went on for a little too long. There is a scene just as the end credits start but nothing at the very end. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 26 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think I would rent it, either.

","The mockumentary style of filmmaking can be a divisive one. You have to balance the tone well enough for viewers to believe in the story you're trying to tell while also giving enough laughs to please the fans of the genre. Even if Popstar didn't produce as many big laughs as I would have hoped, I can appreciate the attempt to change the structure to typical filmmaking.<br/><br/>Starring the trio from The Lonely Island and pretty much every other comedian and/or celebrity, Popstar has a tendency to rely too heavily on surprise cameos and over-the-top gags. That's not to say I didn't think the main cast had their moments, they did. But the biggest laughs came from surprise appearances from people I didn't know were in the film.<br/><br/>The overabundance of celebrities make me curious as to why virtually no one showed up to the theatre to see the film. It's also not like they didn't properly market the film. The trailers show exactly what you're going to get; a raunchy comedy told with in the mockumentary style about a dysfunctional lead singer who struggles to regain fame, with plenty of cameos mixed in. Perhaps there just isn't the audience for this type of story.<br/><br/>The other detraction of Popstar is that it's blatantly predictable. We all know how these films about music stars/bands go, there's a breakup, downfall, and usually a rise. So when the film reaches for a little bit of dramatic weight via one of these clichés, you see it coming a mile away. <br/><br/>With all this said, there's plenty of entertainment to be had here. It's a quick watch and the film definitely earns its R rating in a good way, so I can see the appeal here for comedy fans or anyone who has watched SNL in the last 10 years or so.

","One of the things I loved to do when I was a kid was hook up my old camcorder to the TV and face them towards each other. The effect would create a swirl of constantly moving frames that would eat into each other like reflections on either side of a fun house mirror. Popstar is kind of like doing that. It points the camera at fictional pop superstar Conner (Samberg) but it might as well be pointing it directly at the music industry, creating a post- modernist spiral of superficiality that is at once hilarious and distressing.<br/><br/>Taking cues from modern music vanity projects (though from Justin Bieber: Never Say Never (2011) especially), Popstar follows music icon Conner as he prepares for a world tour and awaits the reception of his newest album. Conner was formerly a member of The Style Boyz a Beastie Boys inspired trio co-developed by Lawrence ""Kid Brain"" Dunn (Schaffer) and Owen ""Kid Contact"" Bouchard. These days he's dubbed himself Conner4Real and replaced the embittered Lawrence with a constant stream of social media updates. Owen is still around though he's been relegated to the status of iPod shuffling DJ on Conner's world tour.<br/><br/>Popstar is arguably one of the most savagely entertaining music industry satire to come out in the last few years. While constantly focused on the low-hanging fruit of celebrity personal branding, product-placement, reality TV inspired banality and faux savoir- faire worldliness, audiences can't help but respond with heaps of constant laughter. The laughter becomes louder when The Lonely Island crew cuts deep into Hollywood's insincere sanctimony and egoism such as when Conner releases ""Same Love"" inspired ""Equal Rights"" which reiterates Conner heterosexuality one too many times.<br/><br/>The film is littered with an obscene amount of musical celebrity cameos ranging from Danger Mouse, and RZA to Michael Bolton and Weird Al Yankovic many of which play themselves and give sit down commentary on how their music was inspired by Conner's ""superior"" abilities. This in itself is a funny premise but the movie takes it to the nth degree allowing celebrities to savagely mock themselves and each other with the absurdity of A$AP Rocky hawking school lunchables. Let's face it, any movie that begins with holographic versions of Adam Levine dry humping himself while Conner sings ""I'm so humble"" in the background is clearly setting a mocking tone.<br/><br/>That said there are some jokes that just don't work, the most egregious of which is Popstar's parody of TMZ, CMZ. The set-piece hopes to coax laughter out of sycophantic shrieking and Will Arnett's need to always have a straw in his mouth. This along with tour sponsorship being handled by washing machine manufacturer Aquaspin are more bizarre than funny.<br/><br/>Yet with the sheer amount of visual humor, clever dialogue, goofy- comic setups and a richly layered meta-text, you can't help but enjoy a movie so crudely and gleefully nutty (in more ways than one). The musical interludes are boat loads of fun; Lonely Island's ""Finest Girl (Bin Laden Song)"" being the real showstopper. Andy Sandberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone are clearly at the top of their game and with any luck, still have a few more witty tunes to churn out in the future."

Jorma Taccone plays his DJ who is reduced to wearing a blinking lights oversized helmet on stage. Akiva Schaffer plays Lawrence, a song writer who left the band to become a wood worker on a farm. He resents Conner because of his ego and taking credit for his writing. Tim Meadows plays Conner's frustrated manager, and Sarah Silverman plays his publicist who must present a dose of reality to Conner when he is shamed and reduced to a drunken state at his mother's house. There is numerous celebrity cameos that are usually involved in mock music videos. Taccone and Schaffer also serve as directors and they blend comedy with the reality of fame. The production is flashy and fit the mood but the humor may draw protest from those who are not interested in seeing Samberg autograph a penis that emerges through the rolled down window of his limousine. Theme regards egos and fame and the crash that occurs when they meet. The result is funny and innovative but doesn't walk as hard as Dewey Cox. Score: 9 / 10"

","If you like the previous songs and videos of the ""Lonely Island"" than you will love this film, if you didn't, than you might want to spend your money on something else. This movie was a brilliant on the nose satire of the way of life being lived by a lot of the stars that cameo in this very movie. The jokes walk a fine line between being stupid (but still funny) and clever wit disguised with a ""stupid joke"" coating. All in all it was a good movie, one of the best new comedies I've seen in a while, and I would definitely recommend it. It can be difficult to create a comedy movie because it's hard to keep a joke going for an hour, Popstar does a great job of this task."
"lesleyharris30","8","7","13","9 August 2017"," Hilarity From Beginning to End,
","Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a top notch comedic cast. If you are a fan of the Lonely Islands, then this movie is not to be missed, and it is exactly what you would expect from the trio's first feature length project. It is a laugh riot from start to finish as we follow Connor separating from his group Style Boyz, trying to make it as a solo artist. What follows is a consistently funny, always energetic and never tedious ninety minutes that is a pure delight. There are many great songs featured throughout, which we have come to expect from the group, they really went above and beyond for this project. <br/><br/>I was a little underwhelmed, I was very excited for this film, and was hoping it would be a nine for pure comedy gold, but it ended up being an eight for me. I really just felt that the plot could have gone further, I would like to have seen Connor in more ludicrous situations before making peace with his best friends. I felt the screenplay really had the potential to go anywhere, but it played a little safe. <br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal. Of course, Andy Samberg is stellar as Connor 4Real, a snobby, arrogant, lovable artist that the versatile comedian nails. As well as that, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Sarah Silverman and Tim Meadows shine in main roles, while there are also a ton of priceless cameos throughout that I will not spoil, but each one is well casted and simply hilarious. <br/><br/>Ridiculous fun from beginning to end. Stellar cast, comedically brilliant and boasting some excellent original songs, I would highly recommend Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping to anyone looking for a good comedy. <br/><br/>A member of boy band Style Boyz tries to make it as a solo artist, however, it proves difficult to break away from what originally made his famous. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Andy Samberg"

","The movie was set up with a familiar plot that shouldn't really blow anyone out of the water. it also had a unique reality TV type way of shooting the film, but this movie is really meant for one thing. The off the wall humor. However the problems with the film shouldn't discourage people who want laughs! The movie had quite a bit of off the wall humor. Although the movie doesn't have you busting your gut through the entire showing it has it's moments. So if you like The Lonely Island, or Andy Sandberg's humor, go see the movie! In addition I will say I found the music in the film quite entertaining. The ""So Humble"" song that's at the beginning of the movie and in the trailers is still stuck in my head, and I don't mind."
"avenuesf","1","42","126","17 June 2016"," Andy Samberg made this?!
","Andy Samberg is a funny guy. I've always enjoyed his Lonely Island videos on Saturday Night Live and I like the fact that he gets outrageous and over the top. This movie is absolutely terrible, and I really looked forward to seeing it. It's not funny in the least, it's incredibly pedestrian, and very, very dull.<br/><br/>What was he thinking when he made this? The humor is like something out of a network sitcom and the script is dated and totally predictable. It clearly had a huge budget, and there are cameos from a lot of pop stars, and every single one of them is wasted. I think I laughed only one time in the film, and it was during a satire of TMZ.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time or your money on this. Twenty minutes into the film I realized it wasn't going to go anywhere and I found myself getting more and more impatient for it to be over. I finally gave up and walked out after an hour, which is something I rarely ever do."

"ironhorse_iv","6","4","7","19 September 2016"," Do the Donkey Roll! This music mockumentary was really stupid, but also kinda funny.
","From the minds of Saturday Night Live veterans: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone (collectively known as The Lonely Island) comes an over-the-top comedy about a fading pop-star singer known as Conner Friel AKA Conner4Real (Andy Samberg) who must rethinks his career after his second solo album 'Connquest' tank at the Billboard 100 chart. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the film directed by Schaffer and Taccone is offering nothing new. After all, 1984's 'This is Spiral Tap' & 1978's 'The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash' did the music mockumentary, way better than this movie even did. Also, this movie plot arc is a familiar one: An arrogant celebrity falls from grace, but eventually realizes his own pride and narcissism have contributed to that downfall. So, in sense, the story is a little tiresome, clichÃ©s and predictable. However, I think, the reason why, this over the top movie work is because it's so funny. While, this movie lacks believable. It's make up for its lack of seriously, in its utterly outrageous nature. Yet, the whole thing felt a bit lazy, as they were really going for the low hanging fruit with this film. The jokes were a little too juvenile and gross with the sexual innuendo and harsh language for some viewers, but for me, I didn't mind it, because it landed hard on my funny bone. I found the whole thing, very laughable, even if it's low brow and relies too much on shock value like graphic nudity, drug use, and violence. Who knows, if the penis feature in the film is producer Judd Apatow's junk or not, but it was funny to see. Yet, the whole joke about the man who entire job is punching him in the nuts to remind Conner where he came from, could had been, use more. It's seem like it was forgotten. I also like the fact that the movie is a parody of Justin Bieber's career and his 2011's documentary movie ""Never Say Never'. So, that is a plus. However, the parody of the Celebrity Gossip Show 'TMZ' was kinda fall flat for me. Still, I love the other cultural references in the film such as Disney 1998's 'Parent Trap'. That was semi-OK. However, it's the songs written by Lonely Island that made the movie. I have a blast, listening to the lyrics of 'The Finest Girl', 'Donkey Roll', ""Incredible Thoughts' and ""I'm so humble' written by the Lonely Island. Yet, there were other songs that I kinda wish, were in the film, like ""F**k Off"" that was deleted from the film. Even the songs like 'Two Banditos' and 'Hunter the Hungry Is Gon' Eat' with controversial rapper, Hunter the Hungry (Chris Redd) were kinda funny, even if it's highly offensive. I think Andy Samberg did a great job as the narcissism Conner4Real in his acting, rapping and singing. His character was trouble, but not unlikable. The other fictional characters in this film, are just as watchable. I love the character of Owen (Jorma Taccone) even if it is way too similar to the Kevin Powell role from 2007's 'Hot Rod'. I also dig the short cameo of Justin Timberlake as Tyrus Quash, Conner's chef, even if it's uncredited. Made me wish for the days of SNL Digital Shorts. I also enjoy the cameos of other SNL alums pop up, too, like Tim Meadows, Maya Rudolph, Will Arnett, and Bill Hader. Yet, it's the other celebrity cameos that were a lot memorable. Singers like Adam Levine, Seal and Michael Bolton playing themselves, gave the movie, the best laughs. Others, not so much. The interviews parts with Ringo Starr, Nas, Simon Cowell and others, felt out of place, and not well-used. It's weird to hear them, talk about Conner4real as if he has been singing for years. It doesn't make sense that a young Usher would go into dancing, because of the Style Boys 'Donkey Roll', when, technically they're the same age. The whole 'archival' footage doesn't add up as well. I really have no clue, how old Conner4real is supposed to be. Overall: I wouldn't say, I'm a Style Boy for Life, but I do have to say the movie is kinda dope, even if being dope isn't always what it's cracked up to be. Still, highly recommended."

","When I started watching it I was hoping for something hilarious yet something that I could write more than few sentences about. Well, it wasn't that funny and it wasn't that smart either. The cleverest thing was how the main character Conner is exactly what we think certain kind of celebrities are like.<br/><br/>I mostly wanted to watch this movie because I like The Lonely Island's music, and also Will Arnett was in it. Arnett's part was small, but I expected that. But there wasn't as much music as I would've hoped for. How many songs were fully played? Maybe four. <br/><br/>Mockumentary as a style of story telling is getting a little boring, but how else would they have done this though?<br/><br/>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping was an okay movie.

","I'm all for corny movies but this is horrible! Andy Samberg usually does good comedies but this is horrendous. It's very typical and dry. The script has been done before (similar to Hugh Grant in Music and Lyrics, just more focused and tried to make it funny), and it's annoying that they tried to make it as a documentary. This movie basically sums up Justin Biebers life. It's immature. The stupidest parts as well are the celebrity cameos. Simon Cowell?! Whether they're just trying to be funny, or trying to make it realistic then his cameo was just awful. We all know his stance on music and his opinion in the movie is just the opposite. A waste of 2 hours of my life."
"alecfrazier","1","33","104","5 June 2016"," Truly the worst film I have ever seen!
","There are many films in this world. Millions. Billions, maybe. I cannot profess to have seen all of them, but I have seen at least 1,000, and probably more. Furthermore, I do not pretend to be hypersensitive to the fine arts. I am a viewer, not a trained filmmaker. Nevertheless, I have seen some really awful films. Now, granted, the definition of awful changes from person to person. However, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016) is the single worst film I have ever laid eyes on.<br/><br/>I have been cooped up in my apartment for the last few days, and was in the mood for something fun. I heard this film was a comedy. Ha! The joke's on me! The reviews looked pretty good, and I have not seen the previews, so I read some of the reviews. Those couldn't possibly have been reviews for this film. They said that although this film missed some of its mark, it remained smart, entertaining pop culture satire. Pardon me, I am laughing as I write this.<br/><br/>One minute into Popstar, my reaction was, ""Seriously?"" Three minutes in, my reaction was, ""My God, this is horrible! I wonder if I should leaveÂ…"" Five minutes in, I thought, ""This is in no way entertaining. I hope this is just a joke that ends soon."" Seven minutes in, it dawned upon me, ""Holy cow, they are completely serious."" This is how they wanted to make the film. Finally, nine minutes in, I decided to stay for the entire damn movie, because I was going to watch them destroy pop culture, rape my mind, and ruin America. Sorry if I seem overwrought, but the film really is that bad.<br/><br/>It's not that Popstar doesn't try; it tries very hard. It tries to be the worst, most tasteless film ever produced by humanity. The film follows a popstar, Connor4Real, played by Andy Samberg, as he comes out with his second solo album. He used to belong to a group called Style Boyz, whose members are played by Samberg's real-life ""comedy"" troupe, ""The Lonely Island"". Connor's second solo album starts to tank, and he makes music videos, goes on tour, and interacts with people in his life and business, who are played by a veritable Who's Who of D-List celebrities, except for his publicist, who is played by comedienne Sarah Silverman, who definitely does not give her all for this film. This film insults a number of A-List celebrities by using stock footage of them to associate them with the goings on in the film. A number of other celebrities appear throughout the film to talk about turns of events, and you get the feeling that most or all of them had no clue what they were signing up for.<br/><br/>The film contains many songs authored by The Lonely Island. The songs have the most artificial, forced, intentionally offensive lyrics that one can contemplate. It is stretching it too much to call them music. There are a number of jokes, but they either have no punchlines, or the punchlines do not meet up with the setup. There are only a couple of jokes that actually make you laugh, and you get the distinct impression that those were mistakes on the parts of the writers. The writers, of course, are also The Lonely Island. There is gratuitous nudity, including director Judd Apatow's penis shoved brazenly in your face. He of course directs this film. Popstar film is meant to scandalize, and does not shy away from alienating many populations when possible. This film is also extremely gross, involving turtle vomit and fecal pancakes among other things. <br/><br/>This film will have you cringing, sighing, gasping, groaning, and hiding behind anything and anyone just to catch some peace. This could have been an incredibly successful satire of the modern pop culture phenomenon. Instead, it is absolute, unmitigated trash. At the end of my viewing, I laughed and clapped for several minutes straight. I truly did not know that such a horrible film was possible. Hats off to the cast and crew for lowering the bar of film by several degrees. This film is endemic of a huge problem with this country, and to some degree the world. America is constantly dumbing down, but that assumes that some vestigial amount of intellect is left. This film has no intellect. Common sense has been murdered with a butter knife, and shut down the port-a-potty.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is, to my knowledge, the worst film ever made. On a 1 to 10 rating scale I give it 1. On a 1 to 5 rating scale I give it 1.<br/><br/>Good God, this is horrible."

","You'd think the mockumentary genre was played out by now. If you asked me before I watched this movie, I'd probably think so too. But the humor that the boys of the Lonely Island have concocted is not only completely fresh and well thought-out, but will prove to be ahead of its time some day.<br/><br/>One-third of the comedy team, Andy Samberg, stars as Connor4Real--a Justin Bieber-esque pop icon--who's former hip-hop group broke up when he decided to start his solo career. Experiencing the downward slope of his fame and his slow decline to ""has-been"" status, his ego is too big to realize or admit it. <br/><br/>Along the way, we get documentary-style interviews from real-life ""contemporaries""--such as Usher and Mariah Carey--who give commentary on Connor's career.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with at least a half-dozen songs, which are all catchy enough to be on the radio. But upon further attentiveness to the lyrics, they're laden with totally crude and offensive- -yet hilarious--content. <br/><br/>So many jokes are completely off-kilter and have no ounce of necessity, but we're glad they happen. The humor, both subtle and broad, showcases the comedy trio's range. They use the Seth MacFarlane rapid-fire approach, but in a way where the jokes are much more uniform and cohesive. And if one doesn't work--or merely goes over the audience's head--there's another right around the corner to make us laugh and forget about it.<br/><br/>It finds a nice balance between antics and story. But the Lonely Island have made their brand by successfully fusing political incorrectness, awkwardness and silliness. And the trio has taken it to the next level here. They have such a tight grasp on not only what's funny, but what's topical and realistic--making everything that happens in this movie feel like it could actually happen--or is actually happening. It's a great feeling to completely trust your filmmakers.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by, and featuring, the other two members of the Lonely Island, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. Together, with Samberg, the three of them have established such perfect chemistry over the years, that they probably don't care if you're not laughing at all because it's obvious they believe in their work and make themselves laugh, all while having a great time doing so.<br/><br/>The humor may seem very easy to think up, but is in fact, pretty inventive. Some jokes may prove to be a bit more esoteric for those not in the industry, but there are plenty that aren't.<br/><br/>Usually a lack of laughter comes from something not being funny. But there's an ode of confidence exuding from this film that you feel like, if you're not laughing, you just don't get the joke. <br/><br/>Ever so slyly, the movie's main theme is a mockery of the self-absorption and self-aggrandizing of today's media and society--especially within the millennial generation. But it's never preachy. In fact, for those most caught up with what's hip, the jokes may not come of as jokes at all.<br/><br/>Samberg has so much conviction in his role. It seems as if he truly believes every naive thing that he says and does. His character is so over-the-top, but Samberg makes him so real that it's never over-exaggerated.<br/><br/>While a tad predictable, that's not the point. Popstar never tries to be any other film. So many times have we seen American comedies give their best shot at shamefully replicating--or reinventing--a Judd Apatow/Adam McKay/Todd Phillips/Seth Rogen style of comedy, and lose their own vision. But these guys take their own vision and have their way with it. Samberg and the Lonely Island have influenced comedy a lot in the past decade or so. And now they're changing the rules all over again.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 93"

","There's lots of good comedy here-from the celebrity satire and cameo-littered mockumentary framework to the outlandish songs and dim-witted lead-but it does start to wear thin even within the short run-time, and the predictable plot (props for the spoof of the ""choosing what really matters"" moment with the stage manager though) doesn't do much to fill in the gaps. Still, a serviceable comedy that gets laughs, even if it's just from pure ridiculousness (see the wolf attack/marriage proposal).

","Hmm, I think I'm missing something here or I'm late to the party because I don't get it. I'm only familiar with The Lonely Island's viral music videos like ""I'm On A Boat"" to which I'm not really a fan of either. I know this comedy trio isn't a complete write-off though because people like Jimmy Fallon and the Saturday Night Live crew were behind them and they've been about since the mid-2000s. However, it really isn't my kind of comedy. <br/><br/>It's a musical mockumentary which suddenly gave me flash-backs of David Brent but superbly involved music superstars like 50 Cent, Usher, DJ Khale, Naz and Ringo Star, either getting performances from Seal and Michael Bolton. P!nk, Akon, Adam Levine, Mariah Carey and even Simon Cowell, in fact there's so many it's quite impressive and hard to keep up. <br/><br/>We follow Connor4Real (Andy Samberg) who has to come to terms with the looming fact he's no longer the brand name of the pretentious music industry. The film documents his split from the original line-up of The Style Boyz and his relationship with remaining member DJ Owen (Jorma Taccone) and fallout with ex-member Lawrence (Akiva Schaffer, who both direct this movie.) <br/><br/>There's small parts galore which are borderline cameos excluding the musicians, Sarah Silverman, Joan Cusack, Maya Rudolph, Imogen Poots and even British Inbetweener James Buckley with the only other people worth mentioning is there manager Harry played by SNL regular Tim Meadows and Chris Redd who played the limelight stealing rapper, Hunter, echoing David Brent again. <br/><br/>It's a total parody of the current pop music world and while it has some great satire it failed to make me laugh out loud and I don't remember anyone else in screening did either. It's dragged for a short 87mins runtime but what I was impressed with was the silly songs and the set pieces that were were spot on. <br/><br/>I can only imagine fans of The Lonely Island will find this amusing I would recommend those to watch it and I'm interested to hear what they think.

I expected 87 minutes of dragging, over-the-top stupid humor, and ultimately a burning desire to see credits rolling, but to my pleasant surprise, I actually did not hate this movie. Now pump the brakes... I did not love it. It is not my underrated comedy of the year, it simply was better than I expected. When you see Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone tagged to a film, you should already expect 'Saturday Night Live' satire and humor. 'Popstar: NSNS' simply was an SNL skit expanded to a feature film length, much like its previous successors when popular SNL skits were turned into films. The satire of the pop music world was clever and hilarious at moments and it definitely had those moments that made me laugh at how much the film tore apart notable pop stars in the music world. Now that is the extent of the positives for this flick. Once the film reaches its climax, it loses its steam and quickly becomes a snooze- fest. The comedy quickly reaches too far to pull laughter from its audiences, meanwhile I was already out the door.<br/><br/>Again, not a total failure as I was anticipating it to be. It had its fair share of moments where it vultured a laugh or two out of me and the ever susceptible topic of pop culture and its superstars were ripe for the picking to create clever and relentless jokes of which I enjoyed.

(R)<br/><br/>The ""This Is Spinal Tap"" rock mockumentary style is updated to the modern age when dance pop and hip-hop dominate the charts; Samberg plays Connor4Real, an industry superstar dealing with the fallout of the release of his heavily-hyped album to dismal reviews and sales. Raucous, fast-paced comedy throws everything it can at the dartboard and sees what sticks, be it incisive satire, sly insider jabs, deadpan one-liners, knowingly dumb gags, or gross-out vulgarity. As a result, sloppy at times and uneven overall, but it's admirably relentless and generates more than enough laughs (even the shameful kind) to ultimately succeed in style. Serving as actors, producers, writers and directors, it's Samberg, Taccone and Schaffer's show--they of Lonely Island fame--but they share the wealth with their co-stars, including a galaxy of celebrity cameos from both the film and music industries, often playing themselves.

It is a kind of way they speak, they keep a joke going on too long and add words that don't need to be there for comedy affect. They talk over each other because they think it looks 'more authentic' as in the way real people speak. Pitch Perfect 2 being a perfect example of this. Comedy now is just a cringe fest. It is not funny at all. If you look at comedies pre 2008 they are some great really funny, well done classic comedies. <br/><br/>I wish that Family Guy had never happened because it has single handedly destroyed comedy, even The Simpsons try to copy it and it is the worst, most un-funniest show that has ever been on TV."

","The Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Jorma Taccone) take their song-writing and music video talents to the next level with this brilliant send-up of pop music and the changing music industry in the internet age. It is not that Christopher Guest is too subtle or Weird Al is too old-fashioned; but with declining attention spans and deluge of digital entertainment options... they are. <br/><br/>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is able to capture and imbue the same deadpan satire with in- your-face subtlety. The best satires are a reflection of the current state of culture, music, technology, fandom, and yes vulgarities of society. So while some may dismiss ""Popstar"" as another 90 minute crude-as-craft Apatow vehicle, peppered with cameos to re-grab the attention of the AD/HD crowd, it is much more than that. <br/><br/>In 2005, The Lonely Island viral video ""Lazy Sunday"" was the tipping point for the now ubiquitous You-Tube, and is credited by some for its subsequent $1.5 billion valuation and acquisition by Google. The ensuing battles over copyright take-downs, creation of Hulu, and IP ownership was not lost on it's members. The immediacy and vulgarity of Samberg/Apatow's trademark humor are layered over the archetypical music parody plot, which is simple, superficial hilarity.<br/><br/>But for those looking closely are themes of privacy vs. social media, corporate overreach, obsession with celebrity news, the absurdity of today's ""music""... all with back-handed whimsy. Managing to mock their own audience without them even realizing they are also being critiqued. While Samberg is the lead, the other members co-star and direct, with all three credited as the writers. The Lonely Island boys know how to goose the Millennial audience to remain relevant, while servicing their own influences (namely Christopher Guest and Weird Al Yankovic). <br/><br/>And therein lies the real fun of this film. You can choose which level you want to enjoy it on. Deadpan satire? Sure. Social commentary? Definitely. Mindless fun with crude humor, poking fun at pampered, self-important pop-stars (possibly from Canada)? Absolutely. Oh, and it also reminds you that friends are good. So there's that. <br/><br/>Doink-de-doink."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","3","6","23 December 2016"," Enough hilarious highlights in an otherwise okay movie
","The big question heading into ""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" was whether The Lonely Island trio of Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer could make their brand of pop music humor work in a format that lasts longer than three minutes. Not surprisingly, it's in different three-minute clips that ""Popstar"" works best.<br/><br/>""Popstar"" is a music mockumentary following a pretty standard faux biography structure: Conner4Real (Samberg) is a huge star who made it on his own after many of years of success as a member of the Nasty Boyz, a trio with his childhood best friends, Owen (Taccone) and Lawrence (Schaffer). The story predictably follows his rise and fall, narrating it with a host of cameos from actual music celebrities playing themselves as well as supporting characters.<br/><br/>Conner is an over-the-top caricature of the dumbest celebrity you can imagine, and Lonely Island makes sure that there's no element of his music or rise to fame that you take seriously. Ripping into pop music culture, however, isn't the movie's focus. It's a film about a music group because its creators' gimmick is musical comedy. The goal, presumably, was to create outrageous characters and scenarios, not create stinging satire.<br/><br/>""Popstar"" opts for the machine gun style of comedy, unloading jokes in rapid succession knowing that if at least a majority of them stick, they've done their job. Ostensibly, that strategy works. A number of gags land and feel like rather original jokes, too. From a wolf attack to a wardrobe malfunction to an argument in a limo that's besieged by naked body parts, the sequences constructed with the intention of being funny often are, it's the wedged-in jokes that aren't centerpieces that fall flat.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the comedy songs used in this movie aren't the highlights. Conner's single about equality in which the lyrics are all about how he's not gay even though he's singing about LGBTQ rights is pretty standard for Lonely Island. Fans of their music will be pleased, but the comedy really comes from the joke-writing and the occasional quick-witted dialogue exchanges.<br/><br/>Nothing about the plot is surprising or particularly clever, however, and knowing exactly what direction they're going to take the story within the first 10 minutes weighs down the ceiling for what ""Popstar"" could be. If more jokes missed than hit, this flaw would be abundantly apparent and have caused the whole movie to collapse. <br/><br/>The Lonely Island brand of cleverly packaged immature humor won't be a hit with everyone, but it definitely salvages ""Popstar,"" at least enough that I can highly recommend the clips.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","The movie overall was not too bad. The comedy wasn't subtle or clever, but it wasn't without its moments. There were parts that made me laugh out loud, and others that got a chuckle, and some where I just wasn't amused. The obvious parallel to Justin Beiber's career is great, as I despise Beiber and everything about him. The absurdly obnoxious narcissism of Connor is for the most part, the best aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>Spoilers below this point<br/><br/>The parody of TMZ had me laughing fairly hard, one of the better jokes in this movie. However some of the songs, particularly the ""Im Not Gay"" and ""Bin Laden"" songs were not spectacularly funny.<br/><br/>Overall, not a movie you watch for brilliant comedy or artistic value as a parody of pop culture, but a movie you can enjoy and appreciate for its funnier moments"

All they do is talk too much crap and nothing more, I like the songs but without liking the movie, it would be the worst experience for me to waste time looking at it. <br/><br/>Why did they have to make Samberg look like a Justin Bieber type, that look doesn't suit him... He's just better to act as himself when he was on SNL ages ago.

","We got lucky to see the advanced screening of Popstar. It is a very straightforward and predictable story. But that is intentionally so, taking a dig at the pop movies. It parodies every aspect of pop media, the TMZ, the paparazzi, the entourage, the egos, the commercialization etc.<br/><br/>The cleverness and comedy is not in the story. It is in the telling of it. It is what happens along the way. It is one of the funniest movies you'll see the whole year. The acting by the Lonely Island group is spot on with their comedic timing. The whole ""The Office"" themed documentary style also bodes well with the theme. And at last the music. The whole idea behind the movie, according to Andy Samberg, was to 'showcase the music they created, so they made a movie around it'. Now I won't go as far as to say that the music will win Emmy's but it sure was catchy and funny! It is a one time watch movies that will not disappoint."
"kaptenvideo-89875","5","3","7","9 December 2016"," 10 minute sketch stretched to 80 minutes... but I enjoyed it
","Considering how much I like the comedian Andy Samberg, it's kind of surprising that I've mostly seen him in smaller trivial movie roles and ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"", but not ""SNL"" which is his main body of work on screen.<br/><br/>So the catching up may begin with ""Popstar"" which gives him a big movie role. In a rather little known and commercially flopped movie but still! <br/><br/>Co-written with ""SNL"" buddies Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Tacco, all three forming a rapping boy band. The most successful one goes solo later and this is mostly his story about going places, then falling down and rediscovering the charms of having your true buddies with you, always. <br/><br/>The result is mockumentary-style modern music business fable, hitting on all the main clichés and having a surprising amount of real life stars cameoing, mostly as themselves commenting on the main character's career. More on that later.<br/><br/>Like many projects by famous American screen comedians, ""Popstar"" has some good ideas and ambition but doesn't really reach out to any refreshing new ground, relying mostly on the charms of the cast and their ability to improvise. <br/><br/>They try quite hard and steadily, to lampoon the American new pop music industry – where mediocrity rules and promotion is way more important than the product – but end up mostly imitating or rehashing the stuff they are supposed to laugh at. <br/><br/>So if you like Samberg, you will be at least somewhat amused by the result; if you don't know or care about him you can quite safely miss this movie.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow is credited as one of the producers. His ""extended family"" has actually produced similar lampooning comedies in the first half of 2000's. Some of them are actually good and still watch-worthy: ""Anchorman"" (about 1970's TV news business) ""Walk Hard"" (about music business) and ""Talladega Nights"" (about NASCAR racing). So if you don't dislike Will Ferrell or John C. Reilly or Apatow school of modern rude but sweet comedy, you should check them out. <br/><br/>Just to let you know: ""Popstar"" really has amazing amout of real life stars in small roles, playing themselves mostly. <br/><br/>Including Questlove, Carrie Underwood, NAS, Usher, 50 Cent, Ringo Starr of The Beatles, Simon Cowell, Adam Levine (Maroon 5), Akon, Mariah Carey (insisting she's the most humble person she knows), Pink, radio host Big Boy, DJ Khaled, A$AP Rocky, RZA, T.I., Pharell Williams, Seal, Snoop Dogg, Weird Al Yankovic, Michael Bolton, The Roots, Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, Danger Mouse, Jimmy Fallon, Arcade Fire. Also popping in are some cool comedy people like Sarah Silverman, Will Arnett, and Bill Hader.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a good 10-minute sketch stretched to over 80 minutes... but I still quite enjoyed it. Go, Samberg!"
"WriterKay","10","5","15","7 June 2016"," Deeper Thoughts
","Many viewers believe that this movie is rather stupid; however, I believe it is quite the opposite. On an intellectual level the movie takes many celebrity stereotypes and impresses them on one person. Using humor the movie sheds a light on how trivial this idea of a popstar really is. With the character of Conner we see hints of stars like Justin Bieber (a kid that grew up in the business and having issues with handling adult situations) and Justin Timberlake (a once boy band front man turned huge solo act). The movie also messes with the idea of the over popularized love for boy bands and comebacks. Much like the Backstreet Boys, the Style Boyz had been a band for years. People in the movie grew up listening to them and worshiping them so when they broke up it was heartbreaking in return when they got back together it was an long awaited and emotional experience for the world inside the movie. At the same time with songs like ""Finest Girl"" and ""Equal Rights"" the movie not only shows how much freedom we give to famous people solely based on their celebrity status but also how much we as a society care about current and past events. For some this movie may just seem like a big joke and never give it a second thought but beneath the surface this movie is more than a mockumentary."

","Popstar may be a bit overstuffed at times, but it is able to remain consistently entertaining throughout and at times quite funny. Andy Samberg leads a brilliantly over-the-top performance as Conner-4-real and truly carries the film on its comedic level. Tim Meadows and Sarah Silverman also provide some great supporting performances, as well as Joan Cusack as Conner's mom. The film can be a bit formulaic at times, as previous tropes are poked fun at, as they have been before, and at times the film can seem to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for some original moments (besides the songs). The film can be quite funny at times, with some lovely and clever satire, as well as some truly stupid, but fun moments and hilarious cameos. In the end, Popstar is not a total success, but it is able to carry itself more often than not, and prove to be a showcase of talent from all involved- especially The Lonely Island themselves.

"eminkl","7","0","0","18 April 2020"," a-ok for a light genre comedy
","Andy Samberg owns the spotlight, playing a Bieber-esque swooner who abandoned his old bandmates, springboarding their early group fame into solo superstardom. Samberg is right on the money as the essentially deluded wunderkind, set adrift without a life jacket when his sophomore album is met with universal disdain. His elaborate stage performances are a big highlight, spinning the band's notoriously loony lyrics (the ""Bin Laden Song"" production must be seen) into a heavily-funded, bombastic concert experience that's pitch-perfect. Lampooning the inherent idolatry of pop music is like shooting fish in a barrel, so it's intrinsically shallow fun, but the laughs are pretty consistent. I didn't sense very much bite in the original music - most of the lyrics are scattershot and random, which is mildly disappointing - but the beats are still great and there's a hidden gem or two in the deep cuts. ""Legalize It,"" which plays over the closing credits, was my favorite of the bunch, as berserk and ridiculous as TLI's best. Stuffed with celebrity cameos to lend credence and unpredictability, not to mention effortlessly hilarious, it won't surprise you or strum your heartstrings. Which is a-ok for a light genre comedy.

","Review:
'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' is an American mockumentary-comedy film directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. I can't even count how many times I have watched this movie and it never gets old. I watch it for reasons any normal person would watch a movie, entertainment alone. However, I watched it more closely this time around because I wanted to give an impartial review, based on the movie's criteria and not what my own personal sense of humor is.
The film follows a solo music artist by the name of Conner4Real (Andy Samberg) as he falls from fame and reconnects with his childhood friends.
This movie was so smart taking the documentary route, because the three guys from ""The Lonely Island"" are not the best actors in the world. Taking this approach, they didn't need to be - it felt like a crew was just following these people around and weird shit was happening. They have so many cameos in this movie too. I'm not going to say who because some of the people they got is so surprising, again almost all the cameos are playing themselves and can't really act, so this format works on all aspects.
Everything in this movie is to the moon and it's fantastic. The soundtrack is incredible and funny. They got so many guest artists to feature in this soundtrack, such as Akon, P!nk, Emma Stone and Linkin' Park to name a few! It's something that is going to be offensive to some, if you take it the wrong way. You really need to go into this knowing who ""The Lonely Island"" are and what type of comedy they possess versus what their views are in real life. They look at comedy as making fun of political views, so when we watch the music video for ""Equal Rights"" and Conner is being very offensive in the video starting throughout that he is ""not gay"", it's Andy Samberg making fun of 'Toxic Masculinity'.
Overall, if you're a fan of ""The Lonely Island"" you should check this one out, because they all wear their hearts on their sleeves in this movie and you can tell they cared about that outcome. You might not be able to see where I am coming from because this is such a raunchy and eccentric film. That just means you don't know Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer's comedy and might just want to stay away from one.

","After Hot Rod, The Lonely Island team of Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone tackled the world of pop music yet bombed bigger than the movie's hero, Conner4Real making only $9 million back from a $20 million dollar budget.<br/><br/>I have no idea why. This is the kind of movie that rewards multiple viewings, sticking to the maxim that makes so many 80's comedies work. Come up with a simple plot and let hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>Once, Conner4Real (Samberg) was in The Style Boyz with his childhood friends Lawrence and Owen (Schaffer and Taccone), but his success made him a spinoff act. Now, Owen is his DJ, forced to wear a giant head that plays the sound from the Tom Cruise era War of the Worlds, while Lawrence hides at his farm.<br/><br/>The joy of this film is how it juxtaposes real life artists - Mariah Carey, the Rza, even Arcade Fire - with the unreal world that Conner lives in. He employs thirty people, including a man who punches him in the privates so that he remembers where he came from.<br/><br/>But the second album just can't live up to his debut - Thriller, Also - even when his sponsor, Aquaspin, plays them in all of their appliances. Soon, his tour is joined by a new opening act - Saturday Night Live's Chris Redd as Hunter the Hungry - and their friendship quickly sours.<br/><br/>There's a really deep joke in the midst of all this silliness. After saving Conner and his fiancee from wolves - don't ask - the singer Seal claims that wolves caused his scars. In real life, they came from lupus, but seeing as how the scientific name for wolves is canis lupus, that's a pretty far way to go for a throwaway laugh.<br/><br/>If you don't like movies that get completely stupid, there's nothing I can do to convince you to watch this. But for those that just like being entertained, this one does it every time."

","Amusing mockumentary in the vein of Spinal Tap. Andy Sandberg stars as vapid pop star Conner, who came to popularity through a hip-hop group he founded with his two best friends (the other two members of Lonely Island and the directors of the film, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone) but who has recently gone solo. Taccone has stayed on as his DJ, but he mostly just plays music through his iPod at concerts. Schaffer was infuriated with Conner's behavior and has gone rustic and become a farmer. The film is very silly and a lot of fun, with plenty of great gags, hilarious songs, and entertaining cameos. I do think it runs out of steam as it nears the end - it has to wrap up the plot and becomes semi-serious, and it kind of harms the momentum. I must beg AMPAS to recognize ""I'm So Humble"" and/or ""Equal Rights"" for Best Original Song next year."

","This is a silly gut-busting delight, the kind of movie that I'd see with my dad if I saw more movies with him - it's basically what I'd call ""Son of Spinal Tap"" and like when you got the ""Son of"" movies of old (Song of Kong, Son of Frankenstein, whatever) it's not up to par with that, but then that's among the funniest comedies of all time. The ""Lonely Island"" team may take on some targets who are almost so obscenely ridiculous in real life - ie Justin Bieber's comments after leaving the Anne Frank house - but they have an excellent instinct for taking on these targets in the pop music world of today, which is just about unlistenable in many respects, and throwing on the silliness and vulgarity but the vulgarity works because it's from a place that's not really mean.<br/><br/>The main character of Samberg's, ""Connor 4-Real"", is one of those lovable self-obsessed idiots of the movies who works because he is so unaware of how dickish he acts to people around him. There are times where the improv approach as it's an Apatow production by the way goes on a bit too long, mostly in the second half of the movie (the first half fires on all cylinders and largely in part due to the songs and music videos with themes like ""I'm so Humble"" and f***ing a woman as if it was killing Bin Laden!) But on the whole I found a lot of really sharp actors around Samberg - Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, Justin Timberlake, and many other 'real' people (and a helluva running cameo from Will Arnett, the highlight of the movie for me as a ""CMZ"" chief editor ala TMZ) - that makes it consistently funny.<br/><br/>And it's the kind of dopey modern satire I like if it has to be done this way at a big studio level: keep the gags and jokes coming, even if they involve penises (and this movie has one of the better ones), and if there's a gag that falls flat there's one in a minute that will keep the pace back up, whether it has to do with ""10 seconds to Mars"" (it's a band, not a fact) or unexpected celebrities like Seal and the Rza. Call it a semi-guilty pleasure but I had a lot of laughs here, and more than some other SNL movies I can think of."

Blending all the major trends in the current music scenes, the screenplay by co-writers/(with Jorma Taccone)co-stars/co-directors Akiva Schaffer & Andy Samberg play a pitch-perfect parody of the times,from the hilariously vicious riffs on social media memes and gossip shows like TMZ, (here called CMZ) to the ""bad boy"" image Pop stars use to make themselves look edgy,and the deafening beats of EDM. Giving Conner chart-topping tunes,the writers spin super-catchy spoof tracks, ranging from pounding Hip-Hop,to very funny, R&B/Pop tracks on subjects that include Osama Bin Laden. Stealing all of Conner's Pop fame, Chris Redd gives a fantastic performance as rapper Hunter,with Redd giving his stage performances a rough, exciting atmosphere. Looking every inch the modern chart-topper, Andy Samberg gives a great performance as Conner,whose arrogance Samberg uses to keep him completely lacking in self-awareness as all those who worked with him quitting,over Conner believing he is a Popstar who will never stop stopping."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","1","2","25 February 2018"," Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping never really starts.
","This was always going to be divisive. A satirical look through the pop star telescope, where we have a fictional story filmed in the style of a documentary. Whether you view it as just a film or a slight dig at pop stars and bands like Justin Bieber or One Direction, it's undeniably entertaining. However, it's just that. It never really dives from the glossy surface to the depths of intelligence. A band entitled ""Style Boyz"" started off with a successful career, until the lead singer is thrown into the limelight and commences a solo career. We follow him on his new album release and tour and get an insight to the lavish lifestyle and pressure of a pop star. The key ingredient to this film is the inclusion of comedic band 'The Lonely Island'. Love them, hate them, don't care about them...but you cannot deny that their hilarious song writing is crazily infectious. I mean, I remember when they created a song called ""Jack Sparrow"" with Michael Bolton (who I'm glad is in this as well), and I still sing it to this day. In fact, I'm going to put it on right now. We've got songs about equal rights, terrorism and a great closing track. Clearly assimilating the current craze of having politically themed songs that aren't necessarily explicit. Throughly enjoyed the songs though. ""Keira Knightleyyy""! Performances were fine, with real cameos of musicians and media moguls embedded in the documentarian narrative. That's all well and good, the problem is...I didn't laugh. I smiled at a scene involving a swarm of bees, that's about it. For something that is supposed to be ""insanely funny"", I was rather underwhelmed. Clever but not hilarious. I also found the main plot to be ludicrously formulaic, which is a shame for a rather fresh idea. As soon as the pace kicked in, the film ended. Over far too soon. I can categorically say this was underwhelming, considering the mass adoration for this. However, it is enjoyable and would watch it again. Next time, have more Michael Bolton, he wins at life."

","The film is an honest attempt to make mockumentary and stuff it with as many clichés and nudges as possible about the entertainment world. <br/><br/>Several guest stars playing themselves did help a bit to create the atmosphere.<br/><br/>It leads us through patches in the career of a pop rap musician in his plight for a place in the spotlight after he had fall out with his boy band members. Think of Robbie Williams going solo or something like that but without heavy drugs or drinking. Mine favourite is from Mariah Carrey, who probably _is_ the most humble person she knows : ) <br/><br/>The plot is quite predictable from the start, there were some nice twists though. The most of the songs are really politically incorrect, (even reminded a bit of Borat franchise). The last song is actually a hoot, no pun intended : ) ..<br/><br/>Final thought: <br/><br/>If you into this kind of films the documentary about Heath Ledger if definitely worth watching."

When it comes to Andy Samberg I find his music very funny, but his comedy styling and acting are not so much to my taste. So I was pleasantly surprised to find myself having a very good time with this film. Right from the start it was genuinely funny and the music was catchy and hilarious in only the style that 'The Lonely Island' can achieve.<br/><br/>There are an enormous amount of celebrity cameos, all of which are cleverly done and seem like the person really bought into it. The story, while a playoff of Justin Bieber obviously, is actually really investing and well structured.<br/><br/>When it comes to comedy I find it's almost always a case of simply asking yourself, how funny was it? In the case of 'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' though it feels like there were more layers to it than that. You can appreciate the music, the story and the send up of Bieber. I don't think this did overly well at the box office (was it marketed very well? I never heard about it until well after it was released) which is a shame. I would recommend giving this one a look."

I did laugh twice as the writing was pretty slick in places and I'm not totally insulated.<br/><br/>Overall, POPSTAR is watchable. The film provides an accurate portrayal of the music business and its insane ways. The fact that the producers managed to convince a bunch of superstars to make cameo appearances, where they pretty much made fun of themselves, says a lot about this industry.<br/><br/>But lets not get too philosophical.

Plus the mockumentary style wasn't a good choice.<br/><br/>My favorite cameo is Justin Timberlake, whenever I see him act it is always well aware of his roots as a musician and he perfectly sells every scene he is in.<br/><br/>Watch with friends as you will have fun riffing of one another and enjoy the silly songs."

Although packed with cameos, it was a derivative and scripted. I do admit certain parts had me chuckling. The song parodies are still strong and a highlight of the movie, but the plot was easily discernible. I realize that heavy plot twists were not expected in an offering of this type, but a good story is still a good story and it lacked in this aspect.

This film is a straightforward parody (spoofing) of the commercialization & selling of a star to a wide-eyed gullible audience. From writing (and selling) dumb lyrics; a shallow persona; an attending entourage (Conner4Real - yes, that's our star's stage name) possesses amongst his 30+ personal attendants someone to watch over his pet turtle. Most ludicrous was his hook up with an appliance manufacturer, Aquaspin, to have his songs play when you open the dishwasher (etc.) door. Again spoofing how we buy into anything the ""worshipped"" attach their names to. The TMZ (called CMZ here), celebrity gossip scene spoofs were spot on. Finally, were all the film's 10 second celebrity guest spots giving commentary on our show star's sorry state of affairs as his career rises and falls and maybe rises again - watch and see. These guests spots included as follows: Underwood, NAS, 50 Cent, Ringo, Levine, Carey, RZA, Seal, Fallon, and more."

Sure, this movie uses a like of pop- culture references and celebrity cameos for most of it's humor. But c'mon the title of this movie is ""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"". I usually found the The Lonely Island crew to be pretty darn funny with there skits and music videos. So for a movie like this, they really brought all their talents to the table. The direction when it comes down to it, is actually quite predictable and has been done before when it comes to the three amigos having a conflict with each other with one being the middle man. But it's not the direction that makes a movie such as this, but it's the process and how the interactions and humor plays out. I give this movie a 8/10 because of it's clever humor. I would have given it a higher score if it still carried the momentum it had that lasted for about an hour, then it started to go downwards. If this movie is not that funny for some viewers, it's at least amusing. Lastly the soundtrack for this movie is tight with it's original track, well at least for a comedy.<br/><br/>8/10"
"rgkarim","8","5","25","4 June 2016"," Pop, Lock, and Jab At Hollywood. Popstar is Clever, but a Bit Over The Top
","You see them on E network. You read about them in the popular tabloids. The life of a star is on display for everyone in this world and we eat it up like pies in a fair contest. Heavy are the heads of those who wear the crowns of stardom and many will do anything to keep the light on them. This weekend, Samberg and his crew release a movie that attempts to poke fun at the silliness that is music artist drama. My review is on Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. Let's get started<br/><br/>The GOOD:  Clever presentation.  Lots of jabs at Hollywood trends  Lonely Island Songs Filling The Air<br/><br/>The first thing I loved about Popstar was it's clever presentation in the form of a documentary, or in this case a mockumentary. Popstar is a tale about Conner, a former pop sensation who is trying to go solo in an attempt to keep his fame high. To help promote the album, the arrogant, naïve boob hires a crew to capture his life on tape to portray to the masses (the audience). In this format, we didn't just get to see Conner's screw-ups, but observe the thoughts of those involved in his entourage. Various celebrity cameos riddle the interview scenes, making hilarious comments that show the fickleness of the Hollywood scene. This dual approach kept things interesting, and provide a variety of comedy styles that shows some people still have originality. <br/><br/>Popstar's plot also allows for opportunities to jab at Hollywood stars, who enjoy a few too many benefits due to their status. I can't tell you how many times I smiled when they threw a celebrity under the bus, or parodied an incident that some dopey star has done in the past. You know that what is being done is stupid, and Samberg's overacted antics only make it more ridiculous. But it's satisfying to hear someone bash a celebrity for acting so juvenile. While I can't say they hit everyone, Samberg and company cast a wide net to cover a lot of musical entertainment follies while also extending into the obsessions of the general public. Yesyou the audience also get to be jibed as they emphasize just how absurd fans can be about everything and hurtful they can be thanks to the Internet. And what better to way to poke fun then a Lonely Island musical number in all itsinteresting qualities. The vulgarity and aggressive nature of their songs remains just as colorful as their albums. <br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/> Offensiveness  Banter gets old  Overacted at parts<br/><br/>Despite how much fun the movie is though, someone is sure to take offense to some of this movie's more assertive jokes. The opening number about Not Being Gay is sure to rile up some community's twitter account that will black ball Samberg. I agree that there are some moments that cross the line, but audience members need to put their big people pants on and realize most of this is a joke, or don't see the film. Still Samberg and his crew need to watch where they travel to in terms of their comedy, especially when it further stains the image of America to foreign countries. <br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, the comedy is very diverse and spans a number of styles that keep it fresh. One of those happens to be the banter routine, where Conner and some poor schmuck get caught in a rousing game of idiot tennis. Much like the T.V. shows that plague cable these days, Popstar has plenty of these moments, where the characters go round and round on an issue. Some of these arguments are pretty good, especially with the writing. However, there are other times where these banters are annoying, or a bit too stupid to be enjoyable, (which happened around the third or fourth time), as they rant on and on (much like this review). This was especially true in the TMZ parodies, which was a farce that needed to be two minutes and dropped like a scalding cup of coffee.<br/><br/>And much like the banter, sometimes the acting itself goes too far into the overacting territory. One certainly sees the SNL roots at times, particularly in Samberg's moments of overemotional whining or screaming. Some may like this silly style of acting, but when it is drawn outwell that's when I lose interest. Even the supporting actors trail in this territory, but fortunately the writing bails them out and we move on with the film. There are even a few stunts that didn't fit well into the movie, depriving the more emotional parts by hamming it up with a cheesy interlude. Fortunately, much of these weaker parts are short-lived and the low running time only further helps. <br/><br/>The VERDICT<br/><br/>I was pleased with this movie and for the most part found it entertaining compared to half the comedic crap that comes out of the woodwork. Popstar's creative presentation and diverse comedy style will surely bring a little something for everyone. Sure there are moments that things get out of hand, and there are lots of moments I wish were cut out or edited down to say the least (especially more mature male organ parts). However, Popstar indeed stands out and certainly deserves a chance for those wanting a laugh. Worth a trip to the theater? Heck no, it lacks pretty much everything I praise for a movie. But I encourage a rental when you get the chance. <br/><br/>My Scores:<br/><br/>Comedy/Music: 8.0<br/><br/>Movie Overall: 6.0"
"bankofmarquis","7","3","13","7 June 2016"," Pretty silly and fun
","The scene in the new comedy POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING that made me laugh the most was when the out of touch POPSTAR played by Andy Samberg autographs a penis. If this set up sounds like something you might get a chuckle out of, keep reading. If not, you may go back to whatever else you were doing.<br/><br/>Okay...that should have gotten rid of the contingent that this is movie is NOT for. For the rest of you degenerates, I would highly recommend POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING as a laugh out load jokefest that skewers just about everything in modern POPSTAR-ism.<br/><br/>Andy Samberg stars as white rapper Superstar Connor who is living off the enormous popularity of his first solo album. When his 2nd album tanks, Connor tries everything in his power to stay on top. And those things are pretty silly, crude, funny, grotesque, inappropriate, foul...you get the point. If that type of humor appeals to you (and it does to me), then you'll enjoy this.<br/><br/>Samberg co-wrote this film with his THE LONELY ISLAND compatriots Jorma Taccone (who co-stars) and Akiva Schaffer (who co-stars and directs). These 3 grew up on Saturday Night Live and this film has the feel of a variety of sketches tied together, fairly successfully, into a film. Samberg brings the right amount of cluelessness, selfishness and charm to the role of Connor which gives us a character that we can root for and against. He is ably assisted by co-stars Schaffer and Taccone as well as a litany of comedy and musical guest stars - mostly in cameos. The likes of Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader, Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Joan Cusack, Will Arnett and Kevin Nealon all join in on the fun as well as musical stalwarts Carrie Underwood, Usher, 50 Cent, Ringo Starr, Adam Levine and Mariah Carey, to name just a few. They all come on the screen with great energy and play along just right.<br/><br/>Is it a ""classic"" comedy? Well...no. But it's a pretty good one that gave me enough laughs - including the penis joke belly laugh - that enables me to strongly recommend this film. If you're looking for a 90 minute escape, then you will be well rewarded by POPSTAR, it's well worth seeing.<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","You have to go into this movie knowing it's satire. There are so many reviews interpreting this as a serious movie, and it is not. Basically, this is a ""mockumentary"" sort of movie about the fictional character Connor and his solo act ""Connor4Real"". The mockumentary format can be a bit offputting to some, so keep that in mind. I got used to it pretty fast, though. Most of the jokes were met with that slight ""heh"" and exhale you do when something is funny, but not funny enough to warrant an actual laugh at. There were a few scenes where everyone in the theater lost it, though. <br/><br/>This plays out like a long SNL/Lonely Island sketch, and for some people that is good, and others it is bad. If you enjoy the Lonely Island's previous work, you'll most likely enjoy this. Check out their official Youtube channel; they've posted some clips from the movie if you want to see the kind of comedy in it.<br/><br/>If you have some time to spare, go see this movie. If you have to make time to see it, I would wait until it is released on DVD or streaming. My reaction to it is an ""Eh, it was good""."

"Floated2","8","1","3","4 November 2017"," Comedy for acquired taste
","Popstar Never Stop Popping appeared to be a parody of many artists and popstars mockumentary style concert type films in music. This film shows a very realistic view point of how artists go through fame and shows the ups and downs of the music industry. The budget as relatively low but they made the film very much watchable and unique with all the cameos and extra stunts. One can tell they did their research and Adam Sanberg put a lot of effort into the making of the film. Having doubts of how exactly the film would, Never Stop Popping exceeded my expectations and was a lot better than expected. The film is quite short which works well in its favor as it does not overstay its welcome (meaning it doesn't drag on). The parodying of TMZ was another unique and funny aspect of the film. This film flopped which is a shame but nonetheless not surprising. Recommended for those who enjoy Lonely Island or are seeking a concert type comedy. As a rewatch 08/05/18' Popstar feels better and moves more smoothly on a second watch. Highly recommend as this film is quite overlooked but then again is for an acquired taste in comedy and music of sorts. Enjoy and don't take the film too serious."

I didn't like That's My Boy, or Hot Rod, and the only film I liked him in was I Love You, Man where he played a small but memorable role. <br/><br/>Jorma Taccone plays Owen, Conner4Real's best friend and one third of Styleboyz which is their boy band. The other third is Lawrence the last of the Lonely Island, Akiva Schaffer. Owen is the friend that never left, where Lawrence plays the one who left. This adds a bit of conflict for a film that really is just a conglomerate of music videos.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that I had already seen many of the funny moments on YouTube. I know a majority of movie-goers don't follow the Lonely Island and it shows in the box-office. I counted three times the film made me laugh, but I imagine if I had not seen the publicity and went in blind I might have laughed more.<br/><br/>Verdict: I can't say don't see the film. It is going to offend an older audience, 100%. It's funny, and that's what a comedy is supposed to do. For that I recommend watching it."

","""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" is wonderful musical mockumentary from the Lonely Island boys (Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer). Rather than string a few of their film clips with a tenuous plot, they've created an original movie, with original songs.<br/><br/>Gleefully aping Justin Bieber's ""Never Say Never"", Samberg plays pop-rapper Conner4Real, a former member of boy band The Style Boyz with childhood friends Owen (Taccone) and Lawrence (Schaffer). Conner4Real become a solo superstar and a tabloid darling, his excessive ego and bravado makes Oasis in the nineties look restrained. The film charts the release of Conner's second album Connquest, some questionable appliance-based marketing choices, his friendship-turned rivalry with rapper Hunter the Hungry (Chris Redd) and eventual fall from superstardom. <br/><br/>As well as SNL alumni Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph, ""Popstar"" has an impressive list of guest stars, most who've collaborated with Lonely Island, including:<br/><br/>Akon, ASAP Rocky, Michael Bolton, Mariah Carey, Régine Chassagne, Simon Cowell, Danger Mouse, DJ Khaled, Jimmy Fallon, 50 Cent, Adam Levine, Nas, Pink, Questlove, The Roots, RZA, Seal, Martin Sheen, Snoop Dogg, Ringo Starr, T.I., Carrie Underwood, Usher and Pharrell Williams. <br/><br/>The best cameo is from the always-game Justin Timberlake, playing Connor4Real's put upon tour chef.<br/><br/>Samberg - of course - dominates this movie, with Taccone and Schaffer pulling double duty as directors and playing Conner's bandmates.<br/><br/>""Popstar"" deserves its MA rating, with a number of delightfully filthy songs, including ""Finest Girl"", which uses Osama Bin Laden's death as a sexual metaphor. The soundtrack is a must buy/download for Lonely Island fans.<br/><br/>As a mockumentary, ""Popstar"" won't have the wide appeal - or legacy - of Spinal Tap, but it's still a heap of fun, especially if you love Lonely Island's music."

","'POP STAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A pop music spoof, starring Andy Samberg. Samberg plays a former boy band member, that will try anything to remain popular. The film was directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone (who also costar in the movie), and it was written by Samberg, Schaffer and Taccone (the three also worked together on'Saturday NIGHT LIVE'). The movie also costars Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, Chris Redd and Imogen Poots. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, but it still bombed at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it. <br/><br/>Conner4Real (Samberg) is a world-famous pop-rap recording artist. He used to be a member of the popular boy band The Style Boyz, and the group had a horrible falling-out. Most of Conner's fans really want the band to get back together though. When Conner's second solo album bombs, Conner becomes desperate to regain his popularity. He refuses to make amends with his old group though. <br/><br/>The film plays out like a spoof of Justin Bieber documentaries (or similar movies). I've never seen any of those films, so I can't give a comparison, but I think this movie is hilarious (mostly). It's definitely more hit, than miss. Conner4Real is too unlikable a character though, so I didn't really want him to succeed. Even so, Samberg is great in the role; and the ending is pretty satisfying (to me). So I mostly liked the film, because it is really funny.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/BdhMQkH1n2k"

","Fans of Andy Samberg's film Hot Rod have waited a long time to see something that matched the humor and feel of that classic comedy. The Lonely Island has brought its unique brand of comedy to the small screen with SNL skits, and Popstar is a classic return to the big screen. While bizarre and goofy, it was filled with funny moments, especially to those who have seen all the music videos of The Lonely Island. With many references to previous skits, it will be enjoyable for fans of the show, but I could see how those unfamiliar with The Lonely Island will find the movie somewhat dumb and lacking in humor. I found Popstar fairly funny throughout, with a few laugh out loud moments. I will admit the story line was stretched and ridiculous, but it was never meant to be taken too seriously to begin with. I would probably see this again, and would recommend it to those who are familiar with Andy Samberg and Company's previous works."

","I had frankly high expectations when going in to this, all of which were brutally shattered by 30 minutes as I suddenly realised its everything I hate about film. I generally speaking don't mesh well with American Comedy avoiding most films and finding the likes of 'Friends' barely tolerable there's been some sort of appeal to Samberg as both character and actor for a while from me and his work on a Brooklyn Nine-Nine is impressive but here his form was all off. I've got a good knowledge of the lonely island and find their work fun but something does not hit well at all here. Connor the lead of the 'documentary' is intolerable and for as much as this was intended tonal there's genuinely no charm in the character whatsoever. The others have roles that weren't worth naming and frankly are interchanged as the plot decides. The form aspect is poor, a 'mockumentary' there's so much potential when approaching such a type of film see the lines of 'What we Do in the Shadows' with the genre classic being 'Spinal Tap' there's evidence of what can be achieved in this world but all is missed here. In the case of 'Popstar' which it'll be called for convenience sake there's more focus on just celebrity cameos opposed to substance with all the Talking Heads being a who's who? Of modern fame featuring but not limited too: A$AP Rocky, Usher, Akon and later stock footage of the likes of Rita Ora and one more major appearance from Snoop Dogg. This absolute scatter of fame is presumably there for drinking game purposes and serves no real weight to the characters at all with only Justin Timberlake and Usher actually appearing outside of the Talking Heads segments. The 'Style Boyz' funnily enough appear to have no chemistry what so ever and such the payoff of the grand return misses the mark completely and the music is enough to make ears bleed, which sure is again intentional but even so just stop and also in hindsight how they got away with certain songs is amazing as they certainly didn't sit well with me personally. The splitting of the characters was contrived and the return was also plus the 'comedy' in between was worthless and had zero laughs from me. In what seems to be just a million cameos and various cultural references (Such as Kanye West attacking a videoing journalist) it's more of a 'look it's Celebrity X' and 'oh I remember that' opposed to anything that has real substance as a film and such is just a waste of time that passed by so painfully slow, if you can avoid it."

Samberg's character has little depth, so his fall from grace feels less like the tragedy of hubris and more like a jerk getting his comeuppance, which means you never really care about the story. It's a very jokey, superficial film, so when it's funny you enjoy it but every time the humor weakens you think, why was I watching this again.<br/><br/>While not as funny as Samberg's series, Brooklyn Nine-nine, it's definitely fun."
"brando647","7","0","2","11 September 2017"," It's Good for a Few Laughs but POPSTAR Hasn't Got a Lot of Substance
","It was only a matter of time before the Lonely Island guys came out with a music mockumentary; I just expected it to be about Lonely Island. Nope. Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer instead bring us into the world of fictional international pop icon Conner4real (Samberg). The movie is constructed as a behind-the-scenes/concert film for Conner as he prepares to release the follow-up album to his massive hit solo debut. Conner was originally a member of boy band/hip-hop trio the Style Boyz but broke off on his own when his ego became too much to handle for the trio's writer, Lawrence (Schaffer). Now Conner tours the world with the band's third member, Owen (Taccone), as his DJ while Lawrence has retired to a quiet life of farming and subpar wood carving. Conner's second album debuts with such controversial hits as ""Equal Rights"" and ""Bin Laden"" and becomes an instant flop. Unable to cope with failure and surrounded by useless sycophants, Conner life begins a downward spiral and Owen believes a Style Boyz reunion would be the best thing for everyone. Unfortunately, Conner and Lawrence didn't exactly part on the best of terms and getting the two of them in a room to talk, much less reunite for a performance, is going to be near impossible. POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING is an improv- laden mockumentary in the same vein of THIS IS SPINAL TAP but never achieves its level of awesomeness, but it has got its share of laughs.<br/><br/>I enjoyed POPSTAR for what it is but watching it has made me realize how much I miss normal scripted comedies. Improv films can be real hit-or-miss and this one is no different, but I'd say the scales tip in favor of the funnier bits. There aren't a whole lot of hilarious moments that'll be with you too long after the movie is over, but you're bound to get some chuckles from it if this is your type of comedy. Personally, my favorite gag comes about halfway through the movie when Conner's manager Harry (Tim Meadows, excellent as usual) is breaking some bad news to the singer over some breakfast mimosas and Conner has a rough moment, asking the documentarians to kill the cameras for a minute. The video cuts out but we keep the audio as their tender conversation quickly turns when a wandering bee becomes a nuisance and quickly escalates to a battle of life and death. That was probably the one time the movie got a solid laugh from me. The rest is a bit of a mixed bag but fans of Samberg and the Lonely Island material from ""Saturday Night Live"" shouldn't be disappointed. There are plenty of new songs created for the movie and Conner4real and some of them are pretty good, but there's nothing on the level of ""J*zz in My Pants"", ""I'm on a Boat"", or ""Motherlover"". This is why I was hoping it'd be a mockumentary about Lonely Island: great music catalog.<br/><br/>Since it's a ""documentary"", it's filled with cameos from music artists who've got a sense of humor and contributed interview snippets including RZA, Mariah Carey, and Ringo Starr. You can also expect the usual cavalcade of comedic talent filling out the rest of the case, such as the aforementioned Tim Meadows as Conner's manager and Sarah Silverman as his press agent. There is plenty of talent on display here; Samberg and company pulled out all the stops to surround him with high quality cast-mates. So even if the comedy isn't your style, you can spend the duration of the movie tracking the endless stream of cameos. Otherwise, it's exactly what you would expect for a Lonely Island mockumentary. If that's your thing, you'll probably find a reason to watch and I'm sure you'll enjoy it fine. If not, this movie isn't likely going to win you over. POPSTAR is what it is and to me it's a fun piece of throwaway entertainment that might've aspired to SPINAL TAP levels and fell short. The Apatow style of improv that's permeated comedies in the last ten years is good for a quick laugh but most of the movies of this sort are quickly forgotten and I'm sure POPSTAR, as amusing as it can be, will probably fall into that category."

It's on HBO right now, so prepare yourself for multiple viewings & enjoy some of the best lyrics you will hear from any actor, possibly most rappers.

"SquigglyCrunch","7","0","1","13 April 2017"," A Solid Coming-of-Age Story Disguised as a Satire
","Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a parody of the modern music industry, and it follows a young pop star, Conner4Real, as he reaches fame and suddenly begins to plummet. <br/><br/>For starters, Andy Samberg is really good as Conner4Real. He captures the self-centered obliviousness of the character without making him feel too fake or over-the-top. He's a super fun character, and it's clear that Samberg is enjoying him too. Jorma Taccone stands out as a particularly good performance as well, as the sidekick friend character who kind of awkwardly lives in the background. <br/><br/>The comedic aspect is great. The main source of this is in the songs that Conner4Real performs. They're all great. They sound generic, but the lyrics both fit the character who wrote them and prove to be hilariously offensive. And even the comedy outside of that is great. Again, Samberg really has a good time with this one, and the writing for him proves to be just the same. <br/><br/>And yet, despite the comedic and satirical aspect of the film, it is still at least partially a coming-of-age story. Samberg's character really isn't that unbelievable, and when he starts to fall it takes on a more serious tone. It's not a weird sudden tonal change because the movie is both serious and comedic all the way through, it just gets more serious towards the end. In some ways it is kind of generic as far as coming-of-age stories go, but the characters are solid enough to carry it, so it wasn't a problem. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. It's a solid comedy and an equally good coming-of-age story. In the end I would definitely recommend this one."

","This movie never elevates beyond comedy (and slight satire), but it's really good at what it is. It's a funny movie. It's just a well crafted comedy.<br/><br/>While the characters are all caricatured, they're still rooted in some sort of reality. They're dumb, but they're not Zoolander-dumb, they're not like characters from a kids movie. The conflict is actually quite believable, and it's never taken too far. The same goes for the reconciliation. It's easy to believe in. The most silly part of the movie is probably the songs, but they mostly work within the universe that's established.<br/><br/>What I like the most, though, is how this movie tries to deliver solid jokes that stands on their own legs. It doesn't succumb to non-sequitors, sudden nostalgic references or slapstic. All of these forms of comedy has their use and place, but they're often overused, and a method of getting cheap laughs. This movie stays clear of those, making it all the better.<br/><br/>The fun had by the people making this movie is also obvious, and you can't help but share the joy of it all.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","15 February 2017"," Works okay as a parody
","""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" is an American movie from last year in the English language. At slightly over 80 minutes, it is a relatively short film and it was made by Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. These three also play core characters in here, especially Golden Globe winner Samberg. It is a mix of comedy and music, but really mostly comedy as it makes me a bit sad that what we hear in here is considered music. At least it is just a spoof of what people consider pop music in the 21st century, which is equally depressing though. Anyway, this is the story of an ambitious singer who splits up with his band and tries to become famous on his own, so basically something that happened many times, but rarely worked out as well as it did for Justin Timberlake and Beyoncé for example. The former also has a brief cameo in here like many many others as well, people from the music industry like Usher, Ringo Starr or Mariah Carey who basically play themselves in here.<br/><br/>I think this SNL trio came up overall with an entertaining film here. The title already gives away that this is basically spoofing the careers of ""real"" musicians in the pop music industry these days and from this perspective, the outcome is acceptable. However, the consequence is as well that Samberg (and the rest) can go outrageously over the top and justify it all by being satire. I am not sure how much I like the idea, but it is certainly a smart one as this way they made sure we do not recognize Samberg's mediocre (actually almost non-existing) talent when it comes to serious acting. The film lives through funny scenes and comments and really all the spoof elements. Actress Imogen Poots has one of the best lines in her very brief appearance here. So yeah, expect smart writing, but not really good acting here. Poots is one of very few occasions of actually pretty talented performers. All in all, it's an okay little movie, but nothing really that should be on anybody's top of the year list. Thumbs up."

It felt like a total parody on inane, goofball stars like Justin Bieber, or Brittany Spears. For a while it seemed like he was channeling Bieber, one of the most ridiculous stars of our generation. <br/><br/>The movie's view of the pop universe is so comprehensive. In the hands of creators with less intimate knowledge of the music industry, Popstar would have been a Bieber-inspired spin on the emperor's new clothes, and indeed it seems like no coincidence that at one point Conner is literally disrobed in front of all his fans. But the message of Popstar isn't that pop stars are self- absorbed, out of touch, and lacking talent, it's that pop stars are self-absorbed, out of touch, and some are actually very talented. (Popstar reprises one of the more memorable images from Never Say Never when it shows Conner performing a drum solo as a baby.) When things go off the rails, it's when pop stars lack equally talented collaborators who will help them check themselves lest they wreck themselves. (It's not that the emperor has no clothes; it's that sometimes he needs someone to tell him that gold-encrusted onesie is a bad idea.)<br/><br/>This was a very, very entertaining movie. Kudos to the filmmakers, and the crew. Well done. Very well done."

","Andy Samberg owns this spotlight, playing a Bieber-esque swooner who abandoned his old bandmates, springboarding their early group fame into solo superstardom. Samberg is right on the money as the essentially deluded wunderkind, set adrift without a life jacket when his sophomore album is met with universal disdain. His elaborate stage performances are a big highlight, spinning the band's notoriously loony lyrics (the ""Bin Laden Song"" production must be seen)into a heavily-funded, bombastic concert experience that's pitch-perfect. Lampooning the inherent idolatry of pop music is like shooting fish in a barrel, so it's intrinsically shallow fun, but the laughs are pretty consistent. I didn't sense very much bite in the original music - most of the lyrics are scattershot and random, which is mildly disappointing - but the beats are still great and there's a hidden gem or two in the deep cuts. ""Legalize It,"" which plays over the closing credits, was my favorite of the bunch, as berserk and ridiculous as TLI's best. Stuffed with celebrity cameos to lend credence and unpredictability, not to mention effortlessly hilarious, it won't surprise you or strum your heartstrings. Which is a-OK for a light genre comedy.

Beyond the opposite of tone deaf writing and subject matter, the film delivers more Easter eggs than the famed Bunny. This may partially help explain why it was only lukewarmly received. There's so much insider baseball, somewhat obscure references, meaningful cameos and stuntcasting it may have just overwhelmed the 12 to 24 demo that largely came to see it. Also this reliance on such of-the-moment comedy fodder may mean the movie won't age or travel well. In short, best to see it soon before everyone forgets the Bieber / Anne Frank incident (remember that? well, Justin was...)."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" (2016) is kinda OK and not a bad attempt to mock some current days superstars (J.Bieber especially). It is a not bad comedy and ... nothing more. As the story itself you probably have seen many times in better movies then this, this one has many famous superstars cameos, some a bit extended. Music is lame, as it was targeted to be (but that is the kind of music that is unfortunately dominates today's TOPs.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" is a pretty OK flick for one evening with some friends and maybe some light alcohol involved. Don't' take it to seriously, its OK flick for seeing it once."
"Reno-Rangan","7","0","1","24 September 2016"," A fun film, but also very sensible.
","The title clearly says it is a parody of 'Justin Bieber: Never Say Never'. I haven't seen that, but this film was so fun. Just like another 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story'. If you like the combination of music and comedy, this is for you. I think the writing was the best thing, even the lyrics of the songs. The directors did their part very well, but in the end it was the actors who saved the film. Andy Samberg was splendid.<br/><br/>The film was narrated in a documentary style like a series of interviews which also includes behind scenes, I mean unedited clips like the live recording. It is the story of three members of a famous band in America. When everything was going well for them, the split happens unexpectedly. So the main singer decides to go solo and sees some success. But he struggles through his girlfriend and their marriage plans, and also he finds some issue with his manager. You know the makeover begins, how he comes back to his normal life was the remaining film.<br/><br/>It is not anybody's biography, but you should still watch it. The storytelling is not preoccupied with the drugs and sexes, though there are some amounts, which makes it is good viewing for the adults. Don't think it is some silly comedy, lots of things from it makes sense. You can enjoy the music and at a time you would have some laughs. Well balanced contents and overall it is a rare comedy.<br/><br/>7/10"

","""Ever since I was born, I was dope."" Conner (Samberg) was part of the biggest boy band in history. After the break up he decides to begin his solo career. After some success he is excited to release his new album. When it is released tomixed reviews.he tries everything he can to remain on top, but things don't go as he planned. This is a movie I had very low expectations for. I am not a big Andy Samberg fan and really only liked when he did the songs on SNL, that said I did laugh and liked this a lot more than I expected to. This is essentially a mock-umentary about a Justin Bieber type guy who is so disconnected from reality that it leads to hilarious outcomes. The songs in this are great, my favorite was the one about gay marriage. For someone that is not a fan of Samberg at all I have to admit I really enjoyed this and even though it started to drag and get repetitive this was still much better than I expected. Overall, somewhat of a fake documentary based on the guys that do the SNL songs, much better than I expected. I give this a B."
"Genti22","8","0","2","29 August 2016"," Funny all the way through.
","Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a musical mockumentary directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. The film stars Andy Samberg on the lead role as the popstar and co-stars Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Imogen Poots, Joan Cusack and Maya Rudolph. This movie is basically a satire of the celebrity life (Justin Bieber much ?) and the way that famous people react to falling from grace among other things. I personally really liked this film, it was incredibly funny all the way through and Andy Samberg does a fantastic job on the role here. He's actually really funny and we're once again reminded of his talent. The soundtrack is also unbelievably amazing, all the songs have a really catchy beat and funny lyrics that just replay on your head for a long time after hearing them. It does drag on for quite a bit unfortunately even though it is only 86 minutes it felt like much longer. Also the movie is filled with clichés but I guess that is not the point of the film because it was never trying to shy away from them or be something ground breaking. It is just a fun flick to watch when you have free time and I appreciate it for that."
"organicsocial","8","0","4","9 August 2016"," Spinal Tap Comparisons Are Inevitable But This Stands On Its Own
","Lonely Island was my introduction to Andy Samberg and his comedic prowess. He was a bright spot on SNL as well. I do feel that he is markedly underutilized in Brooklyn 99. That show itself is preposterous. Thankfully, there are movies like Popstar which give Samberg a chance to to do what he does best - act as if he is a genuine moron in a hilariously natural way. This movie is a work of satire that can't be overlooked. It is quite balanced in its critique of the music industry today. The mockumentary style and the fact that it focuses on mainstream music is obviously going to draw comparisons with 'This is Spinal Tap' but I would say cut it some slack. We all know how music has changed over time. What has remained consistent though, is the narcissism and un-hinged lifestyle of the stars. Sure, there are more things to buy now and the superstar man-child can just break more stuff when he's sad for the most stupid reasons but in essence it is all same old same old. On the sidenote, if you've to compare this movie then do it with Samberg's own - 7 days in hell. I think he is onto this mockumentary genre and is determined to perfect it. <br/><br/>Popstar has its heart in the right place when it comes to the message - true friendship and simplicity matters at the end. There are moments in it that are similar to the Spinal Tap, for example when the band hits a low or when Nigel and David bury the hatchet and start playing music again. There are a lot of funny dialogues and shenanigans. Serving dog poop pancakes to test honesty among 'friends' being one. However, it does not take us into the unfamiliar zone. It doesn't tell us anything about the so called gods of pop music that we don't already know. How many times have we heard that music business is tough? As the band manager succinctly adds ""The highs are high and lows are really low"". Probably, that's the real irony of media that it parodies itself (the TMZ bit) within a satire and doesn't come off as anything shocking. Maybe that's the point of Popstar in showing him a little too honest with his fans on his Snapchat or Instagram but the fans still going crazy over his lameness. Well, who am I to complain? I can probably watch it a couple of times with friends just for the laughs."
"nozplays","9","0","4","23 July 2016"," Great Movie With My Favourite Band
","I absolutely loved Popstar: Never Stop, Never Stopping. I loved how the got a really good message across, even if young people ,who require that message the most, can't see it. My favourite part is when the boys are in the car and (Spoiler Alert, Spoiler Alert) Conner's fans show him a butt with 'I Love Conner' written on it and when Conner is asked to sign a woman's breasts. Conner goes to sign the breasts and is greeted with a mans penis. I loved this movie because it blended music and humour really well. I would recommend watching 'Brooklyn Nine Nine,' 'Hot Rod' and listening to the Lonely Island if you watch this movie. I would also recommend that you are ready for huge amounts of swearing, laughs and of course, amazing music."
"trulstei","8","0","2","18 July 2016"," Amazing
","I'm not sure why the average score is at 6.9, because I enjoyed this movie a lot! Although some jokes were a little predictable because of the trailer I still thought this was over all an amazing ""mock- umentary"". Every song was catchy no matter how ridiculous the lyrics were, I understood surprisingly many references, such as DMZ (TMZ) and the Justin Timberlake and Michael Bolton nod backs to The Lonely Island's previous songs.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is pretty exaggerated I think there's still a lot of truth in it, like having fake friends, how the media is portrayed and how stupid the public can seem when they blame celebrities for things that was obviously not their fault (Seal getting bit by wolves).<br/><br/>Speaking of celebrities, I loved all the appearances, THERE WERE SO MANY! Usher, Emma Stone, Jimmy Fallon, 50 Cent, Ringo Starr, Simon Cowell and so, so many more, really impressive.<br/><br/>According to the IMDb page they made around 10 million dollars less than they had for their budget, which is a shame because of how great all these characters were and that I would really love seeing a sequel with even more of dope songs and see where these characters go next.<br/><br/>Lonely Island, never change <3"

","This film tells the story of a famous rapper group, and one of them, called Conner, goes solo. Conner achieves much success, but his career hits a series of lows when he releases his second solo album.<br/><br/>The fun thing about this film is that at times it runs like a mock documentary. A lot of famous stars are interviewed, all proclaiming how amazing Conner is. That itself is so funny! The events portrayed are just so funny! I'm particularly amused by Seal making fun of himself. The songs Conner sings are at times so bad that makes me laugh out loud. I enjoy all the famous cameos too. I really enjoyed watching it, because it's so entertaining."
"RforFilm","7","0","13","6 June 2016"," The Lonely Island get a funny movie out of Popstar: Never Stop Never Stoping, even if the joke runs out too soon
","The best movies about show business are usually done as mockumentaries. Somehow, the style feels more real when ironically, nothing about the characters are real themselves. A lot of it comes down that the people making the mockumentary probably understand the most about troubles and tribulation on what goes on behind the curtain. They know that the biggest stars are the craziest people around. They've figured out how unforgiving that show business world can be. They especially know how hard life can still be with the fame (or without it). Though there are plenty of regular feature films that have parodied the show business world fine enough, the mockumentary style somehow makes it look more unsentimental.<br/><br/>At the top of my head, the best movies about entertainment are A Hard Days Night This is Spinal Tap, and the lesser-known Waiting for Guffman. All three portray the world of show biz with some really funny characters (or in the case of the Beatles, exaggerated versions of themselves), and a relatable story on the hardship of trying to make it and how they manage to continue onward. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a modern day look at the music industry. <br/><br/>The mockumentary is a look at the fictional band Style Boys and their frontman Conner Friel (played by Andy Samberg). Conner is a musical prodigy and has always counted on his friends to support his dreams. After years of working together and making a mark on the charts, they break up when one of the members Lawrence (played by Akiva Schaffer) is not given credit for a song nor is even thanked when Conner wins an award for it. His other friend Owen (played by Jorma Taccone) stays on and moves into the background as Conner's DJ, while Conner reinvents himself as a Justin Bieber-like singer called ""Conner4Real"".<br/><br/>His first album Thriller, Also is a hit and advances him to massive stardom. His ego (and low intelligence) pushes him to make reckless choices and surrounds himself with yes-men who only encourage more bad ideas. His second album Connquest is met with critical bashing and a bad publicity stunt that causes massive blackouts (I can't tell why, it's too funny). He attempts to continue a world tour with opening act rapper Hunter the Hungry starting to gain more popularity then it's main star. The movie is filled with interviews from real life icons like Simon Cowell, User, Carrie Underwood, Seal, Pink, Arcade Fire, and even Ringo star.<br/><br/>When you really get down to it, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a film version of Andy Samberg's parody band Lonely Island. Though comedic, Lonely Island has generated real hits, real concerts, and has even been nominated for an academy award. Andy Samberg clearly understands the world he comes from, as he makes some sharp criticism about the music industry. All the songs featured here are very funny, catchy, and oddly sound like something that I would hear on the radio. <br/><br/>What Samberg also understands is how guys like him could make it in the world. Though obviously exaggerated, I can't help but think that some real life musicians are as naive as Conner is here. <br/><br/>As funny as the joke is, I'll admit that it does start to run out of steam sooner then it should. Though running short at an hour and twenty minutes, it still felt way longer then it should be. Perhaps if we saw some more fake musicians that Conner is up against, we might have seen some justification to go on longer. Though this will probably play well on the digital market, it barely makes it as a movie. <br/><br/>I'll give this seven Lonely Island albums out of ten. The joke is funny, even if it's not as substantial as it wants to be. Most music fans and those that have liked Andy Samberg will probably enjoy this parody. I'd say give the Lonely Island music a listen too first and them maybe check this movie out."
