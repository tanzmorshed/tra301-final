","A slow, rich movie. Though it lags in places, the three lead performances are indelibly written in my memory. And the great jazz soundtrack and warm colors made this movie go down like a glass of bourbon.<br/><br/>Embodying the archetypal difficult genius, Emmet Ray is an almost cartoonishly dislikable guy. But Sean Penn keeps him just this side of sympathetic; we loathe his actions, we curse his self-destructiveness, and yet we're compelled to keep watching in the increasingly futile hope he'll turn himself around. His last scenes are heartrending.<br/><br/>As Hattie, Samantha Morton strikes a perfect, almost Chaplinesque, balance of comedy and tragedy. The line separating the two is razor-thin; she dances gracefully upon it. I could say more, but perhaps appropriately, it's difficult to find words that capture the beauty of her silent performance. Half the joy is in watching her reactions naturally unfold anyway.<br/><br/>Like Penn, Uma Thurman portrays a pretty unlikeable character. Her Blanche is overly intellectual, questions incessantly and is in some ways just as emotionally alienated as Emmett. Though her character is grating at first (particularly in contrast to Morton), Thurman does not shrink from the less flattering aspects of her character. It's a brave performance in a thankless role.<br/><br/>Woody Allen has constructed a thoughtful meditation on the nature of artistry. Not on celebrity -- we all know how that film turned out -- but on the rights and responsibilities of the true artist. Emmett, Hattie and Blanche represent the axis of artists, fans and critics respectively. As their relationships play out -- naturally, inexorably and poignantly -- the viewer gets a rare treat: a film that plucks at the mind and at the heart as gracefully as Emmett picking his guitar strings."
"jldmp1","9","24","26","16 January 2006"," For The Love Of Django
","When we try to understand genius, or love, or ""why?"", we run into the same problem that the ancients encountered:<br/><br/>""I went to the poets  I took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning of them  thinking that they would teach me something. I must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves. That showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them.""  Socrates, The Apology<br/><br/>So here we have Woody telling a story about a storyteller, who talks and struts endlessly (Penn has a ball with this), but can only say anything through music, and he can't explain a bit of it. Much like Woody, who prattles on about every neurosis, but speaks volumes through his control of the medium. It's just something he's born to do.<br/><br/>And this is the only way to understand Django -- with only two working fingers on his fretting hand (accidental disfigurement), he reinvented the whole medium of guitar. The new shape of his hand forced him into holding octaves - which can be done on guitar with two adjacent fingers, unlike on the piano - and changing the way leads and comping - here, self-accompaniment - were played. His art was the necessary step before Les Paul, and thence to Wes Montgomery, and so on to you and me. <br/><br/>Here is devotion without hagiography, because all of this is wrapped into ""one of those Emmett Ray stories"", where you can 'never be sure' of what is truth, confabulation, or exaggeration. <br/><br/>Brilliance. Bravo, to all."
"llltdesq","8","52","60","2 October 2000"," The type of film Woody Allen does very well
","In my opinion, there is more than one type of Woody Allen film.  There is the antic lunacy of films like Bananas and Sleeper, the serio-comic ""serious"" film with ""meaning"", like Annie Hall, Husbands and Wives and Deconstructing Harry and then there are what I think are Woody Allen's ""love notes"", if you'll bear with the expression, films like The Purple Rose of Cairo, Bullets Over Broadway and Sweet and Lowdown, films as a general rule that are period pieces (generally the '30's or thereabouts) that are basically mash notes from Allen to something Allen particularly cares about, such as jazz in Sweet and Lowdown (specifically jazz guitar and Django Reinhardt).  The score is great, which is typical for a Woody Allen film. Allen does these little films vey well and they are almost always worth watching.  Sean Penn plays a self-centered, egotistical creep with talent. I will leave any further interpretations regarding the preceding statement to the Gentle Reader.  Why he was nominated for an Oscar escapes me. Samantha Morton, on the other hand, gives a sweet, if almost one-note, performance, which basically sums up the movie: worth the time and effort to watch, but a one-note film.  If you like this side of Woody (and I do), this is worth seeing."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","39","46","24 October 2005"," Hats Off To 'Hattie!'
","This is a strange movie, but one made a little bit special to me because of one memorable character: ""Hattie,"" played by Samantha Morton. What a wonderful, endearing character! The sweet look on her face alone makes this movie worth keeping.<br/><br/>Another huge positive for this film is the cinematography. This is beautifully shot with great colors which look all the better on DVD.<br/><br/>As mentioned by other reviewers, Sean Penn also does an excellent job in the lead. The shocker for me was how good a comedic touch he exhibits. Putting his general persona or politics aside, this man deserves kudos as an actor.<br/><br/>There is a third very different and interesting character in this movie: ""Blanche,"" played by Uma Thurman, who portrays an amoral woman in the last part of the film. She, too, is fascinating.<br/><br/>So....three interesting characters, great photography AND terrific music - jazz guitar is a central part of this story - all make for a fun hour-and-a-half of entertainment."
"ian_harris","7","19","21","29 May 2003"," Very watchable, very charming
","This is a very enjoyable movie.  It has many touches in it that are classic Woody Allen, so it should appeal to his many fans.  It is also so strong on the jazz material that it should appeal to jazz afficianados even if they are not Woody Allen fans.  <br/><br/>The biographical / documentary styles keep this movie away from Woody's worst excesses (I am a fan, but not a blinkered one)and provide momentum. There are one or two scenes that migrate towards farce, such as the hold-up scene(s) and the ""moon seat"".<br/><br/>This film is well worth seeing."
"jaspoet","8","23","26","4 August 2004"," A virtuoso performance by the greatest actor of our time.
","Sweet and Lowdown is the story of a fictional jazz guitarist who is self admittedly the second best in the world(next to that gypsy in France) but there is one thing that is clear while watching this movie, sean penn is second to no one. He is simply the greatest actor of our time and he once again proves it here. As emmett Ray, sean penn invests his very soul and embodies the role of a vain, talented, yet oblivious and cold hearted man who is actually filled with self doubt and remorse. The character is as crude a low life thief and pimp as he is a excellent musician. He is the zany, pathetic artist with a heart of stone. That penn can make you feel for him is no easy task. Penn also did an exceptional job mastering the appearance of playing the guitar for the role. Woody Allen has crafted a gem of a film filled with poignancy and humor. Samantha Morton is incredible as Hattie the mute girl who clearly worships everything about Ray, though Ray doesn't have the ability to notice a good thing when it's standing in front of his self absorbed face. That Ray is both a genius and a fool is clear and it's the emotional core of the film. He's just as at home shooting rats at the train tracks as he is performing drunk for his adoring audience. At the end of the movie there is a series of scenes in which the emotional weight of Rays mistakes seem to finally be understood by him. In one he meets Hattie again on the same boardwalk where they originally met, though she is now happily married and a mother. The false bravado of Rays personality seems to crack momentarily only to be swallowed again by his deluded machismo. The second even more heart wrenching is the final scene at the railroad with Gretchen Mol. Penn in an ill fated attempt to show off his skills for her seems to have all of his regrets, conceits and pain hit him at once. Watching Penn slowly remove the mask of Rays lonely broken heart is a gift, in an acting class of it's own. He is truly the master of American acting. Who won best actor in 2000? Russell Crowe in gladiator? And we wonder why penn doesn't believe in acting awards."
"Ben_Cheshire","8","37","44","31 May 2004"," The first essential Woody Allen film in a long time.
","Sean Penn plays Emmett Ray, a little-known jazz guitarist, an eccentric, egocentric genius self-proclaimed as the ""greatest guitar player in the country"" or the ""second greatest guitar player in the world"" - because of that gypsy from France, the bane of his life, Django Reinhardt. The story of Sweet and Lowdown is the story of Emmett and the girl he first describes as ""the little one with the silly hat,"" who is also, incidentally, called Hattie. There is something so special and memorable about the chemistry between Hattie and Emmett. Hattie is perfect for Emmett, because she's mute, and therefore he can sound off all day about how great he is, and she's the one person who won't contradict him.<br/><br/>Woody has the knack of making highly watchable movies - and popping them out one a year. There is a continuity across them all, yet they all seem somewhat unique. Sweet and Lowdown stands heads and shoulders above every other film Woody has made since Husbands and Wives. With Sweet and Lowdown, Woody reminds us why we loved him in the first place - yet i'm not sure i can think of another Woody film that's as genuine, beautiful and moving, yet eccentric and funny at the same time. Annie Hall was probably as touching, but with Woody is no actor next to Penn, which i think makes an incredible difference! Penn brings to life a character so eccentric and unbelievable, yet we never doubt him, we never feel he's not a total human being.<br/><br/>Penn's performance is counterbalanced by another equally moving performance by Samantha Morton as Hattie. Often you'll find yourself watching a two-shot with the both of them on screen, and you won't be able to decide which character you're more curious to watch. More often than not, you'll watch Samantha Morton, to see what Hattie is thinking and feeling. An extraordinary job by an extraordinarily talented actress you may have seen as the mother in In America or the pre-cog Agatha in Minority report.<br/><br/>The one fault in the film is Uma Thurman - she is badly miscast and clearly only suited to intentionally hammy fodder like Kill Bill. Her character, Blanche, is great (""Okay, so i slept with him, but i was just researching a book!""), which makes it more the shame that Thurman speaks her line like she thinks this is a cartoon or a Tarantino movie. The audience will only accept the eccentricity of this style if the performances are genuine: she gets an F. She pops the bubble of this movie. When she appears, we suddenly realise its only a movie, and the spell is broken. Nevertheless, she's only in a relatively small portion of the film, and she can't bring down the rest of it. <br/><br/>Sweet and Lowdown has the feeling of telling you a tale, and it spins some great fun yarns about little-known jazz guitarist Emmett Ray. Penn and Morton bring to life an incredible couple of characters - two of Woody's best creations. Well designed with nice period costumes and well directed, especially the magestic final crane shot (a reference to La Strada i believe). The story is beautifully punctuated with scintillating jazz music by Dick Hyman and others.<br/><br/>""Come listen,"" Emmett tells someone at one point, ""you'll love this, i'm great."""
"Trufó","8","21","24","15 April 2000"," Great, small movie form the genius.
","Woody Allen has such control over the story telling tools of cinema that he can do whatever he wants. Mixing ""documentary"" comments about what is happening with the characters, and straightforward and yet superbly filmed feature sequences, Allen shows once again why he is one of the greatest film directors of our time. Good plot, great performances, skillfully constructed characters, excellent camera work... can you ask for more?"
"Dragonshadow0","10","12","14","6 June 2002"," I Don't Like Woody Allen, but......
","I loved this.  A story of a fictional character, portrayed as documentary, the viewer is drawn in, particularly by the believable performances from all the cast, Samantha Morton and Sean Penn in particular.  They both deserved the nominations they received for these roles.  Morton especially since she had no words, only expressions, to carry meaning, and she succeeds.<br/><br/>In addition, if you like jazz, there is simply some fantastic music to be heard.  Apparently Penn had never played guitar before this movie, and while it is unlikely that he was able to play to this standard, he nevertheless carries off miming very well.<br/><br/>Great music, great film.  10/10"
"Spleen","9","10","12","4 April 2002"," Proof that Allen still has it
","I didn't find out until afterwards that Woody Allen made it all up - that Emmet Ray didn't even exist.  Nor did my sister.  She thought the lack of accuracy took some of the shine off the film; I thought it made it an even greater creation.<br/><br/>It would spoil the joke (well, it's not really a joke, nor a hoax; I don't know what word to use) for Woody Allen to let on that it's all made up, WITHIN the film, even during the opening or closing credits (although if you read the latter carefully you'll notice that ""Emmet Ray"" is not credited with performing any of the music, even though Django Reinhardt is).  But the film is neither deceptive nor intended to deceive.  If you know in advance that it's pure fiction then so much the better.  Unlike ""Fargo"" (which was good enough not to need to lie to us but did anyway), it never tells us it ISN'T fiction; unlike ""The Blair Witch Project"", it has as strong an effect even if we're aware that it's fiction - and treat it as such.<br/><br/>It is, in fact, one of Woody Allen's few flawless gems.  (Those of his pictures that aren't flawless gems are, of course, never less than likeable.)  This would be a perfectly constructed documentary if it WERE a documentary.  It's a perfectly constructed work of fiction given that it IS fiction.  Such a balancing act is harder than it looks.  But who cares? What matters is the unerringly apt art direction (nobody does 20th Century period pieces better than Allen), photography, acting and dialogue.  The story is slight but still carries a charge; even if it didn't, there's more than enough of a profusion of interesting narrative AROUND the story (never getting in the way) to carry the movie."
"zippyflynn2","10","13","17","5 August 2007"," Wonderful Movie about Love, Genius and Great Jazz Guitar Playing
","As Woody Allen said of Sean Penn after working with him on this film ""(Sean's) a tremendous actor"". And he displays his tremendous talent in playing the role of Emmett Ray, jazz guitarist, a genius at his craft, rather a disastrous dope in all other aspects of his life.<br/><br/>Then there's Samantha Morton who is brilliant in her portrayal of sweet, adorable Hattie, a cute mute young woman whose simple needs and wants, along with her lack of narcissism and inability to spew out mind numbing volumes of bulls+t banter obscure her deep strength and savvy intelligence. Those that value pure, sweet, unassuming kindness will find her irresistibly lovable.<br/><br/>Emmett only really knows one thing, how to play guitar like no one else in the world, with the exception of the one person he idolizes to the point of hysteria: Django Reinhardt. He's obliviously inept at just about everything else in his life, especially his feelings, to the point where he doesn't know real, rare, wonderful love when it's right next to him. Sean is able to make Emmett so very likable, even in his worst of behavior. He excels at what he does best, bringing real human depth and qualities to his craft that exceptionally few actors are or have been capable of doing.<br/><br/>This film is much like the character of Hattie, deceptive in its initial appearance and of a substantially better quality than you may first think. It seems like a light, cute little story largely due to its entertaining presentation and lack of dramatic pretense but there is significant texture and reality to this work of art. Emmett is perhaps the greatest guitar player in America and has so many of the essential ingredients for huge success: drive, ambition, presentation, wardrobe, personality, yet he tends to sabotage himself frequently and never gets the lucky break needed to put him at the top. True he could probably do rather well if he didn't p+ss away such volumes of cash but he never gets the type of success that the best supposedly deserve and is so wrought with money it won't disappear in the most extravagant lifestyles.<br/><br/>Emmett also makes the tragically universal mistake of believing bullsh+t, both his and society's. He thinks the money and possessions and trophy girlfriends are what happiness are all about. His one saving grace is his love and respect for his craft but can this alone keep him from making a disaster of his life? He discovers all too painfully that the beautiful woman with the sophisticated, witty repartee, whom all the other men drool over, has an extremely high price tag of impenetrable, cold blooded narcissism. And though Emmett acts for the most part like a shallow dope, trying to hide and deny that besides being a genius he is a painfully sensitive man in desperate need of sweet, nurturing love, he still makes way too many foolhardy decisions. He is blind to the fact that the women who use sweetness merely as a tool of manipulation are the last thing he, or anyone else with a shred of decency, need or deserve.<br/><br/>This is a great film and story and you can also enjoy a very pretty picture of life in the 1940's while you watch it.<br/><br/>Apparently there was an obscure jazz guitarist named Emmett Ray but even if there wasn't, this is not really a fictionalized account. Certainly not in the sense of capturing the essence of character, love and genius. As he has done so marvelously before and since, Woody Allen masterfully captures an immensely watchable slice of life that most of us will only have an opportunity to witness with this fine offering. For the film itself as well as the two stellar leads this is will go into my relatively short list of wonderful, favorite films."
"drosse67","Null","19","30","9 September 2004"," Proof that Sean Penn can really act
","The two movies that come to mind when I think about Sean Penn and his acting ability are not Mystic River and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. They are Carlito's Way and Sweet & Lowdown. In both of these movies, he immerses himself in the characters, while in most of his other movies, including the art house hits like 21 Grams and Hurly Burly, he plays more or less the same type of person. Sweet and Lowdown has Penn playing a self-absorbed classical guitarist who obsesses over a world-renowned guitarist much in the way Woody Allen obsesses over things in his other movies. Woody himself shows up as a commentator (this, like Zelig, is presented in mock documentary fashion). It is amusing, if slight (and a sign of things to come in 2000-2002, with Small Time Crooks, Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Hollywood Ending). Samantha Morton won a justified Oscar nomination, but Uma Thurman and Gretchen Mol are wasted (Uma got second billing over Sean Penn, and is hardly in the movie!) Not a Woody Allen masterpiece, but fans could do worse."
"tedg","Null","11","16","28 November 2000"," Sweet
","Woody is uneven to say the least. His most celebrated films strike me as failures by overreaching. But here the aspirations are slight and the result is rather winning.<br/><br/>All of Woody's pictures are self-referential in the sense that they are about him, his foibles and neuroses. Here, that is made more plain by the invention of a simple self-referential device: the film is about an artist who has troubles relating to women, and who has eccentric habits. Ho hum, until you add the tricks which are deft;<br/><br/>--The story is a documentary (complete with reminicenses) but of a completely fictitious character<br/><br/>--The narrative comes not from a disembodied camera, but from the contemporaries and historians, including Woody. Thus, the artist sits down with the audience, to swap tales about his avatar.<br/><br/>--Some of the stories are of the `as I heard it' tall tale variety, going so far as to have three versions of a scene all patent lies. This is really the best.<br/><br/>It all works because Penn is such an intelligent actor. He knows that he has to live in several realities:<br/><br/>--He is the character<br/><br/>--He is the fictitious remembrance of the character<br/><br/>--He is one of the storytellers<br/><br/>--He is the actor Sean Penn winking at you throughout<br/><br/>Penn carries this off with aplumb -- simultaneous stances, all but the first in good humor. Great drama, since you never really know where you stand. This film is a gem."
"greenboy37","10","4","5","1 September 2003"," The Best Woody Allen Film That Noone Talks About
","I'm surprised when I discuss Woody Allen films with all of my movie buff friends that this one is rarely brought up. It's easily his best film since Crimes and Misdemeanors way back in 1989. It's a sweet slice of life about a has been guitarist, played wonderfully by Sean Penn, and his love affair with a mute. Sounds silly, as most Woody Allen plots do, but it works beautifully. With trite messes like ""Hollywood Ending"" and ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" being directed by Allen in the past few years, this is one everyone should go pick up to realize how great Allen is when he's on."

","Help!  Call the Police!  911!  One of the greatest injustices is currently happening RIGHT NOW!  And it all has to do with Woody Allen.  Yes, apparently, no matter how good the movie is, the critics and the general public are forced to say that woody allen isn't good any more!  What a disgrace!  Sure, he's not making annie halls anymore, but he's certainly not making any terribly horrible movies like people say he is.  Ladies and Gentleman, please: save those comments for when joel schumacher directs Annie Hall 2: with a vengence.<br/><br/>Sweet and Lowdown is an independent film that received an amusing reaction from critics.  Wow!  Woody Allen made an art flick!  BFD, i say.  Some critics loved it, others seemingly dismissed it.  I think it's a great flick, and excellent character study.<br/><br/>It's imdb, we know the plot, let's hit the acting paragraph, shall we? Jeff Spicoli, a decent actor, shines as the lead, which i can almost guarantee you could not be played by any other actor.  he lets us know that he hates himself, his talents, his habits, his personality flaws, and even those he loves.  Penn was nominated for his role, but lost to kevin spacey for his role in american beauty, which was simply a better film, but each man gave an equally stunning performance.  Samatha Morton was the one who received the random nomination at the 1999 academy awards.  Not to say she was bad, she was great in fact.  She loves emmet despite his flaws, and in some ways relates to his struggle, and offers him her undivided attention and sympathy.  Great performance, but if you think the academy actually cared then you're a bit mixed up, my friend.<br/><br/>Sweet and Lowdown is an exceptionally good film that i highly suggest you go out and rent (don't worry, they'll have it).  A great character study, this film proves that ol' Woody is not ready to go yet, and definetely deserved the standing ovation he received at the 2002 AA's (I was hoping that it would happen and was shocked that it did).  So here's to you Woody.  Go back to your apartment, turn on the tube, and get out a cold one.  Maybe cook yourself lobsters with your girlfriend, or order an italian sub with mayonaisse."
"elshikh4","7","2","2","25 May 2010"," A story of an artist who dreams of the moon, and fears of riding it !
","It seems like ages since the last time I watched a decent movie by (Woody Allen). Let's see; from Annie Hall (1977) to Everyone Says I Love You (1996) things were good. Then Deconstructing Harry (1997), Small Time Crooks (2000), The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001), Hollywood Ending (2002), and Melinda and Melinda (2004) ALL had problems, sometimes more than their good points. In the middle of both phases is where Sweet and Lowdown exists. Now this is a good movie on all the levels.<br/><br/>Why Emmet Ray couldn't be Django Reinhardt? It's simple. He isn't that bold when it comes to express his feelings. So that's why he didn't tell the girl he loved, who loved him as well, that he loves her, and lost her at the end. I think there is a reason why Allen did a movie about that man, else paying a tribute to jazz guitarist he loves. Allen is the complete opposite of Emmet Ray. Dear Woody just can't get enough of showing himself to the audience through the characters of his movies during the last 35 years, some of them played by him. Or maybe, after all of these years, Woody just sees that he didn't express enough, feeling a bound with Ray as if the last is a symbol for the suppression which can kill a talented artist. We can read this movie as a conscience of importunate fear Allen has.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved it. It was fantastic how Allen, out of some unfinished or uncertain stories, made his own version of Emmet Ray's bio. Btw, history itself suffers from having true and false stories! However, I felt something was missing with the background of the character. His history was a bit vague. I knew well that he was poor to the extent that made him afraid of being poor again, so he worked a lot, threw money away for looking rich, having this strange love to steal (he, to some extent, just wants to own). But on the other hand, I didn't understand what the secret of his fear to express was?, was it some kind of compulsory obsession?, was it something in his childhood?, was he that shy of his early poor life?, another unanswered question: He drank much to forget what? His fear, or his inner belief that he wouldn't be great due to this very fear?<br/><br/>There are some nice moments. The ones with his wife were so serene, and hilariously comic. Samantha Morton is out of this world, being a tender creature sent from better place to do this role. In that place that she came from, she was gifted with the magical diamond of acting, which made her deliver so realistic and believable performance. Sean Penn proves that he's a master of characters. He did it nearly flawlessly. However, he was lowdown and no sweet! And finally, there is nothing, and I mean nothing, that can be more joyful more than witnessing how the old jazz tracks, that Woody adores, fit perfectly in the movie he directs. Ahhh, I felt deep relief about that apart!<br/><br/>(Sweet and Lowdown) is romantic, funny, and sad. And, most importantly, it is where all the elements that make a usual Woody Allen's movie shared to make, at last, a fine Woody Allen's movie. The moon that Ray dreamed of and feared of, Allen captured and rode."
"secondtake","6","3","4","20 December 2009"," Like the guitarist in the movie, this is always second best, at best
","Sweet and Lowdown (1999)<br/><br/>Besides the funny idea of creating a musician who never existed and having talking heads of real experts to support the idea (done better in Zelig and, more parallel, The Rutles), there is very little happening there to keep the movie going. There are a few funny lines, for sure, but many more that are either reused Allen quips or just flat comebacks. <br/><br/>At first Sean Penn seems perfect for his role, and he fortunately plays his part no imitating Allen. But either he has so little to work with or he plays this guitarist so superficially, it never takes off, we never feel for him or his situation. The fact that he ""fades away"" at the end of his career is something like the whole movie, which didn't quite form in the first place. Funny and clever the way Scoop is funny and clever--not too much.<br/><br/>Samantha Morton puts in a great performance as a mute woman. And the music, a la Django, is unassailable."
"bob the moo","Null","4","6","31 May 2003"," Bittersweet comedy that is best when sweet but is difficult when bitter
","A mockumentary charting the last few years of the career and life of jazz guitarist Emmet Ray  considered one of the finest guitarists of the time, second only to Django Reinhardt.  The film charts his colourful rise from small time pimp and kleptomaniac to the recording of the work that experts claim to be some of the best of the period.<br/><br/>Like the title suggests, this is a split film and that is the reason I think I may have had difficulty enjoying it with quite the same light laughter that I have had with Woody Allen over the past few years.  The plot is set up well with the fictional character treated for all the world as a real legend worthy of documentary treatment.  The use of talking heads frames the story well and almost allows it to be more piecemeal that it would have been able to as a straight film.  The `sweet' of the film (or rather `bittersweet') is the comedy of the tale  the lunacy or whimsy of the whole affair and this works well and sets the tone.<br/><br/>What then sours the mix a little is the `low-down'.  Basically the story is around quite a selfish and unpleasant character and it is hard to get past that  especially where the comedy is so very light for stretches.  It is hard not to feel that the mood of the film is changing as Ray shamelessly hurts a naïve mute girl who seems to adore him  he seems to be happy to have found someone who can only listen to him talk about himself without interrupting.  There is, of course, redemption but this comes late and doesn't lift the fact that the lead is an unpleasant character, albeit one easily mocked for his own inadequacies.<br/><br/>To his credit Penn holds the role together and doesn't et it become so unsympathetic that the film is lost  it is only occasionally when the actions of his character overwhelm his portrayal of the character.  Support is generally good, Morton is touchingly sweet despite the lack of dialogue, LaPaglia is a good a mobster as you'd expect, Thuman is a good part and there are some well known `Allen' faces in small parts.  The talking heads are good and not overly used for comic interludes  they play it straight and let the story make the funnies.  Allen brings his passion to jazz into his bits and it's difficult to see that he has his tongue in his cheek.<br/><br/>Overall I must admit that I didn't connect with this film as well as other Allen fans seem to have, mostly because the bittersweet mix was enjoyable when leaning towards the sweet but it was less so when the bitter side (understandably) was brought out."
"erniemunger","5","5","9","4 December 2005"," Woody mocks Allen
","A mere shadow of its conceptual predecessor Zelig (in the Allen film typology), Sweet and Lowdown is proof that the mockumentary method is not a guarantee for a successful plot. For one - and despite an honest acting performance - it's very, very tedious having to watch Sean Penn playing guitar and suspend your disbelief, especially when even a side character like the bass guitar player acts like he's never even seen an instrument before. Something's gone terribly wrong with the story as well; from the onset, you're left wondering where it's heading at. Meek puns are badly delivered and poor dialogues try hard to be funny; Uma Thurman's overblown performance is just one example here. Generally speaking, you get the feeling that not much time was wasted on character design, which is all the more problematic as the entire film hinges on one central figure. Of all things, the comments are redundant and spoil much of the potential fun. Worst of all, an off-screen character comment (inner dialogue) pops out of nowhere near the end of the film, making you wonder what went wrong in the story design that had to be somehow recovered in the editing. Amateurish, to say the least. Of course, like so many Allen movies, this one has also quite a few things coming its way, most notably set design and image. And unlike his cheaper flicks, we're awarded a string of atmospheric exterior location shots. But in the end, it simply doesn't add up. You just don't make an entire movie on a one-sided caricature of a character. And it certainly looks like Allen couldn't make up his mind on the genre of film he wanted to make. Just as Emmet Ray is second to Django Reinhardt, this Woody Allen doesn't live up to himself."
"barbarella70","Null","4","7","12 December 2002"," Almost one of Woody's best
","Woody Allen's valentine to jazz music and neglected artists would easily be considered one of his best if it wasn't for a second act that begins to meander and turn ponderous.  The evocative '30's tale of a self-destructive jazz musician (Sean Penn) who dreams of making it big while trying not to fall in love with a mute young woman (Samantha Morton) is so beautifully done that when it begins to shift towards Uma Thurman and Anthony LaPaglia, it stumbles and almost loses its magic.  The film picks itself up again towards the end but that middle section fails to interest.<br/><br/>
 However, Sean Penn is easily one of our finest actors and gives an incredible performance that's matched by a heartbreaking Samantha Morton. Together, the acting chemistry is breathtaking; when they're apart, the film drags.  Both actors more than deserved the praise and awards bestowed upon them and their work here will probably be considered classic one day.<br/><br/>  As great as the actors are, the sets and costumes, music and  lighting all play a major contribution to the feel of this film and show an amazing commitment to detail that Woody should be applauded for.  Sweet and Lowdown is a good film that should be seen even if it falls short of being a classic."

","Once again Woody Allen seems to be completely devoid of any inspiration other than recycling himself.  Here we have a mock documentary (like Zelig), the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) set in the 30's (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets over Broadway) about a low-life (Deconstructing Harry) who believes being a genius absolves him from being a jerk (ditto).  Given this film and Deconstructing Harry, one wonders if this is Allen's justification for his own actions with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter; yes, I was a jerk, but I'm a genius so you gotta love me.<br/><br/>   Allen has only produced two good movies in the past ten years; the fine but overpraised Bullets over Broadway, and the excellent but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery.  His other efforts range from trifles (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite), to edgy yet experimental (Husbands and Wives), to pure drek (Alice, Scenes from a Mall, Shadows and Fog, Celebrity, Deconstructing Harry).  His films no longer even try to have a narrative arc, and his humor seems to aim at wryly amusing, not funny.  After Deconstructing Harry I stopped seeing his films in theaters; after Sweet and Lowdown I may stop renting them as well."

","Woody Allen (who I have to confess at the outset I have never been a big fan of) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a 1930's jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while, then quickly faded. Penn does a credible job in the role, portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not unlike Allen himself, which perhaps explains why Woody would be attracted to this project) who can't maintain relationships, and whose twin passions (aside from guitar playing) were shooting rats at the dump and watching trains.<br/><br/>There isn't a great deal of consistency to the story. It's narrated in a sense by a series of modern-day jazz ""experts"" (one of whom is Allen himself), who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in Ray's life. The end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators, who probably should have done a better job with it. <br/><br/>Jazz fans and fans of Woody Allen will probably enjoy this.

"williambriggs","Null","2","3","28 May 2003"," The best Woody Allen film in 10 years
","Sweet and Lowdown is the story of a musician who through two broken relationships, one with a mute woman the other with a his adulteress authoress wife is able to access true creativity and self-expression. This of course makes it sound like the most dreary, awful Eastern-European psychodrama. Or worse a return to the housebound Woody of Interiors and September, particularly when one sees that Allen does not act in the film. But have no fear. This is far and away the best, and funniest, Woody Allen film of the last 10 years. Allen's biggest obsession, bigger even than  sex, or illness, has always been how the artist can sustain normal human relations. That theme is here more explicit than in any other of his films. Although there are romantic and comic elements this is very much a film about how the artist finds himself.In the fictional 1920's jazz guitarist Emmet Ray (Sean Penn, excellent) he has created a fellow neurotic jazz freak with an added self-destructive streak. The director is often accused of presenting on film a fantasy version of himself; more feral and self confident. Here he goes overboard, portraying a selfish, insecure,  angry, kleptomaniac, alcoholic, shopaholic, near -genius. The insolently talented musician at the heart of the film is surely a wish-fulfilment for Woody who has been slugging through his Monday night clarinet- playing gig at Michaels Pub NYC since 1971. The wannabe stud of his early stand -up performances and the worshipper of Sidney Bechet are fused together in the scene in which Penn wins over the mute girl Hattie (Samantha Morton) with a, for him, perfunctory version of `I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles'. Penn/Ray  communicates the feeling of homage in so much of Allen's work. For his iconic attitude toward the partially disabled French guitarist Django Reinhardt we can read Allen's own constant nods to Bergman and Fellini. Artistic insecurity is a theme that runs through the film, Every time Penn's declares himself, in his stabbing, bratish voice, to be `The best guitarist in the world...except  maybe for this gypsy in France'  we hear a little more desperation enter his soul. The suffering, rejection, and pain he suffers are gradually revealed to be the doors rather than blocks to artistic expression. He is told repeatedly that if he were only able to access his emotions he would play better. This is finally brought about by the departure of his wife.Uma Thurman, barely recognizable in period costume, plays the part and she is the kind of glamourous, self-referencing, pretentious artist/intellectuall  obligatory in all Allen's work. Her shallowness is contrasted by the feeling she inadvertently brings about in her ex-husbands playing. Pain leading to creativity ?  Strained relationships with weird women? Locking yourself in a room for three days to listen to jazz? This of course sounds very much like our idea of the post-Mia, Allen social life. Even for a fan the directors constant use of autobiographical themes can become tiresome. But not when  supported by the excellent performances, period and genre detail on display here. Real life jazz singer Ben Duncan and legendary jazz critic Nat Hentoff (who I must admit I thought was dead) provide commentary. References are made to such obscure figures as Buck Clayton and Eddie Condon. The soundtrack is to die for (by the way why is it never mentioned how wonderful the music is in EVERY Woody Allen movie). This could push the film off into anal-muso-jazz-hell were it not for two astonoishing  central performances. Penn is fast cornering the market manchilds,  reliant on but misunderstanding women. Toward the end of the film he finds it worryingly easy to portray an artist brought to his knees by selfishness and addiction. He conveys all the changed perspective of the genuinely emotionally suffering artist with one simple look at his guitar after playing his first original composition. That great antidote to male boorishness, humility, has entered his soul. Morton is, I must admit, a completely new name to me. But she is blessed with one of the most expressive faces I have ever seen on camera. She communicates, her simplicity,her love for Penn, and her eventual disappointment with him only with her smile. It's difficult to imagine exactly where this role will take her but one hopes it will lead on to bigger things than her other near -mute role in Minority Report. Finally, a word about the dialogue. It has been the case for some years now that Allen jokes are best delivered by others. For pure amusement value this is one of Allen's best and it is nice to think that America's most inventive, and distinctive  living filmmaker is entering his 70's and still entertaining."
"TxMike","Null","2","3","15 October 2000"," One of the more pleasant Woody Allen projects, good music, fun story, 7 of 10 rating.
","""Sweet and Lowdown"" is a mock-documentary about a 1930s Jazz guitarist who is ""second best in the world"", only the real guitarist, Django Reinhardt, being better.  One of the comic threads here is that Sean Penn's character, Emmet Ray, is so intimidated by Reinhardt that even the thought of mmeting him causes Ray to faint. <br/><br/>This Woody Allen film is whimsical in the vein of ""Purple Rose of Cairo"", but so well done that you easily believe Emmet Ray was a real person. Samantha Morton does a good job as the mute ""Hattie"".  Several other well-known actors - Uma Thurman, Anthony LaPaglia, Gretchen Mol - have minor roles.  Sean Penn does a marvelous job with his character and it is clear to me why he received an Oscar nomination for it.<br/><br/>I only give this movie a ""7"" because at 95 minutes, part of which is ""talking head"" snips of Woody and others, the theme is treated somewhat superficially.  More character development and resolution of ""what happened to Emmet Ray"" could have made this a much better movie.  Still, it is enjoyable and worth seeing.<br/><br/>A major complaint from me - the DVD version is in glorous ""MONO"" sound. What a waste and cheap way out, in this modern time of surround sound. However, the picture is very nice."
"bobsgrock","9","1","1","21 August 2010"," Withheld emotion.
","Sweet and Lowdown is the type of Woody Allen movie you wouldn't expect the legend to make, particularly after seeing a nasty and brutish piece like Deconstructing Harry. Yet, Allen shows his most gentle side here; by giving us two terrific and engaging characters, we are deeply engrossed in this fictional tale about a Depression-era jazz player who considers himself to be the best in the world, or at least the best next to Django Reinhardt.<br/><br/>Emmet Ray is a fictional creation from Woody Allen's mind, but I find it fascinating how penetrating he is able to go in order to explore every facet of his character. Sean Penn is also able to bring forth the true feelings, or lack of feelings, Ray exhibits to nearly everyone he encounters. It is a great performance in a great career for Penn, and the same can be said for Samantha Morton who is brilliant as the mute Hattie who loves Emmet but is continually rejected by his lofty ideas of remaining completely detached.<br/><br/>This film is a loose reworking of Fellini's classic film La Strada, which also tells the tale of a great artist (in this case a circus strongman) and his relationship with a mute girl who loves him unconditionally. Both films end similarly, and I think it isn't too far of a stretch to say that Allen's ending may hit even harder the emotions than Fellini. What Allen does here is gives us a very powerful and sad love story, effectively recreate the era of a time in America when resources were low but joy was high and plant a little sweetness and niceness into us for 90 minutes. The film looks great in its photography, sets and costumes and also has two enamoring performances by Penn and Morton. Whether a fan of Woody Allen or not, this is a film to see."

","Once again we get to see Sean Penn at his charming and reckless best. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him go into his self destructive mode, losing out on the things that are really important. One could start off thinking of him as an arrogant ass, but then come to realize that he is more insecure than almost anyone. His fear of the looming Django Renihart is pretty cool. Imagine being the second best and knowing it, that is, being so good but not quite there. How many people can tell you who the second man to walk on the moon was? The money comes and the money goes and the man goes on. The cinematography of this film is wonderful, capturing an era when the jazz performer was the king."
"JamesHitchcock","8","1","1","9 October 2009"," Woody Allen is not as funny as he used to be, but then he never was.
","The story is told about the now-defunct British humorous magazine ""Punch"" that, when someone complained to the editor that ""Punch is not as funny as it used to be,"" he replied ""It never was."" The same could be said of Woody Allen. For years the received criticism of every new Woody film has been ""Woody is not as funny as he used to be"". He never was. Exactly when he was funny varies according to the particular tastes of the critic in question. Some will tell you that he has not been funny since ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", others that he has done nothing worthwhile since ""Manhattan"". There are probably even some purists who will insist that nothing in his later work can compare to early slapstick comedies like ""Sleeper"" or ""Bananas"".<br/><br/>I myself have never been an adherent of the ""Woody is not as funny as he used to be"" school of thought, for two reasons. Firstly, not all his films from his supposed golden age in the seventies and eighties were equally good; several of the sketches in ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About SexÂ…."", for example, today come across as frankly embarrassing. Secondly, by no means all of his films from the 1990s and the 2000s are weak; he has made a number of good films during this period, of which ""Sweet and Lowdown"" is one of the best.<br/><br/>In structure the film is a mock-documentary about Emmett Ray, a jazz guitarist from the 1930s. Ray is a fictitious character, although the spoof is so well done that it becomes entirely credible. (The day after I first saw this in the cinema I went to the library to check out what it said about him in an encyclopaedia of jazz. Needless to say, I did not find his entry). Scenes from Ray's life are intercut with shots of jazz experts, including Allen himself, being interviewed about Ray's music. To add to the idea that this is a non-fiction documentary, the various commentators give differing versions of anecdotes about Ray or differing interpretations of his life.<br/><br/>Allen, of course, is well known for his love of jazz, and it would appear that he first conceived the ambition to make a film about a jazz musician in the early seventies, but this did not come to fruition until 1999. He originally planned to play the part of Emmet Ray himself, but unless he has a much wider range as an actor than he has hitherto shown it was a wise decision to cast Sean Penn rather than himself in the role, as Ray is far from being a typical Woody character. For a start, he is neither Jewish nor a New Yorker. Nor is he a nervous, angst-ridden, self-deprecating intellectual- indeed, he is far from being an intellectual at all. Great artists are not always great men, and for all his brilliance as a performer Ray is a deeply flawed individual- crude, boorish, an alcoholic and a kleptomaniac. Besides his music, he has a sideline as a ponce running a stable of prostitutes. His idea of a hobby is to go down to the local rubbish dump and shoot rats, even inviting his girlfriends to join him in this dubious sport. Obviously the last of the great romantics.<br/><br/>Ray is also conceited about his talent, proclaiming himself to be the second best guitarist in the world after his idol Django Reinhardt (who was of course a real person). Ray's relationship to Reinhardt, whom he does not know personally, is a complicated mixture of jealousy and hero-worship; he adores Reinhardt's music, but also hopes to be able to better it. Ray's one redeeming quality is his passionate dedication to his art, and Penn (in an excellent performance) is able to suggest all the many facets of his personality and to make him someone who is not totally unsympathetic despite his many faults.<br/><br/>The other really excellent performance is that of the young Samantha Morton as Ray's sweet, innocent girlfriend Hattie. Hattie is mute, which means that Morton could only express her character through gestures and facial expressions. It is a performance similar to that of Marlee Matlin as the deaf-mute heroine of ""Children of a Lesser God"", although with the difference that Hattie, although mute, is not deaf. Uma Thurman is also good as Ray's wife Blanche, an upper-class socialite who marries Ray out of what might be called ""nostalgie de la boue"". She is attracted to him precisely because he is crude and uncultured with dubious personal habits- they first meet when she catches him stealing an ornament at a party.<br/><br/>There is plenty of humour in the film, much of it centred upon Ray's sense of self-importance, such as the slapstick sequence about his attempt to make a stage entrance seated on a wooden crescent moon lowered down from above. It is not, however, a pure comedy, but also a character study and a film about the power of music to transform even the most mundane of lives. I am by no means a great jazz buff, but I was enthralled by the beauty of the music in this film (performed by the guitarist Howard Alden). This is one of Woody's most impressive films from the last two decades. 8/10"

","Back in the 1920's and 30's, the fictitious Emmet Ray (Sean Penn) was a superlative guitarist, second only to the great Django Reinhardt. His rise to eventual fame, however, was rocky, due to his gigantic ego and eccentricities. Apart from drinking a bit too much and being a no-show at engagements he was committed to play, Emmet also believed in the love 'em and leave 'em philosophy. But, when Emmet felt the world closing in on him, he just headed off to the nearest dump to shoot rats or went to a railroad yard to watch the locomotives. One day, Emmet and a fellow musician court two ladies on a New Jersey boardwalk. After a flip of a coin, Emmet is saddled with Hattie (Samantha Morton) a mute laundress who can nevertheless hear. She soon becomes smitten with Emmet, so much so that even he can't help but bask in her never ceasing attention. After a gig ends, Emmet and Hattie head to Hollywood so Ray can pursue a career in movie soundtracks. But, over time, Emmet decides to dump Hattie, because as an artist, he can't have any permanent commitments. Eventually, a new woman, writer Blanche (Uma Thurman) enters his life and his career endures more ups and downs. But, has Emmet totally forgotten the sweet Hattie? This is a superlative film, with a great cast, story, and music. Woody Allen wrote this gem, of course, and it is very funny and tragic at the same time. Allen appears in the movie himself, as a commentator on the music of Emmet Ray. Penn, known more for his serious work, is a total delight as the self-centered but engaging guitarist. Just watch him try to land on stage from a giant swinging moon and you will laugh yourself silly. Morton, who garnered an Academy award nomination (as did Penn), has no dialogue but is wonderful and expressive as the sweet, faithful woman done wrong. The rest of the cast, including Thurman, Gretchen Mol, Anthony LaPaglia, and others, is fine, too. The look of the film, a re-creation of the twenties and thirties, sports excellent costumes, scenery, and amenities. Finally, the music is lovely, vibrant, and a pure pleasure to hear. If you have never tried an Allen flick, here is one on which to begin your pursuits. It will strum its way into your heart and soul, between huge peals of laughter."

","Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"" (1999), a fictional biopic about ""the world's second best jazz guitarist,"" Emmet Ray is sweet, funny, dramatic, filled with fantastic music and is simply terrific. ""Sweet and Lowdown"" reminds ""Bullets over Broadway"" (1994), another Allen's period movie set in the nostalgic area of great jazz and gangsters who understood and supported art and the artists, at least to the certain points. Sean Penn gave IMO his best performance as the man as talented as he was egotistic and self-centered. Creating and performing brilliantly the clear, magical, and melancholic guitar compositions, Emmett Ray (Penn) was also busy with kleptomania, a little pimping on the side, dealing with gangsters, shooting rats and watching passing trains as his favorite hobbies, and also drinking, and chasing girls. Young Samantha Morton who was only 21 and ironically never seen any Allen's movie prior to taking a role of Penn's mute girlfriend-laundress, had to do all the acting with her face, eyes, and body language and was she good. The unrequited tender and all-forgiving love has the face, and that's Samantha's face in Woody Allen's bittersweet, comical and poignant Fake documentary about a true talent which was larger than the man who possessed it."
"emdragon","10","1","1","16 April 2008"," For the love of Django
","Well, first off I just want to say that this is my all-time favorite Woody Allen movie. And that is saying something since he has made so many wonderful pictures over a few decades now. But this sweet movie, set in the prohibition age of the 30s, shows off Allen's unique ability to combine real comedy with a sort of expose into the ironic aesthetics of the human psyche and the human heart. Allen narrates throughout this picture, casting Sean Penn, who once again proves to be a really fine actor, and is perfectly placed in this semi-biographical piece where he gets to display his character's overblown egocentric eccentricities while also capturing the cheap emotional insecurities of the orphaned artist. As Emmett Ray, the world's 2nd greatest guitar player, he knows he cannot quite come to grips with his life's obsession, specifically; the gypsy guitarist Django Rheinhart, (and as everyone knows, the world's ""greatest guitar player""). This obsession fascinatingly becomes for Emmett one of ENVY throughout the film, which IS, in itself, an emotional metaphor that ultimately drives Emmett to outlandish behavior. His maniacal drive to assert himself and to prove to himself, somehow, that he is Rheinhard's equal. . . is a sweetly painful joy to watch. (He cannot get it resolved in his head, he cannot quite imagine that his cheap fly-by-night character is not just as ""artistic"" as Django's MUST be!). His performance gets beautifully offset by Samantha Morton, who plays an innocent angelic mute-girl who, alone, can contain Emmett's ego long enough to bring him down to earth, and finally allow him to personalize a bit of his real artistic essence. Her ability to project a wonderful range of emotion while never uttering a sound is remarkable in the movie. Their chemistry is amazing throughout, and the sweetness of it becomes endearing. I cannot quite watch this picture, I think, without a big smile etched on my face, which to me makes it an enduring classic. Allen has done something here that he can never quite find throughout all the rest of his films, and that is to create, with masterful sweetness, a certain expose of the human psyche, and how funny and odd it may become to explore it a bit. The music was also quite wonderful, as usual with Woody Allen's classi films . And most of all I love the way this film leaves me feeling happier each and every time I watch it."

","This is a slight but delightful work. The story is a (fictional) biography of one Emmet Ray, a cad with a passion for watching trains and shooting rats in junk yards and who just happens to be a virtuosic guitarist. Emmet does not lack for talent and ego, but his drinking, philandering, and small-time philanthropizing keep him from capitalizing on his genius. He is obsessed with Django Reinhardt as being perhaps the only guitarist who might be better - Ray has fainted both times he was in the presence of Reinhardt. The story is told as if it were a documentary of a real person with talking heads interspersed with dramatizations. It could be taken as a satire on that style of presentation since the critics being interviewed come across with just a touch of fake sincerity.<br/><br/>The enjoyment comes from the atmospheric and detailed re-creation of the 1930s. The nightclub scenes are a particular highlight. In fact a whole movie of just those kinds of scenes with 1930s jazz bands and singers might have been an improvement to this movie, since that is where this movie really shines.<br/><br/>The filming uses over-saturated colors to good effect, creating a cozy and warm feeling. There is humor, but it is gentle, particularly for Woody Allen.<br/><br/>As usual Allen has assembled a cast of attractive women. Samantha Morton, who plays a mute who turns out to be Ray's true love interest (a fact he realizes too late) is a joy to watch. Her performance recalls the sweet silent movie stars. Sean Penn does well with his playing Ray as somewhat of a train wreck of a man who frustrates all those he encounters, but who never-the-less has endearing qualities. He is transported into another dimension when he plays his guitar and he takes his audiences with him."

Responsible for much, if not all of that charm, are Penn and Morton, who were able to keep me more or less glued to the screen, despite a somewhat directionless plot. I like that Allen didn't assume that he knew enough about Emmet Ray to create a seamless narrative of his life, and instead let the movie deal with what people knew or, in some instances, did not know. There was a wonderful sense of nostalgia as I watched the film that let me into the characters of Emmet and Hatty, which is a really nice place to be in. All the characters are vivid and enjoyable, as they all tend to be when Woody's name is on the script, and this quite detracted from the fact that in 140 minutes, not really a lot happened.

In life, there are people who diligently mask their feelings and motivations, who shield themselves from attempts at examination or explanation, whose pasts remain opaque. Sometimes, the subject is sufficiently important, or the person's life sufficiently interesting, to justify a biography even though meaningful insights into the subject's character are scarce.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown seems to centre on such a subject.  He is Emmet Ray, a 1930s jazz virtuoso whose guitar playing is sublime and whose life is a train wreck.  Named after a little-noted 1944 Benny Goodman vehicle, Sweet and Lowdown presents Ray as a man whose musical genius is offset by character flaws so numerous as to comprise an entire catalogue of inadequacies and pathologies.<br/><br/>Ray may be the ""second-greatest guitarist in the world,"" but he is also a kleptomaniac and a drunk, childishly irresponsible and egocentric.

He is a braggart and a boor and, finally, self-destructive and self-defeating.  A fool with magic fingers.

He doesn't, although the pseudo-documentary style of the picture, complete with ""talking head"" reportage from various ""experts,"" including Allen himself, gave him ample opportunity to do so.<br/><br/>Other than Ray's offhand, post-coitus admission to his lover that his father used to beat him, the viewer is denied any glimpse into whatever may lay beneath the annoying exterior of the man, and therefore denied the pleasure of experiencing the sympathy that comes with understanding.<br/><br/>If there's any reason at all to invest time and money on this film it's to see the performance of Samantha Morton as the mute Hattie, which is every bit as good as they say.  Sean Penn as Ray does an admirable job portraying the kind of out-of-control and slightly berserk character that's his specialty.  Both efforts are ultimately wasted.<br/><br/>There is simply no excuse for creating a vivid, complex character and then declining to offer a clue as to how he got that way.

","So this film isn't ""Stardust Memories""?   Everyone is always so disappointed when Woody doesn't match his finest hour with each film.  Give up the comparisons to ""Manhattan"" people, and enjoy this stuff while Woody is still active.<br/><br/>Sweet and Lowdown is a wonderful film, a sweet story about a cranky artist and the girl who steals his heart.  I fell for it.  I think most people will enjoy this.<br/><br/>I'm convinced that Woody is content to make these types of sentimental films now.  He has nothing to prove to anyone anymore.  That said, I think his 90's output is as consistent  and enjoyable as the earlier decades, though perhaps not as important.  Let's face it, if the man never makes another film, he is still the greatest American director of our time.  Sweet and Lowdown is another little treasure to put on the mantle.  Not his best work, and not his worst.  But it made me feel great for a couple of hours.

","I loved this movie. I think it is one of Woody's best efforts and I am surprised at some of the reviews I have read concerning it.  Great story set in the thirties and Sean Penn is fantastic as the jazz guitarist. Samantha Morton is very effective as Penn's girlfriend and it proves that one doesn't have to talk to be an effective actor.  This movie is hilarious but also very touching and the combination of the two makes for an entertaining hour and a half.  Allen's sense of humor is right on at times and when that happens you get the kind of laughs that are rare, the kind of laugh that turns into a cry. I wish Woody would make more films like this; as far as I am concerned, the guy is still an auteur."

","One of those Woody Allen movies you're already in the process of forgetting before it's over. Sean Penn, with a poof of hair that suggests the David Levine cartoons of Preston Sturges, plays Emmett Ray, the world's second-greatest jazz guitarist (after Django Reinhardt), and an all around louse, egomaniac, idiot, clod, and king of bad taste. Samantha Morton is his lover--a mute laundress--and Uma Thurman is a worldly writer who marries him. The cast is nifty, and Woody Allen lingers on Emmett's guitar lovingly. (This is not, like Robert Altman's KANSAS CITY, a movie for connoisseurs only.) There's nothing unpleasant in the movie; it's just one of those super-extra-minor Woodies, like MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY, that force you to struggle to stay awake."
"allyjack","7","1","1","20 September 1999"," Sweet but minor
","A sweet but minor compendium of fictionalized showbiz chestnuts, with Sean Penn playing a jazz guitarist who - despite drinking and womanizing and general unreliability - enjoys a brief 20's and 30's heyday before fading out of sight. The film keeps a brisk pace, and although Penn's artfully stylized performance could have supported a more probing portrayal, that's not on the agenda: the illustrations of his neurosis are largely played for comedy (of the wistful smile rather than the laugh-out-loud kind). In its zippiness and general inconsequentiality and fake documentary trappings the film sometimes reaches all the way back to Allen's debut, Take The Money And Run. It keeps emphasizing the unreliability of its own portrayal, stressing how the legend may have overtaken the facts, but it doesn't really matter - the film apparently aspires little to art or satire, and achieves its goal of mellow raconteurship."

One of the features of his other movies is multiple characters - variety, witty dialogue.  This movie basically consisted of only one character - very one dimensional.  It had almost no laughs.

What begins as a lovely piece of yesteryear is undone by a maddeningly unmoving story and aloof characters; it builds no emotion.

","A mock documentary, this film needed great work by all involved to come out right. The actors come through as well as they can with the material they have to work with, the directing is satisfactory, and the writing is pretty good for what it is, but the film is crippled through incompleteness. The portrayal of Emmet Ray seems to be truncated, not due to poor acting, but due to the limited scope of the script, and if one were to suppose that the two dimensional portrait was due to character flaw, then this would only highlight the shallowness of the narrative.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Emmet Ray, his wife, and most supporting characters in this film are not quite men and women, but are rather archetypes, wonderful as secondary characters, but incomplete as primary characters. Emmet Ray resembles the cartoon character ""Bender"" in Futurama far more than he resembles a living man. Woody Allen has created a patron saint of artistic selfishness, and Emmet Ray may be a satisfactory alter-ego for the director, but he is not a complete portrait of even the most obnoxious musician, and we are presented with only a burnt out butt of a narrative."

Sean Penn makes the most of the role, with the same sort of intensity that he always brings to his roles. He shows Ray as a rather impolite weirdo whom you can't help but admire - he is a great guitarist. Samantha Morton is equally interesting as Ray's mute love interest Hattie. It just goes to show that Woody Allen can do good work when he doesn't focus on neurotic rich New Yorkers.

","If I maintained a ""bucket list"", near the top of that list one would see ""Cafe Carlyle, Monday night, 8:45"". Perhaps the only thing more consistent in Woody Allen's life than his film production schedule is his clarinet playing. Woody played clarinet in a jazz band for 25 years before the venue closed, but that didn't stop Woody. He now plays where he has played for over a decade at the Carlyle Hotel with Woody Allen & the Eddy Davis New Orleans Jazz Band. A fan of jazz since he was a teenager, which has shown in all of his films, I would love to see Woody Allen play clarinet in person. Perhaps the film in which Woody most clearly illustrates his love for jazz is in his 1999 feature, Sweet and Lowdown. The film brings back to life the 1930's through a guitarist Emmet Ray, who worships a better- known guitarist Django Reinhardt. Sean Penn brings to life the quirky self-sabotaging Ray with an unbelievable jazz soundtrack accompanying the film. In a beautifully raw tale of love and regret, Sweet and Lowdown is an entry of Woody Allen's filmography not to be missed. <br/><br/>Emmet Ray (Sean Penn), the free-spirited, arrogant, alcoholic is also one of the best guitarists of his time. Despite his talent, he is thoroughly obsessed with the French gypsy guitarist, Django Reinhardt. Emmet only allows himself to idolize Django from afar, as he has a morbid fear of actually meeting the musician. Relayed through a mockumentary, a format Woody Allen had previously successfully explored, the audience hears from many people who knew Emmet Ray. It is revealed that Emmet Ray is largely unknown today because he refused to make too many recordings for fear that someone would copy his style. A colorful person with an unknown past has made Emmet an interesting character study. Emmet didn't care for others too much, living life as a womanizer and using prostitutes to fund his lifestyle. A complete eccentric, Emmet Ray was as unreliable in his music career as he was his personal life. Even finding true love wasn't enough to push Emmet beyond himself to deeply care about anyone else. Deciding to keep his focus on him alone, Emmet breaks up with Hattie (Samantha Morton), his one true love because he realizes himself to be incapable of returning the loyalty she gives to him. When he finally realizes his mistake, it is too late to get Hattie back and may be too late for Emmet to truly achieve happiness.<br/><br/>Sweet and Lowdown, set in the heart of the jazz golden age in the 1930's, was filled with incredible period detail, maybe the best in a Woody Allen film up to that time. The film opens in a wonderful way with monologues of those that knew Emmet, making it clear that Woody Allen has dipped into the mockumentary style once again. The mockumentary is a sub-genre Woody Allen executes well, so seeing another from him was a treat. It probably goes without saying, but here I am to waste lines with it anyway, the score in Sweet and Lowdown is pitch perfect. The amazing jazz punctuating the plight of a devoted musician bring the emotion in Sweet and Lowdown to a fever pitch. The color used in Sweet and Lowdown was sensational bringing to life the heavy regret and emotional despair Emmet brought upon himself. Woody Allen perfectly explores someone who self-sabotages their relationships and must live with the regret of pushing away their one true love."
"ElMaruecan82","8","0","0","25 August 2016"," Proof (once again) that no one should take Woody Allen too seriously, as he doesn't himself...
","... and that's the mark of geniuses.<br/><br/>Now seriously, how come I never heard about Emmett Ray? I might not be a 'jazz aficionado', not 'Woody Allen' level anyway, but I humbly believe I would be aware of the existence of the second best guitar-player in the world after Django Reinhart (the film's running-gag). But then again, I gave ""Sweet and Lowdown"", Allen's half-drama half-documentary musical biopic, the benefit of the doubt, after all, if I was familiar with Django yet incapable to tell you the name of one of his titles, it was all the more plausible not to be familiar with the second best.<br/><br/>So, I started the film and I was immediately hooked by Emmett, the character, here's a guy whose eccentricity is displayed before his talent. He's played by Sean Penn using his whiny worn-out voice of the guy who doesn't try to disguise his lack of huskiness, he's got the most original haircut, the most stylish suit, he's a womanizer, even a bit of pimp, and while everyone's waiting for his performance, he's playing pool, having a few drinks and talk with one of his protegees. Call it the 'Amadeus' syndrome but his eccentricity is so flashily displayed that there's no way to believe this guy isn't talented. So he meets the public and starts playing and although I'm no expert, I thought I slightly recognized the first theme he played, which seems to have been borrowed from a very popular French ballad.<br/><br/>That should have given me a hint, but no, as the plot advanced, no matter how weird things got, I didn't see it coming, Emmett was too original not to be real. So I believed the story about the moon, I believed that he met a mute girl and lived perhaps his longest and sweetest romance before getting back to his old habits and dumping her. I believed the love story with the wannabe writer, the marriage, the adultery with a bodyguard and it's not until the final act, that I had enough of bizarreness, I had to check. Because I have a bad habit, before watching a biopic, I like to check the basic details, you know birth year, death, the 'how' and 'why' etc.<br/><br/>I wanted to pause the movie and see when Emmett Ray died, was it in the 30's so I might expect some depression, suicide or assassination or what? So, I google his name and found out he was a fictional character, I couldn't believe it. I didn't even suspect that after ""Zelig"", Woody Allen would strike again in a jazz-related documentary. I swallowed everything, I mean you have Woody Allen talking passionately about his kind of music and many jazz experts debating on the veracity of some details, and come on, the second best guitar player after Django. It's all fake but I guess I'm too stubborn to accept it..<br/><br/>Woody Allen makes a ""Spinal Tap"" like film, and while the jazz player doesn't exist, jazz does, the Great Depression did, these kinds of people too, and these fans of jazz, you better believe they're tangible. So why not exploring the heritage of jazz and reinvent a world that would feel like a kaleidoscope of the environment that made a music like jazz the only possible enjoyable one. By choosing a fictional character, Allen allowed him to be grander and more original and appealing more than any real jazz-man. Emmett Ray knows how to get women but not to keep them, he has no social skills, no sense of commitment or of money but his talent is all he's got and when he doesn't play his guitar, he's regressing. This is how music is important to him. It's all about the music.<br/><br/>And it's also very fitting that the girl he loved was mute but not deaf, she has an access to his talent, she knows what she loves in him and she allows him to be natural but she can't step on his territory, he has a freedom of total expression, and leaves her when his heart is being progressively tamed. He's an artist, so wrapped up in his conviction to be an artist that he can't afford to live a normal life. It's like the musician inspiring Allen and Allen inspiring the musician, a sort of Jekyll and Hyde duality. And both Sean Penn and Samantha Morton are excellent in their respective performances showcasing the natural harmony between the zany yin of a lunatic doofus and the quiet and benevolent yang of a patient understanding women. We love Emmett through Hattie and despite Emmett. And because such a sweet gal like Hattie loved him, we give him the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>The second relationship should have told me something wasn't right, Uma Thurman played Blanche, the writer whose goal is to write about men with fascinating occupations, and she's so different from Hattie that Emmett keeps her like an obvious trophy-wife and if there's ever one thing Emmett cherishes more than his guitar, it's his ego, so it's all come naturally until she finally cheats on him looking for a wilder escapism with one of Emeett's boss bodyguards. I guess Allen went overboard at the end so that the only idiots who didn't know it was fictional could finally realize they were played with but this part had the merit to have a funny punch-line, one that couldn't do without a cameo of Django Reinhart.<br/><br/>Emmett then vanishes after a few hit records, and there's nothing left about him, but who knows maybe there were many Emmett-likes who wanted to be the next Django, we can't be sure that such a larger-than-life never existed and Woody Allen's false tribute to a fictional jazz player becomes the magnificent tribute of a real art."

","The old cliché of a person being great artist but a terrible human being is certainly true for Sean Penn's fictional Emmet Ray, self-dubbed the second best guitarist in the world. Why he attracts the attention of more than one female is beyond me; Thurman's Blanche is drawn to that rough, unhemmed quality about him like writers are drawn to trouble subjects because they make for great stories. And Allen too has made this little misstep - there is nigh a thing redeemable about Ray but for his soulful jazz guitar, which must be exactly what Allen finds himself so eager to capture. The framing device is an unnecessary one, too clever for its own right; Allen and other jazz alumni are filmed as talking heads recounting the great life of Emmet Ray with a wistfulness for his mastery...there is a subjectivity quality to their stories of course, but this seems like an artificial method of further mystifying the great enigma that was Ray. <br/><br/>A pity then that Allen's script is as relatively straightforward as it is. He did not often delve as dark and deep as Interiors did, and here even the most emotionally dramatic scenes are smothered by the incessant cheery jazz as the backing track to Ray's life. No woman would ever be secondary to his music, and it rings so true. Not even such an innocent, demure maiden like Hattie, as Samantha Morton in one of the performances of her time. She winds back the clock to the times of pantomime and silent film, and in each wide, uncontrollably smile, and each smothered tear, has brought us such a defined and memorable character without saying a word. Allen almost never has to bring the camera closer; her body language works furiously in place of her mouth, whether it is enthusiastically replacing a flat tire for the prize of hearing one more tune from Ray, or the way her adorable chews indicate her satisfaction, and in perhaps the best scene of the film, the way she wordlessly convinces Ray to let her accompany him on his trip. Her eyes water, and her entire face crumples up, and Penn rambles and rambles...and relents, even his emotional defense broken down.<br/><br/>In a similar scene he does the same thing and humorously forbids Hattie from giving him a birthday present, before eagerly allowing it once he sees that it is something he desires. This is one of his many vices of course - a sort of contradictive possessiveness and consumerist hunger for objects that don't contribute to his music at all, but which he wants nevertheless. His ego has convinced him that he wants these things, and that no woman would ever want to leave him, and that his musical performance is beyond reproach. Allen, naturally, adds a comic layer to this furiousness and decadence - see how Penn dangles from the model moon and awkwardly untangle himself and let the music come to his fingers. And then a smash cut to later where he is literally smashing and burning the offender. How dare it intrude on his performance. But most of all the character is destructive, and Allen has somewhat obscured this fact. Django Reinhardt emerges as this huge, imposing figure within the film, dogging each of Ray's steps, even as he is never physically seen. How would Django react to seeing the great Emmet Ray? Surely he would not faint. Would he even recognise him? As Allen's faux-documentary style intends, perhaps not."

","Review: I really enjoyed this movie. Sean Penn really put in a brilliant performance along with the other actors who contributed into making this movie a great watch. Throughout the movie you see people telling there own stories about the talented Emmet Ray, including Woody Allen who had wrote and directed this movie extremely well. I hadn't heard of this talented guitarist before watching this film so I found this movie interesting and enjoyable. In the film, Emmet Ray was a completely different person when he was playing his guitar to when he was womanising and breaking hearts. Mixed with his outrageous spending habits and his addiction to stealing, there is enough drama throughout the movie to keep you entertained. The main shocking aspect to the film has to be Sean Penn's guitar playing. Woody Allen made a point of showing the audience that it was actually Sean Penn playing the guitar so I have to tip my hat to Penn for learning such a difficult, unique way of playing the instrument. Anyway, if you know of Emmet Ray then its definitely worth a watch and its also worth watching just for entertainment. Watchable!  <br/><br/>Round-Up: Emmet Ray really did have a weird and wonderful life. From dating a mute, falling into a house with loads of cash and marrying a lady who he didn't really know, he really lived each day as it comes. His random unpredictable lifestyle made everyone around him wonder if he would have been a better guitarist if he got his life together, but he never thought that he had a problem. He was a very cocky individual that had his head in the stars, which is why the concept for the film was so good. Sean Penn really did play his role well along with Samantha Morton who played the mute convincingly. The only thing is that you don't really know what truly happened in some of the scenes because his life was documented. People throughout the movie are using hearsay more than evidence about the mans life, which is made obvious when you hear there stories about the man. Anyway, enough said, watch the film.<br/><br/>Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $4.2million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies which follows events in Emmet Rays life, who was a talented guitarist with personal issues. 7/10"

Were it not for his fingers which play jazz music beautiful enough to make angels weep he would probably be a bum living in an alley.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's 1930s comedy 'Sweet and Lowdown' is a character study about a character whose music is sweet but whose personality is as pleasant as bad cheese. He is legendary as 'The Second Greatest Jazz Guitarist in the World'. However his idea of a date is to take a woman to the tracks to watch the trains or down to the garbage dump to shoot rats.<br/><br/>He meets a mute woman named Hattie (Samantha Morton) who is just exactly the kind of woman he likes: mute and waiting on him and foot. Like most things in his life he doesn't know what a gift he has and can't forgive himself when he gives it up.<br/><br/>Morton has the tougher role, she has to convince us that she really loves this worthless lug but has to do it without spoken word. Her face is sweet, expressive and we almost always know what she is thinking.<br/><br/>Emmett has one pall over his life. He has a phobia about meeting Django Reinhart, legendary for being 'The Greatest Jazz Guitarist in the World'. Emmett does eventually run into Reinhart providing one of the movie's funniest moments.<br/><br/>Emmett would be almost impossible to take in this film were he not played by Sean Penn. Penn is a brilliant actor who knows how to disappear into a role and make us care about the character. Here he has the tough task of making us care about someone who is a complete jerk. He makes Emmett Ray into a lovable guy even when we know we aren't suppose to like him.<br/><br/>That is also based on the strength of Woody Allen's writing. He has written a fiction chapter of jazz history about a man out of touch with everything but his music."

","In the core of this movie is the fictive character of Emmet Ray who says of himself that he is the 2nd best guitarist in the world right after Django Reinhardt (who actually lived). The movie tackles some other subjects but focuses on Emmet and his problems. It works quite well because Sean Penn gives a terrific performance. The movie also portrays the 30's quite well and it got some good cinematography (like most of Woody's movies).<br/><br/>Woody pays homage to Bergman's The Passion of Anna with the interviews he uses to narrate some of the story and express some thoughts from another point of view. The interviews are a very minor part of the movie, but a fun (and unique) little element. The movie is also a homage to Fellini's La Strada. The 2 main characters in Sweet and Lowdown resemble the two main characters in La Strada so if you enjoyed Sweet and Lowdown you might find these two movies interesting (it probably also works the other way around).<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet here's my conclusion: It's not a masterpiece (far from), but it's a good movie that should especially be a treat for musicians, other artists and Allen or Penn fans. If you like character drama and don't mind the comedic touch this is a movie for you. If you're not that interested in character dramas you won't hate it but it's not a movie I would highly recommend to you."

Under the direction of Woody Allen, Sean Penn gives life to Emmet Ray, supposed to be the best guitar player of his time, around the 30's. Emmet lives haunted by one Django, who he believes to be way better than himself, fainting every time he makes visual contact with him. Travelling around the states for money, he eventually meets Hattie (Samantha Morton), a mute girl somewhere around his age, very simple but also quite dumb girl. A not quite mutual relationship begins but only took a couple years for Hattie to wake up with a letter on the bedside table. Emmet had gone. Living like an artist, another woman gets his attention, this time she ain't mute but isn't very smart, still. Blanche (Uma Thurman), has this habit of writing everything that comes to her mind and annoys Emmet for talking too much. Emmet ends up marrying her anyway. I interpreted his marriage to be some sort of regret for leaving Hattie, later in the movie you may understand why. As you see the story ain't the most interesting. The interviews that putted in between scenes don't work out well. Sean Penn is good and Samantha Mortonwas very cool. The music is also very cool. Woody Allen could have surely done it better. 6/10"

","Classic director Woody Allen has done some great movies. Such as Match point, Hannah and her sisters, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and Mighty Aphrodite. One of my top 3 favorites of his is the underrated Sweet and lowdown, and funnier and sweeter Allen film.<br/><br/>Sean Penn gives a in-depth, funny performance as Emmett Ray, a fictional character. Emmett Ray is a jazz player. He's rude, mean, delusional, and kind of crazy. And likes to kill rats. And is a playboy. The film is basically a mocumentary about Emmett's triumphs, and his relationships. His relationships with Hattie(the adorable Oscar-nominee Samantha Morton), a mute laundress, and Blanche(Uma Thurman), who he gets bored with easily.<br/><br/>I think that the main reason the film works is the two main characters. Emmett is obviously a jerk, but he's so funny. And Hattie doesn't say a word throughout the whole film, but she's such a lovable and memorable character, you want her to be happy.<br/><br/>Emmett Ray is a man of mystery. Though he's a jerk, you love him. Morton and Penn really bring Sweet and lowdown it's life. Sweet and lowdown is funny, extremely entertaining, and charming. It's a different kind of Woody Allen film. It focuses on music, which I like. I think the film is perfect. The ending is too. This is an underrated, Woody Allen masterpiece.<br/><br/>A"

","This is certainly one of Woody Allen's best films. It is so ingenious and creative in every aspect that it is a triumph. The invention by Allen of the fictitious Emmet Ray is truly a stroke of genius. Sean Penn's performance as Emmet Ray is also one of his best, coming just before one of his other best, in the next film which he made, 'Up at the Villa'. Penn is a brilliant actor who is probably tops when he is being 'low life'. But in this film he shows an unexpected talent for whimsical comedy as well. He also clearly plays the guitar for real. What a treat it all is. The film is thoroughly delightful from beginning to end. Samantha Morton is marvellous as the mute girl Hattie, heart-rending in her silent simplicity with her angelic smile. Uma Thurman does one of her magnificent wild impersonations, being one of those awful intellectual vamps who want to know what goes through a killer's mind when he pulls the trigger to 'rub somebody out' (no, that's not Sean Penn: he merely shoots rats). Uma Thurman clearly had a lot of fun, and was allowed to go over the top sometimes, but then, why not? After all, this is a satire. But it is sad as well as funny, and poignant in its insights into a man who is psychologically stunted and emotionally handicapped, while being a musical genius. The ending is truly tragic. In this film, Allen's love of jazz, profound interest in human character, and effervescent humour and whimsy come to the boil all at the same time. He must have a charmed egg-timer or an enchanted stop-watch. Or maybe it's both? Let no one say he is uncoordinated ever again. He has everything working at once in perfect synch. Toscanini couldn't control that many things at once. Let's face it, Woody Allen, apart from all his other attributes, is one hell of a pro."
"jzappa","8","0","0","9 April 2007"," Allen Directing Penn? Hm!
","Sean Penn delivers one of his finest performances here as Emmett Ray, who was, or is at least portrayed as, the epitome of the self-centered artist. His art, in this case the guitar, is the one thing the cares about before anything or anyone else. He preserves himself because of the art he lives for. The women who are unfortunate enough to be taken by him are objectified, as he makes it ungracefully and perfectly clear to them that it's their responsibility to change, move, and provide help for him and not at all the other way around. He has a much-talked-about but never-admitted feeling of inferiority to another guitarist, who is quite famous and known as the greatest guitar player in the world, whom Ray fainted in front of both times he saw him perform. The motif of the film is how he absolutely never lets any of his feelings go expressed, keeping them all sealed tightly inside of him, for if he let himself care about anybody else, there goes the thoroughly focused passion that drives his art. The outstanding element of Penn's wonderfully intriguing performance is how he expresses unexpressed emotions and keeps a sympathy and lack of judgment consist in the audience towards such a brutally selfish person.<br/><br/>I was not at all interested in the subject matter of this film before I saw it. I only wanted to see it because I am going through a big Woody Allen phase. Woody Allen, one of the finest writers and filmmakers in the world, has a way of writing and directing dialogue so that no matter what off-the-wall one-liner is delivered, everyone sounds so real that you naturally grow to care for them and become very involved and interested in what will happen to them. We care about what horrible thing one character does to another, yet we care about both of them.<br/><br/>One of the film's highlights is Samantha Morton, who some time ago stood out in The Libertine, perhaps further out that even Johnny Depp did. She plays a mute girl that loves Emmett Ray unconditionally, and her performance is full of bright-eyed, nearly tearjerking selflessness.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman, as always alluring, and Anthony LaPaglia, playing the sort of role one could immediately see him in in reality, arouse anger for us, mostly for the inexplicable care we have for Penn. Sweet and Lowdown is a quick and entertaining detour by a filmmaker who constantly impresses me."

","Not a typical Woody Allen film, as you can see from a cast headed by SEAN PENN, SAMANTHA MORTON and UMA THURMAN.<br/><br/>Penn is a little known jazz musician from the '30s era so there's a lot of jazz guitar music on the soundtrack. Obviously it's a story close to Woody's heart. Penn plays the most down on his luck musician since Kirk Douglas in YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN.<br/><br/>One of the film's best lines: ""A pimp doesn't need business cards."" Yes, Penn's associations are on the tawdry side but he looks to be getting full enjoyment out of his colorful role. He plays a real loser whose dreams always blow up in smoke. It's a juicy role for Penn since most of the dialog belongs to his character--when girlfriend SAMANTHA MORTON turns out to be a mute. She spends most of the time munching on food while she watches him with a baleful eye. But the tender scenes between Penn and Morton make the whole story worthwhile.<br/><br/>During one of his kleptomaniac moments he meets UMA THURMAN whom he subsequently marries. Uma is her usual seductive self. But I'm giving away too much plot. Suffice it to say, it's an enjoyable Allen film and much of the charm comes from the authentic look to the '30s era and the jazz background.<br/><br/>Summing up: Endearingly funny, except for a downbeat, bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Try it, you'll like it."

","The guitar is the subtlest of instruments,capable - in the right hands - of expressing nuances so fragile that they appear to fade into nothingness almost as soon as they are heard.Sublety is a formidable weapon in the jazz guitarist's arsenal,and Howard Alden,who plays the guitar on the soundtrack of ""Sweet and Lowdown"" is a master of the ""Chord Melody"" style and a man with the touch of a gentle yet ardent lover.When he plays ""I'm forever blowing bubbles"" as a solo a la Eddie Lang you are hearing sublime artistry.Could a person capable of making music of such beauty be a lying cheating thieving son of a bitch? Well,yes,actually,if that man is Emmett Ray(Sean Penn) in Woody Allen's examination of the nature of genius. One minute stunning a noisy nightclub crowd into silence with a breath- taking version of ""Parlez - moi d'amour"",the next urging his girl-friend ""Let's go to the dump and shoot some rats"",Mr Ray is not an easy read. Jazz lovers are particularly prone to looking at their heroes through rose - coloured glasses,a trait Mr Allen has a gentle dig at despite quite possibly possessing it himself.As a jazz lover no doubt he worshipped many a musician and probably more than a few failed to live up to his fantasies. They were still brilliant artists but flawed human beings .Emmett Ray is no Mozart,but ""Sweet and Lowdown"" is Woody Allen's ""Amadeus""."

","Although the names Woody Allen and Sean Penn might make you stop reading right here, let's just start by saying it's not that kind of movie. Sweet and Lowdown is a modestly directed, well scripted and acted fictional bio-pic focusing on the life of Emmet Ray (Penn), a classical jazz guitarist. The movie takes place in the 1930's or so, when Ray is said to have been his prime. As he moves from town to town, leaving scores of women and obscene debts in his wake, Ray plays his heart out for the eastern seaboard's wealthy and elite. When he's not playing music at the big clubs, Emmet finds his way to darker corners, where he can gamble and pick the night away. In his spare time, Emmet enjoys the odd hobbies of watching trains and shooting rats. Though Ray is most likely the best guitarist in the United States, he is a distant second in the world, behind Django Reinhardt. Somewhere along the way, Emmet meets Hattie, a beautiful mute who falls desperately in love with him. Without a clue in the world, they venture forth unknowingly toward the great gig in the sky.<br/><br/>Though you may hate either or both of the stars of this movie, you still may want to give Sweet and Lowdown a chance. Because of the nature of the film, Sean Penn's political beliefs are held in check, as well as Woody Allen's almost incessant whining. Allen has almost zero screen time, which keeps him from irritating the viewer. And Emmet Ray is described as ""a self-centered, egotistical creep with talent"" which makes this role not much of a stretch for Penn. The highlight of the movie, though, is a breakthrough performance by Samantha Morton--who recently played Agatha, the pre-cog in Minority Report. As Hattie, Emmet Ray's mute love interest, Morton earned herself an Oscar Nomination for playing the heart and soul of a man whose conscience was long destroyed. Though she has been recognized in her native England for playing only the most challenging roles, Samantha Morton has yet to break out in the United States, if that is even her goal. Either way, this is one of her best roles to date, if only for her infectious cuteness. With darling expressions that give us more of an insight into Hattie's character than most actresses can achieve with lines, Morton is the clear winner here.<br/><br/>In summary, Sweet and Lowdown gives us only the best angle of three very talented, often misguided artists. If you're in for a quiet night at home, snuggling with someone special (or just snuggling a glass of port), this movie is a good bet."

","Sweet and Lowdown directed by Woody Allen, Starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton, Uma Thurman, Anthony LaPaglia, Gretchen Mol Woody Allen's biopic about a jazz musician who never really existed named Emmet Ray is a bit different from his usual. The film is not as funny as your typical woody flick, although it makes up for it with some good drama and good acting. The film lacked great plot, but was told in an original style as ""mock documentary"". I thought Penn's acting was first-rate, definitely one of his better performances although he seldom disappoints me. Samantha Morton was good as well, and it was nice to see Uma Thurman, Gretchen Mol and Anthony LaPaglia in small roles.

","I wouldn't read too much into the ""ted G"" ""sweet"" review placing so much emphasis on the movie as an autobiography. Woody does instill much personal resonance into his films, but its to his credit as a storyteller that he concocts such a gem in the standard misfit as our hero genre of film, an approach that seldom garners critics approval. The film is a beautiful celebration of the individual spirit; one whose rich storytelling belies an artistic spirit without compromise, unafraid to pursue an iconoclastic narrative of self-deprecating humour. The film can also be commended for revitalizing the music of legendary Django Reinhardt, and that particular era of swing jazz in general, rounding out, in vein of allen's earlier ""broadway danny rose"", the story of the consummate, uncompromising 100% artist.

One day Emmet meets a mute woman named Hattie, who falls in love with him. The rest of the film shows Emmet's jazz career going up and down and his love for other women besides Hattie.

It wasn't a bad film and it was well acted and well made but there wasn't an awful lot to it. Not too much goes on in this movie and it doesn't really give the characters a chance to be as interesting as they could be. Also coming from Woody Allen, I didn't find the film funny at all.

","****MINOR SPOILER****<br/><br/>Jazz is not one of my favourite genres of music. In fact I have never taken any interest in it before, and even after watching this film, which involves jazz as it's main theme, I still don't hold any interest. However, I did enjoy the film immensely.<br/><br/>Sean Penn plays the fictional Emmet Ray, a character created by Woody Allen. The character is a product of several real-life jazz musicians, which have been merged to form Ray. It is shot with interviews by Allen and others describing Emmet's life. It is quite convincing, and the first time that I watched the film I truly thought that Emmet Ray was a real-life character.<br/><br/>Sean Penn is excellent as Emmet Ray, an arrogant, cocky character, who says he only has one love- his art. He says that he is the greatest jazz musician in the world, apart from his idol Django Reinhardt. He is a womanizer, but he doesn't, or can't get close to any woman. But eventually he meets a mute laundress called Hattie. She is the only woman that holds his interest, but, every time she indicates that she wants more, Emmet backs off and tells her that he can't get further involved.<br/><br/>Sean Penn had never played the guitar before doing so in this film, so he had to learn how to play up to thirty jazz songs. Samantha Morton plays Hattie, and lends a sweet performance to the role. She has to show a lot of her emotions with her body language and her eyes due to her lack of speech. You sometimes dislike Emmet's treatment of her, but it is almost like he has a self defence mechanism to prevent him getting too close.<br/><br/>The film is often humorous in parts; Sean Penn's performance is comical at times, and even his arrogance comes across as funny. The film shows the real emotions of Emmet Ray at the end, when he realizes what he has lost. It shows that sometimes people can put on harsh fronts to hide their true feelings.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman also puts in a good turn as a writer who shows an avid interest in Ray.<br/><br/>Even If you don't like jazz, don't let this deter you from watching the film. There's more to it then just jazz. It has humour, and drama, and is quite emotional at times."

The performances are excellent, especially those by Penn and Samantha Morton, who was nominated for (and should have won) the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<br/><br/>This is certainly not Woody Allen's best film.

And Ray himself, his only redeeming quality that of playing guitar, is wonderfully portrayed by Mr. Penn. Not a story as much as a character study, we follow Ray on his self-destructive, delusional path through the juke joints and jazz clubs of 1930s America.

","Throughout history, especially when the world was a much bigger place, before the time that whenever a `celebrity' sneezed it was front page tabloid news, how many truly great artists-- those of genius, even-- went unknown, unheralded and unrecognized to the end?  Perhaps there was another Monet in our midst who, for whatever reason, was never noticed; who can say with any certainty there was not, or is not?  It's a consideration writer/director Woody Allen examines in his often humorous, and more often poignant, `Sweet and Lowdown,' starring Sean Penn and Samantha Morton.  In it, Allen chronicles the life of the fictitious Emmet Ray (Penn), who just may have been the second greatest guitar player in the world during the 30s.<br/><br/>	Allen employs the effective (in his hands) storytelling device of `interviews' with those who knew Ray in one capacity or another, to fill in the gaps as he attempts to draw a picture of this talented genius, about whom very little is really known.  Only a handful of recordings-- made during the final years-- remain of who and what Ray is, or was.  The portrait that comes into focus is that of a man, who though gifted as a musician, had a bit more trouble when it came to living his day to day life. Self-centered, irresponsible and taken to drink, he was something of a lowdown character.  Then, one day in Atlantic City, Ray meets a sweet, young girl, Hattie (Morton), and they begin a relationship of sorts.  The problem is, Ray is a self professed free spirit, an artist, who goes where he wants and does what he wants.  Not exactly conducive to a sold relationship.  But inbetween, there's the music; and, as Ray himself will tell anyone who will listen, he's the best guitar player in the world, with the possible exception of this `gypsy in France, `-- Django Reinhardt.  And so, for your consideration, this is Emmet Ray-- the story of the man, and the woman who loved him.<br/><br/>	Told in his inimitable, signature style, Allen presents his fiction in humanistic terms that bring Emmet Ray and his times to life in transporting fashion.  He successfully captures the essence and ambience of the era, just as he did with `Radio Days,' in 1987.  This time period-- circa 1930-- is something of Allen's forte, in fact.  Few contemporary directors in even fewer films have managed to depict it so vividly and believably as Allen has here.  Through Ray, he takes you into the life itself, behind the scenes, as it were, and gives you a real sense of what these times were all about. And, in conjunction with the interviews that lead to the flash-backs, it makes Ray seem as real as any figure in history you'd come to know through the respective media of film or print.  The story is engaging and devoid of pretense, and Allen tempers his own ego and presents it in a way that makes this one, arguably, one of his best films.<br/><br/>	Penn, who should have won an Oscar for his work in `Dead Man Walking,' received a Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of Emmet Ray, and deservedly so, though he was edged out by Kevin Spacey, who received the award for `American Beauty' that year (Russell Crowe was also in the running for `The Insider'-- quite a year!).  There were no losers that year, however (as they say), as-- the award business aside-- Penn's performance is one of the most affecting of his career.  The Ray he presents is a total, well-rounded and three-dimensional character.  Watching him is like seeing the history of someone unfold before your eyes; not an actor, but a very real person, complete with every detail and flaw of his day to day existence.  It's terrific work that, with Allen's guidance, immerses you totally in the story and in Ray's life.<br/><br/>	As Hattie, Samantha Morton is like the second coming of Giulietta Masina; like Fellini's wife and star, she is wonderfully expressive and able to convey so much with a movement of her eyes or just a glance, so reminiscent of Masina's Gelsomina in `La Strada.'  And though outwardly Hattie is fairly reserved, Morton leaves no doubt that within her there is need and desire, but with little expectation.  This is a young woman who is vulnerable and has known pain; someone with whom you readily empathize. When she hooks up with Ray, it quickly becomes a matter of concern, because you care for Hattie, and from the outset you realize that this relationship is going to be fragile, at best.  It's an inspired performance that landed Morton a nomination for Best Supporting Actress-- and she certainly deserved it (ultimately, it went to Angelina Jolie for `Girl, Interrupted').<br/><br/>	Uma Thurman turns in a memorable performance, as well, as Blanche, a writer who crosses paths with Ray and has a significant impact on his life. Thurman makes Blanche credible, and she looks amazing, too.  The `'30s' look suits her extremely well, and cinematographer Zhao Fei (who did a magnificent job with this entire film) captures her best angles and achieves what just may be the best presentation of Thurman in any film yet.  It's a supporting, but pivotal role, and Thurman does it quite well.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Anthony LaPaglia (Al Torrio), Dan Moran (Boss), Brian Markinson (Bill Shields), Tony Darrow (Ben), Gretchen Mol (Ellie), John Waters (Mr. Haynes), Brad Garrett (Joe Bedloe), Carolyn Saxon (Phyliss) and Molly Price (Ann).  When Woody Allen is `on,' his films are insightful and entertaining, and while subtle, are vibrantly alive.  All of which is the case with `Sweet and Lowdown,' in which he demonstrates-- his own personal neuroses notwithstanding-- his grasp and understanding of human nature-- what it is that underneath it all really makes people tick.  He's no Ingmar Bergman, but at his best, he's at least a reasonable facsimile. And this IS on of his best.  It's the magic of the movies.  9/10."

","This film is a mixture of fake documentary, in the style of Zelig, and straightforward narrative. It presents a very beautiful evocation of the 1930's jazz scene. As with many of Woody Allen's movies I found myself missing the brilliant dialogue because I was listening to the wonderful music. The guitar on the soundtrack is played by Howard Alden who manages to sound reminiscent of Django Reinhardt without slavishly copying him. Sean Penn gives a very amusing performance and is quite convincing in the many scenes where he has to play the guitar. It occurs to me that many younger people watching this film may never have heard of Django Reinhardt and may be slightly bemused by a story about someone who is so obsessed by him.<br/><br/>
Woody Allen sometimes underwrites the supporting characters in his screenplays. In this film he has taken this tendency to the extreme by giving Samantha Morton no lines at all as the mute Hattie. She looks like Giulietta Masina in La Strada but she cannot tell a story with her face in the way that Masina could and mainly restricts herself to a cute smile. This is perhaps Allen's fault. He may deliberately have restricted Morton's role to looking winsome during Penn's tremendous displays of vocal pyrotechnics."

","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. Woody Allen wanted to make a movie about his passion: jazz. He used his early techniques (interviews, playing different versions of a scene) and made something completely new with them: a biography. But Woody wouldn't be Woody, if the biography wasn't a complete lie. And he wouldn't be Woody, if the fact that the biography is a complete lie was not the main point of his movie.<br/><br/>Emmet Ray, the second best jazz-guitar player in the world` doesn't exist and so his life, his character and his bizarre ideas lose a lot of their fascination. The cruel thing is that people who haven't read the critics or the comments on the movie, will believe every minute of the first part and then, when Allen's sadistic soul gets the better of him, they will realize that they have been fooled. I'm sure that this was Woody Allen's intention. Once Emmet Ray's made-up biography loses footing on the ice, Allen distracts the viewer's interest from him and begins to play with the possibilities of an author.<br/><br/>The reason why the acting performances are so great, is that Allen instructs the actors, as if they were important. They are supposed to be real and to live in their roles, no matter how crazy and irreal the story becomes. The movie is the sadist's in the first place, but it's also about what it is about: jazz. We may not forget that, and we may not forget how fine Allen's casting is again: Sean Penn, Samantha Morton: brilliant!<br/><br/>Sweet and Lowdown` came exactly at the right time. Woody Allen is a mature director now and so he can finally use the playful methods of his first period much better. At that time, the movies seemed somewhat immature; Sweet and Lowdown` doesn't, although it is as little serious as, for instance Take the Money and Run`. Sweet and Lowdown` is surely not Woody Allen's most important film, but one of his funniest and one of his very best."

","Sweet and Lowdown is rather minor Woody, much in the vein of Broadway Danny Rose and Radio Days, but still a fascinating and hilarious jazz history piece.  The film is like the Ken Burns Jazz documentary, except the stories are played out between narration -- where different versions of legends exist, we see them all.  <br/><br/>Emmett Ray was a typically tortured-soul jazz phenom in the swing age, ""the best guitar player in the world, except for some gypsy in France,"" Django Reinhardt, who ""haunted"" him.  Legend has it that whenever he saw Django, Ray would either faint or cry.  <br/><br/>Ray's escapades are hilarious and tragic.  Pimp -- er, ""manager"" -- kleptomaniac, drunk, and genius on the guitar, he loses jobs, marries impetuously, and squanders money.  He likes to go down to the railyards and watch the trains -- on dates!  ""Hey, let's go down to the dump and shoot some rats!""  Every girl's dream date.  His wife marvels at his ""genuine crudeness.""  <br/><br/>Perhaps the most intriguing part of the Emmett Ray saga is that it is so cryptic.  Little is known about him, and no one knows what became of him in the end.  As Woody says in conclusion, fortunately he made several recordings before fading away (or maybe going to Europe?) that preserved his tremendous playing, which in the end was every bit as good as Django Reinhardt's."
"jerrybor","10","0","0","6 May 2001"," Woody Allen revisits his familiar themes, via ""La Strada"".
","With ""Sweet and Lowdown"", Woody Allen revisits his familiar themes and interests: amorality of the artist; the flawed and lost protagonist; pre-1950's music (in this case, 30's jazz), and love once found, rejected and lost.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Allen hangs his themes on a reworked vision of ""La Strada"", Federico Fellini's 1954 masterpiece. Allen has created a reverse image of Fellini's classic. Whereas ""La Strada"" is uncompromisingly bleak, ""Sweet and Lowdown"" is light, breezy, and comedic. Allen's tale revolves around the male lead, Emmitt Ray (Sean Penn), a caddish jazz guitarist. Fellini's story is more involved with it's female lead, Gelsomina, a simple-minded innocent. (Ray's counterpart in ""La Strada"" is the brutish strongman, Zampano, played by Anthony Quinn). Allen most closely follows Fellini in creating Hattie, a mute who is, like Gelsomina, an innocent. Hattie (Samantha Morton) is the mirror image of Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina), right down to her similarly broad facial expressions. Woody even throws in an ""in the know"" joke: because Gelsomina is often food deprived in Fellini's film (in fact, does she ever eat?), Allen has Hattie stuffing her face constantly. Both characters, in each film, draw out our sympathies (Gelsomina more profoundly, however). Each film presents too the sadness of the too late realization that true love once granted and held, can be lost.<br/><br/>The gravity of love lost, the remarkable and poignant portrayals by Sean Penn and Samantha Morton, and the wonderful music throughout, elevate ""Sweet and Lowdown"" in Allen's canon, making it  more substantial than  has generally been acknowledged."

"rupie","7","0","0","23 March 2001"," nice effort from Woody
","[possible spoiler] Woody's movies have certainly been uneven of late but I would rate this as one of his better recent efforts. His love of the jazz of the 20's and 30's is clearly evident in this film; it is as much at the center of ""Sweet and Lowdown"" as Manhattan was in ""Manhattan"". The fictional Emmett Ray is one of those frustrating characters you want to like but whose egregious behavior keeps you at arm's distance. Like so many great creative personalities (Allen himself, e.g.) his great artistic gifts seem counterbalanced by character flaws that destroy his relationships with people. In the end we - I, at least - cannot help sympathizing with the driven Ray as he realizes he has destroyed his chances for happiness with the one woman who could accept and love him for what he is. The scene where, returning to Hattie, she tells him she is now married put me in mind of the scene at the end of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" where Hally (Mia Farrow) tells Cliff (Allen) that she is engaged to the repulsive Lester (Alan Alda); the heartbreak on the part of the losing men is silently and powerfully communicated. The film is beautifully shot and - as has been remarked - the period flavor is superb. The faux-documentary style - reminiscent of ""Zelig"" and ""broadway Danny Rose"" - works here to unify the episodic story. Sean Penn is very effective in this atypical role. For my money not as good as ""Mighty Aphrodite"" but far better than ""Bullets over Broadway"" and ""Manhattan Murder Mystery""."

","Some stories are about nice guys without an ounce of talent.  `Sweet and Lowdown' is about a jerk with lots of talent, the fictional Emmet Ray (Sean Penn in an Oscar-nominated performance), the second best jazz guitarist in the world during the 1930s.<br/><br/>Another character in the film describes Ray perfectly:  `Not only are you vain and egotistical, but you have genuine crudeness.'  Ray is obsessed and intimated by the world's greatest guitarist, Django Reinhardt.  The thing is, whenever Ray's path crosses with Django's Emmet faints.<br/><br/>`Sweet and Lowdown' gives Allen an opportunity to display his love for jazz, and the film is similar to `Broadway Danny Rose' in that it is told in anecdotes by jazz experts and fans (the final anecdote is told in three different ways, although it's tellers indicate that they're not sure that they're relating anything more than a myth).<br/><br/>Allen boldly makes the Ray one of his least likeable characters.  Ray has the possibility of a meaningful relationship with a mute (Samantha Morton in another Oscar-nominated performance), but he dumps her when the idea of commitment creeps into their conversation.  <br/><br/>The only false note about the film is that it makes the the case that  Ray is passionate about is his music, but he looks anything but passionate when he plays--mellow would be a better description. <br/><br/>This is a good film, but not in the class with some of Allen's classics such as `Annie Hall' and `Hannah and Her Sisters.'"

I thought Sean Penn's performance along the other actress who plays the mute girl were among the best I have seen in an Allen film.

"jewdy69","8","0","0","4 December 2000"," excellence in simplicity
","Sweet and Lowdown, while perhaps not as vital or uproariously funny as we may expect from Woody Allen, still excellently does what it sets out to do. It is a simple comedy that romanticizes the jazz age and deals with the comic elements of a truly eccentric artist whose life story is told merely through fragments of rumors and gossip.\ First of all, as the Academy recognized, Sean Penn is outstanding.  His portrayal of the ficticious Emmit Ray is both comical and emotionally potent.  Samantha Morton does a wonderful job of both being cute and being taken seriously.  There is no question that they deserved their nominations, not to mention they would have been fine choices to receive the Oscars themselves.  But more than that, Allen himself showed the maturity and control he has gained from his thirty odd years of experience.  While viewing it, the hand of a director is no where to be seen. This is not because the film isn't stylized, but because the direction is flawless. The scenes rarely drag and the comedy is creative. The dialogue is witty. And the plot has the plenty of personal emotional depth, enough to make the serious scenes in the film quite powerful.  Often a problem with movies about talented people is that the filmmaker merely tells and doesn't show the audience the character's brilliance, which makes the story less believeable. In Sweet and Lowdown, however, the music is extraordinary, and it is never questioned the talent that Emmit Ray is supposed to have. This, coupled with the simplicity of the story and wonderful acting, make Sweet and Lowdown a tremendous bit of unpretentious storytelling."

This is not Penn's greatest work (see Dead Man Walking for THAT performance), but he does just fine here, capturing the good, the bad and the funny of his character.  He really is one of America's best modern day actors.  Samantha Morton also does a wonderful job as Hattie.  Her warm face and mannerisms will make you smile.  The other star is the music.  The guitar-playing by Dick Hyman inspired me to buy the CD.  This is good stuff.

Talent knows no boundaries when it comes to personality. All of the supporting cast is right on the mark including famous director John Waters's small role. Woody's a master of invention in his storytelling and he's got it all working here including interview cutaways by music historians that make it even more of a hoot and has you forgetting at times that the whole thing is a ruse.

","You can certainly understand why Woody loves jazz music of a certain vintage after watching this picture.  Enjoying a melody is analogous to his appreciation of a plot; the sense of swing corresponds nicely to his pacing of the action; and the improvisation inherent in the music echos the efforts his actors give their less-than-formally scripted roles.<br/><br/>In the reviews posted here, there hasn't been much mention of the musicians who did the soundtrack, and they're outstanding.  Howard Alden, perhaps the best guitarist of his generation (he's around 40), does the guitar work. Alden was actually hired to teach Sean Penn to look like he could play the guitar; Alden followed him around to sets on different pictures he was working on, teaching him the rudiments of the instrument (I have a hunch Sean is a pretty fair guitarist by now).  Pianist, arranger and composer Dick Hyman captures the music of the era perfectly.  Ken Peplowski is the featured reedman.<br/><br/>My kid, knowing what a jazz fan I am, asked me if I had any Emmett Ray records.  He was absolutely astounded to learn that Ray is a fictitious character.  There's a comment about verisimilitude in there somewhere, but I'll leave it to you to fish it out.<br/><br/>Woody's best picture?  Probably not, but well worth seeing."

","I found Woody Allen's latest film, ""Sweet & Lowdown"", a bit of a disappointment myself. Sean Penn's portrayal of jazz guitarist, Emmet Ray notwithstanding, I still felt that the film was neither fish nor fowl - more a hybrid, actually. Is it meant to be a documentary (homage?) to a long forgotten jazz musician (Woody Allen plays clarinet in a jazz band)? The brief appearances of jazz historian, Nat Hentoff, suggests it is. The appearance of Woody Allen (with tongue firmly implanted in his cheek), suggests otherwise. This, despite it being beautifully photographed. The music is terrific, and unlike other music bio's, it looks like Penn is really playing the guitar.

","This is somehow warmer than other of his films, though that is a characteristic many of his movies share.  It took me a few scenes to really latch on to Sean Penn as a virtuoso jazz guitarist, but the actor and the script took me there gradually and once bitten I didn't wanna be let go.  As a musician who is heralded by all but, clearly, himself, Penn excels in a role that is very offbeat for him; clearly a challenge he could not run from taking.  Enormous pathos in the scene in bed with Hattie where he talks about his mother and father and the scene manages to be funny, too. Samantha Morton as Hattie was tremendous, supplying a good deal of the films warmth herself.  Little touches like her eating desserts and his fear of Django Reinhardt, as with all films by The Woodman, take this movie from brilliant to sublime.  The ending had so many wonderful elements to it, it left me hoping he could find a way to get back to a simple life with someone good.  Overall, it's a sweet and, on the 'good movie scale', a very high-up film."

And for all you Westchester/Putnam/NYC people who know RYE PLAYLAND - parts of it were filmed there, so it's nice to see the places you know. Sean Penn plays a wonderful part as Emmet Ray, a womanizer, pimp, guitarist extraordinaire. He's the second greatest guitarist next to Django Reinhardt. He falls for Hattie, a lustful, mental mute played by Samantha Morton. Interesting. Emmet has problem getting to work, showing up on time, showing up drunk, and problems expressing his emotion. He holds it for his music, so throughout the picture, we see that.<br/><br/>From what I've heard, this is not one of Woody Allen's best films, but I thought it was well done.

This isn't going to be an objective review, because I usually go out of my way to see Woody Allen films, and I've been disappointed only once. He is as creative and original as ever. Yes, I know he plays well only on the coasts, but this doesn't detract from his genius.<br/><br/>As usual, the music (here, 20's jazz) is a critically important part of this film, as in almost all Woody Allen films. Sean Penn somehow manages to seem play the guitar with ease. He plays a great jazz guitarist, with an enormous number of personality flaws: egocentric, irresponsible, womanizing, nasty, etc., but a great guitarist. Not surprisingly, because we have come to expect it from Penn, his acting is flawless.<br/><br/>The period (the 20's) is wonderfully captured by the scenery, language, and costumes. The flawed personality almost redeems itself, but it's clear from the beginning that this is not to be. The style is a narrative, with several commentators (including Woody Allen) playing themselves and the narrative is appropriately ambiguous, since it it's about an allegedly mysterious guitarist, known mostly to his remaining avid fans. A wonderful sequence involves three very different takes of a single incident. This is more than Rashoman, it's how myths grow in many different ways.<br/><br/>If you see this film thinking you'll be seeing a minor Woody Allen film, think again.

Still there are touches here of Radio Days, Zelig, and Purple Rose of Cairo. Sweet and Lowdown is a mock-documentary of the career and life of Emmet Ray (Sean Penn) the world's 2nd greatest guitar player circa 1930.  Penn puts in an excellent piece of work as the slimy but sublime Emmet Ray, but is overshadowed by the brilliant performance of Samantha Morton as his mute, not-so-smart girlfriend, Hattie.  Uma Thurman is terrific, too, in her portrayal as Ray's wife, Blanche--a stylish dilettante writer, who briefly enjoys the ride with Ray.

","Every so often a film comes along where the music alone is worth the ticket. This is such a film.  This is an intriguing character study about a fictional jazz guitarist in the 1930's named Emmet Ray (Sean Penn).  Woody Allen, who wrote and directed the film, cleverly uses an autobiographical documentary format, and anyone who is unfamiliar with jazz or didn't know in advance, might easily believe this was a true story.  That is a testimonial to Allen's skills, because despite the fact that Ray was a rogue and a degenerate, the whole story seemed extremely believable.<br/><br/>Ray was renowned as the second greatest jazz guitarist in the world, behind a European gypsy named Django Reinhardt.  Ray had a deep seated insecurity about being number two, and both times he saw Reinhardt play, he passed out. We follow his meandering life as a musician, pimp and carouser with occasional side trips to watch trains and shoot rats.  Unlike most of Allen's films, this one wasn't peppered with stiletto humor and irony. There were some funny bits, but this was mostly a serious character study. Although Ray wasn't an endearing character, he certainly was a fascinating one.  That along with the fabulous music made this film work nicely.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the way Allen shot this film.  He gave it a nice old look. The indoor scenes were shot with an amber filter and the entire film had a very soft focus to it.  There were lots of good period props and costumes that brought the thirties alive.<br/><br/>I'm not normally a big fan of Sean Penn, but he did a terrific job in the lead role.  Penn is not a versatile actor, but he is excellent in certain types of roles.  He is adroit at roles that involve gritty, visceral characters with raw and crude emotions.  In this regard, he was perfectly cast for this part.  The only minor criticism I had was that his guitar fingering was not particularly realistic.  Otherwise it was masterful work. His Oscar nomination was well deserved.<br/><br/>This is the second film this month where I've had a chance to see Samantha Morton.  I enjoyed her work in Dreaming of Joseph Lees' and again here as Hattie.  Since Hattie is a mute, Morton didn't have a single line, but she had a pivotal role and a lot of screen time.  Morton had to do all her acting with her facial expressions and body language and she was fantastic. I have seen numerous actors who have conveyed less with twenty minutes of dialogue than she did with a single look.  She has a very wholesome and amiable quality about her, very genuine and sincere.  She seems to be a very promising young talent and I am eager to see her next role.<br/><br/>This film is a must see for anyone who loves jazz and the character study ain't bad either.  I rate it an 8/10."

","Woody Allen's film has two things going for it: (1) The jazz guitar score is beautiful, and the scenes where protagonist Emmett Ray is onstage with his band are appropriately charming, fun and had my foot-a-tappin'. Allen loves jazz, and this entire movie exudes the charm of our idyllic '20s and '30s. (2) The film has the enormous benefit of starring Sean Penn, who somehow manages to be a scoundrel, an egomaniacal jerk and an insufferable lout while at the same time being spirited, likable and even charming in an odd sort of way.<br/><br/>Those are two pretty big factors in a character driven film about a jazz musician. Penn works wonders onstage, having mastered the extensive fingerings for the jazz guitar. It's a class act - a daunting job for an actor which he pulls off seamlessly.<br/><br/>Emmett Ray is a womanizing b***ard, and he goes through many ladies throughout the course of the film. Sometimes, this got old (Uma Thurman's one joke ingenue is an insufferably long sequence, but has a good joke at the end.) The critically acclaimed Samantha Morton is tolerable as the mute who loves him, her mannered performance reminiscent of Harpo Marx. Sometimes, it's a little too cutesy - I mean, how many times can you cut to her character eating a ton of food? But she makes a good foil for Penn, her silence forcing him to ramble on hilariously. (After sex he takes out his guitar and asks, ""What's your favorite song? snicker  Wait, look who I'm askin'!"")<br/><br/>Allen also manages to pack in some good comedy, such as Penn taking all his dates to the local dump where he shoots at rats. (When one dame gets on his nerves, he tosses a dead rat casually into her lap.) Or the time he decides to make his stage entrance riding in a big yellow moon. There are so many ""Emmett Ray"" stories that one of them gets repeated three times. Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>So I laughed a lot, which is more than I can say for most of Allen's output in the '90s. It's also his most consistent film in years. Sadly, this is the type of project Woody would have knocked off in the old days. Now, it's his finest hour."

Emmett Ray is the stuff of legend, he turned up on the scene, cut some sides, and little is known for sure about his life. Allen fills in the blanks though.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked most was the Django Reinhardt thread, that weaved its way through the whole movie, and made for some of the funniest bits. I won't ruin the movie by talking about it here.<br/><br/>But the movie did seem to be sort of spinning its tires, without a real point, until the last 10 minutes. In that time it goes from being a mildly funny showcase for some GREAT! jazz music to being a statement about what it sometimes takes to be a great artist, and the often tragic irony of this truth.<br/><br/>Thinking about it now, Allen also sort of parodies the documentary format here, in that all the ""modern"" people on camera talking about Emmett Ray really know very little about his life, and the biographical sequences make the viewer the insider, so to speak."

","A few weeks before seeing this film, I had a chance to take another look at ""Deconstructing Harry"", a much different Woody Allen take on the subject of a man who's a genius at art, and an utter failure in life.  While ""Harry"" is a brilliant film with a  lot of energy and insight, it still leaves something of a bad taste; it feels at times like Allen's justification of the hard times he brought on his own family.  Perhaps he's come around, however.  In ""Sweet and Lowdown"", Allen presents the boorish, insensitive artist as a man whose horrible, hurtful behavior ultimately hurts himself most of all.<br/><br/>The story, told in a pseudo-documentary style, is about Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a fictional 1930s jazz guitarist who would be the best in the world, if not for ""this gypsy in France"", Django Reinhardt.  Ray is a true artist on the guitar with a genuinely light touch, but away from the stage, he's a train wreck (which makes sense, as one of his favorite hobbies, when he's not drinking, running whores, or shooting rats at the dump, is watching trains).  He is a man completely cut off from his feelings, who can not relate to people on any realistically sensitive level.  Then, he meets the one type of person such a man cannot properly handle:  a woman who loves him unconditionally, flaws and all.  This is Hattie (Samantha Morton), a mute laundry girl who he uses for a time and then leaves.  He tries his hand at marriage with a pretentious would-be writer (Uma Thurman), but he finally realizes (even though he will not admit it to himself), that he left his true love behind when he left Hattie.  The loss finally ignites his art, and the only recordings he left behind are said to be ""easily as good as Reinhardt"".<br/><br/>As is always the case with an Allen film, the acting is quite good.  Penn is developing a DeNiro-like prowess for character transformations, and Emmett Ray is a nasty, cold man with one great gift to validate his existence. Penn always looks at home with his guitar, and he handles the emotional retentiveness of Ray exceptionally well.  Morton, a surprise Oscar nominee, is truly fetching, with her sweet, open face and purity of spirit.  She's like a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Woody Allen remains among my favorite directors of period-set films, because he always makes his worlds convincing without cramming them down my throat. The film inhabits the '30s with such comfort that it's a real pleasure. Major kudos to the costume designers for their wonderfully colorful array of outfits, and especially to Zhao Fei, who renders the film with an artfully burnished haze of nostalgia, giving the action the feel of a fondly recalled memory.  The music of course is wonderful, Dick Hyman coming through with some terrific arrangements of classic jazz tunes, and Harold Alden lilting the whole proceedings with his marvelous guitar playing.<br/><br/>At first, the pseudodocumentary angle just did not work for me, but as I think more about the film, I realize that it is, on a small level, perfect. Emmett Ray is a man whose life was altered by the love of a woman he ultimately wanted and could not have.  Allen (appearing as himself) comments that his final recordings really show a different side of Ray, a beautiful side.  Ray is best realized as a man who is forgotten except for those recordings, which were made after he had finally been opened up to his feelings, and who was thus able to do what Django had done.  It sometimes takes a lifetime of lowdown to create a moment of sweet, and that's what this film very sweetly suggests."

","What a character this guy ""Emmet Ray"" was - at least Woody Allen's direction and Sean Penn's acting make him seem like a real nutball.  Throughout the movie he's telling everybody he's the second greatest guitar player in the world.  He drinks constantly, he womanizes, and the only places he wants to take his female friends to are the dump to shoot rats, and the railroad tracks to watch the trains.  Plus, he has this mad obsession with Django Reinhardt, whom he considers to be the only guitarist who can out-play him. He cries whenever he hears him play, he talks about him, he idolizes him - but whenever he meets him in person, he becomes deathly afraid and faints. Allen's fascination with Emmet Ray rubs off on you, and Sean Penn gets so into the character you can't help but come to like him, and even feel sorry for him as he rides his bumpy roller coaster of a life filled with arrogance and self-indulgence.  Ultimately of course he has to face the music, and this is where Penn really shines.  As the years go by, I become more and more convinced that Sean Penn is one of the most underrated actors around. This movie really showcases his raw talent though. A note about the actress who plays one of Ray's girlfriends - Samantha Morton.  Since she plays a mute she never utters word throughout the whole movie - but she's really something.  In her silence she conveys so much emotion.  You almost want her character to miraculously learn to speak just so Morton can further showcase her talent.  I'm sure she'll get plenty of opportunities for that in the future though."

","Recently saw this movie at a 'premiere' in Minneapolis,am not a Woody Allen fan and was surprised . I like Django Reinhardt's music and the idea that his music would be used as the basis for a film was good. Sean Penn WAS Emmett Ray! I have not been a real Sean Penn fan but will look at some of his earlier films in a different light,provided he has done something worth while,time to hit the IMBd files. Woody's attention to detail was right on the money. You are in the 1930's. The mood,tone was suttle. My only gripe was with the rail yard.In the thirty's diesel locomotives were rare as were steel boxcars. The portrayal of the Black characters was believable as was the jam session. I found myself laughing a lot. Uma Thurman was a delight.I find that when Uma has good material she shines.This is a good movie. I don't like to dissect a film , just like to be entertained. This is it. A lot of people may not like the music as this music is French swing from The Quintet of the Hot Club of France. The personnel was Django on guitar,Stephane Grappelly,violin,Joseph Reinhardt,guitar,Django's brother,Roger Chaput,guitar,Louis Vola,bass.As noted no brass,drums,pianos,or woodwinds. At one time Django played with the Duke Ellington orchestra. So go and enjoy a good movie with some sweet music."

","Some folks prefer fat Elvis over skinny Elvis or Rat Pack Sinatra over 40's Sinatra.  Same can be said of Woody Allen.  Myself, I prefer the earlier Woodman (Bananas, Take the Money and Run, Love and Death, Annie Hall) as opposed to the post Mia Farrow Allen.  He was a hell of a lot funnier back then and more entertaining.  While ""Sweet and Lowdown"" does not fit in the later angry Allen category (it resembles more of his earlier period), it is definitely not primo Woody.  For me the last great Woody Allen picture was 1977's brilliant and hilarious ""Annie Hall"", no doubt his best work ever.<br/><br/>""Sweet and Lowdown"" boasts a great performance from Sean Penn, looks great and has a great jazz score, but the film for the most part is pretty lightweight and hammers the continuous concept of  ""genius musician cannot be intimate with another"" throughout the entire picture.  Underneath it is really not much substance.  This mock documentary centers on the fictitious 1930's obscure jazz guitarist Emmet Ray (Sean Penn) who lives somewhat in the shadow of the real life jazz player, Django Reinhardt, Ray's idol. Although Ray is a brilliant guitar player, he just doesn't have his act together.  He drinks too much, gambles, is irresponsible, lives beyond his means and has major commitment and intimacy problems (hell, sounds a lot like myself and every other male on the planet).  He eventually meets a mute, Hattie (Samantha Morton) that he falls for and eventually leaves for a socialite writer (Uma Thurman) and then begins his trip to self-destruction and obscurity.<br/><br/>Sean Penn, one of the top ten great actors working today, gives a wonderful and winning comedic and moving performance as Emmet, whose eccentricities and ego put him over the edge and hinder his musical career and personal life.  Penn as always immerses himself deep within the character to create a role that a lesser actor would have made into a caricature.  Now this is the actor who should have played the title character in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", what a different and much better picture that would have been. Samantha Morton as Hattie is also wonderful in a supporting role. Without any dialogue she conveys so much through her body language and facial expressions.  It is a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination, the kind that the Academy loves.  Uma Thurman, who is a hit or miss with me, seems out of place in this picture.  First off, I don't think it is that good of a performance and second, I found her, not the character, annoying.<br/><br/>""Sweet and Lowdown"" is being characterized as a comedy, and while there are some funny lines, I did not find myself laughing that much (at least I laughed more than once as compared to the unfunny ""Being John Malkovich""). I expected much more wit from Woody Allen and much more period.  I guess you could call this Wood-lite.  The picture just does not have much substance to it nor does it really go anywhere.  If it were not for Sean Penn's bravura performance, there would not be really anything here.  After all these years and personal turmoil, maybe the Woodman has finally run out of steam, I hope not.  Not Recommended.  × × 1/2 out of 5"

"MickeyTo","Null","0","0","9 January 2000"," Woody tackles the jazz scene.
","WARNING TO ALL READERS:  I am Woody Allen fanatic, so please note that this review will be somewhat biased.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's Sweet And Lowdown is a slight change of pace for the man who has been pumping out dark relationship comedies for the past several years. While this is the story of a man who can't seem to commit to anything but his craft, the film doesn't seem to explore the real reasons why, as many of Allen's films in the past have.  <br/><br/>Sean Penn plays  Emmett Ray, the second greatest jazz guitarist in the world.  He is trapped by his second rate status, as often it is the excuse for his heavy drinking and irresponsible behavior.  Aside from playing gigs all over the country, Emmett is involved in pimping, gambling, and just about anything else that has the stamp of immorality on it.  Emmett's idea of a good time is going to the dump and shooting rates, or sitting in rail yards and watching trains go by.<br/><br/>Early in the film, while out chasing women on the boardwalk, Emmett meets Hattie, a mute girl played by Samantha Morton.  Her genuine affection for Emmett and his music, and her extremely sweet disposition works, and without sacrificing his selfishness, he agrees to have her around.<br/><br/>Woody Allen seems to have a flair for capturing the jazz era on film.  Past efforts like Radio Days and Bullets Over Broadway demonstrated his passion for the music and the styles of those days.  Sweet and Lowdown is yet another example, offering some beautiful jazz with a great 1930's backdrop.<br/><br/>Allen chooses a documentary style to tell this story.  In fact, Allen, as himself, is one of the commentators.  Since there was very little plot in this one, (just a lot of escapades thrown together) that was probably for the best. It helps to keep the story moving, giving it purpose, without seeming choppy. <br/><br/>Uma Thurman plays a vamp who moves in on Emmett, thus pushing poor Hattie away.  Her performance seemed a bit forced this go round.  She had the look down pat, but here was a girl not sure whether to replay Poison Ivy or stutter like a Woody Allen character.<br/><br/>Sean Penn was great in the lead role.  As Emmett he pulls off just enough charm, and mixes it with just enough sleaze to make us believe that these women would fall for him, despite his obvious short comings. <br/><br/>
Woody Allen always has a fabulous supporting actress and this time around Morton steals the show.  She has no lines in the film and must convey all of her feelings through facial expressions.  Not only does she pull it off, but her performance is so endearing it's hard not to fall in love with the woman.<br/><br/>I read a lot of bad reviews about this film before going in and therefore had low expectations.  I have to say, I wasn't disappointed coming out.  I did find the film to be clever in many respects.  I'll admit that this is not one of the brighter lights in Woody Allen's brilliant career, but it isn't bad.  Sweet and Lowdown is worth a look if you happen to like Woody Allen."

"TheLittleSongbird","9","1","2","18 July 2014"," A big return to form for Woody Allen
","Celebrity to me wasn't a terrible film but it was disappointing and I consider it one of Woody Allen's weakest. Sweet and Lowdown however was a big return to form, let down only by the odd bit of lagging pacing, and is not just one of Allen's better films since Husbands and Wives but also in the better half of his filmography. Allen's films- apart from some of his very early stuff- are always very well made, but the handsome production design and colourful cinematography make Sweet and Lowdown a gorgeous-looking film, and Allen's directing also is nigh-on perfect. The haunting and mellow soundtrack is one of my personal favourites actually from his films and CD-release-worthy. Sweet and Lowdown also has a great and beautifully balanced script, some of it is charmingly witty in typical Allen style, but it also has a lot to say and does so in a way that intrigues and doesn't come across as self-indulgent and the dramatic scenes are among the, in my opinion, most poignant and sensitively done of any Woody Allen film since Husbands and Wives. Allen's mock-documentary contributions are fascinating and you learn a good deal about the music, artistry and Emmet Ray(which Allen delivers in a way that strongly suggests how he connected with the subject matter and what was being said), and the story itself has the ideal balance of comedy and drama, reflected in Samantha Morton's character Hattie, and has an immense charm to it. The characters, although a few of them are on the thankless side(ie. Ellie), are not likable- Hattie is an exception though, because she's the character that you relate to the most by quite some distance- but are written with realism, the relationships between them are identifiable and acted with every bit as much. Sean Penn gives a bravura performance and really embodies Emmet Ray, although Ray is as purposefully dislikeable as you can possibly get there's genuine sympathy to be had from him in his final scenes. Samantha Morton is even better and I'd go as far to say that she steals the show, she's really heart-breaking, has eyes and facial expressions that are really expressive and even when silent her eyes and face tell volumes. Uma Thurman is not used very much but she has a quite colourful character and she relishes it without being at odds with the rest of the film. All in all, after being disappointed by Celebrity, Sweet and Lowdown was a big improvement and is a wonderful film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","'Sweet and Lowdown' is jazz aficionado Woody Allen's fictional biopic of Emmet Ray, legendary depression-era guitarist and loser. In spite of its faux-historical setting, it's still immediately recognisable as a Woody Allen film, with its rambling construction, sly silly humour, and its use of certain trademark locations (Coney Island, for example). In fact, it's amazing how easily Sean Penn, a most distinctive actor, slides into Allen's world; and the film is fresher than many of Allen's recent efforts, in part because Allen himself (who reliable self-caricature before the cameras has grown increasingly stale) hardly features in it. It's hardly groundbreaking, but it is sweet, and funny as well."

","I've never been a Woody Allen addict, but this man does seem to love the same music as me, I had noticed this with ""Radio Days"", ""Everybody Says I love You"", ""Interiors"" et alia. When I saw the dvd of this film about the life of this Django-Rheinhart-like guitarist, I felt it was worth a watch. I did not realise that the character had been entirely made up by Mr Allen and was most impressed on discovering this. I really dug that music that swung throughout the film and my limbs were in almost continuous movement. I did not know the actor, Sean Penn and didn't care much for him though his performance was quite credible for the rôle he was playing ! To enjoy this film you do have to appreciate swing jazz guitar (which is the case for me) but story wise, there's nothing to write home about. But my full credit to Woody Allen for actually getting the spectator to believe it was a real biography about someone. No doubt swing music experts would have had their doubts but the rest of us will be taken in by this. Quite an original film then."
"Buddy-51","Null","1","2","5 July 2000"," minor Allen work
","Minor Woody Allen is better than no Woody Allen, I suppose, but `Sweet and Lowdown' raises the question of whether being as prolific as Allen has been in his moviemaking career has actually begun to diminish him as an artist. Is it better to be a Stanley Kubrick or a Terrance Malick, producing films sparingly and with long intervals between them, or someone like Allen who, for the most part, releases a film every six to twelve months, almost without giving the previous film time to vacate the theater?  Is it indeed possible for a creative genius to eventually run dry in his inspiration and thereby suffer from the law of diminishing returns?  For fans of the more dilatory directors, the wait between works may be grueling and aggravating but, at least, those devotees don't end up taking the artists for granted. In Allen's case, one fears that, when his career is done and his entire body of work evaluated, it will seem to be a plain - an elevated one it is true - but one whose peaks and monuments stand few and far between.<br/><br/>Strike one against `Sweet and Lowdown' is the fact that Allen himself does not appear as a character in the story (he does, however, make a few brief appearances in interview form).  Something happens when Allen pulls himself out of the center of his films; they cease to be true Woody Allen movies and become strangely ordinary.  Endearing and charming as Sean Penn is in the lead role, the absence of Allen also means the absence of the dry, acerbic wit that makes the best Allen films so much fun.  Allen has always been better as a writer of first-person rather than third-person comedy. Somehow, the films in which he stays strictly behind the scenes lack the comedic passion and sharp-edged wit of those works in which he is up front and center stage.  This same problem occurred, for example, in `The Purple Rose of Cairo.'  Allen simply doesn't reach the comic heights he invariably achieves when he is writing for himself.<br/><br/>Penn stars as the fictional character Emmet Ray, the second greatest jazz guitarist during the 1930's, a sweet-natured but lost soul who suffers from kleptomania, runs a second-rate prostitution ring, brags incessantly about his greatness - yet panics when confronted with the prospect of meeting the world's first greatest guitarist - and thinks watching passing trains and shooting rats at the local dump are the height of entertainment.  He also suffers from a deep-seated terror of emotional commitment, throwing up when his ever-loving mute girlfriend informs him she loves him, then flees in panic, breaking her heart and living on in everlasting regret for the foolish mistake he has made, letting the one true love of his life get away. All this makes for mildly amusing entertainment, but Allen's film often seems muted itself in its comic temperament.  Penn provides a stellar and delightful interpretation of this well-meaning but confused genius, yet the scenes themselves rarely make us laugh.  Having Ray's love interest be a charming but mute young woman may be clever and cute in its conception, but it leads to coyness and archness rather than depth and revelation.   We are, ultimately, left with whimsy rather than big laughs, sentimentality rather than character development.  All the people we are involved with seem merely to be acting out parts, not truly interacting in a way that is meaningful. Particularly annoying is the continual intercutting of musical `experts' commenting on Ray in pseudo-interview style, mouthing statements that, politely put, are simply too cute by half.  <br/><br/>I hasten to add that, visually, the film is a knockout.  The set designers miraculously transport us back to a glorious time of elegance and style, recreating, among other things, the haunting beauty of a stroll down a beach boardwalk in the 1920's and 30's.  There is a spareness and simplicity to the art direction and set decoration that works more effectively than the crass visual overstatement that afflicts so many big budget period pieces.<br/><br/>
Yet, for all its virtues, `Sweet and Lowdown' somehow falls flat, leaving the audience bemused but strangely unexhilarated.   Perhaps, Allen does best when he injects his own unique brand of clear-eyed cynicism into the world of heartbreaking romance (just the combination that made `Annie Hall' such a timeless masterpiece).  Here there is simply too much `sweet' and not enough `lowdown.'"

The movie felt as though he wasn't up to the task of completing the damn thing.  Similarly, only once did he make good use of the fact that a certain anecdote could be a mistruth by giving us multiple versions; the rest of the film, he has narrators remind us that the story might be unreliable, but doesn't use this great conceit in the actual narrative of the film.

S & L was a flat, weary retreading of that period kind of thing Woody Allen does, part Purple Rose of Cairo, part Radio Days, and some of the pseudo documentary format of Zelig. Otherwise it's just Sean Penn's character driving himself from one situation to another like panels in a comic strip, then ending rather abruptly, on the assumption that we've been transported to a different place than where we started, and that Penn's character has realized something about the error of the mean, selfish life he's led.

Somehow, it didn't...<br/><br/>Although the story is great (so vivid and real, that I was sure that Emmet way a real character, although, I was very confused that I've never heard of him - since I am pretty informed of most of the Artist of that era. Still, most of the movie (especially after ""documentary"", testimonial parts) I was sure Emmet was a real guy... I spent some time on internet after movie, trying to find something about him... Until I visited PROImdb and found out in these reviews, that Emmet was fictional character. Make's me almost sorry:)!<br/><br/>Apart from that, S. Penn and S. Morthon (mute girl) builded great characters, but here comes the problem - Great story, great actors and very often plot gets into very boring sequences. How and why, I am not sure!?!<br/><br/>Uma Thurman - hm, character that was not that developed - it wasn't Woody's film, she probably wouldn't even read the script!<br/><br/>Woody directed it little bit more ""anonymously"" than his other stuff (If I didn't know it was his film, I couldn't recognize his ""handwriting""..) Although there are some of his trademarks (those long shots,i.e., whole scenes made of one or two of them.<br/><br/>Photography is somehow much more vivid then Allen's usually (with warm and bluriesh colors), but, ok, it's history-era movie...<br/><br/>Well, I don't even know why I went on writing this review - I usually don't do this. This is my very first review on IMDB since many years...<br/><br/>Maybe because I am more confused with ""what to think"" that ever before...<br/><br/>However; maybe that was Woody's intention!:)"

","I like guitar music. I like Sean Penn sans Madonna. I liked this movie, despite it being a typical Woody Allen pseudo-documentary. A special thank you to Woody for not putting Diane Keaton in it."

","'Sweet and Lowdown' has been compared to everything from 'City Lights' and 'Raging Bull' to 'La Strada'.  Formally, the film is more ambitious than any of these.  It reminded me of Anthony Powell's roman fleuve, 'A Dance to the Music of Time'.  Powell's novel, in the wake of 'Ulysses', seems very traditional, a straightforward historical narrative, mediated by a controlling narrator.  Similarly, 'Lowdown' seems utterly conventional, both in narrative progression, and in its assertion that the life of a jazzman is bleak and emotionally unrewarding - the image of Emmet Ray, alone, at night, by an empty railroad depot, huddled, crying, his guitar in smashed fragments, would not seem out of place, with variations, in films like 'Young Man with a Horn', 'Round Midnight' or 'Bird'.<br/><br/>Powell's narrator, Nick Jenkins, tells the story of himself, his family, friends and acquaintances over a period of 50 years.  Jenkins' civilised detachment makes him utterly trustworthy, and we are likely to take him at his word.  However, much of the narrative is based on hearsay, or the stories of others (often second- or third-hand), unreliable to say the least.  Combined with the mnemonic hesitancies of old age, the processes of denial, evasion and embellishment, and Nick's own rarely elucidated personal motives, the novel's mode makes for a highly unstable text, much less conventional than on first glance; where very little is certain, and 'truth' and 'witness' are compromised notions.<br/><br/>The effect of Allen's film is somewhat similar.  Never mind that the film is a 'fictional' documentary - all fiction films are, minus the formal apparatus (and surely everyone knows by now that documentaries are no more objectively truthful than anything else).  But, within the reality of this fiction, there may be no reality at all.  The only truthful thing (on the level of fiction) is the opening intertitle, which gives the brief bald fact that Ray existed, made a few records which some consider beautiful, and then disappeared from public view.  All the rest, as in 'The Virgin Suicides', is an accumulation of hearsay and anecdote, so that the Ray that we see in the film, the truly obnoxious, emotionally constipated (the depiction of which was alarmingly familiar), misogynistic, kleptomaniacal, infantile genius, is not Ray at all, but a 'fiction' of his biographers, complete with cod-psychology.  Like Shakespeare, all we have of the man is the work.  So the film's apparent theme is irrelevant - can a personally repellent human being be an artistic genius?: we only know the fruits of the latter.<br/><br/>That argument was always old hat anyway, although still unresolved, its most obvious difficulty being Wagner - how can a man who, with Shakespeare, plumbed human depths few knew existed, and did so with such all-consuming beauty; how could such a man, quite seriously, call for the destruction of an entire race (the Jews) to whom he preferred his dogs.  If Allen seriously wanted to discuss this theme, he would have used a figure like Wagner - Ray's music is easily dissociated from its begetter's awfulness; indeed, like Amadeus, it seems independent of him.  Wagner's anti-Semitism, on the other hand, is the life-blood of his work, the Jews being the Other that must be ridiculed and expelled from its purifying strength.<br/><br/>Another problem is that those of us unversed in the intricacies of the jazz guitar will be ignorant as to how great Ray truly is.  His music sounds pleasant enough, but one is hardly struck with wonder - and as the film's two emotional moments (Hattie's look when he plays after sex; and the last great recording played over his desolation) require an appreciation of its power, I was left a little unmoved.<br/><br/>My reference to Powell was not entirely gratuitous.  There is an astonishing sequence in 'Temporary Kings' in which an enigmatic event is interpreted kaleidoscopically by the different versions and interpretations of it told from varying degrees of proximity.  There is a similar scene here, when Emmet follows Blanche and her gangster lover to a petrol station, where the narrative, linear enough for all its ellipses and uncertainty, breaks down, and the film becomes a celebration of storytelling.  It is irrelevant which version of the tale is true; each one is told with a master's skill and is equally enjoyable and provocative.<br/><br/>We remember that Allen has parodied 'Pale Fire' and Borges in his comic prose.  The whole film is a series of vignettes, as we only know Ray through legendary tales, some comic (the 'moon' scene is justly celebrated), others emotionally difficult, all evincing a Calvino-like love of the tale, the anecdote.  So although there is a pleasing irony that a man of huge, destructive ego is actually a non-presence in his own non-story; and while art is unproblematically celebrated,  it is reassuring to see that for Allen, combining the love of the sketch of the early films with the resonant maturity of the later work, the tale will always be the thing."

","i always enjoy seeing a film by woody allen. i really like his humor. but i find the last one, sweet and lowdown, misses the woody-allen-touch. it is to tragic and there is almost no irony. i think that sean penn plays wonderfully but for me, sweet and lowdown is not a real woody allen movie."

","For many years, Woody Allen was a chouchou for our snobs who, even in remote suburbia, want his movies in English (with subtitles). However, the audience seems to diminish since the Kafkaian SHADOWS AND FOG; after a nice come back with BULLETS IN MANHATTAN, Woody seems to tackle now with another giant of literature, Jorge Luis Borges. In one of his best books, FICTIONS, JLB wrote about lands who do not exist (Tlon Uqbar Orbis Tertius), books never written (The Books of Herbert Quain)and careers of people absent from any encyclopaedia (Pierre Menard, author of the real Don Quixote). Abiding to his taste, Woody Allen has picked up a jazz guitar player supposed to be No.2 after Django Reinhardt, and joins three jazz specialists to describe his career, his loves and his failures. This enables us to hear some fine performances by Bucky Pizzarelli (unnoticed by many, for his name appears only in a flash on the ending titles, alas never played to their entirety, with largest regrets for LIMEHOUSE BLUES). The main character, a womanizer, a pimp and a kleptomaniac,never touches us with admirations,regrets or understanding, leaving room only for Mr Allen's work, which is one of the poorest he ever gratified us with.Perhaps he should made less but better movies; but he seems to take the contrary steps, because he has two or three projects for 2000 and one for 2001. This one was not only uncomplete, it was frustrating in its best parts. My only consolation: the sublime Samantha Morton (Hattie, the dumb girl looking like Harpo Marx), who steals the show from Sean Penn (Emmet Ray) and even from Uma Thurman (Blanche Williams). Charlie Christian would have been a better bet (to me, he's the No 1 of all times). But most of the jazz biographies filmed to date (Goodman, Miller, Krupa, etc)are mainly hagiographies; Michael Curtiz (YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN)and Otto Preminger (MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM) were more ambitious, but only Clint Eastwood went somewhere with BIRD (Charlie Parker). henry caraso"
