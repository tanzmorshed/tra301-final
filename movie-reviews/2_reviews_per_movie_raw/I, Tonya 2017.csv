","Why relevant? Until I saw this movie, in my point of view Tonya Harding was a cheat and a lowlife and this was entirely based on the media coverage of the events in 1994. Having seen the movie I feel ashamed about how easily I judged her and I realised I have to be way more careful in forming my opinion about people."

","Anyone who was old enough to be sucked in by the media circus that this scandal turned into should make it a point to take a look at this film, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The media seemed much more about the sensationalism of it all than it was about maintaining the kind of objective balance that'd presume Tonya's innocence until evidence proved otherwise. 
But being honest, even if evidence came along that absolved Harding of any wrongdoing in the Kerrigan attack, how happy would the media have been to report it? Or would we have been to hear it? Because we've got to admit that, although it might not seem very nice, there was quite a bit of fun to be had during the couple months we spent focusing on this Hillbilly girl and her bumbling husband, right? Well with that in mind, what would the thought of her innocence have brought, other than damage to the narrative we were having such fun with? Regardless of where you stand in regards to her innocence, its only fair to acknowledge that her role had been laid out for her pretty much from the get-go. Kerrigan was its hero the moment she became the victim, could we have honestly entertained the notion that maybe Harding wasn't as much the villain as seemed to befit the story? How fun would that have been? Really?<br/><br/>In the last couple months, the articles about this upcoming movie had comment sections riddled with people mostly bemoaning the current state of Hollywood. Not the scandals, but that it'd even stoop so low as to peddle this kind of white trash story. ""White trash"" came up repeatedly of course, and while comment sections generally aren't the place to find the best sampling of voices, I personally wasn't able to find a single comment that was anything other than damningly derivative of Hollywood and/or Tonya...certainly not one suggesting the possibility that maybe there was more to this story than what we already knew. But that was always a possibility, wasn't it? The telling of a side that we hadn't heard?<br/><br/>After seeing the flick last night, I passed along my recommendation of it to a friend, commenting that Tonya Harding's guilt might have to be re-thought. In response, I got a chuckling, ""Oh I have a hard time believing that!"" Which, sure that has to be the prevailing opinion, I'd imagine. 
But why? Do we really and truly think that we have the kind of information on the subject that'd allow for the most objective, fact-based decision on it? Have many of us ever stopped long enough to have wondered whether or not we did? The line of questioning isn't likely to be met with much more than scoffs by those who've yet to view the movie, but they're questions that end up being well begged and something that the same people may find themselves unwittingly exploring afterward. I sure have been.<br/><br/>In the meantime, this isn't just a great movie, but a great sports movie, detailing an ice skating prodigy who love for skating drove her life, and whose life ultimately served as a testament to just how influential a class system can be that many of us are barely cognizant of even existing. 
Based off interviews and testimony from the key players in the Kerrigan scandal, watching it brings a much needed sense of balance to the story and will likely leave you amazed at how easily the truth can be blurred when viewed through the lens of sensationalized media coverage. <br/><br/>10/10, great movie that grabs you from its opening scene and will have you entranced throughout."
"rockman182","8","133","154","7 December 2017"," I, Tonya (2017)
","I think this film may have had the best trailer of 2017. I saw it and knew instantly how badly I wanted to see it. I've never been a fan of Margot Robbie and her previous acting efforts but this looked like her awakening and where she would be proving me wrong. I believe it, she's quite sensational in this film. Her dedication to her role shows but really everyone involved has done very well. Craig Gillespie has his first real winner with I, Tonya.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is a biographical picture about famed and disgraced figure skater, Tonya Harding. Tonya was pushed onto the rink by her abusive mother at a very young age and despite the abuse becomes a very talented ice skater. The cycle of abuse continues with her abusive husband but she tries to bear through and succeed. Everyone seems to be against her but her talent is hard to deny. The film also goes into the famed attack on fellow ice skater Nancy Kerrigan and the aftermath of the incident.<br/><br/>The film is sort of told from a mockumentary perspective as if key characters are being interviewed. The film also utilizes breaking the fourth wall where characters in a scene would talk to the audience. I thought this was interesting and separates itself from being a standard biopic and gives this film a real comedic depth. The soundtrack is catchy and literally every performance in this film makes for a very engaging time. I didn't even recognize the chameleon Bobby Cannavale until the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Some wonder why the film was made but it kind of helps you identify with Tonya. She suffered physical and psychological abuse from both her foul mouthed mother and her rage filled husband. Her hands may not be completely clean in what happens to Nancy Kerrigan, but she is also just a victim of circumstances. Vastly talented, but just short of reaching her pinnacle due to outside factors and her image and attitude. The film isn't perfect but its vastly entertaining and could be giving Margot Robbie and Allison Janney Oscar nominations. I'm going to let this sink in and I'm sure its going to be something I go back to.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Man, I personally found this one to be an exceedingly uncomfortable watch.<br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" is cleverly filmed as a pseudo-documentary, featuring re-enactments of the real-life interviews of most of the participants in this true-life drama. I recently bitterly criticised some film critics for spoiling the story of Donald Crowhurst, the subject of the recent ""The Mercy"". But I was about to do exactly the same here, *assuming* that you all know the lurid tale of the rivalry between Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan that led up to an 'event' in 1994 that shocked the world. And of course, many of you younger folk don't know: case in point my 26 year old son who I went to see this with, and who went into the story blissfully blind of the drama about to unfold. So I will try to keep this review spoiler-free.<br/><br/>Playing Tonya from a (not very credible!) 15 years old to her mid-20's is Margot Robbie (""The Wolf of Wall Street"", ""Suicide Squad"") in what is a BAFTA and Oscar nominated performance. And for good reason: the performance is raw, visceral and disturbing in reflecting a victim who still thinks everything at heart is her own fault.<br/><br/>Also BAFTA and Oscar nominated is Allison Janney (""The Girl on the Train"") as Tonya's obnoxious chain-smoking mother LaVona. Janney is truly terrifying as the mother who abuses her daughter both physically and mentally in a driven attempt to make her the best ice-skater in the world.<br/><br/>Victims seem to attract abusers, and Tonya is surrounded by people who are just plain bad for her: notably her husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan, ""The Martian"", ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"") and his slimy and pitifully self-deluded friend Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser). The end credits video footage of the real-life players show just how well these parts were cast.<br/><br/>Why so uncomfortable to watch? There is a significant degree of domestic abuse featured in the film, both in terms of LaVona on her child and Jeff on his wife. This is something I abhor in general, having been brought up to believe it is never EVER acceptable to lay a hand on a woman. To have these cowardly individuals sensationalised in the movie I found to be really upsetting. I strongly feel, for this reason alone, that the film should have had an 18 certificate. Violence in film should be related to the context as well as the severity. (Note that this is in stark contrast to my comments of recent BBFC decisions to make ""Phantom Thread"" and ""Lady Bird"" 15-certificates when I believe they should have been 12A).<br/><br/>The film is executed extremely well, with 4:3 framing for the staged interviews, and ice skating scenes that seamlessly cut between the professional clearly doing the stunts and Robbie (who must also be a half decent skater too). The soundtrack is nicely littered - ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" style - with classic hits of the early 90's.<br/><br/>To think that this story actually unfolded in this way is nothing short of astounding... but it did! There is an astonishing video clip here (#spoilers) of the run up to, and the immediate aftermath of, the Kerrigan incident. I came out of the film with a deep feeling of sadness for Harding (at least, as portrayed) and utter disgust that the villains of this piece could be a) so cruel and out of control and b) so utterly stupid. These are individuals who really should have been sterilised to stop them polluting the gene pool any further.<br/><br/>Written by Steven Rogers (""Stepmom"") and directed by Australian Craig Gillespie, there is no doubting that this is a powerful film: played to an absolutely silent and gripped Saturday night cinema audience. And it has truly dynamite performances from Allison Janney and Margot Robbie. But be warned that you'll need a strong stomach to go and see it without being affected by it afterwards. It's a mental keeper."
"MartinHafer","8","138","174","19 October 2017"," The acting and direction were pretty amazing....
","Tonight I went to the opening night film at the Philadelphia Film Festival and it turned out to be ""I, Tonya"". I wasn't particularly thrilled about this, as I really didn't care much about seeing a biopic about Tonya Harding. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it as the film was exceptionally well directed and the acting was occasionally brilliant. In particular, Australian actress Margot Robbie was simply amazing as Harding—turning in the sort of performance that could mean an Oscar nomination. Likewise, Allison Janney was amazing as wellplaying Tonya's incredibly despicable mother. You really have to respect the great job both of them did in the filmas well as Robbie's learning to skate well in order to make this movie.<br/><br/>The film is about the life of Tonya Harding.yes, THAT Tonya Hardingthe one who gained infamy for her part in the attack on rival ice skater Nancy Kerrigan back in 1994. My daughter was only a small child at the time of the attack and I told her nothing about Harding because I wanted to see her perspective on the story. Both of us left very impressed. However, I must put in a warning about the film. It is very violent.filled with intense and very realistic domestic violenceamong the most realistic I have ever seen. With my background as a psychotherapist, this churned up a lot of memories for me and the film often had me in tears. If you have been a victim of domestic violence, then I strongly urge you to think twice before you see the pictureor at least see it with someone you love. Seeing Tonya being slugged, slapped and even shot was tough to watch. Interestingly, often the audience responded by laughingan inappropriate but thoroughly understandable coping mechanism for such ugliness.<br/><br/>Does the film excuse Harding's behaviors or paint her out to be a victim? Not reallyand if it had, the film would have been a waste of time. What it does do is help you at least understand who she was and why she did what she didas she was more than just an intense competitor who didn't come forward when she learned her husband and his friend had physically assaulted Tonya's competitor, Nancy Kerrigan. Overall, a fascinating look back to one of the most celebrated news stories of the 1990s.one that folks who are old fogies, like me, well remember!"
"Art Snob","10","163","208","18 September 2017"," A triple axel of a skating movie
","If I could have voted online for the best movie that I saw at TIFF 2017 (the voting was limited to iPhone and Android users), it would have been for this film, which wound up second in the People's Choice award competition. Director Craig Gillespie has tackled a difficult subject brilliantly without removing the considerable number of warts from the main characters. This film should garner a considerable number of Oscar nominations, including best picture and director.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie should be a lock for a Best Actress nod, completely burying her Australian background to deliver American white trash with complete credibility. (She won't win of course, because ... Tonya.) Her skating sequences are edited brilliantly - you really believe that it's her.<br/><br/>THE surest Oscar bet has to be Allison Janney as Tonya's acerbic, domineering, Swisher-chain-smoking mother LaVona Golden. She gives what I call a ""schizophrenia"" performance - there's no way that anyone seeing JUNO and this film back-to-back would ever notice that the mothers in both films are played by the same actress. Robbie got the loudest applause when the actors were introduced before the film, but when they came out afterwards, Janney's applause was equivalent to hers.<br/><br/>The story sticks to facts and places most of the blame for the Kerrigan incident on Sean Eckhardt, played with spot-on obnoxiousness by Paul Walter Hauser. The rest goes to hubby-at-times Jeff Gillooly, played by Sebastian Stan. He handles the husband-to-a-celebrity role with a charm not seen since Eric Roberts in STAR 80.<br/><br/>The subject matter may cost the film at awards time, but it's still an excellent movie that you should definitely check out if you have any interest at all in the story."

","I was going to make a list of people who made extraordinary things during the same period that Tonya Harding monopolized the headlines but then I thought it was a pointless exercise. Charles Manson will always be more famous, much more than Sharon Tate. That's the world we live in or maybe it always was. The sadness verging on horror of of the Tonya Harding story will win, fascination wise, than any kind of kindness from anyone anywhere. Now that out of my system let me say that I Tonya is an entertaining harrowing tale directed by Craig Gillespie and his extraordinary cinematographer Nicholas Karakatsanis with, clearly, Martin Scorsese in their minds and hearts. Margot Robbie is terrific and Sebastian Stan as the husband from hell, superb but it's Allison Janney that creates a character that is impossible to take and irresistible at the same time. She is spectacular. So, that's more than enough to recommend I Tonya but if the Tabloid Times is something you subscribe I will highly recommend Gus Van Sant's To Die For and Michael Ritchie's made for television The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","74","97","15 January 2018"," Not a monster...
","""I, Tonya"" is amazing. Margot Robbie gifts a career defining performance. Margot plays disgraced 1994 US Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding. Her performance as Tonya is fearless, vulnerable, sad and poignantly flawed. Harding is notorious for knowing about the attack upon US figure skating Champion Nancy Kerrigan which led to her eventual ban from competitive skating which was her life. <br/><br/>Director Craig Gillespie neither vilifies nor justifies Tonya offering the experience of being her. That she wanted to be loved, to be gotten, and to be the best. At the time Tonya was the only women's figure skater in the world to land the impossible triple axel in competition. Robbie as Tonya in an interview in the movie acknowledged when she landed the triple axel in the trials she knew, ""I was the best!"" Tonya was driven, the figure skating phenom, but she was less than phenom in her life. I think that is the poignancy of Gillespie's direction and Steven Rogers's story. <br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" is not really dark comedy. ""I, Tonya"" is just dark with laughs in its irony and the stupidity of those closest to Tonya. The movie is the dichotomy that defines the tragedy of domestic violence and abuse. In one scene Tonya's husband Jeff, played by convincing Sebastian Stan, slams the freezer door in Tonya's face, because she questions why he didn't buy Dove ice cream bars. That is so wrong. That makes you so angry. <br/><br/>Gillespie depicts that pattern of abuse throughout of beating on screen. And Tonya takes it, and stays until she can no longer. The abuse originates with Mom LaVona, played by focused Allison Janney, who thinks she is tough love as she pushes her daughter in her skating career. No, Mom is an abuser. Janney's LaVona could have been comic caricature; instead she brilliantly nuances the single Mom working waitress raising her kid the way she was raised. Robbie is touching humanity as Tonya, who has the self awareness that she is uneducated, but she is smarter than she thinks and way smarter than those surrounding her. <br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" and Robbie in contrasts of edgy humor and human cruelty touchingly tells the story of how we are raised and the people we choose to spend life with either define or curse. Much about Tonya seems to be the in order to, to prove something. In the great scene before her competition her new Coach Doty, played by strong Bojana Novakovic, tells her ""You show them."" That I think becomes the conversation that dominates Tonya's life. <br/><br/>Needing her Mom's help after she leaves husband Jeff, Tonya sees her Mom. She asks her Mom that when she was a kid, ""Did you love me?"" Robbie's Tonya is in tears. That breaks your heart. Really Tonya just wanted to be loved, like we all do. That may be the point of Gillespie's ""I, Tonya"" with all its emotional extremes and uncomfortable laughs. Perhaps, most of the laughs come from the blatant stupidity of Jeff and his idiot friend Shawn, played by good Paul Walter Hauser. <br/><br/>Maybe ""I, Tonya"" works in its profound sadness as well. Toward the end Tonya says, ""I am not a monster."" No, she's not. She is just the little girl who wanted to be loved and never got it. She was driven and wanted to be the best. Tonya is just human. She is both lightness and darkness. Perhaps within ""I, Tonya"" are loud laughs and the subtle lesson of having compassion. ""I, Tonya"" is one of my favorite movies of the year."
"Semisonic","10","19","22","7 March 2018"," Pure pain on skates
","So, you have watched Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and thought that story was tough and Frances McDormand was terrific and nothing could ever be more tough and more terrific. Especially something with that hot blonde chick from The Wolf of Wall Street. Right? Wrong! So get ready for a big fat kick in the nuts, because sh!t has just got real.<br/><br/>From the very beginning of the film you realize that it won't be pretty. An abusive ever-smoking and ever-cussing mother who would rather wipe the floor with her daughter than say a nice word to her. So destructive that even her rifle-shooting husband loses it and flees leaving a poor child completely unprotected. And when it turns from verbal abuse to the physical one, by her mother, by her boyfriend and later her husband, it's clear that it's not just not pretty - it's damn ugly, and that it's gonna get even uglier still.<br/><br/>The trio of Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney does an unbelievable job of focusing a huge amount of anger, hate and frustration onto the single character, Tonya Harding, making almost every second of her screen time a pure pain to watch. You see her going through things you'd be waking in cold sweat from if you saw them in your dream. But, then again, for someone it was not a dream but an everyday routine. A vicious circle of abuse and humiliation, and the only way to forget it, even just for a minute, was through that ice rink, doing the only thing that would make you feel like something more than a pathetic loser with no single bright perspective ahead.<br/><br/>And with that ugliness comes the true power of this film, of Robbie's performance, and of the real Tonya. The power that channels all the hate she received from all around into the thirst for skating, as if that ice rink is your arena where you fight for your life - or die trying. And when it's your life at stake, things are never chivalrous or graceful - so the way the Hollywood sex symbol dies and gives birth to a relentless competitive monster is a true miracle. And, just like a miracle of a real birth, it's full of pain for both the participant and for the ones witnessing it.<br/><br/>What makes I, Tonya an even more shattering experience is that it's not just a made-up story, it's something that a living human being once went through. When you see her husband beat her and threaten her and even shoot a gun at her, you wish you could simply tell yourself that it's just cinema - but this time it's not quite so. When you see her mother come to her, pretending to be offering a helping hand when she's the most vulnerable - to end up being yet another vulture that came to feast on the prey that looks done but still keeps twitching - you wish you could say that no real child has come through such pain and betrayal, but you can't once again. You see a girl whose story was simply meant to be a tragedy from the very beginning - and you just wish it to be over. But she takes another hit, falls, yet for some reason refuses to stay on the floor.<br/><br/>I guess I realize why this film missed the Best Picture Oscar, just like Margot Robbie missed the Best Leading Actress one. Just like the real world Tonya who outskates her rivals but fails to meet the expectations about her presentation, this film is technically the most riveting and intense story this year, with the leading performance being a big shiny diamond of a masterpiece, twice as precious because it wasn't an established Oscar winner who delivered it but a girl who till now was the most famous for doing a full frontal nude shot a few years ago.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that the scores are rigged and that the competition was flabby. On the contrary, Three Billboards was a great film that I loved, and McDormand's performance is 100% Oscar worthy. The point is that I, Tonya is just not the image the Western cinematographic establishment is ready to associate women with yet - ugly and abused and blood-spitting. But, if in the figure skating world you could at least say that such are the house rules, and a pretty dress and a smile are something that matters at least as much as - if not more than - a triple axel, then the film industry community screaming ""equal rights to women!"" at every corner and not acknowledging the most glaring case of one woman, fighting for her right for her skills to be valued and for herself to be treated as a human being, and another woman, incarnating all that fight and suffering that comes with it on the screen, is pure hypocrisy. Inclusion rider or not."

","As much as I knew about the ice-skater Tonya Harding was her association with the Nancy Kerrigan incident at the Winter Olympics and her being the only American woman to, up to that point, successfully pull off a triple salkot in competition. I know that she was disgraced as a result of her at-a-distance connection to the Kerrigan assault but that she'd come back into the public eye, competing recently in the American version of ""Strictly Come Dancing"". So what an eye-opener this low-budget feature was.<br/><br/>It unflinchingly shows her upbringing, from a broken home, natch by a mother who clearly put the ""hard"" into Harding. Chain-smoking, foul-mouthed and bullying, she's the ice skating equivalent of the infamous ""show-biz moms"" you read about, hitting her daughter with everything but a little maternal love, deluding herself that her cruelty to her only child is self-sacrifice on her part designed to toughen up her little girl for the big bad world that's out there. Her father, you get the impression might just have made a difference, but you couldn't really blame him for baling out on his no-redeeming-features wife. <br/><br/>There's dark comedy in these early scenes as mommie dearest Lavona ignores every social convention to promote her tomboy daughter's one given talent, her ice-skating ability but its typical of Tonya's luck that the man who comes into her life romantically turns out to be a jealous, possessive guy who behind his geeky moustache and weedy appearance threatens her, hits her and even shoots at her anytime she tries to break away from him. Not that Tonya is any shrinking violet, she gives as good as she gets in their numerous arguments and drop-down fights but unfortunately he's back in play just as she's readying herself for a crack at the Olympics where her biggest rival will be clean-cut, all-American Nancy Kerrigan, whose stylishly cut, virginal white skating costume contrasts vividly with Harding's old-fashioned, frills and bows homemade outfit.<br/><br/>The ""incident"" itself, a cockeyed plan by hubby and his meathead bodyguard chum, sees the latter beat Kerrigan on the leg after a training session, becomes international news as the Winter Olympics of 1992 come around pitching the rivals head-to-head with a recovered Kerrigan finishing a close-up second but a psyched-out Harding come in a lowly eighth and that after a controversial re-skate when she dramatically stops her first routine as her boot lace comes undone.<br/><br/>This movie is the women's ice-skating equivalent of ""Raging Bull"", a warts and all portrayal of a kid from the wrong side of the tracks striving to make something of herself with everything seemingly stacked against her. Her greatest moment is shown not as winning Skate America or coming second in the World Championships but the first time she nails that near impossible jump on the ice. From there it's downhill all the way as we see her struggle with her notoriety in the aftermath of all the publicity post-conviction, trying to scratch a living, even trying pro-boxing for a spell.<br/><br/>The performances by the three leads, Margot Robbie as Harding, Allison Janney as the mother from hell and Sebastian Stan as her unhinged husband are terrific. The direction style is a clever mix of eye-on-the-wall documentary realism including recreated to-camera interviews with the main participants and fourth-wall-breaking asides together with convincing depictions of the ice-skating sequences.<br/><br/>It all makes for a deliberately awkward but compulsive insight into Stateside trailer-trash living and also how hard it is for those on the inside to break free from this rough and tumble upbringing and make something of themselves. In this biopic, Tonya Harding tried as hard as she could but was literally born to lose, the little victories and happiness she achieved along the way, scant recompense for a reputation tarnished forever by events outwith her control."

","Do you want to be shocked? Here goes: ""I, Tonya"" is a great movie. That's right. A film about a tabloid scandal in the world of women's figure skating is not just a good movie, it's a great one. I cannot think of any other film that made me laugh out loud and cry so hard, and to do both at once, in reaction to the same scene. <br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" is as frightening and heartbreaking a depiction of child abuse as I have ever seen. It is as profound a meditation on class. Its depiction of ""white trash, redneck, trailer trash"" loves, lifestyles, dreams, delusions, smeared kitchens, underdone bedrooms, and dimly-lit living rooms ripped my heart right out of my chest. If you love movies and you care about social class in America, and how the 24/7 news cycle brainwashes gullible audiences and destroys lives, you owe it to yourself to see ""I, Tonya."" <br/><br/>Allison Janney just won the Golden Globe for her portrayal of LaVona Fay ""Sandy"" Golden, Tonya Harding's mother. Janney's performance is one of the most powerful performances I have ever seen in any movie. When Janney is onscreen, you can't take your eyes off her. There is something very compelling about a mother who abuses her own daughter. You want to understand. You want to find the mechanism that runs this monster. You search for some sign of humanity, of redemption, of love. Though ""I, Tonya,"" is sometimes a campy movie, Janney is never campy. She is a force of nature, like a scorpion or Bubonic plague. There is a scene in ""I, Tonya,"" where Tonya's mother performs an act of betrayal of her daughter so severe that it took my breath away. This betrayal, the real Tonya Harding says, took place in real life. What a lousy ""mother."" <br/><br/>There is a special hatred for white trash in America. This hatred has no easy name like ""racism."" We all know that racism is evil, but Americans are always eager to mock and denigrate working-class whites, especially poor white women. The 24/7 tabloid news cycle bashed Tonya Harding far harder, and for far longer, than Gillooly's goons bashed Nancy Kerrigan's knee. <br/><br/>Tabloids told gullible audiences too lazy to think for themselves that Tonya Harding herself planned the attack. The legal record, and the film ""I, Tonya,"" tell a different story. Teenaged Tonya married the first man she dated. He beat her, as did her mom. It was he, and his delusional friend Shawn Eckhardt, court records say, who orchestrated the attack on Kerrigan. Tonya learned of this after the attack and did not turn him in. She was punished for that. Though she had no means of earning a livelihood outside of skating, she was forced out of skating for life. <br/><br/>In fact, the world of women's figure skating never much liked Tonya Harding. She was a superior athletic skater, but she wasn't pretty, patrician and ethereal as the judges preferred. Tonya Harding has been screwed over by many for a long time, and for all the wrong reasons. I'm glad she has this film to tell another side to her story. <br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" does not whitewash or glamorize her. She is shown fighting and breaking up with Gillooly, and then going back to this man she knows is bad for her. Tonya is foul-mouthed and she gets angry at judges who cheat her on scores. She sabotages her own training by drinking, smoking, and partying. Margot Robbie is terrific. She does almost all of her own skating, after months of training. The had to CGI the triple axel, because only Tonya Harding, and a handful of other women, could do that. <br/><br/>""I, Tonya""'s depiction of Jeff Gillooly and his bizarre goons is both hysterically funny and dreadful. Sebastian Stan plays Gillooly. Though he is repeatedly shown beating Tonya, I never lost sympathy for him. I loathed him as a loser, but I could see his skewed humanity. He acknowledges, with regret, destroying his wife's exceptional skating career. The real Jeff Gillooly acknowledged the same thing, and also expressed regret. <br/><br/>Shawn Eckhardt, who was happy to identify himself as the attack mastermind, may have been mentally ill. In an interview with Diane Sawyer, he claimed to be a terrorism expert. In fact, he was a loser who lived at home with his parents. He died young. Both Jeff Gillooly and Shawn Eckhardt changed their names after the attack. Gillooly, now Jeff Stone, has had repeated run-ins with the law. His second wife committed suicide. <br/><br/>Tonya Harding has worked hard to keep her head above water. That, after all she'd been through, she did not become a criminal, is testimony to her inner strength. That so many people gave in to bread-and-circuses demonization of her, without knowing all the facts of the case, says nothing good about people's eagerness to hate, and the tabloid press' eagerness to profit from hate."
"namashi_1","6","56","84","11 December 2017"," Allison Janney Steals The Show In This Wild Biopic!
","Before I give my thoughts on 'I, Tonya', let me just say two words: Allison Janney. The Multiple Time Emmy-Winning Actress delivers one of the STRONGEST Performances of the year, in her portrayal of LaVona Fay Golden, Tonya Harding's Mother from hell. Janney is pure Oscar-GOLD.<br/><br/>And now coming to the film...<br/><br/>'I, Tonya' like any other sports Biopic, shows us a woman from being a bullied nobody to becoming a somebody in the world of sports. Over-here, we explore Tonya Harding's hardened journey, that is at times powerful & at times exhausting.<br/><br/>'I, Tonya' Synopsis: Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie, in great form) rises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband (Sebastian Stan, very good) intervenes.<br/><br/>'I, Tonya' is about Tonya's violent journey, that started from an impossible, no-holds-barred mother to a violent, brutal husband, who eventually ruined her career. But, Tonya is not a victim of her circumstances. Here is a woman, who despite being thrown into a world of ice-skating & rigorous competition, left a strong mark. She may have not done the right things to get to the position she got, but she was a talented personality who had the power to mesmerize & inspire.<br/><br/>Steven Rogers' Screenplay begins superbly & the personal interviews of its characters throughout the film, give it that extra edge. The first-hour is solid & gets into Tonya's world & the people involved with a wicked sense of humor. The second-hour is a little disappointing & overlong, and the sub-plot involving the 1994 attack on Nancy Kerrigan, Harding's rival and Olympic teammate, offers less impact. The Writing isn't always compelling & takes away some glory from the film, overall. The Dialogue, however, are crackling & foul to the core.<br/><br/>Craig Gillespie's Direction captures all the madness & ambition, with skill. The Director is in good form this time around. Nicolas Karakatsanis's Cinematography & Tatiana S. Riegel's Editing are strongly done. Art & Costume Design, as well as Make-Up, deserve a special mention.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Janney is outstanding & is sure to pick up many awards for her portrayal here. I wouldn't be surprised if she takes the Oscar home, next year! Margot Robbie, also is in very form, delivering a credible turn as Tonya. Sebastian Stan is entirely convincing as the violent husband. And Paul Walter Hauser is terrific as Shawn, one of Stan's friends, who leads Tonya & Stan, into much trouble.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'I, Tonya' is an imperfect biopic about an imperfect woman. Do watch it though, especially for Janney's sterling performance."

","While I found this movie somewhat entertaining, I got a strong sense of falsity as well. It's hard to describe but the most obvious thing was the nostalgia. Not sure what to do with the plot? Play a hit song every 5 minutes, that'll solve the problem. And then there was Tonya's redneck lifestyle. Who am I to say that her life wasn't as terrible as depicted but to me there was a lot that seemed a little over the top. Margot Robbie's performance in particular was all attitude all the time, swearing like a sailor. With the mockumentary style, I feel like they stylized certain elements which probably ended up bending the truth of what actually happened. There were a few times when the movie veered away from its' sarcastic style and for me those were the most engaging parts of the movie. The one that stands out is when the judge bans Tonya from figure skating. That was just heartbreaking. The movie changed some of the views I had about the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident. But overall I feel like the makers of this film had a specific kind of story they wanted to tell and weren't necessarily interested in authenticity. But that's movies for you."

"BassLightyear","8","4","4","16 August 2019"," A very interesting approach to an otherwise no go story.
","When I first found out about this film, a question instantly popped into my head: How do you make a film about one of the most hated persons in America, and make it work? I mean there must be some artistic choices going into the equation here, just telling it ""as it is"" would've been impossible. And I was right. ""I, Tonya"" is a funny, snappy, fourth wall breaking dramatic comedy (or ""tragicomedy"", if I can say that without getting lectured by the stage fanatics).<br/><br/>They solved the problem of not necessarily telling the truth, by making a variation of a multi-plot; having the actual, character-based, living and breathing people tell their own versions of what happened. They have different stories about the same story, which is the outset for a multi-plot. The only anomaly here is that all stories have the same protagonist - Tonya. Another way of looking at it, a more conventional way for sure, is to regard the ""ice skating story"" as the central storyline, the a-plot; their ""mother-daughter-relationship"" (incited by Tonya's father leaving her as a young child) is b-plot and ""romantic relationship with stash-guy"" is c-plot. Both subplots serves the dramatic purpose of complicating the central story line, making our protagonist's life more difficult.<br/><br/>The film is about her, Tonya Harding's, ice skating career, but her intense desire (overwhelming at some points) to be loved and accepted for who she is drives the telling. This dynamic relationship between action and desire results in troubled personal relationships when she can't skate to her satisfactory standard of perfection. This is a key ingredient in creating any interesting, empathetic and multidimensional character - by giving the protagonist an unconscious desire and letting the audience sense that it is there, contradicting the flitting conscious choices of the protagonist. In this film for example - her unconscious desire is to be loved for who she is and not for what she can do, but her conscious desire contradicts this idea, as she wants to be the best at what she does, so that she can be loved. And we, as the audience, can sense this contradiction in how Tonya always seeks her mother's approval and always goes back to stash-guy, hopelessly seeking that fulfilment, which is to love and be loved as a human being and not as an ice skater.<br/><br/>I believe this approach to making the film was necessary, as everybody already knew about the ""incident"". And Steven Rogers (screenwriter) did a great job directing the attention and focal points of the story elsewhere. The theme of the film isn't ""the protagonist failed in her career, because she physically whacked her rival before a competition"". No, it goes much deeper than that. This story is more about what we do to ourselves and others in pursue of our shallow, soul-corrupting desires - fame, money, a celebrity's kind of love - and what consequences we suffer as a result. At least, that's what I took away from the story.<br/><br/>To wrap this up, I just want to give the remarkable Margot Robbie (Tonya Harding) a solid 9/10 for an outstanding performance; a beautifully portrayed protagonist!<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great film! 8/10"

","I, Tonya (Directed by Craig Gillespie and written by Steven Rogers) is a ground-breaking new film about the unstated class system in America.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is that rare movie that puts you, the audience, into the center of what the movie is about.<br/><br/>I, Tonya tells the story of what really happened when a world-class ice skater from the wrong side of the tracks had her main rival whacked, literally.<br/><br/>I, Tonya tries to do for film what Picasso did for art and William Faulkner did for the novel - to capture reality from more than one side, one point of view.<br/><br/>OK, this movie works on so many levels, every time I started to write this review, I kept changing it. So I decided to use all of them because that is what this movie is about: reality in all of its many dimensions.<br/><br/>The story is simple and one that many of you will remember. Tonya Harding (Margo Robbie) was a great American ice skating champion who was the first woman to do a triple axel (three and a half rotations) during a competition. Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) was a great American ice skating champion and in direct competition with Harding for the Ice Skating Champion of the 1994 Olympics. One day, coming from practice, Kerrigan is whacked in the knee by an unknown assailant.<br/><br/>What is not so simple is the world that Harding came from. Her mother (Allison Janney) is one of the great Dearest Mommy mothers ever portrayed in film. And she even hits Nancy with a hair brush. The more success Nancy has, the more her mother insists that it is because she pushed and slammed and even knifed Nancy to be the best.<br/><br/>When Nancy meets Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), she is only 15 years old, but she desperately needs someone to love her and Jeff is it. Sadly, he, too, cannot keep his slaps and punches to himself and worse, he is not too bright. When Nancy tells her mother that she and Jeff are going to be married, her mother advises, ""<br/><br/>Jeff has a friend who is even dumber than he is, Sean (Paul Walter Hauser). When Nancy gets a death threat just before the American championships, Sean suggests that they get back at Tonya's biggest competitor, Nancy Kerrigan, by doing the same to her. From such stupid, small ideas comes a scandal that made tabloid news seep into mainstream news so that today, one cannot tell one from the other. In 1994, Tonya became the second most recognized person in the world behind President Bill Clinton.<br/><br/>The story is told by the major characters in interview format that is inter-spliced with action scenes of what is being described. Director Gillespie keeps switching the format so that we are constantly being thrown from one person's reality to another's. By the time we get to 'the incident' (and Harding tells us, OK, that is what you are all here for), we are not certain who to believe and what really happened. What we are certain about is our complicity in the circus that surrounded the tragedy of Harding's life. As she tells us, she was abused all of her life and (looking straight into the camera) ""lastly by you.""<br/><br/>The acting is some of the best you will see this year. Robbie is incredible. The makeup, the spectacular skating of Harding and, especially, the parental and spousal violence are so real that they make us understand more than ever that the movies are now at a stage where they can create reality, any reality, that they want to create. What is real becomes just as nebulous as what is true.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is about class, both as in classy and as in class status. Harding was from the wrong side of the tracks and her 'class' is not something she could hide any more than she could hide her ambition. As she continues to be the best female ice skater in America, but is never named the best by judges for the American Ice Skating Association, her frustration mounts until she finally confronts a judge in a parking lot who is visibly scared of her. He admits that her mediocre scores have nothing to do with her skating but rather they are because the Association does not want her to be the face of American Ice Skating.<br/><br/>In the irony to end all ironies, that is exactly what Tonya Harding becomes."

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>I, Tonya tells the story of Tonya Harding as she grows up to become a professional figure skater and then falls into the depths of controversy. The story is interesting and very entertaining. The story does lose some steam in the middle but towards the end it picks back up. I wish they had gone into her sex tape controversy because it would have added to her story.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Margot Robbie performs very well as Tonya Harding. Sebastian Stan, Julianne Nicholson, Paul Walter Hauser (who is hilarious), and Bojana Novakovic (who is such a sweet lady) all perform very well. Allison Janney delivers the best performance throughout the entire film. Her brutality towards Tonya is so real its scary.

","TL;DR<br/><br/><ul><li>Unique style makes it personal and stand out</li><li>Great soundtrack</li><li>Goodfellas vibe to the whole thing</li><li>Tracks a lot of Tonya's life but the focus narrows in on ""the incident"", improving structure</li><li>Phenomenal performances, particularly Margot Robbie and Allison Janney in particular</li></ul><br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>You have to admit, I, Tonya came out at a pretty perfect time; with the Oscars just around the corner and the Winter Olympics in full swing, Margot Robbie's latest ticks both boxes with a film about ice skating worthy of its three Academy Award nominations. Bringing a sporting legend to life, I, Tonya is a well-made, strangely captivating film.<br/><br/>The style chosen by director Craig Gillespie and writer Steven Rogers is a unique, interesting one and works very well. Starting from her childhood and tracking her life up until the present (more or less), it's absolutely a biopic, but it's given a dash of personality and realism by occasionally having the style of a documentary, with the actors recreating the real-life interviews and the editing cutting the talking-heads to fit in seamlessly with the rest of the film - the nomination for editing is well-deserved. Having the actors break the fourth wall and talk to the audience, both in the talking heads and fitting into the action, makes the story seem a lot more personal and works well, also fitting with Tonya's rebellious persona. In fact the constant personal narration (along with the fantastic soundtrack) gives off a strong Goodfellas vibe that works well.<br/><br/>Most of the film is about the characters though, the latter half specifically being about how they react and handle the aftermath of ""the incident"". The cast are all wonderful, without a weak link. Even the comic relief in Paul Walter Hauser doesn't detract from the film's tone and is used in moderation to lighten things up. It's especially refreshing to see Sebastian Stan flex his acting talents more than we often see him in the Marvel films, with his Bucky character relegated to just brooding and not giving off much of a character. Here however he's given a chance to deliver a well-rounded, complex performance, playing a character we really shouldn't like, but Stan makes the pathetic and aggressive Jeff almost sympathetic. This complex performance extends especially to the Oscar nominated performances by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney. Robbie makes a wonderful lead, fully embracing the ""bad-girl"" persona of Tonya Harding, while still making her empathetic and likeable. With such a charismatic, intricate performance, it's not surprising she's been nominated. Janney in particular is one of the most interesting characters though, easily stealing every scene she's in and really making the part her own. It would be so easy for her character to be seen as an abusive villain, but instead she makes her more complex than that. Like with all the characters, Janney's excellent performance portrays her character as neither good nor bad, neither likeable nor unlikable. She's a flawed person and is perhaps the best thing in the film.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is nothing if not refreshing; a uniquely styled biopic which breaks the fourth wall, is effortlessly entertaining and captivates audiences worldwide with flawless performances of very flawed characters. This one easily steals a gold medal."
"Turfseer","5","49","100","17 November 2017"," Janney shines as ""mother from hell"" but Robbie as ""trailer trash"" skating champ is all wrong for the part
","I, Tonya, is director Craig Gillespie's take on the mercurial rise and fall of Tonya Harding, the figure skating champion who threw away her career through her association with an abusive ex-husband. Gillespie tells Harding's story through a series of interviews with the principals, most made up to appear how they might look in the present time, speaking directly to the camera, and insisting that their version of events is the correct one.<br/><br/>The real star of the film is not the actress who plays Tonya (Margot Robbie) but Allison Janney, who steals the show as Tonya's mother from hell, LaVona Golden, a serial psychological abuser, who still manages to garner sympathy through her abrasively witty comments directed toward Tonya throughout her childhood and into adulthood (as well as directed toward us, the enraptured audience). One can't help sense that LaVona heaped abuse on her daughter both out of love and jealousy-love in the sense that she wanted Tonya to be more successful in life than she was (LaVona being a waitress at a greasy spoon) and jealous once Tonya had achieved the fame and recognition that eluded her mother who was nonetheless a highly intelligent woman. <br/><br/>If it wasn't for Janney, I, Tonya, might have been a complete flop, as Robbie, the Australian actress who plays Tonya, is all wrong for the part. This is especially true when Robbie plays Tonya as a teenager-she simply looks too old to be believable. What's worse is how Robbie is unable to convey Tonya's likable qualities-that odd mixture of naivety and ""trailer trash"" aggression that initially endeared the public to her. Instead, Robbie comes off as too harsh, compromising her attempts to convey Tonya's more vulnerable side. While Robbie is an accomplished skater (and this is probably the reason why she was cast), I think it was a big mistake for Gillespie to use her for that reason. Without a compelling protagonist, the necessary verisimilitude is lost.<br/><br/>Gillespie's approach, akin to the Japanese classic, Rashomon, works best when Tonya's and husband Jeff Gillooly's differing points of view are contrasted in high relief. Gillooly denied that he ever physically assaulted Tonya but that seems highly unlikely as Tonya's description of what happened has the ring of truth. At a certain point, Tonya had enough of the abuse and decided to walk away from Gillooly-she even had to get a restraining order as he continued to stalk her (once putting a gun to her head, threatening to shoot her). But why did Tonya feel that she needed to go back to Gillooly after separating?-even though she claimed it was only a temporary arrangement. Despite being on the verge of complete success in the skating world, the old demons reared their ugly head-her crushing insecurities from her mother's put-downs and lack of a father figure-this led to her inevitable fall from grace.<br/><br/>The bizarre plot to injure Tonya's rival, Nancy Kerrigan concocted by Gillooly's moronic pal, Sean Eckhardt, is so ludicrous that it's hard to believe that he actually thought he could pull something like this off undetected. I happen to believe both Gillooly and Harding's assertions that they were unaware that the plot was going to turn into a physical attack on Kerrigan. Gillooly insisted the initial plan was to send Kerrigan some threatening letters which might perhaps cause her to withdraw from the tournament or throw her off her game. It makes sense that Gillooly would confront Eckhardt over his lame-brain decision to have one of his confederates actually break Kerrigan's knee cap with a baton, suggesting that Gillooly had no idea what Eckhardt was ultimately up to.<br/><br/>Much of what happens after the attack on Kerrigan, is anti-climactic. Gillespie basically presents a basic recap as to what happened as the story reaches its not so fitful conclusion. Of interest of course are the courtroom machinations, particularly Tonya's decision to take a plea bargain and accept a lifetime ban from figure skating. Benjamin Lee, writing in the Guardian, sums it up perfectly when he writes: ""The zippy fun of the first half dissipates once we reach the overly familiar scenes of the second, the focus on the harebrained criminal scheme feeling particularly sub-Coenesque. It's hardly dull but it's not quite as biting and sharply realized as it could be given the wealth of stranger-than-fiction drama surrounding Harding.""<br/><br/>With a more convincing protagonist in the lead role, I, Tonya, might have been a tad bit more enjoyable; nonetheless, there's still Janney's performance to marvel at. And for all those who long for nostalgia, Tonya's story will bring you back to the heady days of the early 1990s, a time that feels way distant from our own."
"M_Exchange","10","36","73","18 December 2017"," The Best Film of the Year
","First, I'm stating that it's the best film of the year, and I just barely care about women's figure skating. So you know that it's phenomenal. For me, it edges out ""Dunkirk,"" which was my favorite 2017 film until the night I saw it. <br/><br/>Director Craig Gillespie is obviously a Scorsese protégé, and unlike Martin McDonagh's cheap ripoff of the Cohen brothers, he manages to pay homage to the man without imitating him. Like Scorsese (and Bob Fosse) he meshes documentary with realistic drama seamlessly well.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan deliver good performances. Allison Janney and especially Paul Walter Hauser deliver OUTSTANDING performances. In fact, I didn't feel like Hauser was even acting as much as he was just BEING. These performances are also a credit to Gillespie.<br/><br/>Almost every scene is well-paced, has little ""fat,"" conveys meaning and adds to the narrative, which indicates great video editing. The editing was so good that I didn't even check the time, which is rare for me. Outstanding pacing.<br/><br/>When I entered the theater, I didn't think that I was going to get even slightly emotional about Tonya Harding's story. But she is truly a sympathetic character without feeling sorry for herself, which is rare nowadays. Nowadays, everyone seems to be competing for who has it worst and who is the most pathetic victim. In Tonya's world, it's just her life, and it's presented as factual rather than maudlin and soap operatic. As Tonya basically says at the end of the film, ""s--t happens. Deal with it."""

"vinylvanilla","6","47","101","26 December 2017"," This is a movie about a bidimensional, white trash ice skater - not Tonya Harding.
","I finally have watched this movie and I can say I am deeply disappointed. I, as a big fan of figure ice skating was really thrilled about this movie and expected much more. If you don't know much about Tonya Harding's story, I suggest you read about her and watch some of her old and new interviews and you'll understand why I didn't like the movie. <br/><br/>One of the reasons is its screen script. There is no ""official story"" about what happened to Tonya Harding or Nancy Kerrigan. The script was written based on interviews with Tonya and her ex-husband, carried on by the screen writer himself. So, much of what is told in the movie is purely fictional, especially the parts about her mother, since she never agreed to talk to the screen writer or the production staff. Tonya herself said some parts of the movie were inaccurate, and Margot Robbie said that when she first read the script she thought it was about a fictional figure skater, not Tonya Harding. <br/><br/>Besides, many things in this movie remain unexplained. The movie is basically about the verbal, physical and moral abuse Tonya endured throughout her life, but shows too little how Tonya built her athletic and ice skating career. And regarding the Nancy Kerrigan controversy, there isn't much talked about, either. Nancy is just a shadow in this movie, there's nothing about her point of view or how the incident actually affected her or her career. In the end you feel that you don't really know what the life of Tonya Harding the ice skater was really like.<br/><br/>Regarding the direction, I found really tasteless Gillespie's attempt to give a comical tone in the NUMEROUS domestic violence scenes of the movie. The characters break the 4th wall to give the violent scenes a more 'casual' look (because according to Gillespie, Tonya talks about her violent past in a very casual manner), but cinematographically this 'casual tone' didn't work - it only makes it look like the movie romanticizes abuse and underestimates its impact on a woman's life. Also, the whole sarcastic/comical tone of the movie made it feel superficial, boring and childish. To me, a more serious approach to Tonya's life would be more appropriate. <br/><br/>And regarding Margot Robbie's performance, I found it very disappointing and amateurish. Regardless the fact that she's not as bulky or athletic as the real Tonya, she played a white trash, foul-mouthed Tonya Harding that never existed. Her interpretation of a redneck is purely stereotypical. Also, I don't know where Robbie's accent came from, since real-life Tonya doesn't have that strong southern accent - she's from Portland, come on! It's an annoying accent that appears and disappears throughout the movie, alongside with the numerous bad words (some of them included by Robbie herself) and a very artificial, rude way to talk that Harding didn't have. Robbie didn't convince me and made me feel NOTHING for her character. <br/><br/>On the other side, Allison Janney is BRILLIANT as Tonya's mother. She could flawless play a sociopath, and truly deserves at least an Oscar nomination as a supporting actress. Another good surprise in this movie is Paul Walter Hauser's acting. <br/><br/>To sum it all up, this is a mediocre movie, that didn't entertain me (how am I supposed to find funny a story with so much domestic violence?), and didn't move me. It also barely tells who in fact Tonya Harding was. It is a superficial, bidimensional portrait of a woman who's surely much more complex than what was shown in the movie."

","""I, Tonya"" is a film based on an undeniably startling series of events in the ice skating and entertainment-gossip worlds of its era, but it ultimately comes off as a cruel stunt rather than a riveting dissection of all that went down and the societal implications of same, which it pretends to be. From the very first moments of the film the actors come off as actors commenting on, and impersonating, the real-life people they play rather than becoming them (with the usually-reliable Bobby Cannavale the worst offender of all), and that queasy feeling lasts throughout the film, even when it pretends to be sympathetic to their violent, lost, and confused world. Allison Janney, who I usually enjoy tremendously as an actor, summed up what I suspected about the actors' and creators' misguided, even clueless actions regarding the making of this film: On a talk show she condescendingly described the real Tonya Harding's behavior at the recent Golden Globes Awards show while seated at her table by implying Tonya had the clueless audacity to approach Oprah at a nearby table, when, in fact, you also get from the story that Tonya innocently thought Oprah would remember her from interviewing her back during the actual high-profile peak of the events' turmoil. That same condescension toward the (at the time) clueless real people involved showed through in the film itself as well, and it makes for uncomfortable viewing. Yes, it is true the real-life people depicted were then-clueless and confused, lost participants in life-destroying antics, but everyone involved in this present-day production should have realized their depiction of them is just as lost, clueless and confused."

Because I felt continually jerked around, I came out of this movie within antagonism toward the whole enterprise and sympathy for none.<br/><br/>And as for the acting, I personally thought Robbie was terribly miscast as Harding---didn't believe her for a moment, and Janney, while competent and entertaining, can play this type of supporting role in her sleep and did nothing here to convince me otherwise.<br/><br/>I just ended up feeling that maybe this movie was better suited for the Lifetime TV channel--although even there a couple of reality TV documentaries have told the same story in a more interesting manner."

However, over 2 years ago new evidence came to light that proves she was heavily involved in the planning of the attack from the get-go!<br/><br/>The fact that this movie tries to paint her as a victim is a gross misrepresentation of the facts!

"texasnina","1","25","52","13 January 2018"," Should Be Advertised as Pure Fiction
","Don't expect a film that reveals the untold truth about Tonya Harding. This is pure fantasy. If Harding were running for political office, this would have been funded by her supporters (if she had any) to paint her in a completely different light from the truth.<br/><br/>First of all, Margot Robbie is FIVE inches taller than Harding with a much slimmer (less athletic) physique. Putting a 90's hairdo and makeup on her doesn't come close to transforming her into a believable replica of Harding. She also speaks with a southern accent--Harding was from the Portland area, where people are hardly known for their drawls--and the CGI dubbing of Robbie's face onto the skater standing in for her was obvious and awful.<br/><br/>But the worst part is the story. Harding is a criminal who has admitted that she played a role in the attack on her rival, Nancy Kerrigan, who is something of an afterthought in this movie rather than the victim. Harding is portrayed as a victim and suddenly we're supposed to feel sorry for her because she endured a rough upbringing and marriage. Lots of people have crappy childhoods and marriages, but they don't plan assaults on others to get ahead.<br/><br/>Many of the major players in this so-called ""biopic"" were not interviewed by the screenwriter, who tells the story sort of like the media reports on news these days--making stuff up as they go along without substantiating anything. Is it possible that Harding's mother was as much a villain as Janney portrayed? Sure, it's possible, but remember, the old gal worked 3 jobs at times to give Harding the opportunity to skate and if she wasn't interviewed for the film, then we are only hearing one side of the story and it is likely far from the truth. Harding was known for clashing with just about everyone, including those coaches who tried to help her, and she was always rough around the edges, making her less than palatable to the admittedly snobby figure skating world.<br/><br/>Kerrigan remains the victim and this film victimizes her all over again, this time by painting Harding as some pathetic creature whom we should absolve of any complicity or responsibility for her actions simply because her mommy didn't love her. Abuse is not an excuse.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor; save your $12, look at videos on YT, and see what really happened 24 years ago."

I followed the story with mild interest, and without strong feelings about any of it--not pro-Kerrigan, not pro-Harding, nor with any guesses as to what actually happened. That said, Harding never struck me as anything like the (as another reviewer put it) ""white trash hillbilly"" the media tried to portray her as, any more than Kerrigan stuck me as the smug ice queen, although it seemed there could have easily been some truth at the core of both portrayals.<br/><br/>I thought the movie portrayed Harding as far harder and trashier than she came across at the time. I remember her more as unpolished than trashy, and with an underlying vulnerability that the movie talked about, but which I didn't think Robbie ever conveyed. I saw it even in the brief film clips of the real Harding at the end, but perhaps that's just because I remember her that way.<br/><br/>The movie seemed to be trying to give a more balanced portrayal of Harding than the media had at the time. I thought it was kind of sad, that, instead, it ended up portraying an exaggerated caricature of the media-induced Harding."

"chong_an","7","14","27","24 September 2017"," An insider view of Tonya Harding
","Tonya Harding is known in figure skating as the 1st woman to land a Triple Axel in competition, but also for her involvement in the physical attack on fellow skater Nancy Kerrigan. This docu-drama is based on interviews from Tonya, her mother, her coach, and some of the co-conspirators, mixing them with re-creations and some historic footage. It shows the difficulty of a poor kid battling into a sport dominated by upper-middle class princesses. While mostly taking the word of the interviewees, the director inserts hints that Tonya may not be as innocent as she claims. There is also an interesting undermining of Tonya's complaint about Nancy being despondent about winning silver at the 1994 Olympics - listen for the placing announcements before the final skate.<br/><br/>This film is 1st runner-up for the People's Choice Awards at the Toronto International Film Festival. However, for me it was marred by the use of music with lyrics at her 1st skating competition, something that would not have been allowed. On the flip side, I can accept the switch in music after she succeeds in her historic Triple Axel, as a switch from skating music to internal emotion."

"iansammons","5","9","16","21 January 2018"," Everyone is right about Janney, but the rest...
","Let me start off by saying, yes. Janney does a fantastic job. In general the acting is good across the board (though she is the only one that really stands out... as well as Hauser... playing believably, a very unbelievable person). <br/><br/>But, the story left an unpleasant taste in my mouth, as it skirts this awkward line of presenting itself as factual... but avoiding having to actually be so with a few fourth wall breaks, and some joking narrator swaps/contradictions... calling itself ""based on interviews"".<br/><br/>Most notably, Stan (playing the abusive ex) is very capably acted... except in the ""interview"" scenes, where he suddenly becomes fidgety and completely unbelievable; I suspect because the director WANTED him to, in an attempt to subtly bias the viewer against his version of events... despite their efforts to pretend they give equal credence to his and Tonya's. No, the movie clearly takes Tonya's story, and introduces three other characters (ex, mother, and former coach) simply to make it seem like they will present any other evidence than Tonya's word. The fifth ""interview"" is a reporter who is primarily there for gag reel footage. Make no mistake, this is ""I, Tonya"". This is Tonya's version of events... no matter how inaccurate they may prove to be. We threw a few extra narrators in there to account for when she didn't keep her story straight.<br/><br/>What this leaves you with is a wholly artificial story told by someone with an apparent persecution complex:
My father abandoned me. My mother abused me. Ever single person who ever judged me was biased against me (except the two times they sent me to the olympics). My husband beat me. My coach was worthless so I fired her, then she begged me to take her back. The judges made me move my abusive husband back in with me. My skates broke at my first olympics, then again at my second one. And even so I skated better than Nancy and should have won, but they wouldn't let me because everyone is so unfair to me. <br/><br/>At times it can't even keep its own story straight. Tonya goes from being absolutely fine with the death threats she helped plan to utter shock that her husband knew anything about anything... but I suppose any sloppy storytelling can be excused by invisible shifts between whose story we're supposed to be seeing at any given time.<br/><br/>It leaves outrageous claims unchallenged, like one that Tonya, bleeding from a gunshot ricochet gets pulled over with her Ex by multiple police cars after a chase... who finding a shotgun, booze, and a recently fired handgun; just wave her and her ex husband (who she's taken multiple restraining orders out against) on.<br/><br/>The story also glosses over, or even rewrites facts. Remember the note in Tonya's handwriting telling them where to find Nancy? They flash a note on the screen for less than a second, after demonstrating Tonya calling one time (not the four times she is supposed to have... each time trying to get more incriminating information) .<br/><br/>And, as a black comedy; they do a terrible disservice by spending the lions share of the movie focusing on Tonya's abusive relationship, and almost none on the events surrounding the crime itself. Virtually no time is given to the two actors on the scene of the crime... not to mention the victim. They go so far as to rewrite the facts (I assume for the sake of time) to write out the people WHO ACTUALLY SOLVED THE CASE FOR THE FBI, inserting existing characters into those roles creating confusing (and wholly inaccurate by ANYONE's account) scenes.<br/><br/>It's an interesting watch if you want to see two hours of someone excusing poor decisions they've made by blaming others, or if you get a kick out of watching someone beat up their wife because she wants expensive ice cream. If you see it, see it for Janney's performance (which sadly is missing from a good half of the film)."

I just didn't feel for her. <br/><br/>Even if the script was workable, which I don't think it was, as I think they should have gone a different direction, the execution was not good, for the reasons stated. Just bad direction. Could also be because they got an Australian to direct a movie about Americans and there is a just a geographical and cultural disconnect that he didn't get. <br/><br/>Just watch interviews with Tonya Harding and then watch Margot's ""performance"" in the film and you can see it's miles apart and you can do that with every single character in the film.

"TheLittleSongbird","7","6","10","7 March 2018"," Not a whole lot of class, but a lot of talent and entertainment
","As with many of my most anticipated films of the year, 'I, Tonya' had a promising trailer that made me want to see it and an interesting cast, the accolades (wins and nominations) and generally positive word of mouth were just as encouraging. Not to mention that it was based on a fascinating true-life person, Tonya Harding, with an equally fascinating and infamous story.<br/><br/>'I, Tonya' was entertaining and well done with a lot of great qualities, but somehow it felt uneven to me and like something was missing. Can totally see what people see in it, due to absolutely agreeing with what has been singled out as especially good, but it could have done more with such a great subject to work from and does fall short of being one of my favourites of the year. <br/><br/>Starting with the faults, the CGI for the ice skating sequences (which were otherwise very well choreographed and both witty and graceful) was both not necessary and distracting, as well as not being particularly good. <br/><br/>There should have been much more focus on the Nancy Kerrigan story, that is what made Harding infamous and it was a shame that nowhere near the amount of attention that went into Harding's rise and struggles went into this aspect, which featured nowhere near enough and was under-explored. Likewise with Kerrigan herself. <br/><br/>Also found the montage of Harding's abuse by her mother rather crass. Childhood abuse is a very serious and hard-hitting subject, to see it for my tastes trivialised and not taken seriously (instead played for laughs) won't bear well with sufferers and even non-sufferers like me will find it an ill-judged touch. <br/><br/>However, 'I, Tonya' elsewhere is handled very well. Particularly good is a sensational Allison Janney on pretty terrifying form, with her Oscar Win being one of this year's most deserving in a rare of few questionable wins, was rooting for between her and Laurie Metcalf. That is in my opinion, though there were a few that weren't my personal picks for the category, for example 'Lady Bird' being my pick for Best Original Screenplay.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie taking on Harding was a risk and it pays off mostly in a brave and credible performance that is her best to date (though not in the same league as Frances McDormand and Sally Hawkins). She may not look like Harding, is too old for her and could have brought out her vulnerability more (which would have happened if the film was consistently bolder showing the full horrors of the abuse, some times it was harrowing, other times it was too safe), but she is very successful at portraying her as a flawed and troubled human being with a lot of talent who made numerous mistakes but brings enough pathos to make her worth rooting for. <br/><br/>Rest of the cast are just as good, Sebastian Stan has never been better to me and the same goes for gentle and elegant Julianne Nicholson. Paul Walter Hauser entertains hugely as well. The direction is solid enough.<br/><br/>Visually, apart from the CGI, 'I, Tonya' looks great. It's beautifully shot and cleverly edited, while the music is energetic and whimsical and the ice skating choreography graceful. The script is sharp, acerbic and irreverent, with plenty of blackly funny moments. The story has its faults but is gripping and fast-paced with a lot of entertainment value, relatable themes, moments of tender poignancy and some unflinching ones. Was with the film for much of its length, which is why it was so frustrating that the Nancy Kerrigan story wasn't focused on enough. The documentary elements are an acquired taste and not for those looking for accuracy, but they were generally entertaining and clever if not as illuminating as they could have been.<br/><br/>Overall, entertaining and well done if uneven. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"SweaterCannons","4","6","10","26 February 2018"," Overrated
","The accolades for the acting in this movie are mystifying. If you weren't born at the time of the '94 Olympics, you might be convinced that Margot Robbie makes a good Tonya Harding. Sometimes an actor can pull off playing a real person despite not having any physical similarities. Margot Robbie is not one of those actors. She bears no physical resemblance to Harding, nor does she convince through her acting. <br/><br/>Allison Janney's role as Harding's mother, LaVona Golden, is a one-note comic book villain. She plays it well, there's just not much heavy lifting going on there, acting-wise. (For a screen mother with some emotional layers, see Laurie Metcalf in Lady Bird.)<br/><br/>While it's not Tyler Perry-bad, tonally it's broad comedy one minute, jarring scenes of domestic abuse the next. <br/><br/>I was not left cheering Tonya Harding; mostly I was left with a sense of ambivalence."

","I, Tonya is a movie about Tonya Harding, professional figure skater who became popular because of the rivarly with Nancy Kerrigan and incident that made her charged for. That situation made Tonya one of the most popular people in USA.<br/><br/>This movie fulfiled my expectation in terms of biographical segment and learning about this case. Margot Robbie portrayal of Tonya is amazing and we can say this is the best performance so far for Margot. She showed different personalities of the main character from childhood to the final performance in the Olympics 1994. Tonya was so unique and she had specific relationships with two of her biggest support and in the same time stumbling stones in her career, her mother and husband.
Another pleasant suprise is Allison Janey who just won Golden Globe and will be in the Oscar race. Allison plays Tonya Hardings mother LaVona woman with really strange and sometimes harsh behaviour towards her daghter but in some way she pushed her to be good as she was.
Craig Gillespie is director of this movie and he decided to shoot this movie in a little bit cartoonish way but thats what makes this movie funny sometimes. My problem with this movie is that some scenes or should say some situations was repeated so many times in the similar way esspecially towars her relationship with husband Jeff played by Sebastian Stan. 
This movie is divided in two parts, first part refers to getting to know characters and second is about incident and resolving that case. Second part wants to show us how regular people can be stucked in complicated situation similiar to movie Fargo (1996) but this is where that cartoonish shots is the problem because we cant experience that incident and lawsuit seriously and all looks strange in the end but that is risk when you make a movie about famous person and cases of the past.
This movie with all his advantages and disadvantages is decent maybe not what i expected to be but on the other side its not 
disappointment. Margot is the star of this movie and she is big reason why this movie is good and why we will remember Tonya Harding character and personality.
I give this movie 7.7"
"kjproulx","9","8","15","17 January 2018"," A Well-Acted Drama
","As I've said throughout countless reviews in the past, true stories are hardly ever completely honest. The quality of a film that's based on a true story has nothing to do with the fact that the true story was incredible or not because there's no way of knowing if everything's true unless you're the character it's based on. That being said, I, Tonya is one of the latest feature films (based on a true story) to receive a theatrical release. Gaining buzz for awards season, this is a very relevant story for today's climate. Yes, this film was made before all of these allegation stories made their way into the public eye, but I, Tonya deals with this particular notion in a very grand fashion. While I don't particularly like any of the characters throughout this entire movie, here's why I believe this to be a movie that people will love to hate.<br/><br/>Following Tonya Harding, an unlikely figure skater, due to her foul mouth and horrific upbringing, I, Tonya is about her rise to power and continual falls from grace. Falling in love with a man who (deep down) is just as violent a cruel as she is, their relationship finds a way of working out, most of the time. This film asks you to applaud for a despicable woman and try to forget about how she treats the people around her. Yes, she's talented, but it's hard to root for a woman that acts like this, especially when the entire film revolves around her. I'm sure aspects of this story have been exaggerated or made up entirely, but there are clever editing and writing techniques to make certain dramatic sequences quite funny at times.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie, Sebastien Stan, and Allison Janney are all terrific and believable as these characters, with the most notable one being Stan's portrayal of Tonya's husband Jeff. In my opinion, he was the standout of this film, because even though I've seen and enjoyed his performances in the past, most of them fell in comparison to everyone else in each film he appeared in. I'm simply stating that he's the standout to me, due to the fact that I've never seen him deliver a better performance than this and I don't think I ever will. The performances sell this film, but the true star of this movie is the editor (excluding the very off-putting visual effects of the skater's faces).<br/><br/>From cutting seamlessly between scenes with the brilliant use of sound effects, to quick cuts to show the progression of time, to the long takes exploring a character breakdown, there are many technical aspects about this film to gawk at. I found myself enthralled by the way this film was put together in terms of its structure. It's very rare that I leave a movie and find the most interesting aspect to be the editing choices, especially when everything else about the movie is just as great. Quite honestly, aside from a few plot points being brushed over, this was a terrific film from start to finish.<br/><br/>In the end, I, Tonya impressed me on many levels. From its use of fourth wall breaking to each and every performance seeming extremely committed to the use of unique editing, to the direction that seemed calm and focussed throughout the dramatic moments, this is a ride that I believe is worth taking. Although it doesn't quite offer the truth and literally states that certain things may or may not have happened, it's told in a perfect way for a feature film. This movie deserves its award buzz and I believe it's a great movie that people should check out."

I can for sure say that the awards are well deserved. Probably the best thing this film has going for it is the acting. Margot Robbie, Allison Janney, and Sebastian Stan all turn in great performances. Robbie is such a talented actress and she really does a great job at embodying Tonya Harding. But really the actor that shines the brightest is definitely Janney, she plays the b**ch mother and she plays it very well. I mean it's truly one of the best performances I've ever seen. The script tells us so much about these unfortunate characters. Every aspect of the film is put together is a way that just works.

Thankfully, this was bonkers and I loved the fact it was crazily stupid. Tonya Harding was famous for being a bad tempered figure skater in the 90's. This biopic triple axels (oh God I'm too good...) into her family and marital relationships, as well as exploring ""the incident"". A timely release considering the Winter Olympics, showcasing the grace and endurance required for figure skating. Pushing the sport aside, the focus is primarily on Tonya and her marriage to Jeff whilst intertwining her tough upbringing by her mother. Seemingly Tonya is portrayed to be spoilt and a fame seeker, but I consistently sympathised with her. Her pure skating talent being diminished by judges due to her presentation skills and media attention to the sport. It's a harsh reality, and the film made me feel for her. Played eloquently by Margot Robbie who was able to capture both her solid exterior and emotional vulnerability. Allison Janney was outstanding as the straight talking mother from hell who just loves to throw kitchen utensils at her own daughter (seriously...what the hell). I wished the story delved into their relationship further, just so she could have more screen time. Sebastian Stan also deserves recognition as he conveys both anger and love perfectly. Gillespie's directing style was interesting. Some nice one take edits and the figure skating segments were electrifying, albeit with a noticeable green screen. They tried too hard changing the traditional biopic formula by making it quirky. Consistently breaking the fourth wall, mixing narratives, embedding an interview with a linear plot. It works, however the constant use of these grew tiresome especially for a two hour runtime. Having said that, the plot never skates on thin ice and glides along swiftly. This is Robbie's baby, she and the film deserve recognition."

","This biopic on the Tonya Harding figure skating scandal is both entertaining and informative. Headlined by performances by Margot Robbie, Allison Janney, Sebastian Stan and Paul Walter Hauser, the film tells the story of Harding's upbringing through her figure skating career that eventually lead her to the Olympics. The performances in ""I, Tonya"" are strong throughout. Margot Robbie manages to play the lead role well, with the perfect pitch of darkness and sarcasm. She manages to get the audience to root for an otherwise deeply unlikable (for obvious reasons) protagonist who one might consider to be an ""anti-hero"" in the structure of this narrative. Allison Janney is excellent (as always,) and the other supporting characters bring a unique amount of depth and character analysis to the story. The fact that the incident is approached from a variety of sides and perspectives is unique and provides a sense of originality within the film. The film is also rounded out by an astonishingly good soundtrack loaded with classic rock songs.<br/><br/>""I Tonya"" isn't perfect, however. The film is paced very poorly, as it manages to start introducing the viewer to the circumstances surrounding Tonya Harding and the 1992 Olympics just under halfway through. The lack of resolution after the climax is also a concern. Despite these structural imperfections, however, this is an entertaining and well-made sports biopic also working as a pitch-black comedy--that I do recommend. 7/10"

there is a lot of confusing decisions made in this movie,
the fact that they made the same actors do their teen-aging years and their 20 years later versions was kinda hard to believe
and the way 'the incident"" was delivered was a bit confusing too
in fact, the way the whole story was delivered was not the greatest.<br/><br/>the performances was the only thing that made that whole movie bearable really,
Margot Robbie did a great job playing her character and so did Allison Janney, her performance was so convincing i wanted to punch her in the face through out the entire movie
sebastian stan's performance was kind of confusing though.
i mean, he did have some moments that made me so believe him, but other than that i thought his squeaky attempt to impersonate jeff's voice (which turned out not being that squeaky in the real interview) was kinda disturbing, but that is a director's thing though, which brings us back to the wrong decisions <br/><br/>the movie in general made me question the reason why they did it, it somehow felt at some point that the producers themselves didn't know the actual truth behind the incident too<br/><br/>after all, it still had some touching moments and kinda felt enjoyable at some moments, although this feeling doesn't last so long
but it's still a movie telling a story about a girl who stood for her dream but in no ordinary way."
"markgorman","9","4","6","27 February 2018"," A rags to rags story of your ordinary American trailer trash skating icon.
","Alongside some of its more highbrow Oscar contenders I expected I, Tonya to be a little lightweight and, whisper it, maybe one that's really more for the ladies than the gents. <br/><br/>Not so. This movie has balls.<br/><br/>It tells the true life story. (Wait a minute, who says it's true? Ed. Ah, good point Ed. the opening is heavily disclaimered regarding the truth and whose story is correct.)<br/><br/>It tells a multi-faceted rendering of the happenings that surrounded Tonya Harding's rise from poor American trailer trash to, well, just managing American trailer trash, with a tilt at winning the Olympic figure skating Gold medal, as favourite, along the way.<br/><br/>It's a rags to rags story in which poor Tonya has to suffer more than probably any global superstar ever before to make her claim for fame; ending instead in infamy.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie not only stars as the eponymous lead but produced the film and, in similar fashion to Charlize Theron in Monster, ditches her stunning good looks for hair, make up and wardrobe (train tracks and all) that makes her, frankly, a mess.<br/><br/>Her back story, brilliantly and hilariously told in pretty short order, deals with a life (allegedly) mired in terrible abuse; firstly from her disgusting 'Skating Mom' played brilliantly (and a cert for an Oscar) by Alison Janney (West Wing) and her equally disgusting young husband (Sebastian Stan). The opening scene, as a three year old skating prodigy being brought to her first skate class, is hysterical and sets the tone for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Somehow, despite this tram-smash of a life, Harding rises above it all and bulldozes her way through the middle-class American skating hierarchy into prime position thanks not only to her generally brilliant ability but, in particular, to her nailing the Triple Axel.<br/><br/>That's when it all goes wrong.<br/><br/>You'll know why, so I won't bore you with the details. But suffice it to say the hapless events that follow are particularly well enacted by her 'security' Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser); reminding me of Four Lions.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say this movie is great. The acting is universally superb. The skating scenes are entirely convincing, the humour (black as the ace of spades) is laugh out loud time and again, and the way that Harding is dealt her cards, and the beatings she takes both physical and mental, are abhorrent and repulsive.<br/><br/>Robbie is a revelation in the role and has joined the Hollywood A list as a consequence. I can't wait to see her in Mary Queen of Scots (alongside, count them, no fewer than eight other announced roles) and whilst she won't beat Frances McDormand to the coveted Best Female Lead in March this performance has set a new bar for which she can only progress beyond.<br/><br/>Bravo. If I had a red rose I'd throw it on the ice right now.<br/><br/>(The soundtrack, all the best worst American MOR ever, is great too.)"

","I, Tonya treats the story of Tonya Harding as if you already know the punchline, and you probably do. It doesn't build up to the ""incident"" in climactic mystery-drama style, like some sort of ""Memento on Ice"". Instead, it focuses on correcting the public consciousness of an uncomfortably complex figure. It isn't a single-minded recreation or a myopic vision of an easy character. It's a celebration of the ethically grey, allowing the bigger truths to shine through the conflicting details. One of the most stylish, energetic, and hilarious films of the year, I, Tonya is a stone-cold scorcher.
A biopic of Olympic-skater-turned-American-pariah Tonya Harding, we're given a fully-formed view of what made the superstar one of the most controversial people in sports, and one of the most compelling cultural characters ever. On simple filmic levels (perfect performances, fun long-takes, seamless ice skating cinematography), it's nearly impeccable. The film glides along gracefully, before repeatedly being hit by a baton of style, violence & unique honesty. Using conflicting first-hand accounts, recreated interviews and fascinating fourth-wall-breaking, it manages to make a ubiquitous news story an eye-opening experiment of stylish filmmaking.
Not that the style is mindless pretension. All the kinetic editing and unique writing play into the real point: that truth is more complicated than heroes and villains. Harding worked hard, tried to dress the part, piled up the makeup to hide her bruises (both literal and figurative). Yet no matter how she changed her image, she couldn't change others' perceptions, or even the truth of who she was. She was human. She was complicated, and so was her story. And I, Tonya treats her with that respect, all while staying endlessly entertaining."
"Hellmant","9","4","6","10 January 2018"," Really made me sympathize with Tonya Harding, and root for her!
","'I, TONYA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A sports comedy biopic about figure skater Tonya Harding, and how she and her ex-husband were accused of hiring a man to break the leg of her competitor, Nancy Kerrigan. The film stars Margot Robbie as Harding, and it costars Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, Julianne Nicholson, Paul Walter Hauser, Caitlin Carver and Bobby Cannavale. It was directed by Craig Gillespie (who also helmed 2007's outstanding 'LARS AND THE REAL GIRL'), and it was written by Steven Rogers. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was also nominated for three Golden Globes; including Best Motion Picture-Comedy, Best Actress-Comedy, and Best Supporting Actress (which it won). The movie (surprisingly) really made me sympathize with Tonya Harding, and root for her. <br/><br/>The film follows Tonya Harding's (Robbie) figure skating career, and life, from the time she was a three-year-old girl, until the attack on Nancy Kerrigan (Carver) which ended her career. The film shows how Harding was horrendously abused, both physically and emotionally, by her mother (Janney) and her husband (Stan). She was also treated extremely unfairly by figure skating judges, and society as a whole, because of her poor upbringing and appearance. The movie also takes the perspective that Harding had no knowledge of the attack on Kerrigan before it happened.<br/><br/>The film actually made me feel guilty for thinking so negatively of Tonya Harding, because I always assumed that she was somewhat of a bad person. Of course the movie doesn't present her like that. It actually makes her out to be a tremendously abused, and oppressed sports hero, who at one time was the greatest figure skater in the world (which is something I didn't really know). She lost it all, of course, due to society bigotry (the film suggests). So I really found the movie to be interesting and involving, and it reminds me to always give people the benefit of the doubt (and to not jump to biased conclusions). Any film that can do all this, deserves a lot of respect in my opinion."

","IMDB ratings suck. I don't want to waste time reviewing this, it was not worth the time even for a free ticket. The direction was poor and the lead actor was not a good match to play Tonya. Characters were totally caricatured and totally lacking depth and nuance. There is a scene towards the end, supposed to evoke some emotion from the audience, but it falls totally flat. None of the characters are likable or particularly relatable. Pity that such an interesting character was made it into a totally uninteresting movie."

If I had a small gripe, it would be some of the CGI used; while not necessarily bad, it was noticeable at times. Other than that, I loved this movie from beginning to end."

That story-line is the 17th most important in the story-line after the fact that her idiot husband can't fix a car.

","I usually do not get into biographies. The main problem I have with biographies is that they tell the life of a celebrity that I really do not care much about in the first place. I, Tonya won me over with the trailers. By the time I was done watching the film, I was more then won over. I was conquered. This was very well done. Its packed with live footage, commentary, and raw emotion, and never steers away from feeling like an actual movie rather then just a bunch of facts and lots of talking. To lighten the mood, it has the right elements of humor added. The mood had to be lightened for me, because I found this to be a very sad movie. If you've ever judged Tonya for what she did or did not do way back in 1994, you really need to watch this movie. Do you know that at the time this happened, I remembered a media coverage saying that Tonya was the one who hit Nancy with the stick. It wasn't her. It cannot be denied that Tonya got screwed, double screwed, and triple screwed along with her triple jump, which she is the first woman who performed such a trick. She got screwed by the media with their false accusations. She got double screwed by a court that unjustifiably put the heat on her, instead of the real culprits. And she got triple screwed by having such a controlling, manipulative  mother. I loved I, Tonya for what it was. It follows her from three and a half years old, all the way to her laughingstock boxing career. I found this a great treat, as it cleared up a lot of the bogus lies the media was feeding us at the time. Again, I found this altogether a very sad movie, I did feel very sorry for Tonya, but the film serves its purpose...if you're ever wondering what really happened, and what has happened since then, to Tonya, you will not be disappointed with I, Tonya. The movie also has a great soundtrack."
"RforFilm","10","6","11","1 March 2018"," Is Tonya Harding a tragic figure skater or an airhead who went too far to be the best? I, Tonya is great at never clearly drawing a line
","In the world of sports, there's a level of concentration and motivation that most athletes reach in which they have to decide when far is too far. Like any job, there's always going to be individuals who will want to be the best (only to encounter someone whose probably better). How to proceed from there depends on the people asking themselves that. Do they try to be friendly? Or is there no room for friends and must remain competitive? If you think that everyone is going to play fair, then your wrong. The world is full of people that will stoop to such lows that you'll question their humanity. Life's not fair, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Going back to the sporting world, there are many horrible people that become famous anyhow. Whether people will know of their actions varies, but it seems that even the public is aware of the things that are done. <br/><br/>One such case considers the former ice skater, Tonya Harding. In the late eighties and early nineties, she was a promising athlete who would become a media sensation for what she did off the ice rink. Regardless of whose the bad guy, I, Tonya takes a look at the controversy and those with her. <br/><br/>As a young four year old, Tonya is encouraged by her tough and abusive mother LaVona (played by Allison Janney) to pursue her interest in ice skating. Though local coach Diane Rawlinson (played by Julianne Nicholson) doesn't want to teach someone that young, she is impressed and agrees to help. By the time she reaches sixteen, Tonya (played by Margot Robbie) has won several competitions and is seen as one of the best in America, but can't seem to win the national competitions due to her music choices, white trash background, and more rebellious attitude. <br/><br/>When her mother goes too far, she moves out with her boyfriend and later husband Jeff Gillooly (played by Sebastian Stan) and continues her skating. Her routine at the 1992 Olympics goes well, until she fails to stick her landing, blaming her blades. She's encouraged to try again for the 1994 Olympics. Things get scary when she receives a death threat. In retaliation, her husband, whose convinced that competing skater Nancy Carver (played by Catlin Carver) sent it, arranges for her to get hurt. Once the FBI make the connections, Tonya is constantly questioned whether she knew about the attack or not, while hoping to proceed with the Olympics.<br/><br/>Now doing a movie on Tonya Harding would seem difficult as someone with a controversial background is not a person that too many people are going to sympathize with. This is why I, Tonya does the smart thing, and sets the story like a character study. You certainly get a better understanding of her background and her personality, but it never takes a side. In fact, the movie almost seems like a troll, giving you the typical sports story for the first half, before going into the skater attack in the second half. <br/><br/>This all works together thanks to the cast, which was selected perfectly. Though the roster is filled with mostly unknowns, the main stars suited nicely. Sebastian Stan makes for a good airhead with potential fame going to his head. Allison Janney plays a bit of herself, but still pulls off Tonya's mother LaVona whose a monster, but at least a human monster. Of course, Margot Robbie is great as Tonya. While she too is an airhead, she shows that there's a difference between that and her passion for the ice. In a way, she is a tragic character, but your also not sure if you want to feel sorry for her. <br/><br/>I'll give this ten 1994 Olympics posters out of ten. The best kinds of biopics are the ones that focus on grey characters; those who do questionable things that you'll question for a while. I, Tonya does that and portrays the working American in a world of wealthier athletes. It may not be new, but her character makes your want to go through this trope. I'm glad I caught it in time for the award season. I recommend this, so get on the ice for your fair chance."

"CANpatbuck3664","9","8","16","8 January 2018"," Extremely Involving Movie That Tells a Crazy but True Story With Equal Parts Tragedy and Comedy
","I wasn't old enough to process Tonya Harding's story when it was going on, so I can only describe this movie as a fresh face. I loved how this movie played into the wild and varied accounts about Tonya's life. Instead of presenting one version and calling it ""the truth"" (which Harding even talks about through voice over in the final scene), they present different accounts through Harding (played by Margot Robbie), Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) and LaVona Golden (Allison Janney) and the movie is very ambiguous about what happened. This was refreshing, the story is just so bizarre no matter whose account you choose to believe. It allows the creative team the freedom to cherry-pick what they want to show, and I was constantly engaged. Normally I'm critical when the stray from the facts in a biopic but no one will ever ""actually"" know what happened, so the movie has some fun with it without straying into implausibility.<br/><br/>So, knowing that the movie toys with the story a little, I still was floored by the characters and the character development. Tonya Harding, whether she was guilty or not, became a sympathetic in my eyes. I'm not saying that what she did was right or that Kerrigan deserved it (that shouldn't even be a question) but with the kind of upbringing she had, was she going to be an emotionally stable adult? I would say no. Even though the world decided she was the villain, her work ethic and her perseverance made her endearing to me. Gillooly and Golden are villains and they're monsters but the movie makes them characters that you want to follow. Add in one of the dumbest characters I've seen on screen in Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser) and a surprisingly informative narrator in Martin Maddox (Bobby Cannavale) and you have a movie populated by unforgettable characters that all have a surprising amount of depth.<br/><br/>I've talked about the characters and how closely the movie sticks to the facts, but I wanted to add how sharp of a script I think this was. The movie is hilarious at points and it just breaks your heart at others. The dialogue is always sharp (even though its vulgar as h@!!) and I found the movie suspenseful throughout. They also present serious issues like spousal/familial abuse in a different light. Tonya faces violence daily and instead of stopping the movie to show it, its very much treated as an everyday occurrence. It is shocking and every time you're starting to have too much fun, it just sobers you up completely. It was a bold but effective choice to show how screwed up her life was. Add in the great 4th wall breaking and narration from different characters, they really produced something special with this.<br/><br/>The script was great, but Gillespie and his team shot the crap out of this too. The skating and action scenes are dynamic with the camera constantly moving and showing things from different angles. What Tonya and the other skaters do as athletes is an art and the movie shows that. I also thought the movie was gritty but had a sense of style. There's also a neat shot showing the passage of time after one of Tony and Jeff's breakups that weaves things together beautifully. Instead of just skating by, the movie committed to making things exciting from a visual standpoint.<br/><br/>I, Tonya has also garnered some deserved praise for the actors and actresses. Even as a fan, I was blown away by Margot Robbie as Tonya. She doesn't look like Harding, but her performance has so much emotion and effort in it that she capably carries this movie. She's probably going to get an Oscar nomination for this and she deserves it. She's got tons of talent and I hope she gets more roles like this. I was expecting great things from Robbie, but the surprising performance was Sebastian Stan as Jeff. He really did great work, he's the underrated one in this cast. He capably plays Jeff as a slimy/bad guy but complex nonetheless. Allison Janney is just evil as LaVona and she's also deserving of the praise/award recognition for her work. She's so awful but you can't turn away because of Janney's performance. Paul Walter Hauser is perfect in the worst way for Shawn. He's so stupid and Hauser plays up the idiocy of the character so well. I also liked Bobby Cannavale in his small role, he's a nice mix of sleazy and funny that helps round out the story.<br/><br/>I only have 1 criticism of this movie and its not the one that most of the reviews have. The biggest complaint I've heard about the movie is the CGI in the skating sequences, that its obvious that they've put Margot Robbie's head on another skater. I didn't think it was a seamless effect, but I never had a problem with it. My problem was that they made the decision to have Robbie and Stan play the 15-16 year old versions of Harding and Gillooly and while I get it would have been an awkward transition (by the end of the movie, Harding is only 23 so how else could they have done it?) I still found it hard to buy them at those points. I don't want to blame the actors, but it just came off as a rare misstep for a largely flawless movie.<br/><br/>This is one of 2017's best movies for me. It was highly praised and after seeing it, I think rightly so. I think the acting, direction and script were all impressive and the movie came together to be something worth going to see. I wish it had a bigger release, I had to go out of my way to see this but I, Tonya is a great sports biopic that breaks the mold. Check this out if you get the chance."
"ferguson-6","8","8","16","20 December 2017"," a perfect landing
","Greetings again from the darkness. Your recollection of Tonya Harding is likely not that she was the 1991 U.S. Champion figure skater and a two-time Olympian. And rather than honoring her as the first female skater to land a triple axel in competition, you likely remember ""the incident"" in 1994 where she whacked her on-ice rival Nancy Kerrigan on the knee with a club. Only Ms. Harding wasn't the one who attacked Ms. Kerrigan ... and that's only the beginning to what director Craig Gillespie (LARS AND THE REAL GIRL) and writer Steven Rogers (P.S. I LOVE YOU, and a bunch of other mushy stuff) detail in this madcap look at a reality infinitely stranger than most fiction.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie (THE WOLF OF WALL STREET) stars as Tonya Harding, and it's a career-defining performance ... funny, tragic, physical and emotionally charged. This isn't the expected bleak biopic, but rather it's a brilliant blend of parody, docudrama, and dark comedy focused on some real life folks that will surely make you grateful for your life. Harding's abusive, profane and icy mother LaVona is played with aplomb by Allison Janney, who manages to bring some humor to the role of a woman whose approach went far beyond the realm of tough love and straight into cruelty. Sebastian Stan plays Tonya's husband Jeff Gillooly and Paul Walter Hauser is Shawn Eckhardt, his friend and co-conspirator. In regards to these last two gents, we spend most of the film trying to decide if they are goofy, ignorant or downright dangerous (or all of the above).<br/><br/>Director Gillespie expertly weaves together the domestic scenes, ice skating scenes, and ""current"" interviews with the main characters. The domestic scenes include Tonya and Jeff, Tonya and her mother, Eckhardt with Tonya and Jeff, and Eckhardt with his own parents. The ice skating scenes emphasize how hard Tonya worked and her relationship with Coach Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson), while the interviews (recreated from actual interviews) provide contradictory details from the memories of Tonya, Jeff, Eckhardt and LaVona. The film tries not to make fun of them, but they kind of do it to themselves.<br/><br/>Bobby Cannavale appears as a ""Hard Copy"" reporter who provides some story structure by walking us through the timeline as reported by the media at the time. McKenna Grace plays a young Tonya, while Caitlin Carver is Nancy Kerrigan. Tonya has long been labeled as the most ""notorious"" figure skater, and a failed boxing career was the closest she came to capitalizing on her notoriety after the scandal. Her life and the incident have been the basis for songs, books, news specials, documentaries, TV parodies, and even a Brooklyn-based museum. The film reminds us that truth and recollections are open to interpretation, and that there is much more to the story than what was reported. Respect is too much for Tonya to hope for, but this excellent and entertaining film might deliver a dose of compassion or empathy (along with incredulity and some laughs)."
"grantss","8","5","9","4 July 2018"," Great movie - funny and emotional
","The life story of Tonya Harding, champion ice-skater. From her life as a young child to teenager to adult life everything centred on ice-skating. Then came the Nancy Kerrigan incident...<br/><br/>Great movie. Could have easily been a fairly dry paint-by-numbers biopic but writer Steven Rogers and director Craig Gillespie infuse the movie with humour and lightness giving it a great deal of energy and engagement. There's also a character-based side to it, especially in terms of how Harding's mother shapes her personality and views on life. This leads her to accept the abusive, dysfunctional relationship with Jeff Gillooly, her first husband, which brings about her downfall.<br/><br/>The light tone does change from a point, and it is a bit disconcerting. As things get more criminal, the lightness is replaced by a seriousness and the movie starts to resemble more the conventional biopic one would have expected. There is still a degree of humour: the bodyguard and the hired thugs take stupidity to another level (and, by the looks of things, this wasn't dramatized - they were really that dumb). <br/><br/>However, the come-down from the energy and comedy of the first half does make for an uneasy transition. There was no way round it though - it would have been inappropriate to maintain the level of frivolity considering what happens.<br/><br/>Ultimately the transition works out well, as the movie ends very emotionally.<br/><br/>Superb performances by Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding and Allison Janney as her mother. Robbie would not have seemed the right person to play an uneducated, working class, incredibly intense, foul-mouthed competitor with hordes of demons but she pulls it off with aplomb. Well deserved her Best Actress Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Allison Janney won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance and the choice is hard to fault. She is fantastic as the aggressive, uncouth mother."
"garthlotel","5","5","9","27 February 2018"," Alison Janney deserves an Oscar
","Janney's performance as the mother is stunning. See it for her, if nothing else. As for the rest of the movie, I was not impressed. It is clearly so proud of itself for being mildly clever - it feels like a self-congratulatory university revue written by a bunch of heartless frat boys. It lacks genuine warmth and sensitivity. I also found Robbie to be completely wrong for the part. There is actually something very insulting about her shallow portrayal of Tonya as screeching trailer trash. She is not convincing and you are always aware that Robbie the actress is performing this pantomime - ie, the very opposite of good acting. The CGI work when she ice skates is also terrible."
"yawael","6","5","9","26 February 2018"," A Great Performances
","This film talks about the life of (Tonya Harding) one of the best female skating in the 90s. and her big scandal that destroyed her life career.<br/><br/>The film stars one of world famous actress in our time Margot Robbie who raise to fame after her huge breakthrough in Wolf Of Wall Street 2013. following with two acclaimed movies ( Focus 2015 & suicide squad 2016) which distinguish her great star power.<br/><br/>As for this film no doubt that MR delivers one of her best performance to the screen, she really transferred herself of becoming the real Tonya.
Allison Janney was really the second reason for watching this film, she really brought one of her best performances which's mixed with comedy and darkness (her role really is one of the best dark comedy performances I've ever seen).<br/><br/>Despite these two stars the film could have been better, the main problem of this film was the interview scenes for each character, it wasn't bad , but it took a lot of time of the film which makes you losing the track of the film, not to mention becoming bored in a lot of times because the film was really long and maybe half of it was in the interview style and in a randomly way!
i think they could saved this problem by two things:<br/><br/>
First: They had to reduce either the intreview scenes or the time of the film<br/><br/>Second: they had to put the original interviews with the real people, because no matter how the actor is good, he will never be able to show the same view of the real person.<br/><br/>At the end it's an okay film and a must watch for both MR & AJ performance."
"gortx","Null","5","9","13 December 2017"," Unconventional Bio-Pic
","Director Craig Gillespie's I, TONYA is an unconventional Bio-Pic - so unconventional that the term itself doesn't really apply. Part-Mockumentary, Part-Drama and Part-Dark Satire, TONYA gives us a cracked version of Tonya Harding's life and and the events surrounding the knee-capping of Nancy Kerrigan in the week's leading up to the 1994 Winter Olympics.<br/><br/> TONYA contains not one, but several, unreliable narrators lead by Tonya herself (Margo Robbie), her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) and Tonya's estranged mom LaVona (Allison Janney). The movie is framed with faux interviews with them (and others) - often speaking straight to the camera (a convention which also occurs within scenes in the movie). But, make no mistake, Gillespie and Screenwriter Steve Rogers very much favor Tonya's POV here. It's her slant on the story that takes center ice.<br/><br/> The movie works as well as it does because of the cast and the lure of the lurid true story. Robbie looks nothing like Harding despite hours of makeup (this is made clear when we see clips of the real Harding), but, she enthusiastically takes on the role, giving it a grit and energy that keeps the movie on balance despite some significant bumps along the way. Stan and Paul Walter Hauser (as Gilooly's henchman Shawn Eckhardt) are also fine. More problematic is Janney's LaVona. Janney is a superb actress, but, here she is so over the top that she verges on being a cartoon (unsurprisingly, the real LaVona Golden wasn't interviewed by the filmmakers, so it is little wonder than she comes off the worst of the major characters). <br/><br/> The contrivance of an unreliable narrator isn't a bad concept, but, too often I, TONYA ends up feeling unreliable itself. Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) is very much shunted to the background (and only utters one word, ""Why!??""). To believe I, TONYA you'd think that Kerrigan was some rich Ice Queen in contast to the working class Harding. The truth is that Kerrigan's family was also working class (the Dad working three jobs to pay for her training). It's understood that the movie is from Harding's perspective, but, at a certain point, you have to wonder about the movie's overall authenticity. Matters aren't helped by a certain reluctance on the part of the filmmakers to have dramatic scenes play out. There is some very nasty physical and sexual abuse on display, but, they are often undercut with a wink, a retro song (often not very good selections) or a quip directly at the camera. It's as if the filmmakers are saying to the viewer, ""Yes, some bad stuff happened, but, hey, here's a funny aside - you're still having fun and enjoying the movie, ain't ya?!"" And, some of the mugging for the camera makes it seem like the cast is auditioning for an off-Broadway production of an early Coen Brothers film.<br/><br/> Despite some major qualms, I, TONYA refreshingly breaks the mold of a Bio-Pic. It's simply too bad that the filmmakers couldn't find a consistent and more thoughtful tone."
"courtjes","Null","9","20","15 January 2018"," No sympathy for Harding.
","This movie tries to excuse Harding's conduct by portraying her (miserable) mother and former husband as cruel and abusive but Harding made no effort to improve the quality of her life.
But does that excuse Harding's classless, disrespectful, abusive personalty? No way.
The acting is good, and the production fine.
The movie attempts to encourage sympathy for Harding but its difficult to believe she wasnt involved in or at least know of the attack on Kerrigan.<br/><br/> Clearly her mother, if portrayed accurately, is one of the meanest, evil people one could ever meet.
Overall, I would recommend this movie only to get the historical background but be skeptical about how Harding and Gilhooley are shown. It seems they are more culpable in real life than the movie suggests.
The cigarette product placement is annoying and insulting and if big tobacco paid to finance this film, it should be made public and investigated."
"IMDBreview2017","5","10","23","9 January 2018"," Hard to watch...
","I am not a big fan of domestic violence, even if its a retrospective character piece, its hard to stomach. The star of the movie was not Margot Robbie's Tonya, but Alliison Janney, whose protrayal of overbearing/vindictive mother of Harding was uncanny and mesmerizing. The whole movie should have focused more on that dynamic, then the rest of the film. Sebastian's Jeff Gillooly was a little unwatchable, as half the performance was him beating her. Rest of the film was more the aftermath of Nancy Kerrigan incident. Don't expect many scenes with Nancy Kerrigan character, its more a Tonya Harding centric pic. Worth watching on DVD, maybe for Janney's performance."

",".....is nothing in TH's life her own fault? Her mother is a demon - but as a young girl she says she loves her mother and not her father (who appears to be quite decent). Her husband beat her - but in the film we repeatedly see her knee him in the testicles (ouch...). Her trainer is useless - so TH's best solution is to chuck her skating boot at the woman's head. The judges are all continually biased against her - but she does actually appear in the Olympics. And when, at one stage, she does not perform a triple axle it is only because people set her blade wrongly. The truth, I suspect, lies somewhere in-between. <br/><br/>As a film, it plays between dark comedy and tragedy. But surely TH herself must be responsible for some part of that tragedy? Nope - according to the film she was always a victim, albeit talented and spirited. And, for good measure, Nancy Kerrigan was an ungrateful cow. Oh dear."

 However it was never great. <br/><br/>Margot Robbie was the wrong actress for this, with an especially wrong accent. Tonya Harding is not an Eastcoaster, she's from Oregon. Robbie is an average actress at best. Should have been Amy Adams all the way! On the other hand Allison Janney did a great job, and even more so Sebastian Stan as Harding's abusive husband. <br/><br/>This is one of the few movies I believe could have benefited from an additional 15 to 20 minutes of runtime. At 2 hrs runtime that should be enough to forge a strong connection between characters and audience, but that connection never fully developed for me. Less editing may have helped. Different editing choices also. Perhaps more in depth coverage of Harding's childhood and adolescence, and less coverage of every single time she got beat by her husband. <br/><br/>All in all its solid, but not outstanding. With a stronger lead character and different pacing I would have given it a 7.5/10. As it stands now my rating is 6.5/10."

","I remember well the whole Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story (I was just graduating from high school when it all went down), and I was very intrigued to see how a movie would portray it all. At the time, I mostly just remember being done with the whole thing by the time it had played itself out. I was so sick of everybody involved, Kerrigan included, and it all just seemed so sleazy and embarrassingly American. The movie made me feel much the same way. These were trashy people living a trashy life style doing trashy things, and despite the film's clear intention to do so, it isn't able to wring much moral significance from the whole episode.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie does a fine job in the lead role, avoiding the temptation to do a simple impersonation and instead trying her hardest to turn Tonya Harding into a three-dimensional character. The film limits her success, however, because of its dogged determination to remain glib and cartoonish and play the whole thing like a big joke that the audience is in on. This is weirdly at odds with choices the director, Craig Gillespie, makes at various points in the movie, like giving Tonya monologues about how she's a different person than the media would have us believe, or one uncomfortable scene during which Robbie addresses the movie audience directly and tells us that we collectively are as responsible for persecuting Harding as her abusive husband or monstrous mother. If handled differently, moments like these could have made this film a reflexive examination of America's unhealthy relationship with the media and its obsession with fame, however earned. But the movie is too eager to be a crowd pleaser to dwell for long on anything too serious, so it rushes on to its next bit of comedy and ends up doing to Tonya Harding exactly what it accuses its audience of. <br/><br/>In addition to Robbie, Allison Janney is getting a heap of acclaim for her performance as Harding's mother, an absolute horror of a woman. She hits the marks she's asked to hit, but it's a shame that such a talented actress as Janney isn't given more to work with than the gross caricature she's given here. On the other hand, Sebastian Stan, as Tonya's buffoon of an on-again-off-again husband, gives a great performance that no one seems to be talking about.<br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" is entertaining, but it doesn't deserve to be remembered in the same company as some of the best films of 2017.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","""I, Tonya"" breaks the fourth wall. It uses direct address. Tonya talks to you. Tonya has a grudge to settle with you. Throughout the film, Margot Robbie breaks character with in-scene commentary from her future self. This is how ""I, Tonya"" works. Robbie, in essence, plays two roles: Tonya Harding, and the actress who plays Tonya Harding. The faux-documentary version of the present-day ex-skater, the Portland, Oregon native that Robbie channels during sit-down interviews with an off-screen ""documentary filmmaker""(the director also plays two roles), overlap into the biopic proper, the narrative, in which a wizened Harding seated in her kitchen, sucking down Marlboro after Marlboro, reflects on her younger self. The interjections are 20/20 enlightenments, the hindsight that a spousal abuse victim acquires after years of unlearning the learned. She was an accidental co-conspirator; she was the protagonist in The Crystals' song ""He Hit Me and It Felt Like A Kiss"". The interjections can also refute the situational action of the unfolding narrative. ""This is bull****, I never did this,"" Tonya says, after she fires a rifle at her husband, the fallible narrator, who purports the incident to have happened. Jeff Gillooly(Sebastian Stan) lies to us. Jeff Gillooly tries to change history. Tonya's abusive husband says, ""I never hit her."" And sadly, there are people who will believe him. And that's because, in her mother's own words, Tonya Harding looked like ""a bull-dyke"". The tomboy reminds Lavona(Allison Janney) that, hair down or hair up, she is indeed young, twenty-three years young. When the Hardings are stopped by the police, the still-fresh blood streaking down Tonya's face should be clearly visible to the presiding cop. This officer points the flashlight towards the occupied passenger seat, but he doesn't even bother to ask a courtesy question about the battered woman's disheveled state. The cop takes one look at the ""Charles Barkley of figure skating""(called so by Jeff) because Tonya possesses an unrivaled physicality that allows her to land the triple axel, and figures this woman, who is, frankly, a little on the masculine side, can handle herself and dish it out for good measure. And yes, Harding does resemble a waitress at some greasy spoon who never calls the mechanic to fix her truck. If Tonya Harding is guilty of anything, it's not being pretty in dresses like, in her own words, ""a retar*ed tooth fairy"".<br/><br/>When all the acidic sensationalism gets squeezed out from this lemon of a story, this made-for-television psychodrama on ice, the last of the dwindling media horde encamped on the perimeter outside the Gillooly house packs up. And we know why. As Jeff peers through venetian blinds, we catch a glimpse of the next ratings bonanza glowing from the boob tube aside from him. A covered body is being pulled on a wheeled stretcher into the coroner's van from the compound of a famed ex-NFL running back. ""I, Tonya"" picks up where the coda for ""Natural Born Killers"" leaves off; that bravura ""year in review"" stories Oliver Stone encapsulates in an A.D.D.-like channel surfing montage that underscores the decline of broadcast news and the general public's hunger for violence. In this sequence, both the O.J. trial and the Kerrigan/Harding brouhaha are included, along with the Menendez brothers, Waco, and Lorena Bobbitt, tabloid stories all, given the patina of mainstream respectability because, as the ""Hard Copy"" reporter puts it: ""For the first time there was a 24-hour news cycle to fill."" Appropriately enough, Harding would become a lady boxer, the perfect metaphor for this new wave of journalism, tabloid journalism, since Kerrigan versus Harding was the undercard for the main event: O.J. Simpson versus the prosecution.<br/><br/>""You think those nitwits in Zombieland remember anything?"" Wayne Gacy(Robert Downey Jr.) asks a worried subordinate, who edits the latest ""American Maniacs"" episode, a hyper-violent extrapolation of ""America's Most Wanted"", which, it goes without saying, wouldn't look out of place on the current airwaves. The question is a rhetorical one. The world is turning into the dystopia that Oliver Stone predicted. Click on your flat screen right now. All the president's men just moved the goalposts again. And Martin Maddox(Bobby Cannavale), a cynic in the mode of Wayne Gale, knows, too, that a good portion of the viewing public can't tell. Oliver Stone saw the future. ""I, Tonya"" confirms what ""Natural Born Killers"" intuited over two decades ago, which was that Sidney Lumet's ""Network"", a speculative film about the merging of news and entertainment , and the relationship between the media and its audience, was far out, 'til time caught up, and then, wasn't far out enough.<br/><br/>Some people can't remember what happened yesterday. Let alone, remember the incident. Jeff Gillooly claims that there are people who believe it was Harding herself who whacked Nancy Kerrigan behind her knee with a metal rod. ""I, Tonya"" sets the record straight. Derrick Smith(Anthony Reynolds) and Shane Stant(Ricky Russert), out-of-state acquaintances of Harding's bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt(Paul Walter Hauser), are the ""boobs"" who executed the ""hit"" job. If the figure skater and her husband were guilty of anything, it was stupidity, Boobs, meant in the pejorative sense as ""stupid"" people, a description apropos of this muddled redneck crime outfit, can also mean television personalities. Mickey and Mallory are boobs. Across the bodies of these serial killers, Stone superimposes the words in white light lettering ""too much television"" before Mickey accidentally shoots the Indian. Wayne Gale, because he reenacts the couple's murders on ""American Maniacs"", turns these criminals into stars, ascending stars, whereas Tonya Harding was in descent, a falling star, that the cable news outlets followed until she fell to earth. Mickey, as played by Woody Harrelson, in the midst of a full-scale prison riot, subtly breaks character, when he says: ""Murder, it's pure, but you made it unpure."" That is Oliver Stone speaking, in his own voice. Harrelson is just a puppet. ""Media's like the weather, but it's man-made weather,"" Mickey continues. That is still Stone; his hand, firmly entrenched inside the puppet head. For someone from his generation, a man who can recognize the breaching norms, the very idea of Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite, giants in their industry, reading from a teleprompter about warring figure skaters was a litmus test. Stone couldn't picture this. It was beyond the pale. Maddox would agree. The ""Hard Copy"" reporter knows that these boobs were straight out of central casting. The media turned a light drizzle into a Category 5 hurricane.<br/><br/>The audience threw roses at Alexis Winston(Lynn Holly-Johnson). The blind girl skates over the flowers, then falls. Her boyfriend comes down from the stands. He helps her up. The crowd cheers as they take a victory lap around the rink. Tonya Harding, needless to say, would not have been asked to audition for ""Ice Castles"". She doesn't look the part. Jeff leaves a trail of rose petals that lead to a refrigerator stocked to the gills with Dove bars. Ice cream on a stick is as good as it gets. She is not properly loved. She deserves better.<br/><br/>From her mother.<br/><br/>From men.<br/><br/>From America.<br/><br/>Tonya Harding may not have looked like a princess, but she sure skated like one, to ZZ Top music and blue nail polish."

"roaldellsworth","10","3","5","4 November 2018"," One of the Best Movies of 2017
","When I first saw the preview for ""I, Tonya,"" I laughed. It looked cheesy, like a soap opera on ice - but I definitely wanted to see it. I just didn't expect much. I remembered the events unfolding in real life. I was about 13 at the time and watched it all happening on TV. It was just the sort of drama that grabbed the attention of a young girl in the early 90's. What's more, I was a dancer back then and (of course) there was that one girl who was my main rival. So there was some projecting going on.<br/><br/>I went into ""I, Tonya"" thinking it would be nostalgic and funny to see the figure-skating drama queens. But by the time I finished watching it, I realized this movie was far more than a trip to the past. I discovered how much I can relate to Tonya, and how much she (in this movie) is really a metaphor for the American Dream. She's also a symbol of the obstacles faced in pursuit of it. Specifically, she's an excellent example of how class affects our pursuit of the Dream.<br/><br/>No matter how hard Tonya works, and no matter how talented she is, her working-class background stands in the way of her dream. It doesn't just affect her ability to afford nice skating outfits and such. It affects her on a deeper level, destroying her self-esteem. Then she makes one bad choice after another - like staying in an abusive relationship.<br/><br/>In America, we don't like to talk about class. We like to think there are equal opportunities for everyone. This movie puts the issue front and center. You get the feeling that Tonya suspects what a lot of working-class people suspect: that the world is rigged against them. That the only way to get ahead is to cheat. Is that true? I'm not sure. I like how the movie isn't sure, either.<br/><br/>On one hand, you get the feeling that Tonya could have won the Olympics. Her coach believed in her. She had the talent. There's a reason why Rags-to-Riches is a cliche. Even though we have class divisions, we love it when people rise about their economic status to achieve their dreams. If she had the confidence in herself, could she have pulled it off?<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie hints at what I mentioned before: that the system is, indeed, rigged. We hear whispers that Tonya just isn't family-friendly or the image the skating world wants to project. The implication there is that, no matter how good she is, they still won't let her win.<br/><br/>That's why I loved this movie. It doesn't really give any pat answers. It leaves the possibilities open. It shows that, yes, things are stacked against Tonya. But on the other hand, she had opportunities. After all, she did make it to the Olympics.<br/><br/>I also loved the way the movie handled the Nancy Kerrigan incident. Was Tonya Harding involved? It's essentially left up for you to decide. The move basically says, ""Here she is. Here are the choices she made in her life leading up to that point."" Then it doesn't draw conclusions for you.<br/><br/>That's why I enjoyed ""I, Tonya"" so much. It was much better than that fish love movie, in any case."
"paul2001sw-1","6","3","5","13 April 2018"," Entertaining but lazy
","The story of Tonya Harding is an amazing one. A figure-skater whose face and image didn't fit her chosen sport's, she nonetheless had a pretty decent career; but one which ended in extreme controversy when she was implicated in a plot to injure one of her leading rivals. It's a story of someone doubly disadvantaged by their background: Tonya faced prejudice, but that's not to say she wasn't carrying real baggage as well, in the form of the various unsuitable acquaintances of hers involved in the assault. Unfortunately, 'I, Tonya' is a rather lazy film, with a clumsy and unsubtle description of American ""white trash"", an unimaginative soundtrack comprising a semi-random assemblage of pop hits, and a treatment of the story as essentially comic. It ends with a ludicrous court scene in which Tonya is banned from competition as part of her criminal sentence. It's a shame, because you're left with the feeling that there's certainly a story worth telling in here; but this feels no more sophisticated than a cartoon."
"paul-allaer","8","3","5","19 January 2018"," ""I was loved... for a minute""
","""I, Tonya"" (2017 release; 121 min.) is a bio-pic about the life and times of (in)famous figure skater Tonya Harding. As the movie opens, we are reminded the movie is ""based on irony-free, wildly contradicting and totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly"". After some current-day interview excerpts of them and others, we then go back to ""Portland, Oregon 40 Years Ago"", where we get to know Tonya as a 4 year old, along with her all-too-soon absent father and her abusive mother, the latter pushing Tonya into figure skating. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself hoe it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Craig Gillespie, who most recently brought us the excellent ""Their Finest Hours"". Here, in conjunction with Margot Robbie's production company, he brings the ""truth"" as to what ""really"" happened in 1994, when Nancy Kerrigan was whacked on the knee in the run-up of the upcoming nationals and then Olympics. But the movie is about so much more than that. Harding was ""white trash"", as was everyone around her. It breaks your heart to see her being abused, physically and psychologically, time and again, by the people around her, when all she really wants is some TLC. ""I was loved... for a minute"", laments Harding on more than one occasion. The movie's approach is wild, and wildly entertaining, where characters address the audience directly on numerous occasions. Margot Robbie is outstanding in the title role. Is that really Robbie in the skating sequences? If so, wow... But equally impressive is Allison Janney in the utterly unlikable role as Tonya's abusive mom. How can a mother end up so cruel as to her own daughter? It's a topic worth examining further in and of itself... The movie features a ton of great song placements, which only increase the viewing experience in the best possible way. ""I, Tonya"" is clearly inn line to do quite well in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so (Janney already won a Golden Globe for her performance).<br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim, and is now finally getting a wider release. The Thursday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (for a weekday evening). I can only imagine that this movie will benefit from the sure positive word-of-mouth that audiences will give this. If you are in the mood for a wildly entertaining bio-pic about a controversial figure skater who never stood a chance, be it in figure skating or in life for that matter, you will not want to miss this. ""I, Tonya"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"kckidjoseph-1","8","3","5","6 January 2018"," An American Tragedy, on Two Levels
","As I wend my way through a plethora of films up for various SAG Awards _ an unusually diverse group including the likes of ""The Shape of Water,"" ""Darkest Hour,"" ""Downsizing,"" ""Lady Bird,"" ""Get Out,"" ""The Big Sick,"" ""Call Me By Your Name"" and ""The Disaster Artist,"" among others _ I find, much to my surprise, that the one I like the most is the one I thought I would like the least: ""I, Tonya.""<br/><br/>""I, Tonya,"" directed by Craig Gillespie from a script by Steven Rogers, is a biographical film about the disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding leading up to and including her involvement (or not) in the 1994 attack on her American Olympic teammate Nancy Kerrigan.<br/><br/>The film is a deeply moving study not only of a troubled young athlete and her dysfunctional family, but a convincing treatise about class distinction in the United States and how it can manifest itself in complex, easily dismissed and misunderstood ways.<br/><br/>For example, when the movie-Harding confronts a skating judge after losing a competition she justifiably thought she had clearly won, the judge says the jury's vote was not about skating but about not wanting to be represented by someone from the wrong side of the tracks. Among other things, she makes her own skating costumes, which are clearly not in the class of those worn by the more well-fixed competition.<br/><br/>The movie begins in the 1970s with Tonya, then 4, being shoved down the throat of a local skating instructor by Tonya's mother, LaVona Fay Golden, played by veteran Allison Janney (""The West Wing"") as a kind of more obvious and profane Nurse Ratched, the ultimate rotten stage mother incapable of love and caring even when it comes to her own child at her most needy and vulnerable.<br/><br/>When the instructor balks, the mother levels the other skating tots with a coarse putdown usually not reserved for children (strong language permeates this script, another not-so-subtle reminder, and not an unbiased one, of the class distinction motif).<br/><br/>Tonya is played with breathtaking _ and there's no other word for it _ effectiveness by Margot Robbie (who also produced). Robbie, a real beauty, makes herself much less so without the theatricality so often displayed by actresses when they are called upon to play more threadbare characters. Robbie is Harding right down to her toenails, whether providing commentary about her life as she smokes a cigarette at her kitchen table, or skimming along the ice with honest-to-goodness athletic virtuosity.<br/><br/>Sebastian Stan as her boyfriend-turned-husband, Jeff Gillooly, whom Harding marries as much to claim independence from her mother as because of true love, is excellent as he walks the fine line between being physically and emotionally abusive even as he fights to defend her honor.<br/><br/>The attack on Kerrigan is re-created in a chilling, violent street-crime-meets-the-Keystone Kops way that works in showing both its grotesque and tragic possibilities while exposing the ridiculousness of the misguided logic behind it.<br/><br/>Julianne Nicholson, Caitlin Carver and Bobby Cannavale are completely believable and moving in supporting roles. <br/><br/>The film is described as a black comedy that uses occasional mockumentary techniques (like having characters break the fourth wall and speak right into the camera), but I would beg to differ.<br/><br/>This is an American tragedy _ a tragedy in which America itself was complicit."

I don't know what the hell were they thinking hiring this sexy, mature and beautiful woman to play a teenager, they certainly didn't fool me, they made me laugh the whole movie, Margot looked older not only than the teenage Tonya, but herself as well, the real Tonya Harding had a certain innocence about her that no 30 year old actress can fake, I mean her face was out there 24/7 so we all know what she looked and acted like, so when Margot is hopping around as a 15 year old with braces, it kind of changes the mood of the movie into a comedy. It was such a disappointment because I liked Margot in other movies and I'm kind of turned of right now. I know there is a lot of great 16 year old actresses who could portray Tonya Harding more realistically, so why Margot? The acting just doesn't matter that much anymore if you misfit the look, the age, the character, the whole persona. Everybody else was great so I don't understand why did they have to ruin this movie this way. Tonya Harding carries the whole movie so why to make it so ridiculous, I still gave it 4 stars because everything else was spot on, acted well and directed well considering that the actual story could have made this movie cheap looking, but the director managed to give it a certain style, that deserved to be nominated."

I wasn't born yet to know how much people hated Tonya, but this movie captured more than just the incident itself. The film had showed Tonya's life from when she was fifteen to somewhere in her forty's and explained who Tonya was when she wasn't on the ice. Tonya had to deal with a abusive mother, who believed that she raised Tonya the right way and formed the figure skater that Tonya is. After that she moved onto a boyfriend named Jeff who she loves at first but then again turns out to be her next abuser. The reason why Tonya had stood out from the rest of her opponents wasn't because she could do a triple axel, but because Tonya came from a lower class family. She wasn't able to afford a fur coat, or a proper costume she had to make one herself and due to this and this and Tonya's presentation of herself the judges gave her a lower score. Tonya later went to go speak with one of the judges and he explains that the competition is not all about the better skater, and the winner of the competition would become the face of the country and the girl who tells the judges to, ""suck her d**k!"" Isn't the ideal choice. Instead the judges wanted someone with the perfect family and life to become the face of the country. I loved the mocumentary style of the movie and how you get to see the varying viewpoints between Tonya and Jeff especially once you get to ""the incident."" It makes perfect sense for why anyone would believe that Tonya wacked her competitor in the knee with a pipe. Tonya is jealous of Nancy. She is jealous that she gets better scores, and she is jealous that she has a family that cares about her. This would lead you to believe that but that isn't true. Tanya gets a lot of hate for this incident but then she goes on to win first place at the Olympics after having major skate complications. The scene where she is looking in the mirror trying to smile really conveys a strong message about what is going on in Tonya's life. At this moment the whole country felt for Nancy and this was one of my favorite parts of the movie. Tanya explains Nancy's reaction when she was getting her second place medal as like she stepped in poop. Tanya then explains that Nancy has everything else but Tanya has nothing but the first place medal. The next part of the movie is Tanya's court case. This part was really emotional and I got choked up watching it. Tanya pleads her case to the judge but he bans her from ever competing in any skating competition ever again or even to coach. Tanya even says that she will take jail time over not being able to compete again. This movie cannot be summed up in any plot synopsis that you are going to read. Margot Robbie's performance in this movie is spectacular. She did most of her own skating except for the triple axel of course. The movie had a Martin Scorsese feel to it through when the broke the fourth wall. This movie was like the Goodfellas of figure skating. The parts where Tonya and Jeff were teenagers was a bit awkward. The main message that I received from this movie is that you don't know who you could trust. In the scene where Tonya's mom walks into her house and you think that they are now going to work together, we find out that she has a tape recorder on her so you still can't trust her, she couldn't trust Jeff, and she couldn't even trust her own body guard to protect her in the figurative way. This movie does something that most movies. I truly believe that Tonya is innocent and this movie stands out from most for the reason that it shows the truth behind someone that people used to hate. If you went back to the time of this case and said, ""I'm going to make a movie about Tonya Harding because it think she is a hero,"" people would have a entirely different idea about the film. In conclusion, I think that I Tonya is a great movie and I recommend you see it soon."
"CineMuseFilms","7","4","8","15 January 2018"," a compelling portrait of an abused skater-made-good
","From its confessional title to inconclusive finale, I, Tonya (2017) is the kind of film that leaves you wondering why it was made. The fragmented mockumentary approach disguises a lightweight narrative filled mostly with deplorable people with few redeeming qualities. However, Margot Robbie's compelling portrait of an abused skater-made-good turns an otherwise lacklustre melodrama into an engaging performance.<br/><br/>The pathologically unfiltered stage-mother LaVona Fay Golden (Allison Janney) was the kind of mother than nobody deserved. She forced her four-year daughter into ice skates and a life of verbal and physical abuse. Without ever once enjoying a mother's praise, Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) grew up a talented competitive figure skater who had nothing else in her life except Olympic dreams. To escape her mother, she fell in with another abuser Jeff Gillooley (Sebastian Stan) who became her husband. Despite the elite skating fraternity looking down on Tonya for her loud-mouthed brashness and being too poor to buy costumes, she competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics to win a fourth place. Retiring briefly, she mounted a comeback while her husband and his moronic friends arranged an inept attack on Tonya's main skating rival Nancy Kerrigan. She recovered quickly yet the entire story leads to the question: what was Tonya's role in the attack?<br/><br/>It is difficult to label this film: it is not a serious whodunit nor is it funny enough to call it a black comedy. The mockumentary technique leans heavily towards telling rather than showing and the narrative is disrupted constantly by actors shifting out of character and into the role of interviewee. But the effect of multiple narrators is to construct a swirling matrix of viewpoints, in the middle of which Tonya desperately struggles to find respect and belonging. Margot Robbie's performance is outstanding. To convincingly play a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who was force-fed elite skating despite abuse from her mother, husband, sporting judges, and the media, is no small achievement. Whether the film makes a compelling case that we should care at all is another matter. With Tonya centre stage, the camera treads lightly over her abusers and leaves us guessing about her involvement in the Kerrigan attack.<br/><br/>If you are hoping to see some skating excitement the film will disappoint. There is a noticeable absence of narrative tension in either the characters or depicted events, yet the story engages our sympathy for Tonya. Themes like the discriminatory politics of elite sport and the social burdens of class and family dysfunction get a light airing, but it's hard to see this as a message film. Those who remember the real Tonya and the attack will find it interesting. For others, the unusual story format and characterisations are more enough to hold your attention."
"verepaine","7","4","8","12 January 2018"," Great movie, but thats what it is
","This movie is well worth seeing; for the acting, the direction, the cinematography...<br/><br/>But people please remember this is fiction, made to be entertaining. This is not a history lesson."
"PotassiumMan","9","4","8","16 December 2017"," Gripping biographical black comedy gave me chills
","Over time, I have grown weary of the biopic genre. It tends to yield a lot of films that are by-the-numbers and lack an edge. Enter this film that proves the exception, a fiery account of the renowned U.S. figure skating champion Tonya Harding, whose husband and friends got involved in her career in the most sinister way possible and seriously injured a figure-skating competitor of Tonya, Nancy Kerrigan who, as it turned out was equally impressive on ice.<br/><br/>The film starts out at the beginning of Tonya's development as an ice skater, when she is virtually a child. The film smoothly transitions to her more grown-up years as Tonya morphs from an adorable little girl on ice to a frighteningly edgy teenage competitor. It is then that we meet her boyfriend, who initially seems like a socially diffident young man, but is quickly revealed to by a physically violent nightmare of boyfriend/husband. Their relationship goes through many twists and turns, but it does witness her defiant rise to greatness within her sport.<br/><br/>The film bristles with vivid performances, the most electric of which is Allison Janney who steals the film as Tonya's monstrously cruel mother who shows little regard for Tonya's emotional well-being even as she pushes and pushes harder for her daughter to reach the top. Sebastian Stan is great as her abusive husband/intermittent ally. Margot Robbie finally shows how transformative her acting ability is in this film. She disappears into the role of the figure skating champion whose rise to fame went against the norms of the figure skating sport, that disdained her working class background.<br/><br/>There are no heroes in this story; no one emerges looking even decent. But it's a deeply incisive story of how one person's amazing journey took a radically unexpected turn. It will strike a chord with anyone who had to cope with at least one difficult parent, which might make it difficult to watch, but it's a film of absolutely granite integrity. Enthusiastically recommended."
"nimdude","5","6","14","28 December 2017"," An acting driven biopic with little else going for it
","I, Tonya is quite a mixed bag. The subject matter is pretty difficult for any writer or director to take on so it isn't surprising that the film falls flat in every area except acting (mostly) because neither the writer or director have shown themselves to be capable of tackling such a difficult subject.<br/><br/>The movie isn't really bad it is just a very standard biopic with less than stellar writing and exceptional acting in most cases.
Margot Robbie deserves to be mentioned as someone who is showing to be a very good leading lady in drama, however I didn't believe the character of Tonya Harding in the film and I thought she was written poorly. Margot's acting was fine considering what was written for her, but the character wasn't written as ""white trash-charming"" as she should have been.<br/><br/>Allison Janney is marvelous as the harsh and unforgiving mother of Tonya.
Her performance was believable and her character was very well written so I guess you could say that she was the real star of this movie. She was the only character in the movie that fit perfectly.<br/><br/>Sebastian Stan was fine. I didn't hate his character and that's bad. His character wasn't written correctly at all but again, the actor did fine with what he was given.<br/><br/>The movie sometimes does not know what it wants to be, editing wise. It has some pretty weird choices that I was able to follow but really shouldn't have needed to. In the beginning it has an interview style, then it goes away, then comes back again, then goes away and so on. Its just annoying and it should have been written as a standard biopic.
The second half of the movie that focuses on ""the incident"" is tedious and annoying and not what needs to be seen when talking about Tonya Harding. At no point in the movie except when Tonya said it , did I feel how important skating is for her.<br/><br/>This movie could have been way better and I blame the writer and director for its mediocrity. Margot and Allison did a wonderful job, Allison especially, and I'd consider both of them an awards contender.

"garethcrook","8","2","3","2 January 2020"," Remarkable.
","Bloody hell if there wasn't an undercurrent of dark farcical humour to this, you'd cut your wrists inside 20 minutes. I can't say I knew much about Tonya Harding and I'm gonna take all this with a pinch of salt. What we have here is what I suspect is the general gist of events, but with the drama dialled up... and there's a lot of drama. Harding is not a quiet character and Margot Robbie plays her with the volume turned all the way up. Poverty, casual domestic violence and an expletive count that scores 10 across the board, it's pretty gritty or perhaps as Harding suggests during videotape style pieces-to-camera, it's real. It's all punctuated with some really lovely stuff on the ice with the camerawork being almost as spectacular as the skating. This film though isn't about finesse, it's about the lack of and works as a perfect accompaniment to Harding herself. It's a raw struggle of pretty stupid people, living in a stupid class system, in a country that appears, at least in part obsessed with competition and hatred. A quite remarkable story, told remarkably."
"glenjue-20890","9","2","3","28 December 2019"," This movie gives you a different prospective.
","I can remember the incident in 1994 and being from the other side of the pond, I had formed the opinion that Tonya was just a cheat. However the movie gives a good insight into Tonyas life and the difficulties she faced not coming from a stereotypical all American family. Her biggest mistake by far was hooking up with Jeff he basically ruined her career. She definitely had the talent and the drive to be the best in the world, but sadly she will probably always be remembered for the Nancy incident."

","Before this movie, I've never heard of Tonya Harding, here in Spain the incident wasn't that famous, so this story was completely new for me.
I really liked the way they shot the movie, it was great seeing the actors talk direct to the camera telling some facts or their characters sides of story, it gave it more authenticity.
All of the performances were brilliant, Margot, Allison and Sebastian are outstanding, they did an amazing job carrying the weight of this movie.
What I liked most about it was how they told this complex story, how you can see everyone's point of view and at the end you can choose to believe whatever you want. For me there were moments that I could totally feel what Tonya felt at that time, I actually felt sorry for her, she deserved much better.

","8/10 - cool true story with a great Margot Robbie performance"
"gufi-04429","7","2","3","5 April 2019"," Margot's best role!
","The movie is good. It's real, sometimes funny and it keeps you interested most of the time.
But let's talk about the best thing in it - Margot Robbie. Real beauty who people often underestimate because they see her just as a beautiful woman. Not very talented one. But here she proved them all wrong. Her performance was amazing. Even more than that, I can honestly say her acting made the whole movie intriguing, without her this would be somehow dull and maybe even boring."
"NickMacTurbo","7","2","3","23 February 2019"," ""Everyone has their own truth."" My truth: this stylistic triple axel of a film will take you for a spin.
","Margot Robbie and Allison Janney are a devilish duo that make this stylistic mock-doc biopic in a word-of-mouth presentation infused with '80's style and sound shimmer.
The film is an unflinching look into the life of Tonya Harding before, during, and after her infamous 'incident' involving Nancy Kerrigan before the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 1994. But while a lot of films that are 'based on true events' often present themselves in a very wary and questionable way, this film makes no attempt to head or misguide your judgment on the real, or even ambiguous, events portrayed. While the film opens with the statement, ""Based on irony free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly."" Seeing as how Harding and Gillooly presented vastly different stories, it feels as though her innocence is not forced upon the viewer; however, her possible motives are displayed on the screen.
Robbie fills Harding's skates with an encumbering exuberance that draws you in to her character. With Robbie producing the film as well it is very clear she was invested to this role and it shines through in her performance, making her Oscar nomination very obvious.
Harding's early life in rural Oregon, as portrayed by the film, was riddled with the disapproval of her over-bearing mother LaVona Golden (played by Janney). Janney's portrait of Golden is painted in greatness as Janney embodies the character in what seems like a natural fit. Providing the film with its most powerful scenes, along with comically dark and prudent dialogue. One of the titular scenes with Janney is when she first gets her daughter enrolled in figure skating. The scene has an incredulous feeling of the '80's, with Golden smoking on the ice while Cliff Richard's ""Devil Woman"" polishes the scene off with a comfy finesse. This eventually leads to a line that distinguishes Harding's character; Golden is arguing with Harding's coach, Diane Rawlinson (played by Julianne Nicholson), about her not fitting in with the ""rich, prissy"" types that are typically expected of figure skaters. Golden states her daughter can do triple axels and adds, ""She doesn't fit in. She stands out.""
Another scene between Harding and Golden later in the film emerges as the centerpiece of both Robbie and Janney's performances in the film. The interaction between mother and daughter in a cafÃ© is hauntingly real and drenched in emotion. With Golden, rather explicitly, explaining to Harding that she gave her a gift delivering the line, ""I made you a champion, knowing you'd hate me. That's the sacrifice a mother makes!"" To which Harding's response is, ""You cursed me.""
Janney sends chills with her execution of a shameless and distant parent, making it evident why she won an Oscar for her role, and the relation feels real between the two actors on screen.
A lot of scenes felt like they were shot with a lot of thought behind them, such as the scene with her mother on the ice and one later where they explain her history of domestic abuse with intriguing 4th wall breaks. While other scenes fall flat, specifically when she fires her coach in the locker room it felt as though a lot of emotion was lost in the presentation of the scene. But for the scenes it worked, it worked well. Along with the fast-paced and smooth editing, it creates a very interesting and fluent tale. This seems fitting when you realize Director Craig Gillespie and Editor Tatiana S. Riegel had previously worked on the 2011 remake of the 1985 cult film Fright Night, both films have a similar feel.
Overall, I, Tonya is an enjoyable ride, littered with sweet tunes, and dark humour. Harding's character may not be portrayed as likeable but you begin to feel a sense of empathy for her by the end. It is interesting to witness a glaring example of how the sports world always has its scandals, which often become bigger than the sport itself, and how the least expected sport can be ground zero for one of the biggest in history.<br/><br/>

"padawanmovies","8","2","3","13 February 2019"," Awesome movie
","I was a little familiar with this story being a 90s kid but anything involving these 2 I'm interested in. The story is full of differences: beauty & being homely, rich & poor, etc. Initially I would've thought Tonya was the predator but as I find out more about her story (this film included) I believe she was just as much a victim as Kerrigan. Everyone did such a great job in their character portrayals especially Paul Hauser as Shawn and Sebastian Stan as Jeff... Paul captured Shawn's completely break from reality and Stan I've never seen play someone so wormy and violent.<br/><br/>Please watch if you haven't!!!"

"scottlombart","10","2","3","8 July 2018"," Brilliant and spellbinding
","As someone who remembers the actual incident this movie was based on, I have to say that the film was spot on in its reconstruction of the events. Margot Robbie is truly brilliant as Tonya. Her convincingly accurate performance is frightening to say the least. Allison Janey who plays her mother is also incredible. The film is one where you are on the edge of your seat from the very beginning - from Tonya's beginnings with her overly pushy mother to the crisis where she finds herself a criminal. Truly brilliantly done."
"jamesrupert2014","9","2","3","7 June 2018"," An American tragedy from the dawn of the age of 'infotainment'
","If you like to watch stupid lowlifes repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot then you will really like this film, which follows the infamous Tonya Harding's life from precocious child skater to the abrupt termination of her skating career in a court of law (with a quick jump to her brief stint as a novelty-boxer). The movie is an example of the 'unreliable narrator(s)' motif: opening with a disclaimer stating that it is ""based on irony-free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews"" and allowing characters to break the 'fourth wall' to inform the audience that the other character is lying or the portrayed event didn't happen. This all makes for a fun film, as the makers can play up the most bizarre, ridiculous, or tragic versions of events without worrying about whether they are strictly true as long as someone said that they were. Margot Robbie does an excellent interpretation of the tough, foul-mouthed, quick-tempered, 'trashy' '80s chick who was also one of the best skaters in the world (although Robbie would tower over the diminutive Harding) and Allison Janney is outstanding as her abusive, coldly-pragmatic, chain-smoking mother. Sebastian Stan is great as husband Jeff Gillooly, who unwittingly (maybe...) set off the chain of events that led to the crack that was heard around the world, when gormless goon Shane Stant whacks America's beloved, prom-queen skater Nancy Kerrigan on the knee. I especially liked Paul Walter Hauser as Shawn Eckhardt, who was always my favorite dim-bulb in the Harding chandelier back when this was all news, not entertainment (although the line had begun to blur even then). Great fun, and if the line between fact and fiction is fuzzy, that just makes the movie all the more like the original 'news' story."
"bbewnylorac","8","2","3","24 May 2018"," I loved this movie
","This movie makes a good case for a re-evaluation of top figure skater Tonya Harding, who was punished severely, and crucified in the media, for being associated with the infamous bashing of rival Nancy Kerrigan. I went into this movie expecting to be confused about who did what, and expecting that Harding would come out looking bad. Instead, writer Steven Rogers and director Craig Gillespie offer us a mock documentary that, while funny in highlighting the redneck nature of the participants, gives a very clear account of what happened, based on actual interviews with them. And Harding, despite her many faults, emerges as a kind of hero. Not least because she rose from working class hillbilly who was so poor she had to make her own costumes, to US Olympic representative, with equal parts enormous talent, drive and hard work. We forget just how good she was - nailing triple axels when no one else would even attempt them. When she blasts the judges to their faces for marking her down for being the 'wrong kind of girl', i.e. not sweet or middle class enough to win, she is convincing in her argument. Also she had to contend with a monster of a mother, LaVona (beautifully played by Allison Janney) who believes praise and love of her daughter are weaknesses. Yeah, maybe LaVona's toughness did drive Tonya to win, but at what cost? Then Harding falls for the initially sweet and supportive Jeff (Sebastian Stan), who turns out to be a violent thug, bashing and even shooting her. If Harding knew what was good for her, she would have dropped him like a hot potato, but unfortunately he was her one source of support. And she needed support. The real villain emerges as Jeff's friend Shawn (masterfully played by Paul Walter Hauser), who initially comes across as a harmless loser, but whose delusions of grandeur lead him to translate Jeff's casual talk about sending death threats to Kerrigan, into ordering flunkies to carry out the eventual bashing of Kerrigan in the leg while at training. 
According to the movie, Harding may have known about the talk of death threats but didn't know about the plot to bash Kerrigan. Harding was also accused of not reporting what she learned about incident after it had happened.
You get the sense that Harding was punished enough. She was banned from skating for life - although it was her reason for being. Actor Margot Robbie is way, way too tall and glamorous to play the stocky, working class Harding. But Robbie does give the role an appropriately manic energy, and the skating scenes are very convincing, even if a stand-in must have done most of the difficult bits.
Harding later gets into professional boxing, which seems very appropriate - she was a fighter from way back. At the end of the movie, I was cheering for Harding, and I was glad from the credits to see she seems to have found some happiness in later life."

","The Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan scandal of the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics was the biggest ratings winner for the ladies short program. 24 years later, the world has changed and moved on. The figure skating world had other scandals but none topped the Harding-Kerrigan saga. Nancy was Olympic bronze medalist from 1992 and Tonya finished fourth place. Tonya would have probably been okay if she hadn't an abusive ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly in her life. She married him to escape her abusive mother (Allison Janney earned an Academy Award for her performance in this role). Tonya's life was one tragedy after another. She should have been removed from her mother's care as a young child. She was neglected and abused since she was a young child. Tonya's relationship with her mother, Lavona, was abusive and dysfunctional. Her father abandoned them and he was the fifth husband and her fourth child. She was a chain smoking waitress who worked hard to put Tonya through skating lessons. Tonya was a high school dropout with only figure skating on her mind until Jeff entered her life. Margot Robbie escapes into the role of Tonya Harding as a believable tragic figure skater. The film is about Tonya Harding's life not about Nancy Kerrigan. After the scandal, figure skaters earned a lot of money as a result by performing for television specials. If you have any prejudgment about this film, you need to see for yourself and decide for yourself about what really happened in 1994."
"elizrug","8","2","3","7 March 2018"," Enlightening movie that made me think
","There's a saying about not judging others because they might be fighting a battle we can't see. Well, this movie made that clear. I remember this event. I was 23 when it happened and followed figure skating on TV pretty closely. I remember how I immediately decided Tonya Harding was a bad person because that is what i was being told. I remember her being the butt of jokes, like on the Letterman spot that you see in the film, and I remember laughing at her story. 
This makes me see things differently, and I appreciate it for having that ability.<br/><br/>On another note, I don't think Margot Robbie was the best choice for the role. Her looks are so different from Tonya's, it's took away from the story for me. The other characters were spot-on, to the point that it was almost uncanny, and there was a lot of detail in costumes and clothing. I loved that her husband was wearing Z. Cavariccis. Nothing says early 90s more than that. All-in-all a really good movie that I highly recommend, especially to anyone who remembers the actual incident."

Although the movie is heartbreaking as you encounter the flair of tonya her greatness at skating soon enough you see how everything goes downhills and how a small event can change the whole life of a person.

"andrewroy-04316","9","2","3","21 February 2018"," Extremely impressive depiction of a controversial, ambiguous narrative
","Coming from a perspective of knowing relatively little about the Harding scandal, I'm very impressed by the way Gillespie attacks the challenging and controversial topic. Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance, one of the best of the year, and Janney also does a very good job. What is so difficult is the contradictory narratives given by the media, Tonya, and Gillooy. Rather than piece them together and frame it as a clean, neat narrative, Gillespie turns it on its head by emphasizing the contradictions and how truth as a concept and particularly in popular culture is so loaded and complex. Devices such as split screens and breaking the fourth wall are employed effectively to underscore the fuzzy nature of truth. The way Tonya's character is explained and built up is also very well done and allows you to really connect with her emotionally and understand how the events unfolded. The ending was truly heart wrenching, and in general the movie did an excellent job of staying true to how things really unfolded. The script and direction both blew me away and were among the best of the year. Very impressive and well-rounded depiction of a crazy true story, with Robbie leading the way."

I liked ""Borg McEnroe"" a lot, and I pretty much love ""I, Tonya""!<br/><br/>Based on a true story, it's about an American figure skating star Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) of the 1980's and early '90s who's too white trash-y to be taken seriously by her peers, and her life choices turn out to be so damaging that she's banned from professional skating forever.<br/><br/>Robbie is nothing short of sensational as Harding but it's not just about her. ""I, Tonya"" is hands down one of the best ensemble movies that I've seen recently, and there's been quite a number of them.<br/><br/>You may remember the rising star Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn of ""Suicide Squad"" - the only memorable thing from this abysmal superhero effort -, but you wouldn't probably recognize any other name from the cast.<br/><br/>But there's so many incredibly enjoyable performances that I just have to give shout outs also to Alison Janney as Tonya's stone cold ever-hateful mother, Sebastian Stan as Tonya's impulsive and violent husband, and Paul Walter Hauser as Tonya's ""bodyguard"", one of the most brilliant comic relief type of performances that one could think of.<br/><br/>It's amazing how, on one hand, everybody feels like such a black and white cartoon figure, and on the other hand, like a real person.<br/><br/>There's also Bobby Cannavale - the only one besides Robbie whose face you might remember easily from other movies or series - but his contribution seems wasted by the creative team behind the project.<br/><br/>Cannavale has great presence and he's super charismatic as usual but the character has so little screen time and importance that it could have been replaced by voice-over or just let somebody mention him in passing. Sad.<br/><br/>In fact, not making the most of the material is the only thing that I would call the weakness of the movie - and why I wouldn't give it even higher score.<br/><br/>It's not that the storytelling is lazy but Cannavale is not the only thing that's been added to the story just to be thrown aside carelessly.<br/><br/>For example, I find it most curious indeed that Tonya has four siblings but they get mentioned once and otherwise have zero participation in the story. It would be reasonable to show at least something about their lives, even if they were not part of Tonya's life.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the storytelling is enriched by the inventive technique to sometimes speak directly to the audience even during the busiest of scenes, without losing the momentum or spoiling the atmosphere. Impressive use of breaking the fourth wall, as they say.<br/><br/>I also love the production design - how the 1980-90's lower working class American dream looks like. As period pieces go, this is great work in its own right.<br/><br/>All in all, I just loved ""Tonya"". There's a great number of movies aiming for sassiness and feeling energetic, but director Craig Gillespie and writer Steven Rogers have managed to raise these qualities to a new level, or at least to a league of its own.<br/><br/>Judging by this movie, the old spiritual observation that being poor can make you more alive - living in constant need will make good things more vibrant and enjoyabble - seems 100% true.<br/><br/>There's something irresistible about the atmosphere of ""Tonya"", all this mobile and restless energy just glues the attention on the screen.<br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" is nominated for 3 Oscars: Robbie as the actress, Janney as the supporting actress (she already won the Golden Globe for this) and the editing. All three seem award-worthy on their own, although the competition is strong in each category.<br/><br/>So, I don't know what to tell you. Go see it, if you haven't already. It's captivating, always ertertaining and has a lot of punch. One of the more ""alive"" films of the year.<br/><br/>Just like Harding at her prime, the authors have made most of their strongest materials and left some other bits hanging. But who's to whine if the result is so winsome!"
"aldri-39576","7","2","3","8 February 2018"," Gripping but not really funny
","I, Tonya is a surprisingly good movie and much of the credit goes to Margot Robbie and Allison Janney who were both excellent. If you want to call this a ""dark comedy"" though I guess that would be alright but don't expect a lot of laughs. The humor is really in the storytelling, full of irony, plus the foul language and violence which is kind of taken to absurd, almost comedic levels.<br/><br/>Anyway, Tonya is portrayed throughout as a fiercely combative woman who gives as good as she gets. She's no timid victim except perhaps when going up against her mom in the early years. You can infer what you will about that as it applies to the ""the incident"" as it is called. I mean, the real Tonya always seemed more sweet that prone to violence at least in public interviews. But if she is in reality anything like the Margo Robbie character, I would have to say that yes, she could easily have been complicit.<br/><br/>But I liked this movie especially because of the way it contrasts the ""two"" Tonyas - Tonya while on the ice vs Tonya everywhere else in her life. The skating scenes were awesome (good music throughout, BTW), with Tonya's gracefulness and athleticism on full display. Everywhere else in her life though it was pretty much chaos, so the skating seems likely to have been an escape for her. This is reinforced in the movie by her relationship with her proper coach who is so very different from her mom you have to wonder if Tonya ever wished she actually had been her mom.<br/><br/>Also, taking everyone back to your main character's childhood is a ploy that always works for me in movies in general (like in ""Contact"" etc). Its just something that inevitably causes tears to well somewhere along the line while evoking sympathy for your character."

","We have now come full circle with the life and times of the one and only Tonya Harding.<br/><br/>I very much remember the actual footage and news stories and relentless pursuit of her movements.<br/><br/>Tonya the champion. Tonya the conniving participant in evil deeds. Tonya the celebrity joke. Tonya the hated. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie very efficiently converts the hard-scrabble world of Tonyas' daily beat-downs from a hell bent mother, well meaning but idiot husband, and a small collection of his single-digit I.Q. associates into palpable comedy.<br/><br/>We actually receive guilt free laughs as Tonya and her husband Jeff pound on one another, delivering blood and bruises while shoving each other's heads through walls and shattering mirrors.<br/><br/>The formula works, considering a lot of it probably did happen. Before this, I had no idea how deep her red-neck roots went.<br/><br/>Imagine the Bundys from the old ""Married with Children"" TV show except with genuine violence, alcohol abuse, and firearms... you get the idea.<br/><br/>The second half delves into mostly tangible drama as Tonya's world is permanently unraveled by bumbling, delusional fools who fancy themselves real live black-ops agents and 'cleaners'.<br/><br/>As the buffoonery and drama fades into the end credits featuring footage of the real Tonya at work on the ice, your heart strings will be tugged on more than a little bit in hopes the once brief American Legend has found peace.<br/><br/>And a big fat check in the mail."
"tm-sheehan","8","2","3","25 January 2018"," Red Neck U.S.A. Heaven
","Extraordinary story- no spoilers it would ruin the movie but I wouldn't be at all surprised if Australian actress Margot Robbie who gives a superb performance as Tonia Harding and Alison Janney as her mother ( she makes Medea look warm and fuzzy) take out a double actress Oscar victory.
With the current mood in Hollywood and their excellent performances both women excel.<br/><br/>I knew noting really about Tonia's story and though I'd enjoy the ice skating but this film is much more than it appears. I liked it's almost documentary style exposing red neck American ""culture ""and domestic and criminal violence both male and female perpetrated by husband and mother .<br/><br/>A must see movie but don't expect The Nutcracker or Sleeping Beauty on ice."
"lopsilceci","8","2","3","24 January 2018"," Scorsese-ish with a female lead character
","As someone born in Mexico in 1995, I approached this movie completely unbiased and unaware of all the media circus surrounding the Tonya Harding controversy in the 90's, that most americans are familiar with. Maybe it was this emotional distance that allowed me to fully enjoy the movie and just let the characters take me through a story that was completely new to me.
My opinion about Tonya Harding now is that she is a fighter. Someone with the sensibility to love a graceful and beautiful sport such as figure-skating, who, at the same time, had to grow a very thick skin and toughen up to endure all the rough stuff that life (and especially those closer to her) kept throwing at her.<br/><br/>This is a different kind of sports film. There isn't a big final competition where the underdog beats the odds and wins, with a happy ending. It's more about Tonya's personal and domestic life than it is about her as an athlete. 
Characters constantly break the fourth wall and all the humor is very dark, as it invites you to laugh at the violence between the character's interactions.<br/><br/>You can see the influence of Martin Scorsese in the filmakers' choice of story, music and cinematography. Here, instead of a real-life inspired male lead character who is violent, we get the story of a female lead character who is violent as a result of the violence inflicted upon her first by her mother and later, her husband.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the perfomance of all the main actors, especially Margot Robbie, Allison Janney and Sebastian Stan. I thought Margot made Tonya a compelling and sympathetic character; Sebastian was good and believable as the nightmarish husband; Janney made the most out of her supporting character and gave a very strong performance.<br/><br/>I would recommend the movie to those who enjoy black humor and aren't easily offended by depictions of domestic violence and profanity. 
Also, it's probably more enjoyable for those who are a bit emotionally distant from the Tonya Harding story and have a more open mind about it. 
For some, it might even change your opinion about her or -as in my case- make it."
"Lugo1989","8","2","3","22 January 2018"," What a story
","I have to admit, I was not familiar with the story of Tonya Harding. It might even be a good thing since the events of the story seem even more unbelievable and have a bigger impact. All the characters are a bit crazy but still very interesting in their own way. And you really feel for Tonya Harding since after all, she only wanted to skate and be successful. She achieved success but had to overcome endless hurdles along the way proving that you should never give up on your dreams no matter the odds. Performances are great, especially from Allison Janney and Paul Walter Hauser who played Shawn and captured his delusional character with perfection. Another positve thing about I, Tonya is a really great soundtrack containing classic songs from the 70's and 80's. <br/><br/>Definitely recommended and you do not have to know anything about figure skating to enjoy this film since the story itself, characters, good performances and music will take care of that."
"george.schmidt","9","2","3","22 January 2018"," Robbie & Janney are en pointe
","I, TONYA (2017) ***1/2 Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, Julianne Nicholson, Paul Walter Hauser, Bobby Cannavale. Robbie gives a clear-eyed, laser focused turn - a career high - as figure skater Olympian Tonya Harding, whose arduous climb into celebrity and the limelight was only earmarked for the planned attack on her competition, Nancy Kerrigan, and the aftermath of becoming a global punch-line instead. Filmmaker Craig Gillespie goes the Martin Scorsese route ala ""GoodFellas"" with characters breaking the 4th wall, a pop jukebox of rock and FM staples to underscore the proceedings at hand and outrageously larger than life costumes (thanks to Jennifer Johnson). Janney is Oscar bound as Harding's domineering monstrous mother whose vile bile poisons her daughter's life and enlivens things overall."
"bunsen2019","10","2","3","21 January 2018"," Hardings and Giloolys stories laid on the table-you decide....
","Amazing film- the director handled the material objectively and with fantastic character development. Getting to know Tonya Harding was a trip. She came from the depths of poverty and abuse with no connections, yet used her considerable fortitude and discipline to sculpt her natural talent into skating gold. I loved the fact she could fix cars, shoot guns and sew her own clothing from scratch. Yes other skaters work hard, but most have the luxury of money and support at home. Tonya Harding had none of this; she wore the badge of 'white trash' and fought biased judges and the elitist skating community making her achievements ever the more exceptional. 
The Kerrigan attack is presented quite differently between Hardings and Gilooly's retelling. The movie leaves the viewer to decide on what really happened. And as in all memories of our personal stories, the mind colours events and distorts truth. I love this movie for letting us decide."
"blanbrn","8","2","3","21 January 2018"," I did my best and got an 8! Well done look at real life Greek like tradegy that's a life full of hard knocks with a blunt and brash lady who came off the train tracks!
","Everyone remembers the drama of around 1993 and 1994 when the sports and ice skating world was turned upside down by an attack scandal featuring Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. It rocked pop culture and became tabloid headlines. And this latest biography type picture called ""I Tonya"" captures those moments just perfect as the acting and direction is just perfect as the film is told from the perspective of all involved thru interviews and flashback like form.<br/><br/>The movie follows the life of one hard luck woman as from the start you see that Tonya Harding(in a fine performance from Margot Robbie) is a doomed lady who's abused both mentally and verbally and beat on from those most close to her. Tonya's only comfort is the cold ice that she skates on underneath and it's her want and desire to be the best on the ice that moves her, even though the odds are stacked against her.<br/><br/>This picture is also a showcase on the life of hard knocks and abuse as a key contributor is Tonya's hard and tough as stone wicked witch of a mother LaVona Golden(in the best performance ever from veteran actress Allison Janney) who helps throw her daughter into a life of negative ways and trailer park trash type living. And upon marriage to a guy named Sebastian, Tonya's life doesn't improve as the beatings and punches and bruises are still given to her. And it's the husband who plays a key role in the plot to go after and mess with Nancy.<br/><br/>Overall really a pretty good movie that's blunt, brash, and outspoken for the way how it shows that the life of a woman came more and more off the train track. It proves for some that life is cruel and brutal and it took me back in time to the early to mid 90's when this drama was headline news!"
"boatsfra","10","2","3","20 January 2018"," Tonya, we owe you an apology
","Besides being a really good movie, meaning the acting was strong, the plot moves to a kicking soundtrack and I laughed out loud, I was genuinely surprised to learn the heartache that Tonya Harding had to endure growing up. ""I Tonya"" is a great depiction of a woman who, unbeknownst to America, didn't have the ""typical"" life of what we all think is the clean, happy life of an Olympic skater. Why? Our beloved media of course! Look at all of our skating representatives: oh so pretty and so innocent! So says the media.
 When the ""incident"" happened back in the early 90's, us onlookers of course, well, looked. We didn't have the internet back then, which clearly sets this story apart than other true stories. We didn't have Nancy Kerrigan or anyone else tweeting 24/7. We had ""Hard Copy."" Oh wait...we had the major networks too! They controlled the narrative and my goodness did they dig for dirt at every turn. We relied on their stories to frame our perspective. Why was Tonya vilified? Was this the start of our tabloid television? Why yes...if you look closely at the television set near the end...there is a peculiar figure on it...
 These issues are at the heart of ""I Tonya"" and are relevant. I owe Tonya a huge apology...I had no idea Mrs. Harding. I hope the rest of your life is a happy one and I will forgive you if you want to give us all the bird. 
P.S. Hand the Best Actress Award to Ms. Janney...hands down the best character she has ever played. Hats off to Margot too!"
"MudgeMalog","8","2","3","18 January 2018"," Surprisingly Feel Good Movie
","I have to give credit to the people behind this movie. They could have easily made a feel-good Nancy Kerrigan movie, hired some adequate actors, and made a ton of money. But they decided to tell a good story, make us re-think what we remember, and make a great movie. Just when you think the film industry is nothing but cheap sequels, remakes, yawning rom-coms, and the same-old looking/feeling comic book movies, they slap you in the face with something fresh.<br/><br/>Honestly, I went to this movie for one reason: to see Harley Quinn in a skating uniform, doing those intensely sexy skating maneuvers. And I did get those incredible scenes, but honestly, they were the boring part of the movie. Call me ignorant, but I didn't know much about the Harding/Kerrigan incident. I didn't know Harding was so poor, that she was a skating pioneer, that Kerrigan only bruised her knee, and that she still ended up winning Silver. <br/><br/>That's why I titled this review a Feel Good Movie. Before this movie, when I thought of Tanya Harding, it made me mad thinking someone could be so evil they would assault and cheat just to win. My blood pressure would rise even though I didn't know the whole story. Now thinking of her name makes me think of this movie and how great it is. And replacing hate with laughter definitely feels good!<br/><br/>I wish they would make more movies like this. Take public figures that are in general disliked but not well known. If a movie can humanize a person who is vilified by public opinion, it's a recipe for a successful movie. There must be an endless supply of people that fit this mold: Michael Vick, Barry Bonds, Prince Charles come immediately to mind. They all have stories most people haven't heard, and if you're going to hate somebody, you better have the whole story.<br/><br/>I've been talking to alot of people trying to convince them to see this movie, and they all say the same thing...Tanya Harding doesn't deserve a movie, or the movie will be tabloid garbage. But don't watch it for either of those things. The movie is smart and hilarious. Robbie's acting was so good, I wouldn't be surprised if she got Oscar nominated. It very much reminds me of when Charlize Theron won the Oscar for monster. She played a hateable anti-hero where the acting and story softens the hate. She also downplayed her gorgeousness for the role just like Robbie. Allison Janney was also terrific, although her character was much more one-dimensional and a smaller role. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies that will stick with you weeks after you see it. If you're sitting around doing nothing, you'll find yourself thinking about certain scenes and how great they were. I don't know how historically accurate the movie is and I don't care. It's a great movie regardless."
"AnishMisra","8","2","3","16 January 2018"," I, Tonya Review
","I, Tonya is a film directed by Craig Gillespie. I hadn't known about this film until, I heard about the Golden Globe nominations. This film also got some rave reviews, which increased my curiosity for the film. So I finally decided to give it a watch without watching any trailers. And I can say that I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Plot: The life and times of Tonya Harding, a professional ice skater and the 1994 controversy that led to her subsequent downfall.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film is not your conventional biopic. The makers decided a different way to go about it, which works quite a lot in the film. It employs the fourth wall breaking and mockumentary technique, which fascinated me a lot. The characters also are varied and interesting. We have Tonya who from her childhood itself was hardened to become strong and stand for herself. Then is LaVona, Tonya's mother, who is very hard on her and wants to make her daughter stand on her own and fight for herself. We also have Jeff, Tonya's husband, who has various shades for his character. And finally, Shawn, Jeff's friend, who is that dumb person everyone has in their life. The skating shots also looked very real. It never felt that a stunt double was doing the skating and it was edited so beautifully to make it look like one shot. The selection of music is great too. I felt like dancing in each of the soft rock numbers that played on screen. But this film has some issues that bug me. For instance, towards the last act the film felt quite rushed. And also some characters were just kind of not given that screen space which should have been done. <br/><br/>Performances: Margot Robbie did it again. She never failed to impress. From sad to happy she yet again proves how fine an actress she is. Sebastian Stan was also great. I didn't expect this kind of a performance out of him. Allison Janney just killed it. The way she adapted to LaVona Harding was awesome. She just mesmerized me. Bobby Cannavale was restricted to only the interview parts of the film, but still it's always fun to watch him. <br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The scene where LaVona warns Tonya about Jeff right after Tonya's wedding. We see a mother's worry and a daughter just not caring about what the mother thinks of her choice. This is the kind of scene that takes place between every mother and daughter even now, which touched me a lot.<br/><br/>Verdict: Although there are a few hiccups, I, Tonya doesn't have a single dull moment. I liked the not-so conventional take on a biopic. Do watch this film for some awesome performances and the great soundtrack.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."
"ThomasDrufke","8","2","3","14 January 2018"," A Bunch of Entertaining Gillooly
","It's often difficult to find the balance of portraying real life events accurately and delicately. And I say delicately because there's so many times when movies take the approach of brushing over real life events with a cheap and safe version of what actually happened. Vague, but true. However, I, Tonya throws all of that out the window by telling a fascinatingly outrageous story of Tonya Harding's upbringing, triumph, and of course the downfall following the Nancy Kerrigan attack.
The attack may be what you go to see the movie for, but it's far from the centerpiece of this ridiculously ridiculous film. And yes, I just said that. I, Tonya has irreverent humor with an underlying sense of heart (which I didn't expect), and oh it's also filled with the most vacuous of characters/real humans. You will walk out of the theater asking yourself, ""did all of this really happen?"", and the most likely answer is yes.
Director Craig Gillespie, who has done films like The Finest Hours and Million Dollar Arm stepped into unchartered territory with I, Tonya, and did so rather well. Whether it be fourth-wall breaking, heightening scenes to improve the effect, or even shooting visceral ice skating sequences, the energy of this film never stops.
Gillespie isn't the only hero of this movie, as it's hard to overlook the performances of Margot Robbie and Allison Janney as Tonya and her mother respectively. Producing as well, Robbie is clearly devoted to this role and it sure looks like she'll get some gold this awards season because of it. Her counterpart, Janney, may do exactly the same, as a scene stealer and brutally relentless mother. If I were a betting man, I may put my money that those two to win this Oscar's. So a wild story, told in an insanely entertaining way, makes for one enjoyable 120 minutes.

","""I, Tonya"" kept me entertained from the first second to the last. The acting in this film is brilliant; Alison Janney as LaVona Golden shines in one of her best roles yet. Margot Robbie is phenomenal, and Sebastian Stan pulls it off brilliantly. The movie overall is extremely well acted, even if you're not keen on the story line or Tonya Harding herself, I think most could agree the actors are well immersed in their roles.<br/><br/>The movie offers a different perspective on the notorious incident that happened in 1994 where Nancy Kerrigan was unfortunately assaulted by a hit man who based in her knee where she suffered severe bruising. The attack was then linked to Tonya, since it was her husband, Jeff Gilooly, who hired the hit man.. The movie explores what was going through her head at the time it all went down, as well as all of the layers that was going down that Tonya didn't even know about. In the end, it shows a fresher perspective on the issue, as well as, sees Tonya in a slightly more sympathetic light than other ways media presented her.<br/><br/>Aside from the incident, the movie deeply explores Tonya's past, her heated relationship with her mother and the physically abusive one she had with her now ex-husband. The film also exposes how people who didn't grow up conventional are treated in the world of figure skating, and how that put's people like Tonya at a disadvantage. It's a very griping and raw film, the dialogue, editing, and performances are all stellar; I highly recommend it."

","""The haters always say, Tonya tell the truth! There's no such thing as truth.""<br/><br/>What is the truth? Is it what we hear about through other sources (gossip, the press, television, social media) or is it only what we want the truth to be? ""I, Tonya"" takes on the controversial true story of Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan and the violent figure skating mele that shocked the nation 24 years ago this month. But despite the age gap, ""I, Tonya"" is a film for our times. The complicated insanity of this particular story mirrors so much of what we've been living through in this country lately. A time of anxiety, fear and paranoia of who to trust, what is right from wrong and what on earth is about to come next.<br/><br/>You would think, in that sense, that ""I, Tonya"" would make a mockery of Tonya Harding. You would think that Hollywood would portray her as a piece of white trash from fly-over-country who got everything she deserved. We love to do this to each other. We enjoy a gladiator show of reaffirming our popular views in the court of public opinion. But ""I, Tonya"" chooses not to go down that path. Instead, it chooses an area just as problematic.. siding with Tonya Harding. Based on what we know about the case from the initial news reports, it isn't wise for any critical thinker to take Harding's word for what actually happened. We will never know for sure if she was an accomplice in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan or not. She was, at the very least, complicit in Jeff Gillooly's bungled attempt at sabotage. But in the end, does all of this really matter? Did we as viewers find it problematic that GoodFellas was based on Henry Hill's account of his time in the Mafia? Did we find it unsettling as Boogie Nights recounted the awful story of the Wonderland murders and the tragedy of pornstar John Holmes? We all did, but those are two great films. I, Tonya is a great film. <br/><br/>I adored every last frame of this film. It is precisely the kind of energy and inspiration that keeps me going to the movies. Fearless, powerful, raw and most importantly, real. Craig Gillespie holds nothing back. Steven Roger's amazing screenplay doesn't mince words. By far and beyond, it is the best edited film of 2017. Clearly reminiscent of Thelma Schoonmaker. The icing on the cake are the performances. Margot Robbie is electrifying as Tonya Harding. Sebastian Stan plays the utterly despicable Jeff Gillooly perfectly. A soft spoken dummy and a wife beater. His portly companion Shawn Eckhardt (played by Paul Walter Hauser) is a full-on riot. The worst hitman in human history. A conspiracy nut who orchestrated an international incident from his parent's house and willingly exposed himself to the FBI. You could only find this kind of stupid in America. The role that everyone is talking about is Allison Janey's shocking portray of Tonya's mother, LaVona Fay Golden. A commanding on-screen performance for the ages. She's a horrifying cross between Nurse Ratched and Terence Fletcher. Sometimes, the film plays up a lot of the abuse that Tonya took from Golden and Gillooly, much of it violent. It is more matter of fact, than funny. At times, it's painful to sit through. But then two seconds later, you are laughing at a funny quip from any of the characters on screen. This is real life. It's horrifying, it's funny, it's absurd. Take the trip and you will love it as much as I did."
"bottomsgaming","8","2","3","12 January 2018"," Interesting and entertaining look at one of the biggest ""villains"" of the 90s.
","This one is all about the performances. Robbie and Janney steal the show as daughter and mother. I'd say with ease that both deserve nominations. Robbie's performance is equal amounts charisma, persona, comedy, and hope. There are numerous scenes in which her eyes carry more weight than any plot point or a piece of dialogue. There are a few scenes, in particular, where her strength, expression, and persona crumbles upon just seeing her mother. It's devastating.<br/><br/>The movie itself has The Wolf of Wall Street watchability in that it deals with some despicable people and acts in a lighthearted mockumentray style, and is about as good, too. There are several scenes that have intentional tonal clashes, where like the aforementioned WoWS, you'll be thinking, ""Did I just laugh at that?"" Yes, you did, you heartless bastard. But it was funny, indeed.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is a very good movie that'll make you laugh, it'll make you angry, and it'll make you sympathize with Harding. Most of all, it takes these numerous unreliable narrators, and crafts a story that feels genuine."
"themovieparadise","9","2","3","11 January 2018"," Absolutely Insane
","This is one of the most unique movies of 2017 I have seen. It takes an incident that is deadly serious, and transforms it into this whimsical, eccentric, fourth wall-breaking mania fest without ever minimizing the severity of the situation, which is a nearly impossible task. From the opening shot, I was whisked away by this film. This is a movie that could be categorized as a ""ride"", which is a strange way to put it but it oddly fits. You get a great sense that every single character in this movie is chemically imbalanced, but they all justify their actions through their own twisted thinking. Margot Robbie is excellent as Tonya Harding. She completely disappears in the role, as she shows us how unbalanced Harding is, while also simultaneously trying to convince us that she's in the right. Through an ingenious use of video confessionals, we get to see multiple perspectives on different events, and we get a window into how each characters' minds work. Every character thinks they are right and everyone else is wrong, and the film captures these mindsets in a really fascinating way. Allison Janney steals the show every time she is on screen. She is brutal and ruthless, but you can understand why she is the way she is..."

","An interesting thing happened to the audience (and to me) in the full theater that I was in when attending I, TONYA - the documentary-style behind-the-scenes look into the infamous ""event"" in 1994 between U.S. Figure Skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding. <br/><br/>The audience entered the theater expecting a rollicking good time - and at the beginning, laughs were a-plenty. But, about 10 minutes in, the mood began to change. I know I started getting uncomfortable laughing AT these players. I was beginning to get disturbed by them and as the movie unfolded, the raucous laughter turned into nervous laughter and then turned into somber silence, so - by the end - you did not know whether to laugh or cry at (with?) these characters/people.<br/><br/>A good deal of this feeling has to do with the work of the three leads in this film. As the titular Tonya Harding, Margot Robbie continues to show that she is an actress and not just a pretty face. Her Tonya has a strong will to succeed despite the odds but also, as a defense mechanism, has an uncanny way of twisting the truth to land on the phrase ""this is not my fault"". It is this denial that, at first, is funny, but later is sad. As shown in this film, Tonya brings on quite a bit of her problems on herself and then blames others for her actions/faults, causing a cascade of negative consequences.<br/><br/>Matching Robbie's delusion is Sebastian Stan as Robbies abusive husband Jeff Gillooly. Another actor that continues to grow and to show that he is more than just his Marvel SuperHero (Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier), Gillooly is a loser that sees his chance for winning in Harding's superb skating skills. The glimpses into this dysfunctional, abusive relationship is hard to watch, if you strip away the cartoonish nature of their characters and see the real dysfunction underneath.<br/><br/>But both of these actors/characters pale in comparison to Allison Janney's performance as Harding's Tiger Mom LaVona Golden. This is an unsympathetic, driven character that will help her daughter win by sheer force of will if she has to. Janney's performance is superb, unwavering and stern - and that is both a compliment and a complaint. She plays Golden with a driven one-note performance. There is no nuance here - you know what you're going to get, so you just sit and wait for the inevitable blow-up to happen. Janney will most certainly be nominated for an Academy Award for her performance - and she deserves to be - but I wished that there was a little more nuance (or variety) to this extremely watchable character.<br/><br/>But that's not the film that Director Craig Gillespie wanted to show. This is a ""warts and all"" portrayal of the people and events of 1994 and so his camerawork is just as unflinching as the character's perspective on what happened unfolds. Only Stan's Gillooly seems to be truly sorry for what had transpired, the rest still sit in the delusion that what they did was ""right"" or ""wasn't my fault"".<br/><br/>Which makes I, TONYA interesting - and a bit disturbing - to watch.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B+<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take this to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"burlesonjesse5","9","2","3","10 January 2018"," VIEWS ON FILM review of I, Tonya
","I, Tonya is my latest write-up. It's a biographical pic following the skating career of one Tonya Harding and her subsequent involvement in the Nancy Kerrigan baton assault. In ""Tonya"", Harding is painted as sympathetic and misread. She gets beaten, put down, and inhabits an unsafe, toxic existence. <br/><br/>About four days ago, I prematurely put out my top ten movie picks for 2017. After seeing I, Tonya with its ice skating sequences shot so fervently, I think I'm gonna have to make a swift revision.<br/><br/>I, Tonya may feel like a bullet point presentation of Harding's 20-year figure skating career from age 4 to age 24. And yeah, I'm not a huge fan of inserted interviews (of the present day personas) that reek of cliche. However, because Tonya Harding was such a polarizing figure and because I remember a lot of the news coverage from 1994, I feel that director Craig Gillespie makes the proceedings a little more special anyway. <br/><br/>""Tonya"" is feverishly paced, with pinpoint storytelling, deadpan performances, a biting 70's soundtrack, and some nifty match edits (towards the flick's conclusion). It's equal parts satiric, upsetting, funny, and in a way, heartbreaking. <br/><br/>I, Tonya's wiki page claims that it's a black comedy. I'm not sure on that one. I'd rather call it a comedy-drama that makes you wriggle. ""Tonya"" contains filthy, ferocious dialogue, a measure of sucker punch barrage, and an unabashed, wink wink to the audience (a lot of the actors talk right into the camera during regular scenes).<br/><br/>Come Academy Awards time, I'm hoping that Margot Robbie (as Harding) and Allison Janney (as Harding's nasty mom LaVona) get nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively. Robbie may not look like Tonya Harding but her transformation and raw containment still comes to fruition. As for Janney, well she gives LaVona Harding a standoffish parka and some vile, spit-fire discourse to accompany her character. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I, Tonya projects like it's touched by the cast of Duck Dynasty or the nincompoops that inhabit the The Jerry Springer Show. Its white trash residue and its sledgehammering of squeamish behavior surprisingly make it a near-perfect film. Rating: 3 and a half stars."

"Cinnyaste","8","2","3","2 January 2018"," A Brilliant Film About Clashing Forces
","""I, Tonya,"" evokes lurid attention similar to the rubbernecking that occurs when passing an auto accident. Part pseudo-documentary and part biopic of an abused women who struggles within a sports system that disavows her, ""I, Tonya"" presents a true story to clear Ms. Harding's reputation in a stranger-than-fiction story.<br/><br/>Given the gift of being lightning on skates set against a truly abysmal, trailer trash environment, Tonya glides on ice under extreme mental and emotional duress meted out by a stage-mother-from-hell, a trope redefined by a brilliant Allison Janney who steals every scene. Too, ""I, Tonya"" thumbs its nose at inspiring sports films where underdogs succeed against all odds to make it big. An unrecognizable and equally brilliant Margot Robbie tells us so with acid in her voice by breaking the fourth wall as if in a documentary.<br/><br/>The events leading to what's called ""the incident"" (the attack on Nancy Kerrigan) are too insane to be believed. Harding, we're told, is not entirely an innocent victim, but her complicity is fairly portrayed - and payback for breaking the rules in a genteel sport where Tonya's blue-painted fingernails, self-made costume and rock song accompaniment are not welcome. At the end, she is banned for life from skating competitions even after pleading to the judge to send her to prison instead of taking from her the only brightness in her awful life.<br/><br/>The brilliance of ""I, Tonya"" stems from juxtaposing Ms. Harding's skills against the struggles of her personal life. Her familial abuse spills over to choosing a husband who beats her for no reason. She is not a Phoenix rising from the ashes but rather a bird who tries to flap unsuccessfully from the fire only to fall back incinerated. An argument could be made ""I, Tonya"" is a feminist film but without mawkish sentiment for a poor, powerless waif. She divorces her scumbag husband only to bring him back in her life when she needs him which leads to his twisted arrangement of ""the incident.""<br/><br/>This is God's joke on her. Powerlessness, no education (she drops out of high school to skate), an unsupportive family and the settling for abuse align. The eight hours a day practice cannot overcome the gaping hole in her soul and psyche.<br/><br/>""I, Tonya,"" minus the skating, is the story of America's low-income underbelly where crassness is a way of life and abuse is mistaken for love. It is also a story of how people cling to insane beliefs they are something they are not because there is nothing else in their miserable empty lives. This is underscored by Shawn (a fine Paul Walter Hauser) who pretends to be an obese, overeating expert in intelligence with an IQ of ten.<br/><br/>The intercutting of documentary footage adds spice to the proceedings, and the behind-the-scenes of Olympic worthy skating is illuminating.<br/><br/>With rich layers, a search for truth, exciting skating scenes and a perverse underdog story, ""I, Tonya"" succeeds in every sense. The acting is Oscar-worthy for Janney and Robbie. Don't miss it!"

","If I, Tonya was a fiction most people would say that this could never happen in real life. The over the top family disfunction, the sheer incompetence and buffoonery of the Nancy Kerrigan incident can only happen in the movies. But the funny thing is that all of this cartoonish characters and events were actually based on real life. After watching the film I kind of felt pity for Tonya Haring. From Harding's abusive mother, played brilliantly by Allison Janney, to her abusive and somewhat dimwitted husband and his equally dimwitted friend, the people that populated her life were all lowlifes. Speaking of Harding, the heartbreaking, comical, and electrifying performance by Margot Robbie was jaw-dropping. Hands down the best performance of her young career. From the exciting skating scenes, to the funny, quirky, and sad story, and the can not take your eyes off of her performance by Robbie; I, Tonya is a winner and gets a perfect score from this judge."

","The reason to recommend this movie is Margot Robbie who performed exceptionally well as she portrays Tonya Harding. The movie stamps the acclamation and versatility of Robbie as an actor. The whole drama is well drafted which centers around Tonya the talented but problematic and disturbed individual constantly tries to prove herself, supported well by Allison Janney as her mother for which she claimed the Academy Award for her supporting actress along with others with the same category. Margrot Robbie also got several awards for the best leading role but unfortunately lost Oscar from France McDormand at 90th Academy Awards.

","This film really inspired me to look into the Tonya Harding situation. It really shows the crazy situation from all angles, and brings to light the sheer nastiness of both the women's figure skating world and the American media. The best part of the film is the performances. Margot Robbie doesn't just play Tonya Harding, she IS her, for the entirety of the movie. Allison Janney practically steals every scene she is in with an iconic performance as Laverna. Sebastian Stan delivers an impressive and in depth performance as the absolute mess that is Jeff Gilooly. The performances and absolutely perfect recreations of interviews and recorded skating completions of Harding's that really make the film."
"gab-fan22","9","1","1","1 April 2020"," Everyone Has Their Own Truth...
","These words are perhaps the most important ones ever spoken in the film, how do we define what is true or false, is everything as clear as we thought it was and so on. I Tonya opens with a title card saying it's based on irony free, totally contradictory and true interviews of Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillolly. We also at times hear from Lavonna Harding( Tonya's mom), her former coach Diane Rawlinson and her ""bodyguard"" Shawn Eckhardt. The screenplay written by Steven Rogers in my view is brilliant as we always hear varying perspectives from all sides over what happened, Tonya the person and the events of Kerrigan-Harding the infamous
scandal which made Tonya a tabloid pariah.<br/><br/>The music, editing and pace all blend perfectly as they capture Tonya's personality, her fast-paced life, her wildness, and her attitude. Tonya is in many ways a rock-star in the figure skating world due to her skating style, lifestyle as a tom-boy, redneck and someone who came from nothing and tried to survive using the only gift she had. The film is styled as a black-comedy, but is in many ways a tragedy as we observe someone see their dreams taken from them by bad choices, bias, loved ones and outside forces.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie is not the actress I envisioned to play someone like Tonya due to her beauty, and other factors. Yet she delivers arguably her best work on screen showing Tonya's highs and lows from her skating career, to the struggles of her life off the ice. Tonya in spite of her image as a rough and tough girl, is actually very insecure look at how Margot's voice quivers when she talks of her 1st date with Jeff, or when she hears a judge tell her she doesn't fit the mold of what the USFGA wants a female skater to be like. But when she is wronged, Margot using profanity or sarcasm pulls no punches like telling the judges to suck my d****
when she is told you have no talent, and we don't like your attire. Tonya's anger fuels her at times, and also is possibly the instrument of her destruction.<br/><br/>Allison Janney who I've been a big fan of thanks to MOM on CBS' delivers a incredible performance as Lavonna. She is Tonya's chief tormentor, frequently putting her down emotionally saying she won't amount to anything, asking why she tolerates' her husband's behavior and violence and at times her skating skills.<br/><br/>Lavonna's view is that Tonya's anger fuels her, she even pays a heckler at one point to enrage Tonya before her skate at nationals where Tonya lands the triple axel. Her chemistry with Margot really stands out, particularly when she and Margot have their big argument scene at the table when she yells at Tonya, and yet her whole expression changes to horror when she throws a knife and pierces her arm. She shows no outward love for Tonya, but there are two scenes one where see on the job tells her boss she's not serving tables, till she sees Tonya's face finish a good routine and of course the wire scene.<br/><br/>Lavonna in a twisted way really does want the best for Tonya, but is so machine-like in how she goes about it and finally when we see a ""tender"" moment, it's revealed Lavonna was willing to hurt her daughter again. Sebastian Stan is brilliant too, but is in some ways overshadowed by Margot and Allison. On a side note, I'm so happy Allison won an Oscar here, though I think the film really should've gotten a best picture nomination.<br/><br/>Many say the movie is too pro-Tonya and glosses over her mistakes, but to me that's not the point of the film. Tonya's anger does hurt her career as does her stubbornness and willingness to speak her mind and fight back.<br/><br/>Yet the film's most tragic moments are Tonya after the scandal. There is the haunting mirror scene where Margot I truly think earned her nomination as she tries to put make-up on and be the girl the community wants. But Tonya's spirit has already been broken by the constant media harassment, Jeff's abuse towards her and how no one really shows her any love. She is on the verge of tears, she's hurting and finally smiles trying to put a brave face on but we know it's not the same girl who exploded with joy after the 1991 Nationals.<br/><br/>Then there's the banishment scene at the courthouse where Tonya learns in spite of cooperating with the FBI and pleading guilty to hindering the investigation of the Kerrigan attack, she learns she is banned for life. Again, Margot is haunting crying almost having a nervous breakdown telling the judge not to take away the one thing that gives her stability, joy and a canvas where she can be herself. And finally, the boxing scene where Doris Day's music plays and Tonya talks of how she tried to make a living as a boxer because ""Violence is all I knew anyhow.""<br/><br/>Is Tonya a saint? No, but to see a woman lose her career, dignity, and everything while others made money off her, got away with abuse, or committed more wrongs than she did is injustice personified.<br/><br/>And yet, Tonya gets up after getting KO' d, and continues to try and make a living and a name for herself. The best films are the ones that challenge what you thought you knew, and make you see things differently. Tonya was featured in documentaries and interviews, but the media always portrayed her in 1 negative light, and we never saw the other side of the story.<br/><br/>Tonya's reputation precedes her, and yet most of the craziest quotes and events from the film are actually backed up by archive footage of the real participants, and other sources. Tonya it turns out was not a full-blown liar, and the film ends with telling us in spite of everything she has made a living, become a Mom and wants the world to know she is a good mother.<br/><br/>PS: My mom was very anti- Tonya, and openly asked me when the trailer came out for this film why people would want to see a movie about Tonya who was trailer-trash, a liar etc... After we saw the movie with my Dad, she told me her opinion on Tonya while it wasn't a full 180 change, she did note<br/><br/>"" I wasn't aware of what she went through, and she deserves to have a chance to coach and come back."""
"csm-78119","7","1","1","26 March 2020"," Doesn't Quite Get There
","There's no doubt that the three central performances by Robbie, Janney and Stan are excellent as are those from the young actresses playing the young Tonya. The film also has a unique quirky feel to it and a good soundtrack. The puzzling thing though is that as an overall piece it didn't hold my attention beyond the first 30 minutes and felt like a series of quirky sketches rather than a fully developed film."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","9","1","1","9 March 2020"," Too early to say for sure, but might one day be a 'classic'
","I first watched I, Tonya about a year after it came out, and immediately regretted having seen it at home and not on the big screen. It got lost amongst so many great releases around the end of 2017 and start of 2018, as it had been a surprisingly good year for movies, particularly around the awards season, with heavy hitters like Call Me By Your Name, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, The Shape of Water, and Ladybird all getting my attention over I, Tonya. It's regrettable but it happens, and at least I was able to watch and thoroughly enjoy it later on.<br/><br/>On my first viewing I had a very positive reaction, but my second, just a couple of nights ago now, was even stronger. I really, REALLY liked the movie initially, but now I think I love it. It's a maximal, bold, very ambitious movie, and as a result isn't going to get called 'perfect' by many people. But my favourite kinds of movies are often heavily stylised, fast-paced, genre hopping, and ambitious, and all these words apply and then some to I, Tonya, a film that I hope will continue to get better with age and potentially become labelled as a classic one day.<br/><br/>First off: it's good to comprehensively list and appreciate just how many things I, Tonya does throughout its two-hour runtime. It's a dark comedy, it's something of a tragedy, it's a sports movie, it's a harrowing look at two very abusive relationships- mother-daughter and a toxic marriage- it feels like a crime movie at points, and it's also a Rashomon-style look at the unreliability of memory and the conflicting ways people recall the same events. It does all this while also being extremely well acted, fast paced, stylised, and emotional. It might drag a tiny bit in its third act, which is perhaps the only real criticism I can give, but then the last scene or two provides a real emotional gut punch that makes the whole thing worthwhile, and puts everything into perspective. I remember the first time I watched it, I didn't think the movie pulled off having the different perspectives on the history it covered while also more or less taking Tonya Harding's side towards the end, but it worked better and more seamlessly the second time for whatever reason. It earned the right to sometimes humorously point out how different everyone's memories were, while also playing up Harding's perspective near the end for some truly devastating emotional moments.<br/><br/>I don't think Margot Robbie's ever been better, and if not for Frances McDormand's career-best performance in Three Billboards, she would have been a shoo-in for best actress (though that being said, Saoirse Ronan was brilliant that year as the titular Ladybird too). Allison Janney was also great, and deserving of her best supporting actress Oscar for her performance as Tonya's emotionally abusive, sociopathic mother. I enjoyed seeing Paul Walter Hauser too, after recently seeing and enjoying him in Richard Jewell, and I hope to see him in a whole lot more going forward.<br/><br/>The film moves at a tremendous pace, and while I felt it came close to almost sagging in its final act, it might only feel that way because of how breathless and exciting it is for its first two acts. I loved how biting, cynical, and fun it was, and then when it starts to expose how demonised Harding was, it suddenly gets quite heavy. There will be some who don't believe Tonya Harding's side of the story, and some who do, and then others who are in-between. I'm of the belief that even if she was more involved in the film's events than she let on, that her fate was still quite severe, and in a way the demonisation and ridicule of her through and by the media reminds me of the emotional and eye-opening Amy Winehouse documentary, Amy, from a few years ago. Both remind viewers that even if these people are flawed and at times outlandish or off-putting, they're still people. They're still going through real problems and real heartbreak, and while you can think that making fun of them is harmless, if everyone acts that way, we're only isolating them and potentially even ruining their lives. As Tonya Harding is still with us, I can say that I, Tonya isn't as devastating as Amy, and being born 1995 myself, I can feel guilt-free when it comes to the societal ridicule Harding went through (I'm sure I made Winehouse jokes as a teenager though, and so that documentary really did make me feel a tremendous amount of guilt).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rambling. This movie is great, it's only got a couple of minor problems here and there, and those flaws can be overlooked quite easily because of how good the good stuff is. If this one flew under your radar like it did mine back in 2017, make sure you give it a watch. It's got some great performances, style for days, solid comedy, and genuine pathos. I look forward to the next time I revisit it, and can say that in time, it may well end up one as of my personal favourite movies from the 2010s."

","This was a pleasant surprise. Margot Robbie once again proves she has exceptional talent as an actor and, in this one, they don't even have to rely on her beauty to accent her skills, it's just raw talent.<br/><br/>Robbie isn't the only one giving an excellent performance though. Sebastian Stan is also going against type, losing his normally cool, tough guy act and slipping into the skin of a low brow and abusive spouse. Allison Janney is also remarkable as the tough loving mother that most of us have probably encountered at some point. Then there's PWH who I thought was just doing his normal slow hillbilly bit again until I saw the archive footage at the end and realized he was spot on in his performance.<br/><br/>The story was compelling. I was a little young and disinterested in figure skating to really remember any of the details and can't begin to say how accurate it is, but as a character study it's fascinating. It also manages to film the actual skating in a way that's kinetic and heart pounding.<br/><br/>That leads into a downside though. I understand that Robbie did her fair bit of the skating but she's not a figure skater and at times a stunt double was needed. The movie opts to scan Robbie'a head and plaster it over the double and it just looks off putting each and every time.<br/><br/>Bad CG aside, this was a very entertaining and stylized movie that I really enjoyed and would absolutely recommend it for the performances alone. That and any movie that can make figure skating interesting to me is doing something very right."

","The turgid Molly Bloom for example. And then there are biopics so immediately different and a sheer tour de force from script to actor to screen that it makes you dive in to their heads and into the history and it's even more weird and exciting.
Margot Robbie is superb in absolutely every frame and makes Harding a sympathetic relatable portrait and the film allows her to be at every turn. You're so swept up in the electricity that it no longer matters how much is true, how much was dramatised, how much actually happened that way.
In fact all the actors are at the top of their game. And Gillespie uses a soundtrack so well that's it's notable compared to how lacklustre soundtracks have been in films recently. The film also manages to touch upon the media's role a little bit, and it has a blistering portrait of domestic violence that is normalised in a frighteningly real way.
Craig Gillespie has long since been one of my favourite directors, making little, overlooked films that delight in a mixture of creative and conventional ways. Here's he's renewed my interest in the biopic and he's told a story with the perfect amounts of normality and madness that a true story has."
"jayjaycee","8","1","1","2 January 2020"," How media makes a monster
","""I, Tonya"" is a 2017 biopic directed by Craig Gillespie starring Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan. The first film I've watched in this new decade is the infamous underdog story and fall of figure skater Tonya Harding. Before I've seen the movie I only had rudimentary knowledge about her and the famous incident that dominated the news twenty six years ago and lead to her lifetime ban of the sport. People to this day have different views on the actual happenings and of how much she was actually involved. In the opening title it's stated that this film is based on the paradoxical interviews of the participants. This information is prominently used in the narrative structure. When I was watching it, I slowly began to notice that several scenes contradicted others and it had some continuity errors or unbelievable events. The ingenious thing about it though is how it was all done on purpose to perfectly mirror the structure of said interviews. I've never seen something like this before and it really amused me. Furthermore, after seeing the original footage in the end credits I was actually blown away by how brilliantly the actors were chosen for their respective roles. The accuracy of how the actors look compared to their real-life counterparts is eerily high. Not only the outer appearance was done right, also the acting as their characters. Margot Robbie delivered her most powerful performance as of today and definitely should have won the Academy Award for best actress (if it wasn't for the magnificent Frances McDormand in ""Three Billboards""). Also Allison Janney's transformation into LaVona Harding is scarily realistic and although she doesn't have that much screentime she dominates every single frame she's in. The interdependence of Robbie and Janney is simply stunning and shocking all the same. The tone of the film goes along greatly with the narrative and what I consider as precious, never judges one of the characters or mocks them in any way. Of course it has been a horrific tragedy and no one's not guilty in any way, but I think it treats everyone with fair respect in comparison to what the media did back in the day. Additionally, how the film is shot is just terrific as it has a lot of great shots, especially on the ice rink and in the slow motion scenes and a frantic editing style that captures the nasty attitude of the story. All in all, this brutal biopic showcases the infamous tragedy with enormous respect and contains both excellent performance and high quality writing and in comparison to what's the general belief gives Tonya Harding a whole new dimension to her as a person and the story that changed her life forever. I think it's great how it casts a new light on a not quite innocent but widely misunderstood woman and her life that has been mercilessly eviscerated by the media. I raise my hat to Gillespie to make this decision."

This movie depicts the true story of sk8ter girl Tonya Harding who in a quest to achieve the American Dream attacks her figure skating opponent Nancy Kerrigan in order to secure a spot on the US Olympic figure skating team.
The story is compelling and the actors do a fantastic job in their roles as perhaps the dumbest tools to ever draw breathe.
Margo Robbie is able to carry the load as Tonya and Janney, Hauser and Stan are spot on in their portrayals of mean spirited, low down white trash.
I know, it sounds like I didn't like it.....but I did. It will be hard to forget and is an enjoyable watch.
The only qualm I had was the music. The vast majority of it predated the events by 20 years and did not feel right. It was the grunge era set in the home of grunge and was about grungy people yei not a grunge song anywhere.!"
"stephfarinelli-17890","9","1","1","20 December 2019"," Tonya Harding: like she really was
","I have to say this movie was really good. Getting an inside look on what really happened- it is really shocking. Tonya really loved skating-performing-everything about figure skating. She started way young, too. It was her life. Until she met and fell in love with that man that ruined it all, after having beaten up on her for so many years-Jeff Goolooly, or whatever his name was. He concocted that plan to hurt Nancy Kerrigan-he was dreaming up ideas of doing something to mess with Nancy, him along with that fat guy in the movie; while he was running around and busy meeting with the fat guy, planning, Tonya was on the ice, training for her competition. That's where she was at physically and mentally. Those guys had their own agenda. And the result of that-the incident-wound up causing the Court to ban Tonya, for life, ban her from ever competing in figure skating. Destroyed her life, the only thing that kept her sane(I believe). The scene in the courtroom when the judge delivers this horrible news- at which time Tonya gets to address the Court, is such a deeply moving scene-she's pleading to the Judge to let her keep doing the only thing she knows to do-skating-and she's crying her eyes out, just trying anything to convince the judge to NOT do this to her... it's just the saddest thing to watch. The acting is extraordinary. Totally extraordinary. This movie is an eye opener. I mean you can tell that Tonya had nothing to do with what happened to Nancy when ( in the scene after the incident-when the F.B.I. are approaching Tonya and Jeff-following them around and asking questions): Tonya is NOT freaking out, she's acting normally, even accepting a ride from the F.B.I., while Jeff is freaking out, paranoid and she's wondering what the hell- Seeing the different emotions and behaviors between the guilty-Jeff and the innocent-Tonya-really shows that she had no idea that that was going to happen. Tonya was an exceptional skater, and she wanted to be as good as she could and worked hard to be the best she could-she relied on that fact alone when she competed. She did her best skating and the triple axel and all that-she didn't want to do anything else. And that was what she did-skated her best, always, and try to win based on her abilities-She wasn't trying to win at all costs-like hurting the competition! Tonya wasn't about that-she was a FIGURE SKATER, she had a gift, she knew it, and that was what her whole being was focused on. She was on the ice doing that/ while other people had other plans-and she paid for it in the long run. Also, it sucks for Nancy, that was terrible! How sIcary and painful and horrible-something Jeff Galooly himself came up with, with another sneaky-guy, who was supposedly Tonya's security-whatever, and the two other guys who were eventually added into the plan."
"gcwheaton-709-274890","8","1","1","2 November 2019"," Great film making here.
","I remember the Nancy Kerrigan incident, but didn't know anything about the background of Tonya Harding going into this film. Because it was figure skating and Margot Robbie, I assumed there would be a lot of sexuality throughout. There was none of that at all. I was so impressed. This is what making a great film is all about."
"calspers","7","1","1","26 September 2019"," Nice cooperation by Craig Gillespie and Steven Rogers
","""I, Tonya"" (2017) is neatly directed and written by Craig Gillespie and Steven Rogers, respectively.<br/><br/>The film covers the life of Tonya Harding, a former ice-skating medalist from a lower-class family.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie portraying Tonya Harding did an outstanding job, as did Allison Janney who deservedly won best supporting actress for her performance.<br/><br/>Other than that, what stood out to me were the interesting directional choices exemplified through creative character breaks, and writing qualities demonstrated through the abundant and self-aware use of tragic-comedy storytelling.<br/><br/>A recommendable and decent little biopic."
"Carrzinho","8","1","1","17 September 2019"," Absolutely captivating
","What absolutely makes this movie is the statement right at the beginning. This movie is based on a set of ""irony-free, wildly contradictory and totally true"" interviews. That's where we're at. Everybody's version of events is represented and you can make up your mind.
This device compounds what is already an incredible story and makes it even more wild and zany. The characters within are all brilliant. Any of these would steal scenes left, right and centre in any other movie. Chief burglar is Allison Janney who plays Tonya's mum. She's cruel and damaged, with a filthy mouth and absolutely hilarious.
In truth this is a very funny movie. The dim witted individuals garner much of the laughs but there's plenty of black humour too such as when Tonya's mum kicks her off a chair as a child.
This is also one of the area's where one might criticise the movie. Tonya is a victim of psychological and physical abuse at the hands of her mother and of continuous domestic abuse from her husband. This is glaringly pointed out and alarming, but so often it shifts uncomfortably tonally as we witness another jape or moment of humour.
The excellent Sebastian Stan is partly responsible too. He is undoubtedly a shameful character but often his other antics elicit sympathy.
I'm not quite sure how the director would have managed to tip toe through this mine field other than the way he does, without losing credibility or enjoyment, but it must be recognised.
A more obvious misstep is using Margot Robbie (who warranted her numerous nominations) to represent Tonya at 15. Robbie, who to me generally looks older than her years, pushes credibility here. She's absolutely acceptable at 21-23 and perfect for the ""interview"" scenes filmed years after.
Whether you're familiar with the story or not, it's absolutely remarkable and 100% worth revisiting. There are interesting takes on the class barriers put up to figure skaters (and Olympians) and the infancy of 24 hour news channels and how their primary journalistic role gave way to providing opinion and entertainment.
Caveats aside you're in for a rollercoaster of 2 hours that zips along that has so much to recommend. EIGHT"
"jmccrmck-65172","8","1","1","12 September 2019"," Wanted to see this for a long time
","The film gets a solid eight and while Allison Janney has been so lauded for her performance and that is very much deserved, watching Margot Robbie portray Tonya Harding is absolutely divine. If I were rating the film simply on that basis I would give it 9.5 stars. This movie really brings the characters to life in a way few movies do. When you arrive at the end and see clips of the real life subjects of the film , the resemblance is positively stunning. As they say, a real must see."

","Not that I knew too much about her, but I can say that the acting was great enough to be the standout thing about the movie. I can not judge the movie based on a true story that didn't know too well about. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Which is the main thing in my opinion.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"david-meldrum","7","1","1","28 May 2019"," A Mixture Of Jarring And Brilliant
","There's much to enjoy here - especially Allison Janney's and Margot Robbie's towering performances as mother and daughter. I was also struck by the cinematography of the skating sequences, which was visceral and beautiful at the same time. I was disquieted by the tone, however; I can understand the comedic edge, given the essential absurdity of much that happened. But when that comedy plays round, and occasionally bleeds over in to, the edges of elements of the story of domestic violence, it jars and feels distasteful. It can sometimes seem to be the work of middle-class people sneering and giggling at the lives of 'the others'."
"krisboogie","10","1","1","2 February 2019"," Really Great Acting

"NowShowingNZ","7","1","1","2 February 2019"," Tonya had to be CGI'd to work in this film
","Margot is one damn fine actress. I'm not going to lie, her acting in this film is off the chart good, better than her stint as Queen Elizabeth in Mary, Queen of Scots. This girl is going places. I would say the only thing letting Margot Robbie down is her looks. She's too pretty to make ugly if you get what I mean.<br/><br/>One thing that wasn't so great was the CGI used whenever Tonya was on the ice - you can tell it's CGI and apparently, the reason why they had to use CGI is that they couldn't get a stunt double to perform the complex skating techniques that Tonya performed.<br/><br/>Just think about that for a minute. Remember, this is the same woman that had her career ruined by some dumbass plot to take Nancy Kerrigan out of the competition. And they couldn't get a stunt double good enough to pull off the moves that Tonya did to earn her place on the Olympic team. There is no denying that Tonya Harding was a world-class athlete, regardless of her upbringing and background and if those things didn't matter, she would have won gold.<br/><br/>If you always thought that Tonya was worthy of all the blame over that whole debacle with Nancy Kerrigan, you should watch this film. You may be pleasantly surprised by the brutal, in-your-face style of story-telling that makes this film good entertainment.<br/><br/>And damn, that Tonya could skate!"
"bonheura","8","1","1","6 January 2019"," Interesting but harsh
","I watched the movie out of curiosity, and with much prejudice I confess. I remember when all this happened, I joined the crowd empathizing with Nancy Kerrigan and shaming Tonya. Then I forgot all of it until the releasing of this movie and I'm quite puzzled. What if...
It's an interesting movie but for a 50-something like me it was hard to watch. Firstly because of my own experience, my own perspective of the events. Secondly because of the physical abuse depicted in it by the mother then by the husband. It's one thing to know it's a movie, it's another to realize this maybe really happened to a real child, teenager, woman.
The movie is directed like a mockumentary, the acting is really awesome and the hardest thing for me was to distance myself. Movie or biopic ?
When a movie challenges me like that, I think it has done a great job."

","I, Tonya was an amazing movie based on true events and the story of Tonya Harding. Margot Robbie had her best performance in this movie. She was perfect. Alison Janney will most likely win Best Actress in a Supporting Role at the Oscars. She was so funny and fantastic. I thought Sebastian Stan did good as well. I thought the film editing was well done and deserves the Oscar nomination. This movie was really good and I would highly suggest it. You'll have a good laugh.

I believe she got the short end of the stick. 20 some years later I still believe she got shafted. I really enjoyed watching this, it really made me understand as an adult what happened. I'm sorry this happened to you Tonya. It's horrible. I wish that this documentary showed a little more real clips throughout. Only reason why I gave it 8/10"

","I went into watching this film with exceptionally high expectations given the hype (ie. Oscar nominations and wins).<br/><br/>Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it worth all the hype? Sadly no.<br/><br/>Like many reviewers here I found this movie tonally confusing. At one point it's a serious view of domestic violence, the next it's like an episode of the Three Stooges. Also I was waiting for some kind of emotional payoff that never came.<br/><br/>Sure Allison Janney was fantastic in the 10-20 mins of screen time total she got. But I can't help but be disappointed at how under utilised she was.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie was fine playing a redneck figure skater, she just wasn't Tonya Harding.<br/><br/>(By the way whoever did the CGI on Robbie's face during the ice skating scenes needs to be fired. So obvious it distracts the viewer)."
"lukeshulver","8","1","1","23 October 2018"," A trailer trash triumph!

The story was told in a interesting manner, mixing perspectives on Tonya Harding's life and the events leading up to the end of her career. <br/><br/>The movie had a nice mix of comedy and drama, feeling almost like a satire at times. The characters constantly broke the fourth wall adding a Goodfellas type vibe. All around it was an enjoyable watch.<br/><br/> Acting wise the movie was really great. Margot Robbie was phenomenal.

","I wasn't sure how I'd feel abt this movie because I thought the Tonya Harding story had been worn out with ""The Price of Gold"" (30 for 30) documentary and the many other news magazine programs about ""the incident"".<br/><br/>However...I loved this movie!! I've heard some people say that Margot Robbie was miscast because she is too pretty for the role but I really disagree. Margot Robbie is gorgeous but that shoudn't mean she's miscast...I think that she did a great job. I don't think it really matters whether or not she's pretty; Tonya Harding wasn't ugly, just a misfit. Margot Robbie really captures how Tonya must have felt about herself with all the abuse she encountered.<br/><br/>Allison Janney is really great in this. I thought it was really well cast.

"blanche-2","7","1","1","13 September 2018"," A re-telling of events of 1994 with a slightly different perspective
","I had mixed feelings while watching this excellent film and the great performances by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney.<br/><br/>I followed every second of this scandal when it broke 25 years ago. I felt as many did that if Tonya couldn't find an ice show that would let her skate to Goodfellas, she might as well quit. She definitely knew what was going on, as she admitted in a recent interview.<br/><br/>This film attempts to put her in a sympathetic light, and it does succeed - after all, she was abused by her mother physically and psychologically, her father left the family, she left school at 15 to devote herself to skating.<br/><br/>Much is made of the fact that she wasn't the typical pretty skater with beautiful skating costumes. Well, that's a little twisted, as one who followed it from the beginning and followed figure skating for years.<br/><br/>It may have been that behind the scenes, the ice skating profession didn't approve of her. But Tonya was pretty, despite what she says, and she wasn't the first skater who didn't come from money - far from it, nor was she the first skater whose mother sewed her costumes. Skating is very expensive, and families sacrifice a great deal to get their kids training, shoes, costumes, ice time, and everything that goes with it.<br/><br/>The film tries to make it seem as if Tonya was the only one with these hardships. Nancy Kerrigan comes from a middle-class family, with a legally blind mother, and if you want to talk tabloid fodder, her brother was accused of killing her father.<br/><br/>My major problem with Tonya has always been that she was a powerful skater, an excellent athlete, and she would have been on the Olympic team without anyone's knee being shattered. The subsequent notoriety and problems with her husband ruined her Olympic performance, which was sluggish - she was obviously out of shape. So what was accomplished?<br/><br/>As the movie shows us, it's now years later. Tonya was young, she made some mistakes, time to move on. After some false starts, it seems like she has. Everyone deserves a second chance. She recently made a good splash on Dancing with the Stars (which I believe pays something like $200,000 - so not bad) and she still practices her skating. She's married and has a child.<br/><br/>You can't leave the film without hoping that things continue to work out for her. The film gives us an interesting perspective on her early life, her bad marriage, the knee-bashing incident, and the stupid people who carried it out (some real dark comedy there).<br/><br/>Highly recommended, and I hope Tonya's new momentum keeps going. Time to take some responsibility instead of being a victim and move on."

","Going to see a movie about Tonya Harding was not something I ever planned on doing, but I will watch anything Craig Gillespie directs, as his movies have a way of making impossible situations believable as plausible tales (see 2007's Lars and the Real Girl or the underrated The Finest Hour). Harding becomes a victim of her own gullibility, thinking it only takes talent and hard work to succeed in the world and that not playing politics will not matter. When other people around her act out on her behalf, well....we all know what happened in the 90's figure skating competitions! We lived it as a country, and finally this tale of a true underdog can be told. Margot Robbie is a force to be reckoned with for sure, if she wasn't before."
"imseeg","9","1","1","22 July 2018"," Tonya stole my heart. She wanted to be loved, but got beaten up by everybody, including the media. Best TRUE story I have seen in years. Magnificent!
","What an incredible true story! Really amazing. For those unknown with the history of Tonay Harding: she was accused of hiring a hitman to crush the knees of her competitor at the olympics for ice skating.<br/><br/>Excellent performance by all the actors involved. I mean really EVERYBODY acts amazingly hilarious, but they do it so seriously that they really seem true to life. It is without a doubt the best performance by Margot Robbie of her entire carreer, playing a white trash redneck girl who gets beaten up by her mom, then gets beaten up by her husband, then gets beaten up by the media and justice for having dumb than dumber friends who ruined everything she loved: ice skating.<br/><br/>This movies trailer is way more aggresive than the actual movie. The trailer of ""I, Tonya"" almost depicts her as a loudmouthed b*tch, who will kill to achieve succes. But the actual movie is much more nuanced and really endearing and supportive of Tonya in the end. In essence the story is all about a little girl wanting to be loved. And the only love she ever had was ice skating. That was what her mother forced her to do, cussing at this little innocent kid, hitting this little young kid with only one goal: to achieve succes in ice skating. That is just heartbreaking to see.<br/><br/>Yes despite all the heartbreaking misery it is still a great comedy. The truly magnificent acting by all the actors, but especially by Margot Robbie, makes this tragic comedy become way more powerful than I expected it to be . Very pleasantly surprised by it. Touched me on a level few comedies ever have achieved before. Very impressed. Started googling interviews with the real Tonya Harding on youtube afterwards.What an incredible true story..."
"desmondlewissmith","8","1","1","20 July 2018"," Uncomfortable but real
","I can still recall this story when it unfolded in real life, so I was delighted to see how they would capture that piece of time in a movie. I'll admit, I had a hard time looking past Margot Robble playing Tonya Harding. It's not that Tonya Harding wasn't attractive, it's that I lived in the era where we were trained to see her as ""ugly"" because of her actions. So watching one of the hottest stars in Hollywood play a less attractive villain was a major accomplishment. Margot Robbie pulled it off with a great performance.<br/><br/>The movie from start to finish kept me interested and it ran in some ways like a 1st person documentary. The movie covered a lot of the backstory on Tonya and did in fact show the human side to her greed and aggressiveness.<br/><br/>This was an awesome movie and I would encourage most to watch it. I'd advised googling Tonya Harding first a getting a little of the backstory, it adds to the spice."

A uniformly excellent cast, irresistible soundtrack and winking sense of humor turn what could've been a standard biopic into a raucous tragedy (not even the fourth-wall breaks get old). <br/><br/>You wouldn't know that Tonya Harding's been buried in the tabloid past to look at Margot Robbie's savage performance (same can be said for Allison Janney). There's plenty of screentime devoted to ""the incident"", but the filmmakers come from behind with a sympathetic portrayal of Harding herself.

","This has been on my watchlist for a while now. I heard both good and poor things about this film, mostly concerning it's representation of Tonya Harding. Despite what I've heard, I went into this with a relatively open mind. I'm glad I got around to watching this film because it was quite entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>Starting with the acting, there is not a single noticeable weak performance in this entire film. Margot Robbie was amazing and played Tonya Harding to near perfection. Her chemistry with Sebastian Stan was great, and every time they were on screen together it was enthralling to watch their relationship slowly devolve. However, Allison Janney totally steals the show. She does an amazing job at playing LaVona, an important figure in Tonya's life. She really brings the character to life in every single scene she's in, Janney indefinitely gave a flawless performance.<br/><br/>The directing was pretty great. I'm happy to see that Craig Gillespie attempted to give this movie it's own visual flare and style. Some of the artistic choices worked really well while others, not so much. I wasn't a big fan of them constantly breaking the fourth wall, while it made sense it definitely broke my engagement in the story. Sometimes they use it for comedic effect but most of the time it fell flat on it's face. I also wasn't a big fan of the sheer amount of music choices. There are so many songs they use in the movie which are only there for like thirty seconds. Some of the music was inappropriate and unnecessary, fortunately it didn't ruin too many scenes.<br/><br/>The writing was on par with the directing. I, Tonya had a quick pace and never slowed down to tell this amazing and interesting story. Some of the jokes felt forced, but for the most part it feels like a documentary and really long flashback, which is what I believe Steven Rogers went for. <br/><br/>For the skating scenes they superimposed Margot Robbie's face over a stunt double and it looks quite obvious in the movie. I wish more of the budget went into the effects so that the superimposing looked more convincing. There's the obvious overabundance of songs, making it feel forced. <br/><br/>Overall, it's enjoyable. This movie felt heavily inspired by Wolf of Wall Street, and if you liked that movie then you'll probably find something here. They did a pretty good job of portraying her career, even though some of it feels either exaggerated or fabricated. Regardless of painting Tonya Harding as the victim in all this, I, Tonya was very entertaining."

"manders_steve","8","1","1","20 May 2018"," So much better than I expected
","I recall the Tonya Harding - Nancy Kerrigan figure skating 'incident' from its brief period of saturation coverage in the news and sports pages, and I approached this film with a bit of trepidation. Maybe it would be a sequence of overacted clichés, or unending fairly dreary skating. But I need not have worried. It is wonderfully written and cast, and you just couldn't invent people and stories like those portrayed. I don't know how faithful to the facts it is, but I very soon stopped wondering as I was carried along by the story, the characters and the overall tightness of the whole production.<br/><br/>I thought Margot Robbie, was great in the Tonya role, and Allison Janney as her driven mother LaVone must have made nearly all of us appreciate our own mothers so much more. With ex-husbands like Sebastian Stan's Jeff, and body guards like Paul Walter Hauser's Shawn, plus her mother, it's amazing Tonya got as far as she did. The film's material states that Margot Robbie did all her own skating sequences, with some four months' intensive training. I'm sure this helped her embody Tonya's unwavering desire to make her mark on the sport, particularly (as she said) I don't have much else.<br/><br/>The film is a wonderful blend of documentary, biting satire and social commentary, all held together by the competitive figure skating world. You don't need to know or care about figure skating. The total package just fairly whizzes along."
"antoniokowatsch","7","1","1","19 May 2018"," Funny, but actually serious in nature
","Overall I do like the movie. Even though many of the protagonists are what I would call ""unlikeable"" they are being portrayed in a dualistic way. We get to see them at their worst and their best. One good example would be Tonya's mom. Yes, she is a very cruel person but at the same time her motherly love shines through sometimes (like e.g. in the diner scene). On a fundamental level she does care but prefers to shield herself behind a cloak of phlegmatism and profanity. <br/><br/>Another thing that I liked was the movie's postmodern approach. There were a lot of scenes where the protagonists broke the 4th wall. I love that stuff, it makes you feel involved even though you're only an observer. Not many directors go this route because it's tricky to implement it properly. If yo do it wrong it seems gimmicky but if it's done right (like e.g. in Fight Club and the Deadpool movie) it's a real experience that you won't forget. Kudos for the execution.<br/><br/>A funny thing that I noticed; some of the protagonists call Tonya Tanya throughout the movie. And yes, although the names may seem similar their etymological origins are not; 
Tatiana -> Tanya 
Antonina -> Tonya <br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the movie was the message that it was sending. All the violence and abuse that Tonya had to endure from both her mother and husband, that's not funny. But the movie kind of makes it seem that way. With the way everything was shot the movie went a little overboard with the whole ""gratuitous violence""-shtick. It was funny the first time but then became worrying as it continued. I mean, I get it. Hollywood is currently obsessed with the strong female protagonists archetype and there is nothing wrong with that. One of my favorite protagonists of all time is Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise. But... , and this is a big ""but"", in this movie they should've just kept it real instead of simply going with the whole ""this is normal to me""-narrative. 
It's not! Domestic abuse is a serious problem and it's not going to get solved by joking about it.<br/><br/>Another thing that I didn't like was the fact that the movie didn't really portray the intense rivalry between Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. If you're old enough to remember the ""incident"" you'll know exactly how intense their rivalry was. There were also other movies about Tonya and Nancy back in those days which focused more on the rivalry between them. I really liked those. For someone who doesn't know the backstory the ""baton attack"" would seem totally ridiculous and unbelievable, but considering the circumstances it's anything but. And that's where the movie falls short. It only focuses on Tonya and totally leaves out Nancy, to the point where people who are unfamiliar with the story would think that the ""incident"" was totally unexpected. But in stories of intense rivalry there is always that one person who's willing to go the ""extra mile"". Just like in the movie Rush where Niki Lauda foolishly jeopardized his health in a daredevilish attempt to win the championship. These things actually happen in the real world; people who compete at the highest level tend to have risk-seeking personalities (think professional gamblers and Olympic athletes who dope). It's a well-defined psychological phenomenon.<br/><br/>Final verdict: recommended (for it's entertainment value)"

","Watching this, you can see how Allison Janey won the Oscar. She's an extraordinary actress and this excessive role brought her the accolade she deserves. What I didn't realize and I'm not alone with this, the major male character in this, is played by the actor who's also in the Marvel Universe as the Winter Soldier .... Mind blowing stuff I know.<br/><br/>And add to this Margot Robbie, who while beautiful, does not shy away of being and acting ugly. Getting down with a role like this and be sort of someone others would call ""trash"" is not easy, especially in the vain group that actors are associated with. But she really did her thing and she deserved the nomination at least too. Oh and did you know that what we get here is kind of what happened in the ice skating business? It's crazy and some things are still unclear, but just the fact that this madness is sort of real (recollections of the people involved, you decide what you think really happened) ... makes you realize that not all ""based on true ..."" movies are bad!"
"lesleyharris30","8","1","1","12 May 2018"," A Fascinating Biography that Never takes itself Too Seriously,
","I, Tonya is a great movie with a very well written plot and a tremendous cast. While it is a very fascinating, well told biography and the character's hardships are felt almost as soon as the film starts, I must also applaud this film for never taking itself too seriously. It has a very fun, flamboyant flow and a lot of moments are unexpectedly hilarious, including several parts where Margot Robbie breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience, making it a very fresh take on a true story. <br/><br/>I will say that the film did feel a little overstuffed at times with too many big ideas that some elements did fall flat. Running at 120 minutes, it jumps around to the main plot to the people being interviewed, which can get confusing for viewers, and it derails from the story a little too often. <br/><br/>The cast is all around terrific, the main credit going to, of course, Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney, who all transform in to these parts with great depth, being completely unlike their real life selves. Despite playing generally unlikeable people, they do manage to add layers to them that helps us connect with them on a human level. <br/><br/>Interesting and refreshing. Well written and tremendous performances, I would certainly recommend I, Tonya to anyone looking for a good biography film.<br/><br/>

","I felt so impressed, actually, about this movie. Taking the base that the last empowered woman´s film that I watched before was ""JOY"" I didn't wait so much from this movie. However, the first thing that I could understand about this, It doesn´t try to be a good-message film. Since the first moment, Craig Gillespie take us and throw us into a real life of Tonya Hardling, without any kind of hope or certainty of a inspiring message. This is a film where the main characters, doesn't try to be models to follow: they're just people flow trough the circumstances. 
I'm pretty sure that is the most important thing to say about the film. The acting is such one of the most organic that i have seen in the year (in many years, talking about bio-pics). 
The drama and the black comedy present make me feel, i think this is a bad, that actually I enjoyed the story. The screenplay and camera game were easy to follow, and the magistral acting of Allison Janney was awesome. I have a thinking that recently it could be impossible to see a movie with so much encountered feelings. ""I, Tonya"" proves that there's fantastic films that take us into a terrenal story, full of laughs and a lot of troubles."
"FelipeCarrillo","8","1","1","27 April 2018"," It wasn't her fault
","Uncovering the most controversial scandals in sports history has become cannon fodder for some writers this season. Late last year, Netflix's eye-opening documentary, ""Icarus,"" faced up to the dishonest doping method created for hundreds of cyclists and athletes consciously by way of a narrative enough expressive and refined to take home one coveted Academy Award. In other circumstances, the seventh art chose to portray one of the most talked and paralyzing ""incidents"" in the history of female figure skating, Tonya Maxene Harding's.<br/><br/>It's not necessary to say that, in the first period, who seizes the story is Allison Janney, an Oscar-winning actress who plays the figure-skating prodigy's chain-smoking, domineering soulless mother. Paradoxically, 'Golden' is the last name of the unforgiving woman who puts her little daughter under extreme daily routines, progressively getting her to an irreversible point, nonetheless, although it's difficult to accept, it's she who forcibly molds- maybe in excess -her daughter's competitive spirit through abuse, insult, and contempt; unforgettable traumatic memories that didn't mean a barrier to Tonya's golden dreams. At an acting level, Janney is superb as LaVona, a character who demanded a complicated search for humanity amongst so much revulsion and coldness. Surprisingly, she gets it by using her overwhelming talent that knows the exact point between containment and emotional overflow. From the other angle, the character counterweight rests on the tiny shoulders of Mckenna Grace, who plays Tonya in the 8-12 age range; a sweet cute girl who performs admirable dramatic scenes, especially one involving her father. One more promising actress to keep an eye on.<br/><br/>In the second stage, two big screen giants take the lead, the actors who must handle the rest of the story. On the one hand, there is an unexpectedly fiery Sebastian Stan, whose performance reveals an overwhelming dramatic range, necessary and extremely functional to the story because of his character, Stan's character background is well-assembled, at least, in terms of his towards the rebel protagonist, since he sticks with the story as exactly a supporting narrative agent, as everything must hinge on her. Jeff is a great gamble in the mind of any actor because, as well as requiring a serious dedication and a keen eye to take the right positions in the right circumstances, it comes with a deep analysis on unwavering machismo in that time, however, also involves peculiarity portraying certain relationships in which women don't decide to cut a toxic relationship off.. And the big star of the show comes into play: Margot Robbie.. The actress plays the title figure skater, Tonya, who must stand earnest personal falls throughout her life to understand that most of those unfortunate events coming her way almost daily have been consequences of the past, that ""it's never my fault"" card, repeated constantly by her, proves the irreverently empowered spirit of the woman, one which won't embrace man's injustice. The character is very caustic but deeply disturbing from the perspective in which the story exhibits it, the audience connects immediately with its rocky ascent; a connection achieved because of the imposing script that lays on the table hundreds of opportunities that Robbie takes advantage in the best way possible, situations pretending to put her at risk, but actually provoking the opposite effect: to show how strong and powerful is her after getting punched in the face, being attacked by the back or getting a knife in her arm. The character-acting relation works one hundred per cent with Margot, she takes over the whole story and doesn't care, the viewer wants her to meet her goals yet consider that certain of her actions are not the right ones, we rationalize the mistakes because the film transforms the spectator into an honest merciful human being about all the bad stuff happening to her, especially at that stage when Tonya faces a sour adulthood bordering the depressive feelings and thoughs. <br/><br/>The third stage can be named as the grand finale, the one that thousands of people in the 94's knew, yes, that ""incident"". Being a biopic, the film must synthesize with a keen sense the key facts on the star, this time, of course, such events were responsible for the future of the skater, who being involved in the attack of her main skating rival, saw her dreams go up in flames: to win an Olympic medal, wowing the whole world with a phenomenal triple axel. According to the film, everything that entails the final act serves to showcase the numerous gender gaps, from sentencing to an irritating talk with a sheriff who doesn't arrest a ""gentleman"" who has just shot his wife, deliberately overlooking countless crimes prior to this one. In this field, the film works as a social commentary about the ever-present machismo, violence and deceit, on how stereotypes can still influence the scope of your dreams. Again, Stan and Robbie are in play, who must finish the film with their most powerful tools, and they do, because our Bucky Barnes and Harley Quinn radiate strength, energy and veracity, even when their characters are opposites. A clear genre switch is perceived in this part, as it replaces the kind of black humor comedy with drama, and then jump to a singular thriller against the clock about the search for the culprit, a risky bet that could hurt the excellent dramatic construction that was being set up to that point. Besides, the whodunit sub-plot doesn't upstage the storyline, instead, it's articulated when it should and when it doesn't, allows the main story to follow its course to re-incorporate in the end, because we're there to see Tonya's full heap of trouble and that aspect has an important role. The fantastic ending doesn't admit improvement as it agrees emphatically with the casual kinetic personality that pervades all the footage, giving a coherent message about what happened that day, a message about the broken dreams of a woman who never broke down, who never accept a weak determinant, a woman who always won. It should be noted, in general terms, the excellent interpretive feast of the cast as a whole because they practically recreate with their performances the videotape recordings projected in the final credits, you can evidence the neat effort in their portrayals, amazing and terribly close to real life.<br/><br/>Artistically and technically, Gillespie's film excels, first of all, by the precise handling of incomparable framing and angles, putting in the second place its cinematography and the staging of other moments. Film inventiveness concerning the photographic stuff underlines what the script doesn't achieve by means of a simple but vivacious visual power, never falling into plasticity and always treating the vision of the director with respect. An unexpected and rebellious fourth wall breaking is highlighted, an unaccustomed technique in a drama and even more in a film of this nature, smashing the traditional rules imposed for biographical adaptations, it endows the film with an interesting satirical air that together with mockumentary style with which present the dramatized interviews, present an enviable balance between black humor and sentimental drama. Peter Nashel's soundtrack displays great hits of yesteryear that match with the tone and timing of the sequences, however, the compositions explicitly created for the film don't get the same impact or importance of the classic songs, it's a real flaw that a vital aspect like this does not get what it should.<br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" by Australian Craig Gillespie manufactures an aggressive portrayal about broken dreams, ambitions and success, vices, repercussions and defeats, working as, in addition to a voyeuristic and enlightening vehicle for the events that stirred the sporting world, an opportunity for gifted actors to push to the limit their interpretative skills. Stan, Robbie, and Janney keep firm the story from beginning to end with their impressive talent, fortifying Gillespie's intriguing vision and strange career, a filmmaker who with more indie stories could make a space among the giants. Incendiary, intense and praiseworthy acted, this film definitely puts a spotlight on actress-turned-producer Margot Robbie while showing a sweeping and realistic cinematic look at an event of unimaginable media outreach."

","I was in college when this whole thing was happening, which means I only heard the headlines but never had time to digest the story. I believed the conventional wisdom that made most people dislike Tanya Harding. I was looking forward to seeing this movie just to get a new perspective of things that I was too young to pay close attention to, so I was expecting to like the movie for it's historical review. However, I was blown away as to how well acted, written, directed, edited, and produced this movie was, and it is certainly the best movie I've seen in years, if not a decade.<br/><br/>The acting and characterizations of the people involved in this story is possibly the best I've ever seen. I think every single person in this movie deserves some sort of Oscar nod. In the closing credits they show the real people that the actors were portraying, and you will be amazed at the likeness each actor was able to convey. Amazing. <br/><br/>I was a little worried that the story may be a bit boring about what appeared to be a fairly two dimensional event, but I was totally sucked in and enjoying every morsel of gourmet movie ""food"", and it never stopped delivering. You'll laugh out loud right from the beginning of the film, sometimes uncomfortably so, as this story is much more bizarre than I ever thought possible. The writing, directing, and editing of this film will reward you with a new experience in movie watching. This was truly groundbreaking in it's artistry and delivery. <br/><br/>I won't conclude by telling you how you will see this event at the end of the movie , but suffice to say anyone that has a critical thinking mind will change their view about Tonya Harding and the ""Nancy Kerrigan event"" at least a few times while watching this film. You will be brought to the sad conclusion that no matter how guilty or not guilty that you feel Tonya is in the end, that the news media loves the headline and the sound bite too much but never cares to ""right"" the story once they've made money with the headline, leaving millions of people with hatred for things that may have never happened. This is a must see film, if only to adjust our national conscious and to correct the black and white feelings that media leaves us to deal with. If anything, this film will leave you filled with empathy and a renewed perspective of understanding of Tonya Harding, and perhaps a new mistrust of blind conventional wisdom."

"GlassBall","10","1","1","16 April 2018"," Smooth as Ice
","Before I saw this film I had a passing understanding of the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. I'd heard about it in passing, the occasional reference on some show. All of this had occurred before I was born and I had negative interest in anything vaguely related to ice skating.<br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" is one of the most enthralling, absorbing, and darkly hilarious films released in the past few years. Gillespie has crafted a punchy, fast paced, visceral experience in the form of relationship drama, ice skating, and white trash. His mastery over speed, camera movement, and sparse use of slow-mo turn the ice skating scenes from spectacle to euphoria, tapping into the rhythm, specific movements, and flow. Beyond the captivating ice skating scenes are the familial and interpersonal scenes between Tonya (Margot Robbie), Jeff (Sebastian Stan), Lavona (Allison Janey), and the hilariously incompetent Sean (Paul Walter Houser). It's hard to describe just how well these actors meld together. Intense scenes of domestic violence and screaming matches are punctuated with interview footage of the characters years after the incident. It highlights the outstanding acting of the cast, as well as the brilliance of the sharp editing.<br/><br/>I have no shame in saying that the Best Actress Oscar was stolen from Margot Robbie. The dynamism in her performance, the ability to be a rosy cheeked hopeful, as well as a horrific vision of stress and madness, is just astounding. The raw emotion in the scenes when confronting her abusive mother and abusive husband is gut wrenching. You feel Tonya's fear, you understand her plight, and you feel nothing but sorrow for her. The struggle for success matched with the anger of the people around Tonya comes through as clear as an unmuddied lake. Alongside Robbie there is Allison Janey who played Lavona Harding with tangible malice. Her sharp tongue, quick wit, and total apathy towards anything except her and her daughter, again, come through clear. Jeff Gilooly is brought to tremendously hilarious, as well as uncomfortable, life by Sebastian Stan, showcasing his ability to be more than just a Marvel accessory.<br/><br/>The real praise lies with the character of Sean, Gilooly's partner in crime. Hilarious, astoundingly idiotic, and so ironically egotistical that it's hard to believe such a man lived on this Earth. Paul Walter Houser embodied this man, only compounded by the showing of actual archive footage at the end of the film. Truly a performance for the ages in all the right ways.<br/><br/>On every level ""I, Tonya"" succeeds. Performance, camera work, music, editing, writing, all of it. Memorable scenes from start to finish, I could sing this films praises for hours and hours, instead I'll keep it short and simply say, see it."
"michael-young-585","7","1","1","15 April 2018"," It's Not My Fault
","""It wasn't my fault"" is a line we hear over and over in this movie - it should probably be a secondary title, as the movie seems to serve as a 'sort of' apology for what they call The Incident, the 'whacking' of Nancy Kerrigan's knees. Everyone is aware of that incident - it was, for a while in the 90s the lead story in the news, capturing the tabloid interests of America by combining a forum for competition in skating, social class, and good looks. Tonya Harding captured more than her fifteen minutes of fame.<br/><br/>The movie does not definitively answer the question of what, exactly, Tonya's role was in the trailer-mafia story. Telling the tale from the mouth's of several of the participants, I don't think we yet have the final truth about whether Ms. Harding plotted the 'whacking' in advance. If the movie truly represents her confession about the matter, then she was at least knowledgeable after-the-fact and participated even dim-wittedly in the cover-up. For that she was punished greatly, being banned from the sport that had defined her life for nearly twenty years.<br/><br/>If we are to believe Tonya, though, 'none of it was her fault'. No, instead it was the judges who could never get past her background; her coach who never gave enough; her husband, who she loved despite the marital violence; his friends whose egos exaggerated their mildly nefarious plot; and, especially, her Mother who, despite giving her as much as she was able, never really gave her any support at all. Whatever happened was always TO her, not BECAUSE of her.<br/><br/>And so the movie leaves you with a very ambivalent set of feelings. You'd like to at least understand Tonya's role in The Incident, and perhaps leave with a little sympathy for her fate. But you can't - there is no acceptance from her here, and no humility. Its all about how awful her life was and how, whatever happened, it has its explanations outside of her.<br/><br/>The movie comes to us from the fertile imaginations of writer Steven Rogers and director Craig Gillespie. Rogers wrote StepMom, a movie from a couple decades ago starring Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts about a dying wife and mom who selects her replacement. I remember the story as being effective and intriguing, although it was not a huge success. Gillespie is best known for directing Lars and the Real Girl which had some genuinely weird and funny moments which he succeeds in bringing to I, Tonya. <br/><br/>One device they bring to this movie that succeeds wonderfully is telling the story in two ways - one in conventional movie scenes, and the other as a series of interviews with each of the characters, separately, sitting in chairs and recounting the events as they remember them. Then, as an added effect, at certain points in the movie the characters break the fourth wall by speaking directly to the audience through the camera. Although this stunt is a dangerous one because it often fails, in this case it seems to add credibility as well as a certain sense of humor to an already twisted story-line.
The movie received a well deserved Oscar nod for film editing. Tatiana Riegel also worked with Gillespie on the Lars and the Real Girl project. In I, Tonya, she succeeds in putting together a tight movie with no extra fat - every scene adds to the film and helps tell the story.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie, as Tonya, does a credible job, and I can understand the nomination for leading actress as the Harding character was not an easy one to play. But I couldn't help but think, as I watched the movie, that she was miscast. Simply put, Ms. Robbie is too attractive to play the Tonya role. Robbie is five inches taller than Harding and doesn't have nearly the muscular build that gave Harding a huge part of her image as a redneck female (Harding was often referred to as Thunder Thighs and she could bench press more than her own weight). Robbie shines in roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, or Jane in Legend of Tarzan, or Naomie in Wolf of Wall Street, or even as herself in The Big Short - yes, she works best in more glamorous roles. She gets an A for effort here, but it's simply the wrong actress for the part.<br/><br/>Allison Janney, on the otherhand, is damn near perfect as Tonya's mother, Lavona. As she chain smokes and swears through the entire first half of the movie, we get a real clear insight into how Tonya turns out the way she did. That Lavona is cold and hard is real enough, but she also gave as much of herself to Tonya as she could afford to give without losing her own identity. Her methods were often crude, but her motives seemed, to me, honest. Janney succeeded in playing a very complex character without dominating her scenes. She was, in fact, a Mother.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is not a perfect movie. At times it doesn't seem to know whether it is a tragedy or a comedy - and works at being both. When it presents violence, which is frequent and fundamental to the story, it sometimes does so with intended comic effect. That can become disorienting to the viewer. Combine that with the almost documentary tone, and the frequent audience asides, and you have a work that is both interesting and challenging to watch."

","Let me first tell you that I think figure ice skating is one of the most boring things to watch. So I was, let just say, not thrilled to watch this movie. But everybody heard about the Nancy Kerrigan incident, and Tonya Harding would become world famous after that incident, even more than Nancy Kerrigan, so I was interested by the story leading to the incident. And I didn't regret watching this movie because I thought it was really well made, with great actors, and a quite unbelievable story. I just think they should have said a bit more about the press that condamned Harding from the beginning and that she clearly didn't deserve that. I was also biased by watching the news about the incident in those days, and this movie made me realize that Tonya didn't had an easy life and should not be blamed for every sin under the sun. Very good acting from Margot Robbie playing Tonya. The best actress in this movie to me is Allison Janney playing Lavona, the mother of Tonya. That character deserved to have her kneecaps broken instead of Kerrigan. A truely awful mother, one that not deserve to have kids. The movie is about white thrash at it's best. But also about how corrupt and narrow minded the ice skating world is, aspecially the judges. Shame on them. One that clearly deserves jail time, regardless the Kerrigan incident is Tonya's husband Jeff, played by Sebastian Stan. An awful human being, a controling egocentric women beater. But the absolute winner of the Darwin award is the character Shawn, played by Paul Walter Hauser. If that story truely happened like they showed in this movie, then that must be one of the dumbest people I ever saw. An absolute garbage of a human being, a waste of space. I, Tonya is a movie that will be appreciated by a lot of movie lovers. Well made, with a great cast, and with an incredible story, a story that had to be told."
"nadiatownshend","9","1","1","10 April 2018"," Honest and Brutal
","The word honest is used here as a reflection on the honesty of the characters in who they are. We will of course never really know whether she was indeed involved to the extent as stated. <br/><br/>If anything the film really gave the characters involved their chance to lay it all to rest and set the record straight as it were. <br/><br/>But more than that - it is an in depth character study of those key players in the infamous scandal and what happened for them to reach that breaking point so to speak. <br/><br/>The actors and actresses do not hold back with their characteristic and comedic portrayals and at times can be rather brutal - Allison Janney anyone?! It really is a triumph in terms of acting, script and the production of a true story - the story itself in its retelling could have gone either way but the screenplay was impressive and pushed our actors talents to their limits - especially the excellent Margot Robbie, who is almost unrecognizable in her portrayal. <br/><br/>Cinematography was stylish and made use of a toned down filter in colour schemes which reflected the late 80's/early 90's well and really set the scene. <br/><br/>The humour doesn't miss a beat and is cleverly dry, inserting some serious moments in between. <br/><br/>We feel genuinely sorry for Margot Robbie's, Harding as a woman who was consistently up against something and someone throughout her life - at points tough to watch but never drowning in it's own self-indulgence, it hits all the right beats and draws emotion for a character who was chastised mercilessly without clear cut evidence to implicate her in the crimes she was judged for. Not to say that what she did was right, she was involved in some wrongs, how much we will never know, but one thing we do know is she was one hell of a skater who fought for approval with every stride and triple axel."

Arguably a 'mockumentary', it touches on Tonya as a child while the film primarily focuses on her mid-career through Lillehammer and ends with her boxing shenanigans. Overall, this was just fun film making; creating caricatures of everyone involved, clever editing, with character asides, well-paced, ample smarmy gags, colorful scenes and great acting. It didn't excuse Tonya's behavior but helped to better explain her personality by continually bashing her mom."
"SnoopyStyle","8","1","1","17 March 2018"," American infamy
","Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) comes from poor white trash and her domineering, abusive mother LaVona (Allison Janney). She had a natural talent for skating from a young age and driven by her unrelenting mother. At 15, she meets Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). Despite her mother or maybe to spite her mother, she marries Gillooly who slowly turns more and more violent. Her ability to execute the triple axel jump puts her above her competitors but her lower class crass personality clashes with the judges. In the 1992 Winter Olympics, she fails to medal coming in fourth. She falls back into waitressing when her former coach Diane convinces her to return for the 1994 Winter Olympics. During the leadup, she would be embroiled in an infamous incident with fellow skater Nancy Kerrigan.<br/><br/>It's funny at times with an undertone of Greek tragedy. It is pure delicious white trash infamy. It's great material and this movie has fun with it. It does have two hurdles to overcome. First is the unreliable narrator. The movie does play with this from a couple of different angles. It would be nice to play up even more this idea. It's fun and it inoculates against any slant in the story telling. The second is Margot Robbie's age. She's asked to play a very wide range from 15 all the way to present day. She doesn't look the part as a 15 year old. The movie could have played with that by claiming that she looked old for her age. It could be a funny jab at the filmmaking compromises. Quite frankly, she fits more after her failure in 92 and the movie works better as a struggling underdog. The more downtrodden the better she fits the role. Neither hurdle is major and both can be excused. Both Margot and Allison are terrific. Overall, this is a fun take on an infamous American story."

As this is apparently the only genuine affection Tonya has ever received from her mom, she grasps the mother in an embrace...and then discovers that LaVona Harding is carrying a tape recorder, attempting to get a confession from her daughter about her culpability in the notorious Nancy Kerrigan incident. <br/><br/>The shattering moment described above is the culmination of the film's depiction of a tragic history of child and spousal abuse that plagued Tonya Harding growing up with her mother and later living with her rage-o-holic husband. At least from the filmmaker's point of view, ""I, Tonya"" offers a perspective on the figure skater's life that was not apparent to the public in the 1990s. <br/><br/>Director Craig Gillespie makes use of a quasi-documentary approach to Harding's story. Characters break the fourth wall and directly address the audience. We get different characters' perspectives on the rise and fall of Tonya Harding. It is a film style that offers an ironic and frequently humorous approach to what could have been a tragic saga. As Gillespie confessed in the DVD bonus track of the film, the script was ""a crazy dance between tragedy and comedy.""<br/><br/>Center ice in the film is Margo Robbie with the formidable challenge of recreating Tonya Harding. Robbie does not resemble Harding physically; Amy Schumer would have been a dead ringer. But Robbie apparently worked on becoming an accomplished ice skater, and, above all, she reached into the soul of the young woman whose entire life revolved around figure skating.<br/><br/>To the viewer, it becomes apparent early on that Harding was surrounded by idiots. With the exception of her devoted skating coach, Harding was on the receiving end of both physical and psychological abuse from both her mother LaVona, who pitches a steak knife into her daughter's right arm, and her cowardly husband Jeff Gillooly, who would beat her to a pulp and, on one occasion, shot her as she was attempting to flee from another beating. <br/><br/>At times, the filmmakers get carried away in their attempt to paint a sympathetic picture of Tonya. This is most apparent in the suggestion that the skating judges would downgrade her performances because of her dress or demeanor. But ""style"" is a component in competitive figure skating. Tonya Harding's style did not have the elegance of a Nancy Kerrigan. It did not even have the elegance of an amateur skater like Margot Robbie. Tonya's coaches could have worked with her more carefully on this part of her routines.<br/><br/>Still, the film offered an insightful approach to Harding's life story. By the end of the film, there is a fresh perspective offered on the much maligned Tonya Harding. Instead of being ""loved, ""hated, or ""a punch line,"" the Tonya Harding of this film is a robust, multi-dimensional, and all-too-flawed human being. Much credit belongs to Craig Gillespie as director, Steven Rogers as screenwriter, and Margot Robbie for pulling off this miracle on ice."

Everyone did a phenomenal acting job in this & writing was superb!!!
Allison Janney deserved Academy award for her performance!
It felt like it was more a commentary on life and how your

Cannot recommend this highly enough!

","Being old enough to remember how the mainstream print and electronic media spun the Harding Kerrigan incident when it happened, I'm gratified to say that ""I, Tonya"" has finally granted the demonized Harding some small measure of justice.<br/><br/>Back then the MSM presstitutes plugged Harding and Kerrigan into a simplistic ""trailer trash villain vs American sweetheart heroine"" mold, and pretty much everyone bought it, myself included. <br/><br/>But thanks to the makers of ""I, Tonya"", many of us now have a far more nuanced understanding of the two Olympic competitors, and most importantly of how unfairly Harding was treated by ""polite society"" and the ""just us system""."
"hunter-friesen","7","1","1","7 March 2018"," Margot Robbie is fantastic in a film that flashy, blunt, and unapologetically crude
","Margot Robbie has had a pretty big climb to fame in the past few years. She kicked off her Hollywood career in 2013 with The Wolf of Wall Street, then made a splashy cameo in Adam McKay's 2015 hit The Big Short. She then achieved A-list status in 2016 with Suicide Squad and The Legend of Tarzan. Now in 2017, she's hitting the awards circuit with I, Tonya, in which she plays the infamous figure skater Tonya Harding. Her performance is the highlight of the film, which is a semi-autobiographical story about one of America's most beloved and most hated athletes.<br/><br/>The film opens with interviews from Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie), her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), and her mother LaVona Golden (Allison Janney). The interviews are taking place about a decade after the ""incident"" and are intended as a way for each of the characters to tell their version of what happened. In between the interviews we are treated to the story of how Tonya grew up as a redneck figure skater in Oregon. We witness her rough upbringing at the hands of her mother and how it affected her skating. After that, we see her meteoric rise to superstardom, all of which is constantly in jeopardy because of her rocky relationship with her simpleton of a husband, Jeff. And finally, the moment you've all been waiting for, the Nancy Kerrigan incident. We watch it go down, the due process immediately after, and how Tonya got caught up in a mess of stupidity. <br/><br/>What I can say is that this film doesn't do anything wrong, it just does everything adequate or well. The handling of the story through interviews and flashbacks does well at establishing the chaos and insanity since each character gives conflicting reports as to what actually happened. The film also uses the fourth wall to have Tonya interact with the audience and extend the autobiographical nature of the story. However, the interviews lose steam about halfway through and are left dormant until the very end. It felt weird since they were heavily used in the beginning and are made to seem like the central medium for telling the story.<br/><br/>Director Craig Gillespie uses stylish editing and camera tricks to keep the story flowing at a quick and breezy pace. Some scenes are oversaturated with them, but overall the tricks serve their purpose well. <br/><br/>The behind the scenes work does a nice job at establishing a feel for the 80's and 90's. The hairstyles and fashion are timely and will make anyone who lived in that period feel nostalgic. <br/><br/>Last and most importantly, the performances carry this film all the way to the very end. Margot Robbie is astonishing as Tonya. She has the perfect mix of looks, personality, and skill to pull off the role. She plays Harding perfectly at every point in her career, especially at the lowest. <br/><br/>Allison Janney is also great as Tonya's cold and unloving mother, LaVona. Janney goes full out in makeup and chain-smoking, giving an authentic portrayal of a mother that will never be satisfied with her children.<br/><br/>Sebastian Stan gives a good, but not great performance as Jeff. He does his best to make Jeff his own, but unfortunately gets overshadowed by Robbie and Janney. On a positive note, Stan shows off a wide range of emotions as Jeff slowly turns from a dumb nice guy to a violent madman.<br/><br/>I, Tonya delivers an entertaining and original way to tell a story that is well known by almost everybody alive. While it's a good film caught in a time of great films, Robbie and Janney give career-defining performances that make this film deserving of your time."
"agmoldham","6","1","1","7 March 2018"," Do we get nearer the truth
","I guess like a lot of people who watch ""I, Tonya"" I can remember the events surrounding Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan pretty well. This movie is focussed on these events from the viewpoint of Tonya Harding. You can't help wondering exactly what the truth is behind the story and only the people who were actually involved will ever really know. The movie tells the story of Tonya via and interview and little snippets of her life story. Some of the domestic violence scenes portrayed are quite raw and she certainly endured some very difficult relationships in her life.<br/><br/>The skating scenes are really nicely shot and Margot Robbie does a pretty good job in the lead. Allison Janney steals the show playing Tonya's mother and was well worthy of the supporting actress award. The good thing is that she does get quite a lot of screen time as well. Well worth a watch."

","When me and a family friend have looked at the credits of sexy Margot Robbie,it has always been disappointing to see that the projects she has been involved in, have largely been of poor quality (with Robbie being the only stand-out in Suicide Squad and Legend of Tarzan.) Not checking her credits for a while, I was pleased to hear that Robbie was starring in an Oscar-nom Drama,which led to me putting some blades on.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Completing her ""breaking the 4th wall"" biopic trilogy, (after The Wolf of Wall Street and The Big Short)Margot Robbie gives an excellent performance as Tonya. Laying bare the abusive treatment Harding got from her mum,Robbie draws the viewer in when talking to camera,by giving the off the cuff comments a wicked, matter of fact streak. Caked in dirt and grime from Harding's Rust Belt roots,Robbie (who does a very good fake accent) sweeps pass any shots glamour by covering Harding's face in pure joy when on the ice rink,which fades to gloom the moment she steps off. Insulting her daughter every time she is on the side lines, Allison Janney gives a great performance as LaVona,with Janney throwing LaVona's put downs with razor-sharp aim, and continuing to light cigs to LaVona's dismissive image of Tonya.<br/><br/> Skating along real and CGI skating, director Craig Gillespie & cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis give Tonya's time on the ice rinks an action set-piece thrill,thanks to the long shots showing each move being performed,being complimented by close-ups on the rush Tonya gets from a successful performance. Breaking the thin ice of her private life, Gillespire twirls round Tonya with stylish whip-pans catching the jet-black Comedy asides in Steve(n) Rogers script from Tonya and a growing group of hanger-ons who will eventually force Tonya off the rink."
"yourjenji","7","1","1","1 March 2018"," Chokes on its own hubris
","Yeah, this movie is punchy and Alison Janney delivers her best performance of her entire career. But I didn't think this film was anywhere near as great as others appear to. There was something really tacky and self congratulatory about the vibe that didn't sit well with me. The tongue in cheek story is offensive to both the real victim Nancy Kerrigan as well as Tonya Harding, who is given an insulting cartoonish treatment in this and a woeful Southern accent. There were a lot of faults, in particular the gross miscasting of a tall slim blank and demure Australian to play the short, stocky, fierce Tonya. You can't just put bad make up and hair on someone who is all wrong for the part and then expect the audience to think it's an Oscar worthy portrayal."
"blazaj","6","1","1","1 March 2018"," Could've been good
","Margot Robbie was a poor choice for this role, from body constitution, the fact that she really looks older (even off screen), to the mere acting. Not once did I take her for a labour girl/aspiring olympic in her early twenties. Even less for Tonya Harding. Sebastian Stan wasn't very convincing either. The only believable characters were Tonya's mother (played by a truly awesome Allison Janney) and the fat guy. 
Otherwise, a story worth being told, much more sensational than this movie was able to depict."
"PyroSikTh","8","1","1","27 February 2018"," A Movie about the nature of Truth and Perspective
","I'll admit, before this movie I had no idea who Tonya Harding was (I was about 4 at the time). A biopic about a figure skater? Why would I care about that? It's probably some prissy inspirational sports movie. But then the trailer dropped and painted it more as a figure skating movie dressed as a Scorsese gangster pic. Suddenly my interest piqued.<br/><br/>For those unaware, I, Tonya follows the story of infamous American figure skater Tonya Harding. She came from a working class background and suffered an abusive mother (and later an abusive husband), but she found her calling at a young age and carried on, ultimately becoming the first American woman to successfully land a triple axel (a move far too complicated for me to fully understand) in high level competition. Unfortunately that was her peak, and she ended up in fourth at the '92 Winter Olympics. When the '94 Winter Olympics came along, she picked herself back up to get back in the game. Unfortunately for her, her ex-husband - desperate to help her out - decided to intimidate Nancy Kerrigan, Tonya's biggest competition both for qualifying and for medals, but it got out of hand and Tonya was implicated in a serious case of GBH, banned from skating for life, and has suffered an infamy ever since (eclipsed that year only by OJ Simpson himself).<br/><br/>Tonya's innocence, and the degree of her involvement in the plot against Nancy, has been a point of debate for the last two decades. At the time she was painted unequivocally as the villain, but as time has gone on, the truth has become mired in contradictory accounts from all involved, and I, Tonya uses this to it's advantage. It breaks the main narrative up with mock interviews with the characters (which were apparently based on real interviews), and fourth-wall breaking, complete with a disclaimer at the beginning that the story is told from contradictory information. While on the surface this is a Tonya Harding biopic, it takes the opportunity to tell a deeper story of truth and perspective. One person's truth is not the same as another's, which is a point beautifully made with the mock interviews by having them deliver the same lines at the same time in a different way with different meanings behind it.<br/><br/>As such, it paints a picture of characters enveloped in shades of grey. No-one is a flat-out antagonist (apart from maybe Tonya's mother), and no-one is a heroic protagonist. Even Tonya herself is painted in a light that is both sympathetic and accusatory (although I'll admit more on the sympathetic side; this is her biopic after all). The character work is absolutely solid, even down to the supporting characters. And on the note of culpability, the film never really takes a side on that either, instead offering a composite of both innocence and guilt.<br/><br/>Of course the shades of grey characters would not have come off all that well without some serious talent and hard work behind them. Fortunately I, Tonya is a powerhouse of performances. Margot Robbie is absolutely the star of her own film (she was an active producer as well). Her Tonya is both trashy and likeable in equal measure. She manages to embody her spine and her vulnerabilities really well and tap into both at a moments notice often in the same scenes. There's one scene in particular where she's just putting make-up on, and goes through so many emotions in less than a minute; from breaking down to gritted determination to fake happiness to sheer desperation. Allison Janney is the other big performer offering as close to an antagonist as the movie gets. LaVona is brutally cold and emotionless, and yet her one moment of reaching out oddly doesn't feel out of character at all. Sebastian Stan is also really good as Tonya's abusive husband, with a fury to fear and a pathetic desperation for love both. And then there's Paul Walter Hauser as Jeff's friend who does such a fantastic job of such a fundamentally stupid character, without going too far and making him a hammy one-trick performance. The added real-life footage at the end really brings his performance as Sean into a great light.<br/><br/>From a more technical standpoint, I, Tonya finds it's biggest pitfall though. There's a fair amount of CGI used here (for a drama) to put Margot Robbie's face on a figure skater, and it can be painfully obvious at times. That said the famous triple axel move was entirely CGI'd (as such a difficult move as it is, there aren't many around who can actually perform it, and those who can can't afford to waste an injury on a movie) and you wouldn't know, even when it's put through slow-motion. The music is also a little hit-and-miss. On one hand it uses some great tracks from Fleetwood Mac, Supertramp, and Siouxsie and the Banshees, but on the other hand they're all tracks that get used in movies a lot and by this point are starting to feel a little clichÃ©.<br/><br/>I enjoyed I, Tonya a fair amount. While it does absolutely paint Tonya more sympathetically than mid-90s media, it somehow feels closer to the truth of ""the incident"" than we'll likely ever get, and utilising the opportunity to make the movie a composite of contradictions result in some hugely entertaining and humourous interactions. The true-life footage and catch-ups at the end are really eye-opening as well, showing that the story that's at times too stupid to believe wasn't exaggerated in the areas you'd expect. I give I, Tonya a low 8/10."
"bowmanblue","9","1","1","27 February 2018"," Harley does figure skating
","I know it's really bad to typecast an actor, but all the way through 'I, Tonya' I couldn't help but see Harley Quinn from the -debatably-popular - 'Suicide Squad' wielding her baseball bat all the way through. However, don't take that as a negative. Whether the cinema-going public loved or loathed DC's villain ensemble, most seemed to agree that Margot Robbie was a stand-out point.<br/><br/>Back in the early nineties I remember hearing about the story 'I, Tonya' was based on, but never really knowing too much about it, i.e. an American Olympic figure skater was so determined to win the gold medal that she had a rival on her own team beaten up. Now, upon watching that brief summary stretched out into a two-hour movie, I'm still little clearer about the details of the event, but then I think that's the point. Many stories that are based on real life (or 'inspired by true events' as seems to be the popular phrase these days) are debateable as to how true they really are. However, right from the beginning, this film states in some opening text that it's based on multiple versions of many unbelievable events. I liked that. Not only does it suggest that what you hear is subjective, but it also sets the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>Once the 'characters' have been introduced, the story progresses and, quite often, we see different versions of the same event - as seen by the different person who witnessed it/is telling that portion of the story. I know I mentioned that Margot Robbie gives off a real 'Harley Quinn' vibe, but it works. I hope she's not actually going to just get typecast as the - borderline nutty - woman of the big screen, as I'm sure she can play numerous roles. However, in this case, I dose of 'Daddy's Little Monster' is just the ticket and she steals every scene she's in. And she has to work for that accolade, as the supporting cast all do their best to upstage her. There wasn't a single bad performance in this movie and it was a real treat to watch.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how much actual skating Margot Robbie did and how much is some form of CGI trickery. I did my best to stare intently to see if I could pick out anything that would give the effects away and either my eyesight isn't that good, or the CGI was just better, as it looks like she's on the ice the whole time.<br/><br/>I don't know how true to what really happened this film is, but I do know it's great entertainment and has a great cast on display. Special mention to Allison Janney, who plays possibly the worst on-screen mother since poor Carrie White's single parent! Only after I'd seen this film did I understand that one marketing quote was something along the lines of 'The Goodfellas of ice skating.' I'm not sure I saw the similarities, but I would say it's an epic tale that's definitely worth watching. It's like Harley Quinn gave up crime, became a figure skater and then took up crime again (maybe!)."
"fox_ronan","9","1","1","26 February 2018"," Powerful, Gripping & Emotional. Like the sport itself.
","During the course of our lives, we are guaranteed to share distinctive moments with those close to us. Yet interestingly, we will all remember those events completely differently. I, Tonya explores this abnormality of the human perspective, an abnormality which leaves us to believe our experience is the absolute and only truth. This film explores this idea through the vessel of the infamous figure skater Tonya Harding. A woman's who's sporting career and personal life made global news in the early 90s. Tonya was perhaps involved in one of the most controversial sporting events in the world, the assault of Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics. Even now, when the key events of the assault are so well publicised, the details and motivations surrounding the incident are still unclear. Hence why Craig Gillespie's amusingly decides to open the film with disclaimer that this story is ""irony free, wildly contradictory and totally true"". <br/><br/>Considering the vast array of perspectives on these complex events, one might suspect that such a story would be a challenge to adapt into an onscreen affair. However, Steven Rogers and Craig Gillespie creatively rise to the occasion by using clever framing devices such as the unreliable narrator. They use this in conjunction with a series of authentic interviews to contextualise the overall narrative, but throughout the film they also use the device for comic relief and emotional impact. The film also uses Deadpool esque fourth wall breaks to achieve similar effects. The film in fact uses a variety of stylistic techniques, which on paper seems like a risky choice considering the sensitive nature of the material at play. Margot Robbie certainly seemed conscious of this and she has talked at great length that as a producer on this film, she was determined to bring on board of a director who could simultaneously balance the beauty and horror of Tonya's life. I would say that Robbie made a good choice as Gillespie, for the most part, succeeds in balancing these dichotomous tones. <br/><br/>Gillespie decides to start the story early, as the film opens with Tonya as a young girl (portrayed magnificently by Mckenna Grace) and we see some of the early defining moments that would come to shape her character. The film then documents her adolescent interactions with her abusive mother LaVona Golden (Allison Janney) and the beginnings of her relationship with the infamous Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). The narrative then progresses to focuses on the professional highlights of Tonya's career, (such as her iconic triple axel at the 1991 US Championships), her tumultuous private life and eventually the 'incident' at the 1994 Olympics which forever changed Tonya's life. With such extensive ground to cover, there was a danger of losing focus and under developing certain story elements. Despite these potential trappings, I, Tonya manages to give equal weight to its various narrative arcs which only serves to enhance the audience's connection to this atypical story. <br/><br/>I must confess, before this film was released I had never heard of Tonya Harding. I think it's fair to say that this off the wall story was a bit before my time. I also hadn't heard much buzz in the lead up to its release, which is odd considering the film has received extensive critical appraisal in the US. Thus, it's fair to say that I was rather surprised that this film blew me away. <br/><br/>There's so much to praise about this film, but to me what stands out the most is the phenomenal performances. Firstly, Margot Robbie absolutely excels as the titular character. I knew she was a talented actress based on what I had seen of her in The Wolf of Wall Street and Suicide Squad. I just didn't know she was this good. Shame on me. In I, Toyna Robbie manages to deliver a sweeping yet nuanced performance. One minute her blunt and comical performance has you laughing at loud and the next you're emotionally moved by the horrid nature of some of her character's experiences. She really does bring a lot of charm and personality to one of the most vilified women in modern US history. It's even more impressive when you take into account that this is her first ever performance in a leading role. A performance that has been deservedly been recognised with a best actress nomination.<br/><br/>Though it must be said, Allison Janney absolutely steals the show as Tonya's mother, LaVona Golden. She effortless portrays a woman who thinks she's a fantastic mother who provides for her daughter. Whilst in reality, all she does is instill various complexes and enables a cycle of abuse. Whether Tonya's mother was actually like this is up for discussion, as the portrayal of Tonya's mother in this film was entirely based on descriptions given by Tonya and Jeff. Interestingly, despite the vast discrepancies in their stories and their clear disdain for one another, the one thing they agree on is what LaVona was like. Regardless, Allison Janney is absolutely wonderful, throughout the film she just masterfully oozes toxicity and cruelty whenever she's onscreen. If the academy doesn't give her best supporting actress at this year's Oscars it will be daylight robbery.<br/><br/>Another strong point of this wonderful film is its exploration and portrayal of abuse. It carefully and accurately captures the cycle of abuse, and how one's treatment as a child can affect the relationships and decisions one makes as an adult. Robbie's performance gives us an insight into a woman who was horrifically abused not only by her own mother, but also by her husband. The film allows the audience to comprehend the danger that Tonya was subjected to; dangers that only escalated as she aged and grew in notoriety. So much so that the film calls out the audience, essentially the world, for how it treated her. The world loved Tonya for a fleeting moment, hated her the next and eventually ridiculed her. A cycle she had been accustomed due to years of abuse, a fact the film heartbreakingly conveys. My only criticism would be that at certain points the artistic flourishes of the film do lessen the impact of the emotional intensity and the brutality of Tonya's experience. Yet this is a rare occurrence because of Gillespie's direction and Robbie's performance.<br/><br/>I could honestly write at great length about the various things I love in I, Tonya. Whether it be Sebastian Stan's excellent performance as Jeff Gillooly, the film's imaginative uses of a colourful soundtrack or the genuinely exciting skating sequences which have the intensity of a high-octane action flick. Yet I think what stood out to me the most is that this isn't your average awards season biopic, it hasn't been solely constructed with the purpose of winning awards. The film, despite its artistic flourishes and humorous moments has something important to say. At its heart it's a meaningful mediation on the complexities and difficulties of life, and how these can completely change someone's circumstances. Whether it be something abstract like social class or something brutally tangible such as abuse. I, Tonya leaves us to ponder what could have been if the world wasn't so cruel. <br/><br/>Because of that I, Tonya unapologetically stands out for the crowd of artsy and pretentious award season films. Just like how the woman herself stood out from the inauthentic and fraudulent world of ice skating princesses. For that alone, this film deserves to be championed and celebrated."

","'I, Tonya (2018)' is inspired by real events but makes no qualms about its contradictory nature, instead focusing on showing the story from all sides possible, and is told through a fast, frenzied and frankly odd mix of traditional non-linear, narration-heavy film-making interspersed with fairly regular to-camera interviews (recreations of real-life footage on which the whole affair is based) and occasional fourth wall breaks. It's a sardonic, sad and, at times, difficult picture despite its occasional moments of (black) humour, actually ending up quite a bleak and brutally honest piece that leaves a bitter aftertaste of melancholic regret with a distinct hint of unfortunate inevitability.

"coreyjdenford","8","1","1","23 February 2018"," Axel folly
","This review of I, Tonya is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>IN JANUARY 1994 - Tonya Harding famous for being the first American woman to complete the most difficult trick in Figure Skating this gained her a reputation as an adored sports-woman she literally had the world at her heels (or in this case her blades). However it wasn't long until she became infamous for an alleged attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan. So more often than not she's remembered not only as having a dislikened attitude towards the pompous judges and sometimes against the audience - also she's remembered for the attack on her rival which not only got her banned from all future Olympic events but she was also forced to retire from skating in general. And, I, Tonya is more than capable of showing her life. 
 
We start with Tonya as a child played by Gifted's Mckenna Grace already forced into the world of figure skating only a few years before by the rule of her overbearing mother LeVona Harding (Allison Janney), Grace pulls a terrific performance as the already tortured child who starts to gain a bad attitude especially towards her dance teacher (Julianne Nicholson) - behind that though is a young skater who's ambitions are high, competing at a high level she quickly becomes a world-renowned athlete. On the ice she's dedicated to winning a life that's better than her own; at home she's tortured by her mother who sees it as a way to get her to become a champion. Then we skip to her teenage years - now it's Margot Robbie to take the reins - on the verge of gaining world fame after competing in championships, she finds a chance to escape from her tortured life at home and get away from her mother when she meets Sebastian Stan's Jeff Gilooly, but even after that moment when she feels better for the escape life doesn't entirely get better for her - not totally away from the abuse - it seems that the ice is her true home, she's utterly relentless thanks to a few action scenes that are fast-paced, well-timed and beautifully shot. But that's only the bare essentials; you have to credit the performances too. 
 
As Tonya, Robbie impresses, entirely capped in ugly wigs, completely stunning through visceral action scenes, complete with the attitude to be fair if you were to essentially rank her performance on a scale, it would very different from playing Leonardo DiCaprio's wife in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, however her performance here is almost the same as the pure insanity of Harley Quinn - from her attitude on the ice, through the arguments with her husband, to the back-chilling Harley Quinn stare which is enough to make your skin tingle from head to toe. So despite her popularity in Hollywood she's not exactly a poor choice here. 
 
Her performance is more than a match for her co-star Allison Janney, as a woman who's not only a keen supporter of her daughter (in her own way) she succeeds as the vicious woman, the result here is even scarily close to the real person, complete with the gold faux fur coat, the bird on her shoulder and the wire of an oxygen tank snaking through her room up to her nose after years of smoking. As a performer Janney has had that streak of cruelty in her roles, but she's also had a nice side to her - not entirely on show her but that's what makes her performance so good (definitely earning her first Golden Globe win). 
 
There's only one criticism with I, Tonya, sadly the action scenes aren't as visceral as they should've been, granted they're fast paced but they fail to a noticeable rubbery CG of Robbie's face plastered over the face of a stunt double. Also the film sometimes gets distracted from winding road of Tonya's making it difficult to get into the underbelly of her turbulant life. Yet still the film is consistently gripping, darkly funny, and utterly relentless, ultimately convincing the audience her tale of trial by media, but Gillespie's directing through the dark winding road into sort of Goodfellas type territory, the stunning performances may perhaps ask you to reconsider. Changing her from the villain to the heroine, but really, what's so wrong with that? <br/><br/>VERDICT Robbie and Janney give gold medal winning performances through darkly hilarious storytelling, if you only watch one biopic this year - make it this one."

","I heard so much hype about this movie that I was a little disappointed by the end result. There's no question that Margot Robbie is a stunning success as Tonya Harding. Margot captures all sides of Tonya, making her brave, tragic, funny, seductive, innocent, deeply flawed and yet amazingly strong all at the same time. Sebastian Stan is almost as brilliant as Tonya's husband Jeff, a dim bulb who genuinely loves his wife but has to idea how to prove his loyalty except through stupid schemes and shiftless behavior. Even Paul Hauser is remarkably effective as Sean Eckhardt, the fat and brutal yet strangely childlike simpleton who unwittingly destroys both Jeff and Tonya. <br/><br/>Allison Janney as Tonya's mom, Lavona . . . well, here's where I deviate from the conventional wisdom. To me, Allison's performance rang hollow all the way through. There was no nuance, no texture. Just meanness and cruelty without any room for any kind of insight or humanity. It wasn't like watching Gloria Swanson play Norma Desmond in SUNSET BOULEVARD. Gloria Swanson never let you forget that this woman really was a star once, and that her love for the fans (""those wonderful people out there in the dark"") the movies and for acting was sincere. None of that cancelled out Norma Desmond's murderous hate and her manipulation . . . but it made her human, and therefore believable. That never happened with this character. <br/><br/>But it's not really Allison Janney's fault. The problem with this movie is that though the acting is brilliant, the writing and direction are geared more towards lazy cheap shots than real insight. How many times can you tell us that rednecks are stupid and mean? Do we really need to see a Ronald Reagan poster in the fat boy's living room? Ask yourself another question. If this movie were about an Asian mother trying to make her daughter into a doctor, would anyone describe the character as a monster?<br/><br/>Another disappointment was the crude soundtrack, overstuffed with classic Seventies rock. I love that music. I grew up with it. But the film makers don't use it effectively. You get the impression that to them the music itself is a joke. Now and then they hit the right note, match the song to the mood in just the right way. (""Shooting Star"" by Bad Company tells Tonya's story better than the movie.) But much of the time it just feels gimmicky, and fake. (""Those rednecks and their dumb music . . . why can't they listen to the Beatles and Bob Dylan like civilized people?"")<br/><br/>A lot of the class hatred in this movie feels forced and calculated, meant to please today's elites. The idea is something like, Tonya's type are trash, they're the ones who voted for Trump. Let's laugh at how stupid they are! But that sort of reasoning rarely makes things better. ""They"" voted for Trump. ""They"" killed Christ. ""They"" stabbed us in the back at Versailles. That's the spirit that drives this movie, and even though the actors are sensational, they can't quite overcome the meanness of the script."

"maurice_yacowar","9","1","1","20 February 2018"," Tonya Harding story retold by its participants
","Though this film is set 25 years ago it's an incisive analysis of Trump's America. Or as Prince might have called it, the States formerly known as United. Tonya is the rough-hewn have-not who can't get a break in the righteous liberal style-conscious America now under fire.
 She flashes an All-American smile under her tears, make-up and shiner-patch. She becomes a world titlist at the difficult art of figure skating, but she can't satisfy her mother, her brutal husband or the fickle public. 
 Neither the breathtaking grace of her art nor the hard-won height of her success can fill the void with which her birth and restrictive upbringing have cursed her. The skating judges remain biased against her, for that class-loaded criterion ""presentation."" As Tonya marvels at the sympathy Kerrigan gets, ""Look, Nancy gets hit one time and the whole world shits. For me it was an all-the-time occurrence.""
 As befits a film about a performer, the film is organized on the theme of performance. We're told the story in a variety of interviews and restagings. The telling becomes as important as the story, especially when the men's plot against Nancy Kerrigan kicks in. 
 The characters are all performers rather than persons. Tonya's mother is a monster who rejects any tenderness from or to her daughter - and indeed turns away from every peck from the pet bird on her shoulder. She wears it to recoil from it. In her coldness and language she's an ogre playing the part of a mother with no understanding of her lines or role. So, too, she sexualizes her daughter, to prepare for that sexualized art. Thus her description of Tonya's supposed failure: ""You skated like a graceless bull dyke. I was embarrassed for you. "" Small maternal sympathy, there.
 The mother's defense to her daughter is a classic perversion: ""I made you a champion, knowing you'd hate me for it. That's the sacrifice a mother makes! I wish I'd had a mother like me instead of nice. Nice gets you shit! I didn't like my mother either, so what? I fucking gave you a gift!"" Her home visit seems tender and supportive, until Tonya discovers her mother is trying to tape her admission/denial of complicity in the Kerrigan plot, presumably for her own profit. ""You can tell me.""
 Tonya's husband equally veers between protestations of helpless love and beating her up. His accomplice Shawn is a live-at-home loser who seems to believe his repeated lie that he's an accomplished international secret agent working against terrorism. This while he directs a terrorist act against America's best figure skater.
 The characters are all poor. Tonya's mother raises her on a waitress salary, her husband with minor odd jobs. Tonya's after-skate career is waitressing, women's boxing and worse. But they feel an entitlement beyond their means: ""I'm America's best figure skater! I don't want friggin' Eskimo Pies"" - but Dove Bars. Hr husband lures her back - briefly - with a fridgeful.
 The Kerrigan ""incident"" itself is described as the biggest stupidity in a world of stupids. Everyone here is as incompetent, unimaginative, fumbling and self-deceiving as ... well, Trump's White House. There are no ideas or logic, just reflexes. As Tonya's mother advises, ""You fuck dumb. You don't marry dumb."" In this distortion of democracy there is no respect for knowledge or intelligence. If this story were not so tragic to its modest players and if this were not such an accurate reflection of Trump's dumbed-down and disintegrating America, this comedy of sad errors would be hilarious. 
 More to that point, as Tonya says, ""There's no such thing as truth. It's bullshit. Everyone has their own truth, and life just does whatever the fuck it wants."" Her husband says of a scene we're watching actually happen, ""This is bullshit. I never did this!"" Time and again Tonya contradicts herself within a sentence and it doesn't matter. Like she's the president.
 Despite her coarseness and self-unawareness Tonya becomes a very touching figure. Her ice-rink mother determined her life from the age of three and hammered her into it. The public was hungry for someone to admire, then hungrier for someone to vilify: ""America. They want someone to love, they want someone to hate."" 
 That role proved as reductive of Tonya as her mother's stardom dream was: ""I was loved for a minute, then I was hated. Then I was just a punch line."" This film stops the punch line and returns the bad-joke woman to humanity. And it's an abused, class-conscious humanity. Hence Tonya's accusation to the film audience: ""It was like being abused all over again. Only this time it was by you. All of you. You're all my attackers too."""

It should not matter in sports what side of the tracks you come from, but the movie made abundantly clear that in figure skating, it does. The film was a beautiful indictment of spousal and institutional abuse and so aptly timed to the current Olympics and national spousal abuse scandals of our day. Tonya Harding was an abused kid who rose to the top of her sport only to be abused again by the people and institutions she loved. A 1990's morality play with painful truths for 2018 ."

","Till this past year I had a problem with most ""biography"" that I watched, the only one that I really loved was The Imitation Game, although, this past year made me change my mind. ""I, Tonya"" is another great biography movie that came out this year.<br/><br/>The acting is gorgeous, Margot Robbie and Allison Janney are the highlights of it, they kill in their roles, but I also like a lot of Paul Walter Hauser's performance. Sebastian Stan is good too.<br/><br/>In fact, this part (the acting) was what I came to the movie expecting, just amazing acting and a ""ok"" movie, but my God, the movie is thrilling and entertaining for the entire run time. The soundtrack is fantastic, every song fits almost perfectly in each scene. The editing is awesome, they mix some ""interview"" scene through the main history, with narration, and fourth wall breaks, and it works! Otherwise, the movie would be just an assembly of events in Tonya's life leading to this one moment, but the montage change this scenario completely. <br/><br/>You understand Tonya's point of view, you get why she is like that, you might not like her overall, but you definitely gets the reason why she act like that. <br/><br/>And this is probably my favorite thing about the movie, how they were able to pick the history and make something fresh with it, not just the ordinary dramatic arch that we saw over and over again. The history is sad in many ways, but the approach here is not only sadness, is also with a comic way.<br/><br/>The movie has tension when it needs to have, it can make you cry when he needs to, and also could get some jokes in a lot of other moments. I love the direction here too, the actor's performance, the cinematography, the use of the slow-mo, the track, in a way, it almost always has the director's hand.<br/><br/>The only issue that I might have with the movie are some of the skating scenes, I don't know how the could improve that, but in some shoot you just can't avoid notice that is just Margot's head in some else's body.<br/><br/>In short, ""I, Tonya"" is a terrific film, that approach this really challenging genre in a fresh and clever way. I love it."

","I, Tonya boasts two first rate performances from Margot Robbie and Allison Janney in this honestly-told and hard-nosed based on a true story adaptation. The film transcends many based on a true story adaptations by not completely coasting off the source material. It adds unexpected depth by delving into what it takes to make a champion and how far parents are willing to go to push their kids to the maximum.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is clearly inspired by the hard hitting cruelty, black humor and self-awareness of Goodfellas. With the source material, this approach proved to be more effective than derivative. The character interviews explaining why things happened allowed the film to be more funny, honest, and meta. You see these peoples' side and understand why they acted the way they did, even if sometimes their decisions were completely idiotic and downright amoral. The only person you feel for is Tonya Harding due to her abusive relationships with her mother and boyfriend, and the fact that her skating career was ruined thanks to a couple of bumbling idiots. Every other character is entertaining but is either ugly, abusive, or downright trashy. Give the movie props for not trying to lionize them and depicting them for how they really are.<br/><br/>Something thought-provoking the film brought up had to do with the complex relationship between Tonya and her overbearing mother. When Tonya becomes an Olympian, her mother tries to take credit for it saying that she made Tonya a champion, through all the cruelty and abuse. Does beating and making high demands of your children really make them champions, driven to overcome any obstacle or opponent? Hmm maybe my parents should've beaten my ass so I'd learn to write better reviews and become the new Ebert. Damnit mom and dad! Haha just kidding.<br/><br/>I, Tonya scores with its funny, well acted, and unbelievable true story that doesn't quite stick the landing discourtesy of its awful CGI skating scenes and unsympathetic, albeit entertaining, characters."

Each time his on screen, the laughs will follow and seeing real life footage of Eckhardt during the post-film credits sequence gives a you a real appreciation for just how good Walter Hauser is in his role.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>I, Tonya is a real riot of a film, featuring an abundance of great performances and cast chemistry. Gillespie has crafted a truly original biopic that mixes in laughs, shocks and drama and while it at times loses some of its steam in the 2nd half of proceedings, when I, Tonya hits its groove, it's a rollicking good time.<br/><br/>4 taped over Star Trek episodes out of 5"

"Troy_Campbell","8","1","1","2 February 2018"," An entertaining (and unreliable) history lesson.
","U.S. Olympic figure skater and self-proclaimed redneck, Tonya Harding is anything but an ordinary figure in sporting history, so it makes sense that this biopic-based on ""wildly contradictory"" interviews, as we're told by the opening title card-is a rambunctious whirlwind of craziness. Framed by re-enacted interviews that quickly establish the inconsistencies between stories and the overall untrustworthiness of everybody involved, the film wears its artistic licence proudly on its sleeve. Some scenes are replayed from varying perspectives, whilst others brazenly break the fourth wall to emphasise the lack of dependability of the source; director Craig Gillespie never letting the (contested) truth get in the way of a good yarn. There's no shortage of filmmaking bells and whistles on display either, Gillespie ambitiously employs crash zooms, unbroken tracking shots and split screens, among other things, to give off that energetic Tarantino-esque vibe. Such brazen storytelling is hard to pull off-especially when trying to sustain it over two hours-so at times it feels like Gillespie is either in over his head or becoming a little too enamoured with his own flashiness, but never enough to derail proceedings. He's also blessed to anchor his movie with a knockout performance from Margot Robbie. De-sexy-fied with prosthetics and 80s hairstyle wigs, Robbie is spellbinding as the crude, tenacious and super-talented Harding, able to simultaneously elicit sympathy and scorn in a single scene. Playing out like a twisted comedy adventure, with a tinge of tragedy and pinch of crime thrown in for good measure, I, Tonya is one hell of a history lesson."

","The story of Tonya Harding is painted as a tragicomedy, maybe a comedic tragedy, as we watch a story self-admittedly ""full of boobs."" Tonya is abused by her mother and husband in nearly every way possible for her entire life, stopping short of plain torture.<br/><br/>There's some digging into what is truth, what is exploitation, and how the spectacle can feed on globalized media sensations of disfigured skaters. There's little more than a little digging into these deeper topics, because the centerpiece is Tonya, the unlikely white-trash star who proved them all wrong, all of them, a desire built upon hate of everything and everyone, surely due to nurture not nature.<br/><br/>The hanging, nagging question is whether Tonya would have had any success as a figure skater if she had grown up in a supporting, loving household. Could it have then been nature not nurture? The unlikely series of boobs and their actions led to an international feeding frenzy, to be usurped by O.J. Simpson's white Bronco ride.<br/><br/>The skating scenes fall with an intoxicating beauty, and Margot Robbie's own face paints the iconic binary masks of tragicomedy, defiant against all on-comers. It was never just about the skating, though, and the pace is unfortunately persistently jogged with breaking of the fourth wall, and light-hearted glibness which downplays and mutes the scenes of inexcusable abuse.<br/><br/>You, Tonya, you had the stuff of spectacle, the same stuff the spectacle devours for fun."

","GRADE: B <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A clever bio-pic that purposely mixes fact and fiction.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: The supposed story of ice skater, Tonya Harding.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: I, Tonya is not your typical biography film. Craig Gillespie solidly directs his movie about the infamous ice skater, Tonya Harding, with a bold conceit, purposely mixing fact and fiction and admitting this premise from the outset. He skates through the hard news facts and avoids conventional storytelling techniques in a refreshing way. The director tends to simplify the story as he adds one part high melodrama and two parts irony to his dark comedy. He does overload the film with 90's pop standards that overstate his message, but he assembles a winning cast of players who act their roles with expert glee and a strong satiric edge. <br/><br/>I, Tonya stays on target with its low-trash trashing of America, and having Tonya portrayed as the eternally abused heroine. Perhaps, not the most accurate depiction of this celebrity. The clever screenplay by Steven Rogers uses mock interviews with the actors in character and the supposed ""true"" events that led up to the attack on fellow skater, Nancy Kerrigan. The script reinforces this notion with a ""she said-he said"" formula which works. <br/><br/>The film sets up the story of Ms. Harding's early skating career, her heartless mother, her violent relationship with her husband, her Olympic dreams, and the ""incident"" leading to her downfall. It tells its tale effectively but spends too much time blaming those around Tonya as her victimizers and making her more saintly sympathetic than need be. Where the film mostly succeeds is in its sardonic black humor and outlandish characterizations.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie, a bit too beautiful for the part, is quite sensational as Tonya. The actress interprets her role very well as abused victim and hard-as-nails survivor. She rarely is shown to be apologetic or kind, usually appears to be temperamental and impetuous, yet Ms. Robbie makes Tonya empathetic and vulnerable. She is excellent throughout the film, her highpoint being her dressing room scene prior to Tonya's disgraceful showing at the Olympics and the film's brutal closing moments. Those alone deserve award attention.<br/><br/>Ms. Robbie gets strong support from a fine ensemble that are physically aligned to the real life counterparts and bring a fierce determination to their characters. Sebastian Stan is Jeff Gillooly, her abusive spouse, and he makes this despicable person a dangerous force and troubled soul. His scenes of sudden violence and unpredictable behavior are powerful. Paul Walter Hauser plays Shawn Eckhardt, his half-witted accomplice with delusions of grandeur, and the actor is quite wonderful...funny and yet pitifully tragic. Some of the other roles could use more clarification and depth, but they are graced with talented performers like Julianne Nicholson and Bobby Cannavale who add much to their sketchy parts.<br/><br/>But the real scene-stealer is Allison Janney as her cold-hearted mother, . She creates a bitter hateful woman, unloved and unloving, and Ms. Janney, almost unrecognizable, never allows her cruel character to be not the least bit sympathetic or caring with the moviegoing audience. What could easily have been an overdone evil caricature becomes an wildly eccentric character that is, understandably, the main cause-and-effect of Tonya's dysfunction. Her scenes with Ms. Robbie have a bittersweet sadness and a quick comic give-and-take shock value that empowers the film.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is a well-made and searing indictment of the rise and fall of one woman and her quest for fame, fortune, and the American Dream. Be careful what you wish for."

Then we have Allison Janney starring as LaVona Golden the mother of Tonya, I personnaly think that there is no way someone will be able to win that Oscar other than Janney herself, she was amazing one of the greatest supporting performances of the past 10 years, there is no way she won't win that Oscar!

Together, they tell the story of Tonya's life before, during and after ""the incident.""<br/><br/>""The incident"" being referred to is the kneecapping of Harding rival, and apparent good friend, Nancy Kerrigan, during a practice session at the Cobo Arena in Detroit. Think of this like the Goodfellas (1990) if the Goodfellas were a bunch of white trash, moronic ""boobs"" (not my word) trying to pull off a hit.<br/><br/>Two things you'll LIKE about ""I, TONYA"": 1) It's funny! The story we saw on TV in the 1990's wasn't that humorous, but how it's told here is quite fun. 2) The acting (props to Allison Janney, who plays mom) the production design, the editing, the directing. Everything seamlessly works together to keep your interest from the very beginning.<br/><br/>Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) A lot of the story is left out, apparently. I did some research after the film to see exactly how accurate this is. I knew a little about the incident, but nothing of the aftermath.

","I, Tonya is a biographical film about controversial figure skater Tonya Harding. Starring Margot Robbie in the lead role, it is a no holds barred, tongue-in-cheek look into the life of the titular skater and the infamous legacy she has left behind.<br/><br/>Since the age of 4, Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) had been forced into the sport of figure skating by her abusive and domineering mother, LaVona (Allison Janney). As she grows older, Tonya becomes one of America's greatest figure skaters and attracts a whole legion of fans along the way due to her bold and brash personality. While training one day, Tonya meets Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), and the two start dating and eventually marry, against LaVona's wishes. However, their marriage is rife with physical and verbal abuse against each other, and over time this takes its toll on Tonya's abilities as a skater.<br/><br/>The film portrays its subject in a surprisingly sympathetic light. We, the audience, are shown that a great deal of Tonya Harding's actions and personality traits are not entirely her fault, but that of the people she was unfortunate to have been surrounded by. Margot Robbie gives a career-redefining performance as the title character, hopefully putting an end to any doubt that she cannot play serious roles like this due to being considered too ""beautiful"" or ""glamorous"". However, Allison Janney stands out as Tonya's tyrannical mother, who is clearing exploiting her daughter's fame and fortune for her own personal gain, much like many of today's ""pageant moms"" .<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"

","I'm not fond of sports-related movies based on true events. I'm not into sports of any kind, so I'm usually bored if I have to sit through one of these films. But, I do like fictional ones like Major League, Stick It, Whip It... if it's stupid funny, I can enjoy it. But wow. Just, wow! I, Tonya was NOT what I thought it would be! Such a shockingly funny dark comedy that had me laughing from beginning to end! I'm not going to praise anything in particular. The acting was great from everyone. The film's direction, editing, music and overall tone was just so well done. The characters, even the evil ones, are so enjoyable. This movie was just one big package of devious fun! There's a lot of great movies that you can watch a few times, then you'll break it out only if someone you know hasn't seen it yet. But this movie? This is one I will happily watch over and over whenever I need a pick me up. It's an instant classic. Easily the most badass dark comedy I have EVER seen!<br/><br/>Just go see this! It's great on the big screen, but it will still make you laugh and feel good even if you end up watching it on your TV when it's available. No matter what, put this on your list of must-see movies!"
"zkonedog","8","1","1","24 January 2018"," Weird Presentation, But Fascinating Subject Matter
","Because of the attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan leading up to the 1994 Winter Olympics, Tonya Harding is largely a household name even to the most casual of sporting fans. What was her role in the attack? Did she help plan it? These are questions that may never definitively have answers. What ""I, Tonya"" looks at, however, is the notion that Harding has perhaps been judged as much for her upbringing and ""redneck"" personality as anything else.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film is a bio (of sorts) of Harding (Margot Robbie). It really focuses on the relationship with her mother LaVona (Allison Janney) and on-again-off-again husband/boyfriend Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). Growing up without much formal education and pushed to focus on skating at a very young age, Tonya did not possess the princess-like grace of her competitors, much to her dismay as the scores would inevitably disappoint. Despite being perhaps the best technical skater of all time (landing the first triple axel in Olympic history), Tonya could not seem to truly grasp the status she thought she deserved. The film then delves into the infamous Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) attack, and posits some theories on how exactly it all came together.<br/><br/>What one must remember about ""I, Tonya"" from the very beginning is that it is pieced together from interviews conducted with Harding herself and Gilooly. Harding tends to deflect blame to anyone else (mother, background, etc.), while Gilooly really puts much of the attack incident at the feet of his mysterious oddball friend Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser). This is pretty standard behavior (trying to as much blame others as take any sort of personal responsibility) for these types of situations.<br/><br/>What this approach does net, however, is some interesting things to think about regarding Tonya that are indeed interesting to ponder. Her mother is a true piece of work, she indeed was very naive due to a lack of education, and it is demonstrated time and time again how both the professional skating administration and the media used her to shape and cultivate their own narratives. While the film doesn't (and rightly so) make the leap of excusing the attack on Kerrigan because of this, it does make one perhaps at least look at Harding in a different light. Perhaps she was not the ""monster"" she was made out to be at the time.<br/><br/>Robbie's performance as Tonya is incredible, and almost single-handedly makes the weird presentation of the film work. Personally, I prefer a more direct approach when dealing with a documentary subject, but ""I, Tonya"" constantly breaks the fourth wall (talking directly to viewers) and often has a character narrating certain scenes from an outsider perspective even while the scene is transpiring in real time. It can be a bit jarring, to be sure, but as I said Robbie really mitigates that with her incredible Oscar-nominated performance.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""I, Tonya"" much more than I probably ever thought I would do to how thought-provoking I found it. Will I ever completely sympathize with Ms. Harding? No. But what this film gave me was a look inside her life and how her tumultuous background may have colored both the events and relationships that eventually brought the skating portion of her life to an end."
"MarkoutTV","7","1","1","20 January 2018"," Solid Black Comedy With an Intriguing Backdrop
","Firstly, the only actual complaint I see about this movie is from people that claim it's inaccurate. If that is your complaint, way to miss the point, dumb dumb.<br/><br/>This movie is a black comedy, the comedy of which centers primarily on the fact that the filmmakers employed the services of completely unreliable narrators. Basing their script off actual interviews with the key players involved, including Tonya, her ex-husband and her mother, the filmmakers make no claim that the events unfolding in the film represent the 100% true story. Instead, it's the story told by people with a very clear stake in how they're represented, and the attitudes of these people in addition to their different interpretations of the same events is exactly what makes it funny and interesting.<br/><br/>And interesting it is, even for someone like me who has been very invested in the story for as long as I've known about it. I mean just think about the absurdity of it: a woman consistently portrayed as white trash seemingly calling in a mafia-style attack on her rival figure skater. Her rival... figure skater. How has it taken this long for a comedy to be made based on this?! It writes itself.<br/><br/>And to make it even better, the story is far from that simple. There are many debates even to this day about whether or not Tonya Harding knew what was going down or if she had any involvement whatsoever. You will certainly see many interpretations of that night's events in that film. But as mentioned, these are interpretations from wildly unreliable sources and while that supplies the comedy and intrigue in spades, it certainly doesn't provide concrete answers. That's what makes it kind of brilliant. This is a black comedy film based on the Harding/Kerrigan Saga. Not a 30 for 30 special.<br/><br/>And let's make no mistake. This film puts the black in black comedy. This deals with heavy subjects, especially to do with abuse, both mental and physical, from parents, children and spouses alike. And while it will often give these moments the emotional gravitas that it deserves, the film will just as often treat them strangely light-heartedly. The expectation of a dark subject being treated respectfully, only for the rug to be pulled out from it in seemingly careless fashion, is the crux of a lot of the humor here. By black comedy standards, it's all rather tame. But people who don't have a dark sense of humor and are unused to that style may find themselves offended. To this I would normally say nut up and learn how to take a joke, but instead I'm gonna be nice and just leave a fair warning.<br/><br/>Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, I should definitely talk about some stand-out performances. First of course, is Margot Robbie, who is rapidly making a case for being called a superstar. Between standing out from the mediocrity in Suicide Squad to deliver a pretty definitive version of Harley Quinn, to now playing a tough-as-nails redneck figure skater in Tonya Harding, the Australian bombshell has displayed a range befitting much more seasoned veterans. She does a great job here being everything from funny and relatable to broken and miserable and it's truly something watching her go to work.<br/><br/>Who I especially want to sing the praises of, however is Allison Janney, who's portrayal of Tonya's damaged mother is a sight to behold. Janney is completely unrecognizable here, marvelously portraying a woman who truly thinks she is doing her best but is ultimately poisoning her daughter with perpetual verbal and physical abuse. Listening to real interviews with Tonya Harding makes it very clear how much contempt she has for her mother, and looking at Janney's performance you can very easily see why. She was absolutely wonderful here, and pretty hilarious in her own right when it was called for.<br/><br/>At the end of the day what we have here is an endlessly intriguing and hilarious depiction of one of the most brutal -and funniest- sagas in the history of athletic competition. I highly recommend it."
"ReadingFilm","10","3","6","30 March 2019"," Far too many comic beats revolving around violence against women
","It's something I never thought I'd see in a film, like the movie is testing the outlier of societal responsibility. They actually punch her out and it's positioned as a comic moment. WTF? Yet the film plays as black humor, and seems to be completely amoral at worse, smug and condescending at best. Of course, these are all hillbillies and low class trash, the film gathers to make fun of them forgetting their own unconscionable taste. The entire film is way overdone and adds this unnecessary mid00s quirky indie aesthetic gone wrong, crossed with the sprawling montage epic that Scorsese popularized, populated with poptunes, and the story doesn't warrant it at all. It comes off as people given the Tonya Harding assignment who don't care about ice-skating but 'want to make it work.' I never thought I'd rather have a more conventional and serious approach as I admire postmodern, experimental, and offbeat works so long as the perspective is responsible and purposeful. I would call this mumbo jumbo filmmaking."
"lasttimeisaw","7","3","6","6 May 2018"," I, TONYA holds sway as a rebuttal to the truth-debunking trend and flags up the inherent impediment in front of everyone's upstream battle
","There is something unconscionably rebarbative in the factual story of Tonya Hardling (1970-) (Robbie), an erstwhile top-notch American figure skater who falls from grace in the wake of a physical assault inflicted to her fellow teammate/rival Nancy Kerrigan (Carver), with which she may or may not be involved, that is, it represents the most air-headed idiocy and indignity executed by those we might refer to as ""peckerwoods"", for wanting of wits, conscience, compassion, even wiles, they are piteous for sure, but there is also a pithy Chinese adage, which can be roughly interpreted as: a poor person must have a detestable trait. <br/><br/>Director Craig Gillespie briskly soups up this biopic with revelatory modi operandi of four-square faux-interviews and breaking-the-fourth wall gimmick to feed us prompt commentaries and wry afterthoughts apropos of its state of affairs from the subjects, an inviting tactic to piece together the less fluid chronological narratology. And the money-shots are certainly hinged on the re-enactments of Tonya's historical Olympic performances, and with a helping hand of cutting-edge CGI magic, despite on some occasions we can fairly discern the effect that Robbie's face is edited onto the gliding skater in the post-production, by and large, the filmmakers have done a cracking job to construct them with a scintillating cinematic sheen. <br/><br/> Apart from a physically backbreaking stunt for Robbie to pull off Tonya's aptitude on the ice rink, she weaves through the whole shebang with amazing verve and compelling agency, aided by a beneficial factor of the film's slant on Tonya: blameless in the scandal, and is not someone who is willfully refuses to play along with the tacit rule of figure skating, but simply she is just a different kettle of fish from those elected ice princesses to represent a nation's international image, a tragic figure falls victim of the dark and sanctimonious side of a typical American dream. <br/><br/> Consequentially, Robbie is proudly initiated as an Oscar nominated actress, which bullishly paves the way for her leading lady status among the Hollywood current echelon. But it is Allison Janney's Oscar-certified showstopper as a monstrously abusive mother that takes this reviewer aback (not in an entirely salutary sense though), as rewarding as to see a veteran of Janney's caliber finally pays her due to grasp the holy grail, her showy and bitter incarnation of LaVona Golden, Tonya's mother, ruefully overreaches the boundary between caricature and baring-it-out authenticity.<br/><br/>Still and all, another monster in Tonya's life, Jeff Gillooly, her abusive first husband played by a smoldering Sebastian Stan, is left disproportionally unsung compared to the hailing laurels received by the two aforementioned ladies, in fact, Stan is far from a sub-par contributor to the film's hair-trigger dynamism, and rightfully, he transmits Jeff's pernicious influence with poise and a semblance of inner conflict that is so critical in a role's wholesome characterization, which is found wanting in both case of LaVona and Shawn Eckhardt (Hauser), the presumed barmy culprit whose presence only reminds us the nadir of human lunacy. <br/><br/>By turns ebullient, over-the-top, rousing (partially thanks to Fleetwood Mac's infectious THE CHAIN), sardonic and archly cynical, I, TONYA holds sway as a rebuttal to the truth-debunking trend and flags up the inherent impediment in front of everyone's upstream battle: we cannot choose our parents, but can we choose our own path then? Not really, as Tonya's story tells us, when something so hardwired such as one's upbringing, stands in your way, just suck it up and keep your heads above the water."

","The infamous story about the Tonya Harding story encouraged by the sect of adoring Oprah fans backing the ""MeToo""/""TimesUp"" initiatives that are more propaganda than action. <br/><br/>The film provides the back story of abuse and suffering that the famous olympic skater apparently had to endure, with strong shaming to those who tried to give her honest feedback about the industry (and the expectations) as well as those who took part in the public hatred she faced following the incident with fellow-skater Nancy Kerrigan. <br/><br/>The film comes too late in the sense that mainstream movie goers don't necessarily recall (or care) about this story any more. In the eyes of the media, justice was served and the injured skater was able to recover to some degree. It dishes the guilt out to everyone, globally, with the implication that Tonya is the product of her environment, pushed down by too many. While this may be true, and while I personal feel sympathy for her childhood back story (no spoilers), as an adult her choices were hers to make (no spoilers).<br/><br/>It's interesting to see who the movie industry now chooses to celebrate."

","I just have a few criticisms regarding this film.
I never enjoyed it to be honest. I felt it tried far too hard to put across Tonya as a victim. It also insisted on creating ""key moments"" and scenes using the first minutes of theme tunes which have been over used by all the other average films out there.
As for the real victim, Nancy Kerrigan, she was hardly featured at all and when you consider the event you have to question the mentality of the film makers in ""enabling"" the sense of ""victimhood"" and naivety in the people found guilty.<br/><br/>They make a Coen Brothers film but not actually a good one.<br/><br/>There was far too much over acting and the usual scenes of violence and stupidity that we have grown to recognize in poor quality films from the US."
"TheBigSick","Null","4","10","27 December 2017"," Margot Robbie deserves an Oscar
","Normally, actresses got an Oscar for emotional performances, and without any doubt, Margot does brilliant emotional acting in the movie ""I, Tonya"". But at the same time, you also have to consider the difficulty of the physical performances. For a non-professional skater, it is extremely hard and nearly impossible to learn the acrobatic jumps, spins, moves and other elements in skating. I think Margot does equally well in physical performances, and really deserves an Oscar."

"Lewis_Heather787","8","3","7","26 December 2017"," Brilliantly written and directed, stupidly funny from start to finish!
","The trailer for this film did its job and wow did this film not disappoint on what was pitched in those trailers. I personally did not know the whole story in-depth of Tonya Harding primarily because I was only born a year after the incident happened so cut me some slack. However after watching this I am intrigued with her story, even if its from many unreliable view points.<br/><br/>Firstly the directing in this film is fantastic from start to finish, Craig Gillespie has done a brilliant job with this film there is not a fault with it. He has managed to capture the high intensity of the skating scenes which a brilliantly shot to the much more slow paced character moments. Neither type of scene seems out of place, rushed or to slow. He as a director is definitely on my radar!<br/><br/>Next the screenplay of the film written by Steven Rogers is simply fantastic, it is some of the best dialogue of the year. It is hilariously funny at times and then in the flick of switch can be serious and grounded in reality, even though that reality is not normal circumstances. The dialogue for Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan is great but far and away the dialogue that is written and given to Allison Janney is breath taking, definitely deserves an awards nomination.<br/><br/>The Cast is brilliant all around however I'm going to focus on the three main players of the film. Firstly Margot Robbie, who is time and again proving that she is a fantastic young actress and will go on to do great things in the future. Her performance is fantastic, its so good that you very quickly get over the fact that its her and you accept that its actually Tonya there. She embodies the character extremely well and leaves and ever last impression, you feel almost sympathy to her as if she is actually the victim? It is her best work to date. Next Allison Janney, now this actress does not get enough big roles for me, she is extremely underrated and deserves much more praise then she get. This is her best performance that I've seen, even though she is playing and extremely horrible person. Coupled together with the dialogue and the ridiculous outfits, that are perfect, she is a shining light in the film and 100% deserves some type of award absolutely brilliant. Lastly is Sebastian Stan who is again brilliant and even though he portrays a man that does a terrible thing, you again feel a strange sympathy towards him because he didn't mean it to happen, well he says he didn't but we should take that with a pinch of salt. Stan is fantastic!<br/><br/>Overall I wasn't expecting much from this film even though the trailers looked promising, I was blown away by this film it is extremely good and it has a great re-watachability to it. 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10 this film is very good, extremely funny at times but does a serious side to it at times and so it should. One of the better films of the year and should definitely be on everyones radar during awards contention."

That line did not come from De Niro or Ray Liotta. It came out the mouth of Margot Robbie playing Tonya Harding in what I have down for the best movie of 2017.
Let me start by saying I actively dislike figure skating. And that's okay. Tonya Harding doesn't seem to give a sh#t about figure skating either, even though she's forced onto to the ice by her hell-beast of a mother almost just after birth.
This movie really isn't about figure skating at all. Its about the dark heart of America, with all its love and hate and violence, wrapped up in bow ties and glitter and put on for show in the Olympics every four years. Tonya was different. She was an athlete that didn't care about the BS, and what happened happened.
Margot Robbie most likely wont win the Best Actress Oscar this year. But she deserves it. And it really doesn't matter. With cinema the cream rises to the top. Finally, there exists in film a female antihero as self destructive as Travis Bickle. Watch this movie now."

","The pretty little ice princesses in skating competitions around Portland in the 1980s find themselves competing with a rough-hewn, cigarette-smoking, foul-mouthed dynamo--one, Tonya Harding--whose specialty is the enviable triple axel. There is one major obstacle for our young heroine: the pristine sweethearts of the ice are walloping her in scores because, as one judge says, strictly off the record, ""It isn't all about the skating."" Years later, after finishing a dismal 4th at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Harding is granted ""a second chance"" when it's announced the Olympics will be returning in just two more years instead of four. Cleaning up her act (somewhat), and leaning on her abusive-but-obsessed ex-husband for support, Harding hopes to topple her main competitor, Nancy Kerrigan--a sometime-partyer who otherwise knows how to play by the rules; fate, however, intervenes infamously once Tonya's former-spouse and his low-life buddy decide Tonya needs a little help. Salty, ballsy biography of Harding (Margot Robbie), her tough-as-nails mama (Oscar winner Allison Janney) and her dumber-than-dirt husband (Sebastian Stan) gets the white-trash milieu down right, while the ice-skating sequences are pumped with excitement. Still, director Craig Gillespie goes a little cute on the cheeky asides, opening with 'funny', contradictory interviews of the principals, then flashing back in time to Tonya as a (soft) four-year-old skating under the thumb of her scheming mother. Perhaps Gillespie finally figured out what we surmise by the halfway mark: there isn't enough material here to sustain a feature (perhaps ""I, Tonya"" would've had more impact as a cable movie?). The director, the screenwriter, Steven Rogers, and the talented cast just about pull it off; you certainly don't end up caring about these unsentimental characters, but that's part of the enjoyment. Nobody needs to poke fun at them or look down on them--these mean, ignorant rednecks are funny enough on their own without any additional maliciousness--and watching them chasing their own tails in search of fame and fortune is the stuff of rich black comedy. Three Oscar nominations in all, including Robbie as Best Actress."

","Considering all the critical gushing that surrounded this movie back in 2017, it is possible that I came in with too high expectations, but I found I, TONYA disappointing in almost every category. Reviews would have you believe this is a pitch-black satire of media circuses and class privilege, but it's just your standard Oscarbait biopic, paying lip service to its themes while never really exploring them in an interesting way.<br/><br/>Of all the actors, Allison Janey came off the best as the mother from hell. Maybe a bit one-note, but generally entertaining. I enjoy Margot Robbie as an actress and she does credible work here, though there are a few scenes where you can tell she's self-consciously swinging for that coveted Oscar gold rather than inhabiting a character. The other actors are pretty good, though they never really feel ""real"" to me-- considering the whole ""unreliable narrator"" schtick the movie insists it has going on, this might be the point (people exaggerating events and behavior in retelling a story), but even in the ""mockumentary"" sections, the acting felt off.<br/><br/>The movie fires on all cylinders when it's doing its best Coen Brothers imitation. The dark comedy generally works, especially in regards to the criminal antics of Shawn, Tonya's hapless bodyguard. However, the dramatic scenes work less so and feel like they're from another movie altogether. These scenes are more conventional, hitting the usual ""biopic"" beats we've seen hundreds of times in other movies. Even the unreliable narrator conceit falls apart: the movie is pretty firm in its ideas regarding what the ""truth"" of the situation is, even if the Harding character claims there is no such thing as the ultimate truth.<br/><br/>It's funny-- I saw this movie just last night and my opinion of it plummets the more I think about it. Another case where I like what the movie is trying to do more than its execution of those ideas."

In the end, the whole shooting method of the competition copied the black swan. As a producer, Robbie is still an actor with too much selfishness. She wants to take advantage of the popularity to reach the top, which makes the whole film vaguely permeated with the taste of ""my mother should take Oscar like a cousin stone""."

","I, Tonya recounts the events before, during, and after the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident of 1994. Rather, it recount several versions of these events as told by those involved. While the Kerrigan attack is a driving force of the plot, make no mistake, this film is about Tonya. Whether or not most of it actually took place, we bear witness to the devastating psychological and physical abuse Tonya was subjected to by her mother, LaVona Golden, and her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly. The story is told in a remarkably engaging way through a sharp screenplay, phenomenal editing, and a stellar cast. The film stars Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding, Sebastian Stan as Jeff Gillooly, and Allison Janney as LaVona Golden. Robbie and Stan as Harding and Gillooly are indeed noteworthy, but the standout performance is Allison Janney as Tonya's abusive and tyrannical mother, LaVona. The supporting actors and actresses are all compelling, but a highlight is Paul Walter Hauser as Shawn Eckhardt, Tonya's delusional body guards who fantasizes he is a hit man/secret agent/counterterrorism expert. I, Tonya is a must-see film that sheds new light on an old subject."
"movieknight-1","9","0","0","4 May 2020"," Terrific film!
","I, Tonya is a masterclass in film-making, directed by Australian Craig Gillespie who has obviously been heavily influenced by Martin Scorsese and superbly utilises long steadicam shots, freeze-frames, zoom close-ups, voiceover and frequent breaking of the fourth wall in a Henry Hill-type manner, not to mention perfectly selected music from the period to tell the fascinating true story of Tonya Harding who trained from the age of four in figure-skating in the '70s and rose to fame in the late '80s, early '90s but whose life and career came undone towards the mid '90s. You probably know the story already but I'm trying not to give anything away for those that don't because I hate spoilers. While the movie is laugh out loud funny at times, it is also extremely hard to watch at other times too as it deals with domestic abuse. It is certainly powerful viewing but comes highly recommended."

","I had no knowledge at all of Tonya Harding. No idea about the incident, her career, what happened to her etc, and boy is it a gripping story. I was hooked. What a tragic and bizarre story and series of events. If, like me, you have no knowledge of Tonya I'd encourage you to just dive right in without any prior research to keep you on your toes.<br/><br/>The way that the story was told was very clever. It presented the events, interspersed with fictionalised interviews and fourth wall breaks. What the film really does well is to cast ambiguity over everything. Tonya is the definition of an unreliable narrator, and throughout the film you will find yourself reaching for that bag of salt on many occasions. You're never 100% sure if what happened is over exaggerated in Tonya's head or whether its a complete fabrication, which makes for a compelling experience. I'd describe the story as rather Shakespearean, in that its ultimately a tragedy but with many elements of farce and black comedy.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie was phenomenal as Tonya and may well have won the Oscar had she not been up against an incredibly strong field. There was so much depth to her performance, expertly presenting the varying layers of Tonya's personality and character. Her and Sebastian had such great chemistry (or lack of it I suppose), and the way that the two of them were able to recreate their complex and toxic relationship was incredible. Allison Janney put in a transformative performance as Tonya's hardened mother, and was a scene stealer whenever she was on screen.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was crafted with great care and used to great effect throughout the film, which didn't go unnoticed. I just loved the atmosphere that it created.<br/><br/>This was just such a great film. Cast, story, direction, script, soundtrack all on point. One of the best biopics I've seen in recent times!"

","I, Tonya is trash made into art. A real surprise as far as I am concerned, I was immediately seduced by this movie, by its way to blend comedy and drama as well as navigating the thin line between documentary and editorial. It is also a blast to watch - there is hardly a dull moment.<br/><br/>As a sideway comment, some have said that Harding was a victime of violence - I tend to disagree; She probably was a product of petty, everyday violence, a part of it. Violence was her norm, the un-told yet practical norm of the society around her, and she wasn't a stranger in ditching some of it around too. Likewise, neither her mustachied husband or mother hated her - they just loved her in their own inept way, because both of them came from the same environment. Such an entourage prevented Harding from accomplishing the American Dream, and yet all the while they thought they were doing the best thing for her. They were, of course, wrong.<br/><br/>All of this drama is played with levity, by well-directed actors in a tale told in the most honest manner possible. The film doesn't want to pass as an infallible teller but rather as doing what it can according to the different versions they've got, which provides us with some fourth wall comments, but all of them fit wonderfully with the movie's format. Robbie offers here the best performence of her (quite successful) career, of course, but Allison Janey and Paul Walter Hauser, helped by their larger-than-life characters (the villains of the movie, some would say) shine through the screen in every scene they appear in, in spite of having both a light touch.<br/><br/>Truely interesting movie. Not so much for the splendid special effect or photography (which is correct here nonetheless, mind you), but rather for the way it tells this rather sordid chapter of American sport history."

","Finally watched the rise & fall of Tonya Harding which won an Oscar for Allison Janney for Best Supporting Actress for 2017 & nabbing a Best Actress nod for Margot Robie. Centering & culminating on the infamous Nancy Kerrigan kneecapping incident, Tonya Harding is presented as a working class woman pushed into ice skating by an overbearing mother where she succeeded but since she came from desperate straits she never garnered the same kind of attention her more polished competitors received. Even marrying a milquetoasty, abusive husband kept Tonya in a perpetual cycle of ridicule, shortcomings & unmet expectations. When a plan is hatched to torment Kerrigan via abusive mailings, her idiotic bodyguard hatches a scheme to hire a couple of brain dead thugs to intimidate her resulting in a kneecap shot heard & seen around the world. Not don't get me wrong, the film is a funny, sad & heartfelt exploration of dumb people doing dumb things but in skewering these knuckleheads, it feels a bit like shooting fish in a barrel making this cinematic attack feel a bit obvious & off putting but if you can stomach this & be a bit numb about the whole thing, you'll enjoy yourself."

","Visuals: The movie is very competently shot. The film grain on some of the interview sections was off putting, but other then that it was fine. Some shots were really good like when the hit man is walking into the training center and it's all one shot. The repetition of shots where she's sitting on the judging seat and loses in a competition did a good job of relaying the frustration she must have actually felt. In some of the 4th wall breaking scenes, the camera would zoom up to the face like a Bethesda game and its really jarring.<br/><br/>Audio: The mixing was pretty solid all around. The raised the volume of the scenes when Jeff is beating up Tonya, and it helped display the severity that it had on Tonyas well being. The music was a really solid blend of 70s/80s/and 90s which was used for Tonya, and classical music used for every other figure skater. The contrast of music helped in displaying Tonya's character and what her character is like compared to the rest of the skating world.<br/><br/>Plot: Having been based on a true story, and a large part of the film having been recreated from actual performances and T.V appearances, the story is one that is familiar, but at the same time brand new. The abundance of documentaries that have been made over this scandal have made the story common knowledge, even for those who weren't alive when it happened. So the focus of black comedy into the film really helped the story overall. Every time Tonya got physically abused by Jeff, it ended with her giving his ""boys down under"" a fair punch and managed to get a laugh out of me. The comedy made the darker parts of the movie way more tolerable, and had it not been there, the movie would have been a slog of terrible event after event. The 4th wall breaking parts like a mentioned earlier are jarring, but don't negatively affect the film. It happens around four or five times, and it's always there to confirm that the ridiculous facts to the story we're seeing are true, like Tonya training in the woods buy carrying sacks of potatoes or towards the end when she becomes a boxer. The interview scenes with the Sean character were really funny, and seeing the original interview after the shot-for-shot remake in the movie made it even funnier.<br/><br/>Characters: Margot Robbie us legitimately great in this movie. It totally redeems the garbage fest the was Suicide Squad, and is easily her best performance. She did a great job recreating the T.V appearances of Tonya, but still made the character her own. Allison Janney as LaVona was amazing and definitely deserving of the Oscar. After the credits rolled and they were showing the film of the actual people, I thought it was still the portrayal and not the real LaVona.

","""I, Tonya"" is the kind of movie I usually wouldn't bother seeing. The previews pitched it as a biography and mockumentary-style rehash of the 1994 off-ice conflict between Olympic figure skaters Tonya Harding (heel), and Nancy Kerrigan (babyface). Yawn. But it's actually way more than that, and almost becomes a primer in how to enjoy the drama of ""I, Donald,"" the very real-life train wreck coming to us live from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. ""I, Tonya"" does an amazing job of making the absurd seem reasonable, and blew the whole Harding/Kerrigan mess up in satirical splendor.

","Right before the 1994 Winter Olympics, news came out that figure skater Nancy Kerrigan had gotten hit in the leg by an acquaintance of rival Tonya Harding. The media circus made it look as though Harding was a monster and Kerrigan was a saint. But as Craig Gillespie's ""I, Tonya"" makes clear, there was a lot more to it than that. Basically, Harding grew up poor and could only make something of herself through skating. Because she wasn't ""cute"", the skating organizations wanted to put on the ice. On top of that, the media wanted something salacious, so of course they hopped on the story of the attack (which apparently wasn't Harding's idea in the first place).<br/><br/>While Margot Robbie does an impressive job as Tonya, the real praise has to go to Allison Janney as Tonya's abrasive mother. This is one woman who makes you feel as if you're walking on eggshells. It's easy to understand her point of view, though. Janney won an Oscar for the performance, although I would've given it to Laurie Metcalf for ""Lady Bird"".<br/><br/>All in all, it goes to show that a person's public image - especially when amplified by media coverage - ignores their background. Tonya Harding is not a thug, even if she hooked up with a bunch of lowlifes. I recommend it."

It's the life story of Tonya Harding - the infamous American figure skater who ended up being banned from skating and with a criminal record after the attack on her fellow skater and American teammate Nancy Kerrigan in the lead up to the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Written by Steven Rogers and directed by Craig Gillespie, this is a combination of biography and dark (very dark) comedy with some very sad dramatic content mixed in. I have to admit that as I waded my way through it, it brought up conflicting emotions within me. There are times when Tonya becomes very much an object of sympathy. Her upbringing is portrayed in nightmar-ish quality. I would rarely if ever use this term, but her family of origin (and especially her mother) are shown as the showcase of redneck white trash. Her mother is domineering, angry and shows no love for her daughter - except, mind you, that she does seem to spend most of the money she earns as a waitress on figure skating lessons for Tonya. But then, at the rink, she's the quintessential ugly sports parent - attacking her daughter, Tonya's coach, Tonya's competitors; foul mouthed, pushy. It was an incredible performance from Allison Janney, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Perhaps not surprisingly, Tonya then ends up marrying Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) - who's portrayed as an abusive guy who's none too bright. Tonya's life is a nightmare. She contributes to it, of course, rather than rising above it - and by not being either able or willing to rise above it she puts herself at odds with the US figure skating establishment, who don't like her because she's almost the complete opposite of the elegant and beautiful Nancy Kerrigan.<br/><br/>And there it is - ""the incident"" as the movie refers to it; the attack on Kerrigan as her knee is smashed not long before Lillehammer in an attempt (unsuccessful) to knock her out of the Olympics. ""The incident"" is what every viewer is interested in; it's the only reason you'd even really know who Tonya Harding is. The incident itself only takes up a few seconds of screen time - but there's a lot of focus on the planning and on the aftermath. It becomes like something you'd see in the Three Stooges. Tonya is jealous of Nancy. Jeff decides the make anonymous threats to Nancy to play with her head. But he can't do it himself, so he enlists the help of his buddy Shawn Eckardt (a great performance from Paul Walter Hauser) - who imagines himself as some sort of secret agent/counter terrorism expert, but who's really not much more than a loser who lives with his parents and his fantasies. In this portrayal of events it seems to be Eckardt who pushes things too far. As you watched all this unfolding on the screen, you wonder how seriously you can take any of it. Often the characters come across more as caricatures than anything - it is, in the words of Hard Copy reporter Martin Maddox (Bobby Cannavale) ""a story populated entirely by boobs."" True enough. Entirely. You do feel some sympathy for Tonya, as I said, but in the end none of these people are anywhere near likeable.<br/><br/>Tonya was played by Margot Robbie. It was a strong performance, and Robbie was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. She was, in fact, very good in the role - she played that redneck white trash completely believably. I have to give a lot of credit to director Craig Gillespie and whoever was responsible for choreographing the figure skating scenes. They were incredibly believable and authentic. I'm not sure that the format of the movie was entirely successful. It's told essentially as a series of snippets of interviews of the various characters, followed up by more traditional dramatic presentations of what was being talked about. I think that perhaps a straight movie format without the interviews might have worked better, although the portrayals of the interviews certainly gave us some feel for the various people depicted in the film.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that in the end I felt sorry for Tonya herself - nor do I think the movie was really going for sympathy. It does, however, give you an understanding of her background and upbringing and helps you gain some sense into how she ended up where she was, and you have a sort of grudging admiration just for the fact that she got as far as she did, and even for the fact that she was so resistant to conforming to the standards expected of a figure skater. But that admiration is linked with a sense of tragedy at the absolute waste of talent that her life ultimately represented, and at what she was ultimately reduced to as portrayed by the last little bit of the film.

","Not a big fan of Margot's acting here, it felt forced and unrealistic to me rather than authentic and raw. Maybe her acting is not the problem, it might be the casting choice as well. I saw her in so many different projects that I wasn't convinced enough that she was Tonya. A fresh new face could do better at impersonating Harding, I guess. Other than that, Sebastian Stan did a pretty amazing job for me. 'Til some point I didn't even realize the actor for the role of Jeff was him, I have to admit.

"nairtejas","7","0","0","11 August 2018"," Molecule Review: I, Tonya (7 Stars)
","I, Tonya is a film about nearly everything. It has a woman skater (Margot Robbie) being ruthlessly trained on her mother's (Allison Janney) insistence since she was 4; it has domestic abuse; and it has a stupid crime. Yet what has stayed with me after I completed watching the movie was an exchange of dialogues between Robbie's character, Tonya Harding, and another who judged her skating performance few minutes ago and gave a bad rating. She asks why was she being rated low, to which the judge replies that performance is not only about skating, you have to project yourself as a good American from a wholesome family. ""Why can't it be only about skating?"", Harding asks and the judge drives away without an answer. I love that scene, and a plenty more in director Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya because it chafes the reality and serves it with dark comedy. I don't know if I laughed out loud in any of the scenes, but everyone in the cast look like they travelled back 20 years to play life, and I did chuckle a lot. Most notable Janney, Robbie, and Sebastian Stan in that order. I, Tonya is less about the sport and more about what external stimuli can do to someone who plays it. A good watch because it's a very well-made and objective film and not your usual biopic. TN."

","First off let it be known that this is mostly from the perspective of Tonya Harding herself so it puts most of the blame for the Kerrigan incident on her ex-husband Sean Eckhardt. It also paints her mother as incredibly abusive. Whether true or not this is Tonya story and should be seen as that. It is however incredibly well acted by everyone involved and definitely deserving of the awards it got.<br/><br/>Part comedy and part tragedy portrays Tonya as an incredibly talented but underrated skater who was viewed as white trash by the people who should have embraced her. That being said it also is clear that she was often the source of her own angst. This doesn't portray Tonya the villain of the attack but more as someone who got swept away by fate and tragedy so if you view Tonya as a villain you won't like this but if you view more to the story then you might want to give this a chance it is worth it."

","The story of disgraced Olympic ice-skater Tonya Harding is told to us in a pseudo-style documentary fashion with the actors recalling the events that led to the knee-capping scandal of her main rival.
There is cartoon-ish style violence throughout with Tonya's head being smashed into mirrors and the like and her mother using her for knife-throwing practice.
The characters are one-step outside of reality, which fits the mad, crazy world of Tonya perfectly as she struggles to get by domestic violence, lack of money and a cast of idiots around her to achieve her Olympic goal."

Sebastian did a good job too and they got along together giving some awesome scenes. The music was good for me but was compatible in some scenes as it was in the beginning . Allison Janney was superb that I really felt she's Tonya's real mother she was absolutely amazing. The screenplay was good and reflected the characters pretty well but the movie was covered by that theme of the year's end movies that looks dull in most of it. The direction and the preview of the movie was very good but wasn't as good as it was in the beginning. the rhythm decreased in the end but the main problem of the movie was in some characters and one of the tellers of the story that didn't matter to exist in the movie though if he is in real life and the dropping of Tonya's behaviours and her reaction to the problem and some talking of her ex husband that wasn't as the truth and was completely conflicting.

","Es una película que llega a emocionar en cuanto a que ella llega a conseguir mucho viniendo de donde viene, incluso llegas a olvidarte de lo mala persona que pudo ser. Creo que es un poco larga, pero se ve muy bien. <br/><br/>La película la levantan los actores, incluso aunque hablen a cámara, lo cual es lo peor de toda la película junto a su peluquería. Están todos tan estupendos que te meten completamente en la historia. Eso si ella tendría que haber sido más joven, es imposible creerse que tiene la edad que dice tener.<br/><br/>El empleo de la cámara lenta, me parece estupendo. Hay que hacerlo en su justa medida y en los momentos exactos y eso lo hace muy bien, aun habiendo mucha, no sobra, está bien puesta.<br/><br/>Lo que menos me gusta es la parte falso documental. No me gusta ver a los actores contando lo que ya se cuenta en la película.<br/><br/>No me gusta ese deporte y sin embargo me gusta verla haciéndolo. Eso lo consigue, no sé si es que ella sabrá hacerlo o sino es que la doble es espectacular y se parece mucho a ella.<br/><br/>La iluminación está bastante bien sin llegar a ser estupenda. Se desmarca de ser una película de bajo presupuesto, pero no llega a ser muy buena.<br/><br/>La dirección ha conseguido que empaticemos con una persona, poco humilde, ególatra, mal educada, pero que debía ser muy buena. No aburre, al revés, te lleva y te atrapa. No usa la cámara como debería, ya que podría hacer unos planos espectaculares pero al menos esta bien llevada.<br/><br/>Te entretendrás viendo una película bastante decente<br/><br/>It is a film that gets excited in that she gets to get a lot coming from where it comes from, you even get to forget about the bad person she could be. I think it's a bit long, but it looks very good.<br/><br/>The film is raised by the actors, even if they talk to the camera, which is the worst part of the whole movie with their hairdressers. They are all so great that they put you completely in the story. That if she should have been younger, it is impossible to believe that she is as old as she says she is.<br/><br/>The use of slow motion, I think it's great. You have to do it in its right measure and in the exact moments and that does it very well, even if there is a lot, it does not spare, it is well set.<br/><br/>What I like the least is the fake documentary part. I do not like to see the actors telling what is already told in the film.<br/><br/>I do not like that sport and yet I like to see it doing it. That is achieved, I do not know if she will know how to do it or if the double is spectacular and looks a lot like her.<br/><br/>The lighting is quite good without becoming great. It stands out from being a low budget movie, but it does not become very good.<br/><br/>The management has managed to empathize with a person, not very humble, egotistical, badly educated, but that should be very good. Do not bore, on the contrary, it takes you and catches you. It does not use the camera as it should, since it could make some spectacular plans but at least it is well taken.<br/><br/>You will entertain yourself watching a pretty decent movie"

","'I, Tonya' may miss the mark of being a great film, but it's held up by phenomenal performances and overall style. Margot Robbie leads out this film portraying the immensely talented and infamous Tonya Harding and she certainly delivers; she pulls of the character brilliantly, making every emotion, every rage and skate seem believable - as if you're watching a real documentary. Allison Janey is also fantastic in her role as Harding's mother and it's great to see Janey take on a serious role for a change, because she does it quite well, with just the right amount of subtle humour. However, in relation to the film as a whole, I believe that the humour may have been a little out of place. Every movie should have witty lines and occasional comedic relief, but it seemed to get a bit muddled in this film and made light of some quite serious issues, such as domestic abuse. Given the fact that this is also a true story makes it a little more off-putting. But the real flaw in the film is the structure of the plot, and what stories got told. Now for those who don't know, the whole Tonya Harding controversy is entered around the attack of her rival Nancy Kerrigan - who is hardly seen in the film! I honestly believe that there should have been more scenes of Kerrigan as it would have made the film far more effective. Instead of just focusing on Harding, and her experiences at home and her personal skating journey, there should have been an empahasis on her relationship (or lack thereof) with Nancy Kerrigan. Apart from that, there's not many other fatal flaws of the film are detrimental to it's decline. The way the film is put together, with reenactments of real interviews of key people in the story (except Nancy!), works really well especially since it tells contradictory sides to the story. It leaves the big question on whether Harding knew about the attack or not subject to opinion. The film shows both her aggressive and unfair side, as well as showing that she was a victim herself too. This ultimately makes the film an engaging watch that is worth your time."

"MichaelMRamey","6","0","0","15 April 2018"," More Than Just A Figure Skating Film
","Sports is a huge passion of mine, despite not being an athletic abilities myself I've always been drawn to competition. The Tonya Harding story I knew from a documentary I watched regarding the famous 1994 incident involving Nancy Kerrigan. Figure skating wasn't ever something I enjoyed watching, but every sport has their stories and this is definitely the first thing people think about when they hear ""figure skating"". This story does recount the incident, but dives much deeper into Tonya's life - some of which may or may not be true.<br/><br/>The film starts off by showing Tonya's love for ice skating at only four-years-old. That is the simplicity of the film; a girl who loves the sport she competes in and overcomes obstacles to obtain her dream. However it takes a turn showing her abusive and toxic relationship with her Mother played by Allison Janney. Her need to be loved comes at a cost when she leaves her Mother only to be put back into another abusive and toxic relationship with her boyfriend - turned future husband - Jeff Gillooly.<br/><br/> I like how the film tows the line - taking an unbiased look into Tonya's life. Writer Steven Rogers is able to show that Tonya had a terrible upbringing and life, but also points out that she wasn't always the lovely person she let on to be. Repeatedly stating that nothing was her fault and taking no responsibility for her actions. Despite all that, this is the classic rags to riches tale that comes with a cost. She mistakes fame for the love she desperately desires. However no one really knows exactly what is true because the film is based on many interviews with everyone involved in a Scorsese-esq biopic - having the characters at times break the fourth wall and claim what did and didn't happen. You do get a good idea on how things went down though, because between everyone's separate recounts, there are some moments where their stories coincide with one another.<br/><br/> Janney plays the textbook, overbearing sports parent that we all know still exist. Pushing their kids to do better by treating them with what they think is ""tough love"". She shines in this film, stealing every scene she is in; making you despise her. If you remember back when I spoke about Margot Robbie, I said her good looks were getting in her way. Everything she was cast in was the pretty blonde, but you could tell she was just about to break out of that and show everyone the talented actress she can be and she does that in this film. This in my opinion is Robbie's coming out role; showing everyone she is more than a pretty face and can act toe to toe with the best of them.<br/><br/> There were a few things I didn't enjoy, which kind of stood out like a sore thumb; one being the atrocious CGI effects used when Robbie is skating. I understand that clearly isn't her doing those spins on the ice, but did they have to make it so obvious? With today's technology, you'd think it would be able to look more realistic and less green-screeny. The other thing I disliked was the ""character"" of Shawn; Tonya's bodyguard who conspired in the breaking of Nancy Kerrigan's knee. I put character in quotes because he is based on the real man and unfortunately he comes off too cartoony. Instead of being the dumb person he is meant to be portraying, he comes off like a henchman from a bad '80s superhero movie.<br/><br/> Overall, I enjoyed the film. If you're thinking you don't want to see a movie about figure skating, that is just what the story is presented on; it is much more than that and should be mentioned alongside some of the other great sports biopics. I, Tonya deserves a watch if you enjoy a unique take on a story as old as time."

","I didn't expect much from the film; I was not a Tonya fan or much of a fan of skating. But what this film reveals (to the accompaniment of the upbeat music of the period) is the class divide in the U.S. and the trauma of childhood emotional and physical abuse that devolves into spousal abuse. A victim of her mother, Tonya becomes a victim of her husband, and ultimately, a victim of the society in which she is always going to be the person who doesn't know how to behave, who walks around with seething aggression because aggression is all she has ever known. This is not the story of overcoming one's past to become a champion (as ""Rocky"" did), but the very real story of not being able to overcome the overwhelming burden of a past spent struggling against abuse from both her family members and a sport that demands a particular form of femininity from its athletes. The thrilling (and well filmed) skating scenes only serve to underscore the tragedy of Tonya's inability to escape her past and her identity; she is a sublime athlete with no chance of winning in this particular world. The film throws comedy into the mix in a way that makes watching bearable; the interruptions of the comic tone by the husband's sudden explosions of violence bring home to the viewer the terror of living under constant threat. We are told in the titles at the end that Tonya is now happily married with two children, but when she is interviewed, she calls out the interviewer and, by extension, the audience, for the injustice of her experience with the media circus. A thought-provoking, well acted and thoroughly entertaining film."
"makleen2","8","0","0","29 March 2018"," '90s Nostalgia-Fueled Docudrama
","Turns out talent and hard work might not be enough to succeed in this faux-docudrama based on the life of former competitive figure skater Tonya Harding, I, Tonya (2017). Written by Steven Rogers and directed by Craig Gillespie, I, Tonya stars Margot Robbie in the titular role. The film re-creates interviews with the principal characters involved in a controversial attack on fellow figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in 1994.<br/><br/>Gillespie is a veteran director with several films and television episodes under his belt, so it comes as no surprise I, Tonya is competently handled. Rogers is mainly known for writing romantic comedies, so this film is quite a departure from his usual repertoire. Like the directing, the writing is solid but the fact it's based on actual interviews and recordings probably made it easier.<br/><br/>Tonya Maxene Harding (Margot Robbie) grew up in poverty in Portland, Oregon. Her overbearing mother, LaVona (Allison Janney), pressured her into ice skating at a young age, eventually taking her out of school to pursue a career in the sport. In 1991, she became the first woman to successfully execute two triple axels in a single competition. She married Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) as a teen and their relationship quickly became abusive. Meanwhile, Gillooly's friend, Shawn Eckhardt (Paul Walter Hauser), appointed himself as her unofficial body guard.<br/><br/>Harding finished fourth in the 1992 Winter Olympics and went home to be a waitress, where Coach Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson) convinced her to begin training for the 1994 Winter Olympics. Gillooly, now her ex-husband, allegedly concocted a plan with Eckhardt to intimidate Harding's rival, Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver). Eckhardt hired two hapless thugs to smash Kerrigan's knee. The event became a media sensation, resulting in Harding being banned from competitive ice skating.<br/><br/>I, Tonya says surprisingly little about Nancy Kerrigan, though roughly half the film is devoted to the assault and its aftermath, and attempts to portray Tonya Harding as just as much a victim. It goes to great lengths to contrast Harding's hard-scrabble persona and background with Kerrigan's ""girl-next door"" image, suggesting the judges were biased against Harding because of her background. In real life, however, Nancy Kerrigan also grew up in poverty. Her father sometimes worked three jobs and drove a Zamboni at a local ice rink in exchange for her skating lessons.<br/><br/>Toxic relationships in this film mean motivations are always suspect. The characters use and abuse each other in pursuit of their self interest, despite insisting they're acting selflessly or out of love. To add to this moral ambiguity, Tonya Harding's character tells the audience there is no ""truth,"" only what's true for each individual. Only there was truth; Nancy Kerrigan really was assaulted with a baton. Shawn Eckhardt really was delusional and a pathological liar. There were consequences for these realities that Tonya Harding had to live with for the rest of her life.<br/><br/>So there's constant tension between events re-created in the film and those that occurred in real life, something that characters call attention to by breaking the forth wall. This is a clever way to address a common problem with movies based on real people and events. Filmmakers frequently alter events or simply invent things in order to make a compelling story. I, Tonya tells its audience: this is true, according to a particular perspective.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is a clever and creative take on an infamous incident from the 1990s. I doubt many people under the age of 25 have ever heard of Tonya Harding or Nancy Kerrigan, but for people alive at the time, this incident was almost as sensational as the OJ Simpson trial. Actress Margot Robbie, who also produced the film, continues to impress and will hopefully be involved in more creative projects like this."

It's playful, clever, at once sobering and maliciously fun, and, without question, one of the most original, evocative, and punchy takes on 'based on a true story' seen in ages. <br/><br/>Pundits of Hollywood biopics often sneer 'why not just watch the documentary?' - so, appropriately, director Craig Gillespie sneers right back with an apropos Tonya Harding belligerence, telling his film as a simulated talking heads 'faux-documentary.' It's an inspired way of sidestepping clichéd biopic trappings, as well as amusingly toying with their ostentatious pretentious of authenticity, complete with the ambiguity of multiple narrators who aren't as much unreliable as overtly contradictory - of each other, and even themselves. Riotously entertaining a Rashômon riff as it is, Gillespie spoon-feeds nothing to his audience, forcing us to draw our own assumptions and conclusions on Harding and her entourage, assessing each of their own complicity in the train wreck their story would become. It can be emotionally disconcerting having to sift through the uncorroborated scenes comprising the narrative - were Tonya's husband and mother really as horrifically abusive as depicted here, or are their depictions exaggerated by Tonya's traumatic memories, or hyperbolic embellishments? And how responsible WAS Tonya for the attack on Nancy Kerrigan? Gillespie remains playfully coy, with a jet-black sense of humour underpinning proceedings no matter how violent or terrible they get, forcing the viewer to themselves decide how emotionally resonant they find Harding's story without the guiding influence of Hollywood conventions. <br/><br/>In many ways, I, Tonya is as much a p*ss-take on Hollywood conventions as it is a fleshed-out telling of Harding's story. Like Tonya, it's noticeably rough and disheveled on the exterior, with hazy lighting and (presumably purposefully) endearingly clumsy editing capturing the faded lycra aesthetic of a daytime true crime special aired at the height of Harding's heyday - appropriately tongue-in-cheek for a film that so actively confronts class discrepancies and the superficial nature of public performance and award ceremonies (resulting Oscar wins notwithstanding, naturally). Conversely, as with the real Tonya Harding, the film finds its truest elegance and energy through skating, as Harding's performance sequences are invigoratingly entertaining, conjuring the breathless thrill of watching a triple axel (as CGI seamlessly simulates Robbie performing the seldom-repeated stunt). <br/><br/>Still, it's unquestionably the cast who land the film's proverbial jump, perfectly committing to a tone so emotionally sincere it verges on histrionic, in keeping with the bizarre escalation of Harding's story. Margot Robbie is at her best as the titular Tonya, employing her vivacious charisma and rough-and-tumble belligerence as a feeble shell for a woman desperately seeking validation in all the wrong places. Allison Janney has a ball crafting one of cinema history's most awful mothers, her endless tirade of sarcasm and abuse as darkly funny as it is chilling (and getting surprising mileage out of bantering with a bird, to boot). Still, Janney is too deft a performer not to play the character's notes of regret and perverse caring, and they register like the faintest flecks falling off a monolithically colourful and resonant performance. Sebastian Stan bravely undercuts his roguish, dopey charm with a streak of jarringly disturbing violence as Tonya's caustically unshakeable boyfriend/husband, while walking cartoon Paul Walter Hauser embodies Stan's doofus partner-in-crime with such hilarious conviction, watching him side-by-side the real Shawn over the film's credits is almost unnerving. <br/><br/>A breath of sardonic fresh air amidst 2017's Oscar contenders, I, Tonya is a deceptively clever slow-burner, with surprisingly resonant critical commentaries on emotionally handholding Hollywood storytelling, domestic violence, celebrity culture, and how the judicial system is swayed by the popular media narrative. It's also the most memorable film about skating since 2005's simpering Ice Princess, and beats the sh*t out of it in terms of watchability, and even good skating. And if anything about I, Tonya would be likely to appeal to the real Tonya Harding, it's that. <br/><br/>-8.5/10"

","""I, Tonya"", a portrait of infamous Olympic ice skater Tonya Harding, is one of 2017's most entertaining films. Directed by Craig Gillespie, it is an iconoclastic biographical comedy that is a brilliant mix of mockumentary-style film clips and interviews interspersed with dramatic sequences, figure skating scenes, and humorous moments in which the actors break the fourth wall and talk to the audience.<br/><br/>The acting is incredible. Australian Margot Robbie has finally nabbed her most important role playing Harding masterfully, but it might be Allison Janney as Harding's sadistic, abusive mother LaVona that might be burned into your memory the most. Real-life villains this memorably heartless are rare for seasoned actors to find. I daresay one look at a photo of Janney in the part with her steely crow's eyes staring through cycloid eyeglasses, oxygen tubes in her nose, short choppy boyish hair, and wearing a seedy old fur with a grumpy parrot perched on her shoulder, and you'll never forget her.<br/><br/>Beautifully scripted as well as directed, the key to the film's success might be its editing that superbly forms a cohesive biographical portrait allowing us deep into Tonya Harding's skin, something that might make one pause. Yet while the film is fair in portraying her flaws, it takes no cheap shots, and shows admiration for her tenacity and skill. Don't miss this."

","So, why is this story should care to the world?
Think about it. If you are not born in the US, do not care about Artistic Ice Skating, do not follow the Winter Olimpic Games, or you lived in a tropical country, in front of a gorgeous beach, at 30 Celsius degrees, or are too young to know, read, heard or even be interested on Tonya Harding´s news, why you should be bother to see this movie? 
Here lays the success of Mr. Gillespie or, to be more accurated, of the team Gillespie-Rodgers. Yes, Rodgers throw the ball -with an screenplay almoust perfectly written, with caracters psicologically well designed, with a plot, roles and actions well fit to the reality- and Gillespie simply hit it out of the park. The Direction of this movie is memorable, combining the documentary format, with the fiction parameters, creating the perfect atmosfera to set the mind of the viewers in what is important. 
When I started seeing this movie -I really watched for the casting, I must be honest- I was in an stage of ""who cares this kind of tabloids storytelling"", but then I realized that Rodgers and Gillespie thougth very well every scene, when to cut to real footage, when to cut to the documentary style, when to show humor, and when to show drama. 
Of course the actings of the cast help them, specially Alisson Janney as Tonya´s mom -thank god I do not have a mom like her- but, as I saw it, the team Gillespie & Rodgers managed to trascend all the prejudices about the Tonyas Live and nail it in the hard task of create an story that catch every viewer in the hall..."

","I, Tonya (4 out of 5 stars). <br/><br/>I, Tonya is a biographical film that has a tone like a mockumentary showing the interviews from Tonya, her mother, her ex husband Jeff, and even the tv producer played by Bobby Cannavale giving his input on the whole situation of Tonya entering the Winter Olympics on figure skating and the 1994 event attack on Nancy Kerrigan. The plot follows Tonya when she was young around 4 years old wanting to learn on being the best figure skater and her abusive mother (Allison Janney). Then, following her teen years with still training to be the best and she meets Jeff (Sebastian Stan) who soon becomes her husband and also abusive. Then, as an adult, were her and her husband are on and off every time. She enters the 1994 Olympics and her rival Nancy Kerrigan was attacked by some hired help that comes bashing her knee before the event. <br/><br/>What worked great with the film? Director Craig Gillespie tried to keep this film at a fast pace. It follows modern times during the interviews with these characters sharing there side of the story and perspective on what they thought of the 1994 attack and Tonya Harding. Then, it flashes to her earlier years briefly up until the 1994 event. Were she gets accused and put on trial for the attack. I will say the film moves at a brisk pace, which does not slow down or get boring. There is also some characters breaking the fourth wall barrier talking to the audience about what they thought of their side of the story.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie was fantastic as Tonya Harding. She grows up to be somewhat of an unlikable character, were judges criticized her for the attitude. And how she acts towards people. Also, Sebastian Stan was great as her passive aggressive husband. He is like a ticking time bomb when he gets abusive around. Allison Janney was phenomenal playing a strict, abusive, unsupportive mother. <br/><br/>What I did not like about the film? Bobby Cannavale's character is out of place. He plays a tv producer sharing his input on the 1994 Winter Olympics attack. And his input on Tonya Harding. His performance was decent but his perspective on the event was more of a commentator as an audience than being involved with the characters. <br/><br/>Overall, I, Tonya is a good biographical film. It was fast paced showing Tonya's earlier years on training to be a figure skater, some events with her on and off husband, and her mother's unsupportiveness, and her entering the Olympic championship. Film does not get carried away with the mockumentary style or wall breaking but does feel out of place with Bobby Cannavale's character. But I still recommend the film as worth watching for some incredible performances and the story of Tonya Harding."

","Published in an exemplary way by an extraordinary trailer, ""I, Tonya"" immediately aroused in me high expectations and hopes.
As extraordinary as it may be, the trailer makes the film look like something that turns out not to be, of course for those like me who were not aware of the true story from which it is taken.
So my expectations were met but only partially, just because I expected a different film, not better or even worse, just different.
Honestly this is a great movie, but a slight bitterness in my mouth remained anyway.
Surely it is a truly remarkable film, above all thanks to his screenplay which, between unbridled irony, a bit of black humor and a lot of freshness proves to be sharp and brilliant, just like a story of this kind deserves to be told.
Very good also the direction very clear and fluid (beautiful the sequences on the ice), a direct and cynical directing that, between a breakup of the fourth wall and the other, literally conquered me.
Very good the female performers, Margot Robbie and Allison Janney, and if the first has finally received a role that could allow her to show her great talent, until now held a bit 'in the shade, the second has finally received, after a long career between TV and cinema, her first Oscar thanks to a role in which she perfectly identified himself.
The film is also supported by a pressing and atmospheric soundtrack that ranges from great classics of the 90s, the decade in which the film takes place, as evidenced by the costumes in perfect harmony with the spirit of the film.
Unfortunately, in the central part it undergoes some braking with regard to the rhythm which, slowing down, weighs down the rest a little bit, also considering the duration of two hours."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","0","14 March 2018"," A Well-Crafted Biopic Whose Only Plus Point Is Margot Robbie's Show-Stealing Performance
","Powered by knockout performances from both Margot Robbie & Allison Janney, I, Tonya brings the story of one of America's finest figure skaters to cinematic life in a stylish fashion but the impact of its emotionally resonant moments is rendered null by narrative choices that simply don't work together.<br/><br/>I, Tonya tells the story of Tonya Harding, the first American woman to successfully land a triple axel in figure skating competition, and covers her ice skating journey from childhood to the controversial incident that ended her career for good. The plot also focuses on the abusive relationships that were part of her personal life.<br/><br/>Directed by Craig Gillespie, the film employs narrative techniques like interviews shot in mockumentary style & fourth wall breaking but the only time it manages to be gripping is when our protagonist is on the ice rink. Her abuse at the hands of her mother & husband is disturbing to watch yet most of the time, it is played for laughs.<br/><br/>Add to its off-putting humour, most characters in it are just spiteful. And though it gives us more reason to root for Tonya, the terrible choices she keeps making all her life only makes us question our investment in her journey. It's a tragic tale but it isn't treated right, or with respect, thus resulting in a movie that only impresses in bits n pieces.<br/><br/>The white trash community isn't illustrated from any new angle. Camerawork is at its best when capturing Tonya doing what she does best. Pacing isn't an issue for the most part but a tighter editing could've resulted in a more compact structure. The stunt team that performed or choreographed the skating moments deserves kudos. And its musical choices are unusual yet fitting.<br/><br/>Many moments are shot in a way so as to appear strikingly similar to the real-life footage and it also offers a number of takes on the scandal that eventually led to Tonya being banned from the sport. Filled to the brim with bums, there is nothing to like about any of the supporting characters plus they get way more screen time than required in the final print.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, I, Tonya is spearheaded by Margot Robbie's show-stealing performance as she plays her physically & emotionally demanding role with finesse and is at her absolute best during the final act. Much is made about Allison Janney's input but for me, it's Robbie who impresses the most. Sebastian Stan, however, plays a loser with effortless ease.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, I, Tonya is a well-crafted biopic that could've been much more than what the filmmakers ultimately settle for. The various subplots aren't always aligned in the same direction, resulting in a narrative flow that isn't streamlined at all. It is entertaining and will manage to keep the audience around till the end but its fragmented structure hampers the film's prospect of being counted amongst the better examples of its genre(s)."

That being said, 'I Tonya' is well in line with movies like Argo, Molly's Game, catch me if you can, Moneyball etc. Bringing such 'based-on-true-story-plots' to the screen depends on a good story telling (by writers and directors alike) and the right cast of actors. As much joy as the actors seem to have shooting the movie, it is probably unfair, to pick one out. However, in the light of the fact that Margot Robbie also co-produced the movie, it seems more that fair to say: Thanks and well done, Margot - please keep on that wicked smile and push plots / roles like this!"
"tomgillespie2002","8","0","0","13 March 2018"," Intelligent, unconventional and highly entertaining
","What I know about the world of ice-skating wouldn't fill the back of a postage stamp. I'm familiar with Torvill and Dean's famous gold-medal winning routine at the 1984 Winter Olympics, but that's probably because I'm British and have seen their performance repeated during near enough every Olympic event since. Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya doesn't care if you like ice skating or not, because as soon as its troubled protagonist Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) hits the ice to the likes of Cliff Richard's Devil Woman and ZZ Top's Sleeping Bag, you'll be too caught up in the action, which are comparable to Baby Driver's car chase scenes, to care. But of course, if you know anything about Tonya Harding at all, you'll know this could never be just about ice skating.<br/><br/>One of my biggest gripes with biopics is the issue of historical accuracy and artistic license. Often a film can resemble a moving Wikipedia page as a result, and the other times it can be accused of glorifying its subject. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I, Tonya plays with this idea by admitting its based on questionable statements, and so tries to film it all to let the audience decide for themselves. Tonya, her mother LaVona (Allison Janney), her abusive husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan), security guard Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser), and a handful of others who were caught up in the whole Nancy Kerrigan debacle, all give their testimonies to camera as the action jumps back and forth in time. Characters sometimes break the fourth wall to outright deny what we're seeing is true, and this playful, fast-moving approach is what gives I, Tonya its zing. It reminded me of Adam McKay's excellent The Big Short, which also featured Robbie talking to camera.<br/><br/>Saying that, the film clearly has more sympathy for Tonya than it does for the abusers and low-lives around her. Born into a white-trash community with a sharp-tongued, bully of a mother looking after her, Tonya felt compelled to skate from a very young age. Trainer Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson) doesn't train girls of her age, but soon changes her mind after meeting LaVona and seeing the 4 year-old come alive on the ice. At 15, she is one of the best skaters in the U.S., and one of a few who can pull off a triple axel jump. She is the only one to brave it in competition as well, but despite her abilities, the judges refuse to warm to her unconventional music and clothing choices, and general 'white trash' reputation. Against her mother's wishes, she starts to date Jeff, who quickly becomes abusive whenever Tonya speaks up. She pushes on anyway, trying to reinvent herself in order to meet the expectations of a snobby sport.<br/><br/>Of course, the action builds up to the attack on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan, an incident that shocked the sporting world and is still surrounded by controversy. As for Tonya's level of involvement, that's for you to decide. Gillespie's film could be accused of ignoring one of the victims caught up in the story, but to have focused more attention on Kerrigan could have taken the action away from Tonya, whose film this is. As for the performances, they are stellar across the board. It's a shame Margot Robbie wasn't up against such a formidable opponent in Frances McDormand for this year's Academy Awards, as her transformation here would have surely seen her take home a golden statue most other years. Janney and Stan are excellent too, with both managing to squeeze some sympathy out of their loathsome schemers, and Hauser appears to have wondered in from another movie until you see the real-life footage of Shawn at the end credits. I, Tonya is an intelligent, unconventional, highly entertaining and darkly funny re-telling of a difficult subject matter, with a knockout performance at its centre."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","0","10 March 2018"," A bold new take on a biopic that's messy but memorable
","Biopics tend to have a fair amount of decorum, or at least a sort of sanctity for the people whose lives they're based on and the truth of their stories. ""I, Tonya"" throws all that traditional methodology out the window, using a faux-documentary, fourth wall-breaking approach that highlights the conflicting accounts and lack of certainty over what happened in the famous scandal surrounding the assault on Nancy Kerrigan. <br/><br/>Films based on true stories always take liberties, but Steven Rogers's script swims in them, purposefully. Why must Rogers condense the differing perspectives of Harding (Margot Robbie), her ""ex""-husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan), her mother LaVona (Allison Janney), her coach (Julianne Nicholson) and others into one narrative and present that as one complete truth? Instead, Rogers liberates the story and himself and celebrates the way all the pieces don't come together all that cleanly. In the process, under the direction of Craig Gillespie, the film too develops its own unfiltered point of view.<br/><br/>Presenting Harding's story in this way necessitates an overtly tongue-in-cheek tone, one that sometimes threatens to undermine the moments when the film shows artistic ambition. Beautiful skating sequences are often book-ended with brash comedic moments, or dramatic conflicts qualified or punctuated by the characters in after-the-fact interviews. It's a wild ride through moments of unbridled humor, sports drama, verbal and physical abuse, and characters acting with unbelievable stupidity. <br/><br/>Robbie's performance becomes all the more impressive when you consider all the forces at work in this story attempting to paint Harding one way or another. Rogers, for example offers us plenty of reasons to sympathize with her and explain some of her rash behavior from a psychological standpoint. It doesn't feel as though he's trying to exonerate her, especially because he tries to make it clear that some of what we are seeing play out in the film comes from her perspective, but he's trying to show both her humanity and her personality, which point in opposite directions in many instances.<br/><br/>Perhaps the boldest choice in ""I, Tonya"" is its indictment of the audience for being complicit in the dismantling of Harding's reputation and the general way that we hold celebrities to a higher standard because they appear privileged, gifted and in the public spotlight. By bringing her challenging home life and abusive relationships into the picture, Rogers asserts that Harding actually rose above her station to even compete at such a high level in professional figure skating. She was clearly not desired in that world in all the superficial ways, and had to rise purely on skill (chiefly, her ability to perform a triple axel).<br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" definitely succeeds at creating memorable moments, as well as bringing perspective and insight to Harding's story. It would be difficult to leave the film without feeling as though you learned a lot about what was a seemingly straightforward news scandal, but it would also be hard to come away with the impression that you know the full story. <br/><br/>Despite sometimes getting a little too flashy or too in your face, ""I, Tonya"" makes it a lot farther than most other stylistic, comedy-tinged movies based on true stories thanks to clever writing, committed performances and a distinct point of view.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","'I, Tonya' is written by Steven Rogers and directed by Craig Gillespie and stars Margot Robbie as disgraced Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding. It covers the time between when Tonya was just 6 years old all the way up to her sentencing for the organised attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan in 1994. Allison Janney plays Lavona Harding, Tonya's despicable abusive mother, in a well deserved Oscar winning performance. Sebastian Stan plays Tonya's husband Jeff Gillooly. The entire cast is excellent in their respective parts they play in the story but it's the barnstorming performances by Robbie and Janney that really win you over. In the genre of biopics this is very much reminiscent of Scorsese's 'Wolf of Wall Street' in the way the story is told using voice over and fourth wall breaks. Many also called it the 'Goodfellas' of ice skating and I can see why to some extent but I definitely feel it has more in common with the former Scorsese picture.<br/><br/>The direction and editing are very sharp and swift here and seamlessly interweave interviews from the characters after the incident with the events leading up to it as they unfold. Steven Rogers deserves a lot of credit too for his great screenplay. Not only did he specifically write the part of Lavona for Janney (a role she was seemingly born to play) but he skillfully balanced comedy with an issue as sensitive as domestic abuse. The movie also doesn't try to make Tonya out to be a total victim but instead opts to show how her relationships with her mother and husband shaped who she became- I highly appreciated this approach of the film. <br/><br/>Perhaps deserving of the most credit and praise is Margot Robbie who not only gives a great performance in the title role but also produced the movie and helped get it off the ground when no one else wanted to make it. All in all 'I, Tonya' is a fast-paced, superbly acted and superior biopic."

"LloydBayer","8","0","0","2 March 2018"," I, Tonya subverts a tragic story into a black, comical and unexpected piece of pop culture history.
","Introducing itself as ""irony free, wildly contradicting, and totally true"", I, Tonya is a fiercely entertaining exposé on one of America's most famous yet equally hated personalities in sports history - Tonya Harding. That name not only generated a media frenzy in US championship figure skating, it was also riddled with infamy owing to events that were both outrageous and scandalous. But at the heart, this is a tragic story of a sports star fallen from grace. 
Contrary to the introduction, the film is indeed a huge irony that asks whether Tonya had any grace at all. And if she did, was it unfairly snatched away by the all-encompassing judge and jury we know as society. But before we get to the film's first most anticipated moment - the incredible triple-Axel jump which no other American figure skater had previously attempted - we are introduced to Tonya at age 4. She is on the ice with her skates. She is a natural. The ice skating teacher can see that. The teacher also sees that Tonya and her mother are from the wrong side of the tracks. This would prove to be Tonya's single biggest challenge but also her drive to fulfil her dream of becoming an Olympian. <br/><br/>The second most anticipated moment is what everyone in the film refers to as ""the incident"". The narration, nevertheless, through fake interviews or by breaking the fourth-wall, doesn't detract from the fact that this was the last straw in Tonya's career as a figure skater. While every sports magazine and TV channel were quick to turn Tonya into a villainous monster, I, Tonya is nuanced by the black comical moments leading up to ""the incident"". Instead of answering the question on every viewer's mind (there's a pause where she directly addresses this to the audience), the film is at its gripping best when we learn about Tonya's many personal issues, including domestic and emotional abuse involving her mother and her (now) ex-husband. Between the constant mother-daughter squabbles and love-hate relationship with her husband, Tonya emerges as young woman with true grit rather than the ice skating princess everyone expected her to be. 
 
Sharply written by Steve Rogers (rom-com screenwriter and not Captain America) and directed by Craig Gillespie, this dark satire not only takes a stab at the hideous and vain nature of the sport but also the sacrifice, pain, physical and emotional bruising Tonya endured just to be accepted as any other aspiring figure skater. Lending a wide range of emotions (and even a glint of Harley Quinn), Margot Robbie is at her best as manic Tonya and impressive in every scene. But even as Robbie delivers her best performance to date, Allison Janney as Tonya's iron-fisted mother is an absolute treat with an unending library of expletives. From her introductory scene to the tune of Cliff Richard's 'Devil Woman' to messing with Tonya's head, to shaping her into a champion, Janney's LaVona Fay Golden is just that - show stealing gold in every scene. Together, Robbie and Janney are the muscle and sinew of this film while subverting a tragic story of a sports star fallen from grace into an unexpected yet unforgettable piece of pop culture history."

","I am glad this film got made. I always smelled a rat in the media coverage of the Kerrigan/ Harding spat in 1994. Kerrigan was not so sweet and Harding not so nasty. Margot Robbie does a fair job as Harding and the staging of the big incident is well carried out. The film is ultimately not as powerful as it could be, as Robbie is too good looking, too magnificent looking. Harding was small, tough and put upon - we do not get that sense from seeing Robbie on screen. Also the mockumentary style falls flat in parts as the jokes are not funny enough; the cutesy girl/ dainty mum being foul mouthed is overused and never really as funny as the film thinks it is. The dialogue often meanders and is only pulled together by the use of the 70s early 80s rock tracks. Still very glad this film got made. Go girl, Tonya."

","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>I, Tonya is one of the best movies based on real-life events that I've seen recently. Being a genre that I usually don't feel amazed by, Craig Gillespie tells a very well-written story by Steven Rogers. Very interesting and captivating screenplay, I was invested throughout most of the runtime and I think the pacing is extremely well-balanced, something that is a common issue in this kind of films. Gillespie also makes a great decision by telling the story through different perspectives since the interviews with the real Tonya and Jeff are highly contradictory (as the movie states right at the beginning of the movie).<br/><br/>The cast's performances definitely elevate the film. Margot Robbie (Tonya Harding) might not win the Oscar this year, but her display proves that she has her hands on one in the future. However, Allison Janney (LaVona Golden) portrays Tonya's mother flawlessly (even if the character might have been stretched, as well as some aspects of the real story) and she is my frontrunner to get the Best Supporting Actress award. Great performance from Sebastian Stan (Jeff Gillooly) as well.<br/><br/>Great cinematography, excellent editing and beautiful use of the CGI for the skating scenes. Tonally, the movie could have been better controlled and it feels that both the story and its characters are certainly exaggerated and distant from (some) truths. The entertainment levels are high, even though the film sometimes feels too long."

Tonya is most definitely written/played sympathetically by the beautiful Margot Robbie. (Spoilers) Actually both Tonya and her one-time hubby Jeff Gillooly come off as very sympathetic characters, even given Jeff's well documented (and portrayed here) spousal abuse. The real villains are Tonya's mom (an absolutely horrible person here) and the self-described ""body-guard"" who set up the whole knee bashing incident.

","Based on a true story: Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) is an American figure skater who was linked to the 1994 injury on her fellow American rival Nancy Kerrigan. Harding's hardship life is depicted before and leading to the event including abusive relationships with her mother LaVona (Allison Janney) and later with her husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan).<br/><br/>Anyone who had access to television at the time would recall this event and the attempts to link the Kerrigan attack to Harding. The forecasts seemed endless and were a staple in the vulgarization of the 1990s. In giving the chance for the deeper story to be told, ""I, Tonya"" does the impossible: it humanizes someone whose name had been reduced to a punchline and shows that nobody ever starts out as ""bad"" (though the same could not be said for LaVona - at least as depicted here). It also makes one question how much guilt Harding had in the attack and whether or not her eventual punishment was fair.<br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" is another fine film that shows the result of class prejudice. While Tonya was a great figure-skater, she had a hard time winning the hearts of judges who seemed to dismiss her as ""white trash"".<br/><br/>Robbie is superb in the title role. She easily draws sympathy as someone who worked through terrible hardships to make the best of her life even if she made some terrible decisions. Janney, who is winning multiple awards, can be quite funny at times as a vile, despicable, creature from hell but the role is under-developed. There is never a moment when we see LaVona in a light makes one understand her beastliness or even the slightest moment of goodness. When all is said and done, is it really ""funny"" to see a parent abuse her child as she does?<br/><br/>The courage in telling this story is also a challenge to the encouragement of chasing the American Dream. In this case, the dream ended up as a nightmare. After viewing this film, one can't help but re-evaluate one's own judgments against Tonya Harding. Kudos to the filmmakers for that."

","Back in January, 1994, when the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story was hogging the front pages and headlining TV news, one had a pretty definite sense that Harding herself was a principal motivator behind the attack on her skating adversary. At least that's the way I remember things, although a couple of decades gone by has a way of distorting one's memory. This movie disavows much of Harding's culpability in the plot to harm Kerrigan, and does a reasonable job of portraying all the dysfunctional elements surrounding Harding throughout her life. With a mother like Lavona (Allison Janney), it's a wonder Harding ever made it out of childhood without becoming a bona fide mental case. Her trailer trash existence got another jolt once she took up with boyfriend Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), and if one is the least bit uncomfortable with instances of spousal abuse, scenes here will make you squirm time and time again. For her part, Harding, admirably portrayed by Australian actress Margot Robbie, didn't do much to help her own image, whether skating in front of disapproving judges or taking up with low-lifes like Gillooly and his shady friends. Not to mention smoking like a fiend while in training and competition. You'd think that cold air hitting her lungs after dragging on a cigarette would send her into a fit of coughing. When all is said and done, it's with a bit of irony that Harding herself poses one of the picture's most rhetorical of questions near the end of her story when she asks - ""How am I the poor sport in all of this?"""

I found that this was a particularly effective and interesting way of depicting Tonya Harding's story that proved to be a brilliant device in depicting the complexities of the incident.<br/><br/>The performances from Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney were all brilliant, they all depict characters that are broken and they just come across as so uncomfortable but reliable at the same time. This all comes down to ating which was highly commendable, Margot Robbie's performance in particular was really great. Her performance encompasses a mixture of childlike naivete, absolute badassery and also the try hard lead. These all goes to depict the complexities of her character, the tenderness but also the toughness and grit of such a character. <br/><br/>Allison Janney's performance just absolutely blurs the line of acting and reality, she complete dissolves into the role, depicting this stonewalling, stiff and harsh mother absolutely brilliantly. In a way that just makes her so unlikable, absolutely brilliant. <br/><br/>I, Tonya was a great bio-pic, while it isn't the most exciting or amazing film it came with brilliant acting and a decent screenplay, at the very least it was fun and entertaining."

"leonegrao","7","0","0","25 January 2018"," A solid film, but not thrilling
","Have to say, I am a little disappointed.<br/><br/>The cast is good, with solid acting (that's why Margot Robbie is on the race for an Academy Award) and very impressive visual changes. Every actor did something for their characters and the universe of the '90s decade was really visible in every frame of the movie. But the visual is only a small part of quality.<br/><br/>It's an easy movie to watch, that was my first feeling. I could watch this and re-watch it easily, I didn't ask myself how much more it had until it end, and that is something hard for me, as I'm a very anxious person. But, the movie escalates for a long time, the peak is ""the incident"". And from there, everything is disappointing. I was waiting the whole time to sit apprehensively, but nothing happened, the plot slowly went to the conclusion living me with the question ""that's it?"".<br/><br/>Even thought I know that this is a true-story and I hate when movies try to change the past, I still felt like something was missing. The acting was there, the story was appealing and the direction was very nice. But, thinking about the movie, the best part I can think of is how they filmed the ice skating. When you see a movie as big as this, you expect to remember something more important than the way the camera behaved in some scenes.<br/><br/>Now, about the facts: is she guilty of something or isn't she? The film is very clear about their opinion: it was not her fault. There are scenes where some hypocrisy is shown in an almost comic way, but looking back at the way she was raised, and how valuable that Olympic moment was for her, how could we expect that kind of honesty? In the end, she is just not a very smart girl, but a very persistent one. The movie perfectly show how absurd is the media coverage nowadays (even if tells something from 2 decades ago), how people idolize, both hating her or loving her, when actually, nobody knew her. It also shows how unfair the justice can be sometimes, as she suffered more than other individuals just because she would benefit more than them.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you lived the polemic story of Tonya, you should watch this movie, it will be fun and it will make you think. However, don't expect something memorable, it's a solid movie, like many others, that is only as successful because of the weight of the plot."
"Red_Identity","Null","3","8","27 December 2017"," Fantastic acting
","I guess because I had no real expectations about this being great, I was actually surprised by how great it was. I admit the writing/directing stylistic choices become obnoxious at times, but they also work to make the film stand out from the usual biopic at other times. This is one of those biopics that has the quick, showy type of editing that award bodies go for so I fully expect the editing to get some notices, but it would definitely be deserved. The film moves like a machine while still keeping the character dynamics and development in tact. Overall, the biggest standout aspect of the film is its acting, and in that department it in no way disappoints. Allison Janney was the predicted frontrunner for Supporting Actress before Laurie Metcalf started beating her for Lady Bird. Since this film has come out all I have heard from those who have seen it is how this is not an Oscar-winning type performance, and I completely disagree. I am actually now surprised by how baity and typical the performance is, compared to previous winners. Now I'm back to predicting Janney to take home the big awards. She is definitely really great in the role, although I myself prefer Metcalf. But the biggest stars of the film are Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan. The former has deservingly been in the conversation for awards, and I would say she is in the same level that McDormand, Ronan, and Hawkins (the other three frontrunners) are. She would make a fine winner. Sebastian Stan is almost equally as great, and it's a real shame he's not getting much notices at all. It's a fantastic performance through and through."
"Quinoa1984","7","3","8","23 December 2017"," or as the judges would say: 5.6(?)
","I, Tonya is that frustrating good movie that should or could be better. Not much of any fault can be found on the actors, and while they're all quite good it's Robie and Janney's movie (sometimes Stan's too as he effectively shows he can do more outside of Bucky). And the direction is absolutely acceptable as far as how Craig Gillespie moves the camera and knows how to hold on a shot when he must - certainly at an absolutely crucial moment, without music and only Robie's face as she goes back and forth from tears to smiles in a mirror, is that moment - and getting this work with the actors had to take some deep work. No, everything problematic is the script and the music, and it's not so much what is there as what isn't and/or what could have been.<br/><br/>I didnt know much at all about the Harding/Kerrigan story outside of the general basics of the ""Incident"" as all of the characters in I, Tonya call it, but as much as I might get out of the repeated abuse that Tonya received as a daughter and a spouse may make her more sympathetic (the connection of her physical, as well as mental, abuse to that she received from the media in 94), but I wondered if they could have shown other things to make the story more complicated. Of course there's the bungled crime plot part of it - maybe this screenwriter is a big Coen fan along with Scorsese, and make no mistake this is down-the-line Diet Scorsese, which ill expound on in a moment - and yet Tonya had, from what the movie tells us, a connection *to Nancy Kerrigan as a friend.*<br/><br/>As the audience, what do we get to see with that? Tonya saying it one line and then we see them giggling on a bed. That's it. What is that bond that happened there? Why was Tonya friends with someone who was much more beloved and maybe/maybe not had the hard existence that Tonya had it? I have to think Robie when presented with the script likely responded to the potential in getting deeper into what is underneath when Tonya talks to us (4th wall is broken not only by fake documentary style but by characters doing it mid scene) and is beaten up and fights back and then accepts whats happened and then in reverse the joy of being on the ice. Did she actually respond to the plot mechanics? Because those... I dunno.<br/><br/>None of it is actively bad exactly. If you are looking for straight entertainment that goes for an invigorating ""we're fuck ups but we're human beings look beyond the media depictions"" take, that is there. But Gillespie or the producers or whomever missed out on what could have been more... *showing* us Harding's existence instead of flat *telling* us. That is where they try for Scorsese first, as far as showing us a group of unlike able but honestly depicted characters (and among them Tonya is by FAR the easiest to understand, everyone else is a pathetic creeper or abuser or, well, okay Janney is outstanding as always and I will take her total conviction over exact depth), but it falls flat because the narration isn't necessary for that purpose, it's not original enough to stand out. It is just... There. The second part is the music.<br/><br/>Just... Please, music supervisors, and I shall assume this had the same hack as Suicide Squad (the Robie connection coincidental. Maybe), listen to some of the deeper cuts on a CD or your iTunes, it is certainly possible to get something else than the same dozen 70s and 80s classic rock tracks to show us ""yes, hard rocking 70s times!"" A shame since I like most of the songs in and of themselves, and could see some value in a couple of them (the ZZ Top track which may/may not have been there when Tonya was skating early on is a good example and a deeper track that fits the scene). But like the script the songs spell things out to nearly comic degrees; Janney's mother has 4 year old Tonya on the ice, how about ""Devil Woman""? Theres another drive away ""for good"" from a mega blowout fight between Robie and Stan? How about ""Goodbye Stranger"" by Supertramp? It eventually is overkill too, but the bigger problem is that it accents the scenes and doesnt do scenes dramatic service. It tells us how to feel before we can get a handle or trust what's already there.<br/><br/>I know this sounds like a dumping on on all of I, Tonya, but that may be in part an expectations thing. I thought if it was going to Goodfellas or maybe Wolf of Wall st lengths it might take a satirical view on this uncanny sports saga - the trailer leads one on that direction too, a great trailer I should add - but it is more like an inverted Raging Bull. What if we got the woman's take on being in seemingly endless cycles of abuse, and you cant take what happens off the ice on it either (except maybe to uh prove the abusers wrong?) and yet it is .... not that kind of story either because we do get a lot more of an indication of where the abuse comes from. It's an experience where I absolutely adore everything the actors are doing, I could go on and on about how much Robie owns even (especially even) the smaller scenes that need to be quieter like with Julianne Nicholson (unrecognizable as always), and at the same time they had richer material and a less hackneyed attitude to certain parts of the style.<br/><br/>Oh, and last thing that may be a nitpick, but... It is really distracting at times how obvious it isn't Robie's face on the body during some of the skating moves. Just get a good double people! Dont make me get the club on you VFX slackers!"

","I do not follow any sports, I know nothing about skating and I live in Europe. Yet, even I caught a distant echo of what seems to have been a major US scandal. As a proof of how damaging gutter press can be, the only memory I had of the facts was that Harding physically assaulted one of her competitors.<br/><br/>Turns out the ""real"" story was a lot more complex than the version I barely recollected. According to this movie, Tonya Harding was the product of a violent environment, with a nightmare of a mother who pushed her into competition from age three. Throughout a history of domestic abuse, Tonya managed to become a great skater and then she fell for the wrong guy, Jeff who - by his own admission, had ""no game whatsoever"". The Tonya-Jeff relationship is the cliche' for codependent-destructive. After countless beatings (from both sides), splitting and reconciliations, the couple went back together for Tonya to get through the 1994 Olympic selections, by proving she had a ""wholesome"" family.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for her, Jeff had friends as dumb as himself. Jeff tried to ""help"" Tonya getting to the Olympics by ""scaring off"" her main competitor. It is not clear what the truth about the ""scaring"" really is: if it involved the beating or ""only"" treating letters. At this stage I think nobody cares anymore if Tonya knew about Jeff's plans.<br/><br/>Still, it's hard to believe that people that dumb can actually exist. What I also found terrifying is the relentless media coverage that turned a minor story into a scandal that crossed the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Tony was a trashy girl from the wrong part of town, without any social grace, who was considered too embarrassing to represent internationally the US and she made herself an easy target by refusing to mend her ways, mistaking stubbornness for authenticity. Even if I understand that Tonya's life was doomed form the start, I do not see her as a blameless victim, more as an accomplish.<br/><br/>In any case, the movie is absolutely brilliant.

"JamesHitchcock","9","1","2","5 April 2018"," Waterskate, or, The Battle of Wounded Knee
","OK, let me set out at the beginning my views on the Harding/Kerrigan affair, also known as ""Waterskate"" or ""The Battle of Wounded Knee"". I have long believed that Tonya Harding was innocent of involvement in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. I have believed this, in fact, ever since Tonya finished eighth in the 1994 Winter Olympics. It is just conceivable that a figure skater might orchestrate an attack on a rival in order to win the gold medal rather than silver. It beggars belief to suggest that she might do so in order to finish seventh rather than eighth. Tonya would have realised what the real culprits, her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and her supposed ""bodyguard"" Shawn Eckhardt, did not, namely that Nancy was far from being the only skater standing between her and the gold. What Gillooly knew about skating could have been written on the back of an envelope. (What Eckhardt knew could have been written on the back of the stamp). <br/><br/>A TV movie ""Tonya and Nancy"" was made about these events a few months after they happened, but I was surprised that more than twenty years on there is still enough interest in them to justify another film on the subject. Given that Tonya has passed into folk-memory as one of the Bad Girls of sporting history, I was even more surprised that it was made from a viewpoint which contradicts that folk-memory by presenting her as more sinned against than sinning. (""Tonya and Nancy"", by contrast, tried to sit on the fence as far as the question of Tonya's guilt or innocence was concerned, largely for legal reasons). <br/><br/>In some circles, in fact, Tonya was regarded as the Bad Girl of Skating even before the Kerrigan incident. She consistently refused to conform to the stereotype of female figure skaters as fairy princesses, and her skating style was characterised more by athleticism than by the graceful elegance of some of her competitors. She was frequently criticised for her temperamental personality, for her flamboyant costumes, generally designed to emphasise her voluptuous figure, and for her choice of music. (She preferred rock music or film scores to the more favoured classical). And although some Americans like to kid themselves that theirs is a classless society, she was criticised most of all on account of her social background; journalists and commentators hostile to her did not hesitate to denigrate her as ""poor white trailer trash"". (Nancy, in fact, came from a similar blue-collar background, but always found it much easier to play up to the ""fairy princess"" image on the ice). <br/><br/>Part of Tonya's tragedy was that she was often let down most by those who should have loved and cared for her, notably her mother LaVona Golden and Gillooly. Tonya had a miserable childhood, especially after her parents divorced and her father, to whom she was close, left the family home. (She was the only child of the fourth of LaVona's five marriages). LaVona was a harsh and abusive parent, frequently beating Tonya and humiliating her in public. It was largely to escape her mother's tyranny that Tonya took refuge in a disastrous marriage to the equally abusive Gillooly. That marriage soon ended in divorce, but Tonya was reluctant to admit that the relationship was over, and it was during an attempt at reconciliation that the Kerrigan attack took place. <br/><br/>The film tells this story in a mock-documentary style, including interviews with the characters. At its heart are two particularly fine performances from the two leading female actors, Margot Robbie (who also produced) as Tonya and Allison Janney (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) as LaVona. Janney's LaVona is a cold woman, unable to feel much affection for anyone, including her various husbands or her daughter. She attempts to take credit for Tonya's success as a skater, but there is a hint that beneath the surface she resents the fact that her daughter has become one of America's greatest sportswomen while she, LaVona, has failed at everything in her life. There is another good performance from Paul Walter Hauser as Eckhardt, a man so delusional that he makes Walter Mitty look like a sober realist. In Eckhardt's imagination he is a master spy, a master detective and a master criminal, James Bond, Sherlock Holmes and Don Corleone rolled into one; in reality he is a bum and a petty crook. <br/><br/>Robbie's casting was criticised on the basis that she does not bear a great resemblance to Tonya, but the make-up department achieve a sufficiently convincing likeness and Robbie brings to her characterisation all the fierce never-say-die spirit that was both Tonya's great strength on the ice and her great weakness off it. (It was her reluctance to admit that she could fail at anything, be it triple axels or romantic relationships, which led to her ill-fated reconciliation with the worthless Gillooly). Robbie was nominated for Best Actress, but lost out to Frances McDormand for ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"". I have no quarrel with that decision as McDormand was indeed excellent. Nevertheless, I felt that it was Robbie's performance here, even more than Janney's which holds the film together and gives it its emotional power. ""I, Tonya"" is not just an entertaining movie about a news item which briefly held the headlines over twenty years ago. It is a deeply affecting story about a sportswoman of great talent whose career was destroyed, partly by a prejudiced and sensationalist media but chiefly by the man she loved. 9/10"
"Blogger66","10","1","2","30 March 2018"," A MASTERPIECE THAT INFLUENCED THE WORLD BEYOND FIGURE SKATING!
","Trust me because I'm a sports freak. I can determine which sports films are worth watching for the fans, also for the audience who don't care about sports. I'm positively confident to say that this movie is for everyone. <br/><br/>First of all, I want to recognize the BIG three who led this film its maximum potential and nearly won the best picture Oscar award. <br/><br/>Craig Gillespie, the director, was single-minded in his determination to pursue his passion for being a successful filmmaker. He dared himself to abandon everything in Sydney and moved to New York City at the age of nineteen. He went zig-zag to direct a commercial to the next commercial for fifteen years until he reached an upper level to lead a high budget film. The majority of his works are considered to be above average, such as Million Dollar Arm and Lars and the Real Girl. Nonetheless, a work of his hasn't touched down to the land of disappointment. <br/><br/>Margot Robbie who continues to blossom like crazy since she won the Harley Quinn role. This film led to establishing her in the category among dominant actresses, especially after she proved that she could portray multi-dimensional characters of different genres. <br/><br/>Thirdly, a remarkable performance by Allison Janney, who's must be known as one of the best-supporting actresses, had nearly stolen the whole attention from Margot with her limited time in the film. Likewise, she won the best-supporting-actress Oscar award. <br/><br/>It's a biographical film that follows the life of Tonya Harding, a figure skater, who was infamous for involving the event of an attack on her rival, Nancy Kerrigan, in 1994. Her abusive mother solely guided Tonya's childhood life by determining her to dedicate her entire life to become the best figure skater. However, the most significant side effect of raising solely on skating was the lack of education. Also, the implication the Bandura's Social Learning Theory where she grew up with abusive mother as her only model. As expected, she's attracted by people with low self-esteem and low education, and that led her to the unforgettable event in 1994. <br/><br/>A critical element that sets this film apart from the others is the blend in the documentary interview style with people who involved the incident. It made it appear as if they explained to you about the whole story. <br/><br/>I want to share a short story that implied to the reason for portraying this critical element. My dad described me about this particular event since I was too young to recall that time. Before Tonya, the majority of people didn't care about figure skating. After Tonya and the incident, people in the world went crazy. The competition in Winter Olympics received the most viewers in the history and Tonya received plenty of hatreds. (On the other side, the Olympics chairpersons should thank Tonya for receiving a lot of attention, mainly when it was the first Winter Olympics.)<br/><br/>Moreover, her rival Nancy Kerrigan had met all the criteria for winning the medal before her performance on the ice, such as her beauty and well-educated background, whereas Tonya struck with a label of ""white trash."" (Unfortunately, the aspects of criteria would be attentive lowly on beauty and such as that today.)<br/><br/>However, back to the point, Craig Gillespie included this critical element-blending in the documentary interview style- to let Tonya and others share the whole story to provide the full perspective on that particular incident and the rest for us to judge. <br/><br/>According to my viewpoint, Tonya was in shallow socioeconomic class as the majority of people in America. Those people who surrounded Tonya were likely to vote for Trump to be our president. She barely had a model who supported her. She nurtured with the attachment style of being afraid and clingy. Therefore, she was accustomed to having people controlling her. She thought it was defined the meaning of love. So, when she found out about her ex-partner was involved the incident with Nancy, she was afraid to share this information because of her lack of knowledge of the fact of the laws and the effect of her attachment style. In result of her nurtured by nature, she was banned from figure skating competition for not spitting out about her ex-partner earlier and received the worst punishment. <br/><br/>This film demonstrated the powerful reflection of the life circumstances. High socioeconomic status, beauty, education, native English speaker, etc. will always have the advantages. Whether we like it or not, the judging system and the laws justified the privilege for high socioeconomic statuses, even when it was without their intention. Tonya, for example, the way she was raised. It influenced the chosen of her action to keep private about her ex-partner extended longer than the statement of law itself. Therefore, it took nearly everything away from her. <br/><br/>Bottomline, I love Tonya for who she is. I love how she went through the obstacles like the mountains, Everest. The most amazing of her doing was her ability to stay at the competitive level for an Olympics medal after all the chaos, including the betrayal of her mother. However, nothing is above the laws. I have to accept the fact that she earned the punishment, but I'm glad that this masterpiece was created for her. She beyond deserved the meaningful recognition and the second thought among people who judged her. <br/><br/>Overall, as I said, it's a masterpiece that's well-deserved to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar award for the reasons of providing multi-perspectives on socioeconomics, psychology (Attachment and Stages of Theories), and sports!"
"soundoflight","6","1","2","28 March 2018"," Average Film, Nothing Special
","I felt compelled to write a quick review based on the number of glowing 10/10 reviews I'm seeing on here. Maybe everything is 10/10 now, and that's just the times we live in, but for me a 10 is a masterpiece of film, a seminal film. ""I, Tonya"" is nowhere close to that. I found it to be an enjoyable bit of nostalgia that was sadly a bit lacking in emotional impact. <br/><br/>I personally disliked the fake-documentary style of the film, and found that this had the opposite of it's intended effect: it took me out of the film and made it seem more fake. It reminded me I was watching a film recreation of actual events, instead of being able to just enjoy the story for what it was.<br/><br/>About 3/4 way through the film I started to lose interest. I knew where it was going to go and there were no surprises. If you are interested in the Tonya Harding story and pine for some 90's nostalgia (which I thought could have been emphasized more), then I would recommend this film to you, but sorry folks, ""I, Tonya"" is not the second coming of ""The Godfather."""

","An amazing sugar-rush of a movie. I felt like I had been picked up and whirled around, then placed back on the ground outside the cinema, laughing. I can pay no higher compliment than that I, Tonya reminded me in a BIG way of a Coen Brothers movie. The dark humour, the cringing embarrassment, the empathy, the tension. It's not a biopic, and those above complaining about inaccuracies or lack of realism should look elsewhere. Without being a facsimile of Tonya's life, it still manages to tell her story - that's what movies should do.
I have never willingly watched ice-skating in my life, but the scenes on the ice here are tremendous. The music punches you in the stomach, and the action is exhilarating. The CGI isn't great but hey, it's the movies, you suspend your disbelief.
Robbie delivers a stunning performance, her screen husband is hapless, pathetic and hilarious, but special mention must go to the rotund henchman (the real character died at 40 in 2007, apparently). His is a comic performance par excellence. Alison Janney deserves all her accolades as the psychotic mother, but to be fair, it's a bit of a pantomime villain role, so maybe a little easier to get her teeth into. Robbie simply steals the show.
It saddens me that worthy but dull, box-ticking entries like Get Out and Moonlight garner all the accolades they do whilst a rollicking entertainment like I, Tonya is, to some extent, disregarded. See it, without delay!"
"Kingslaay","Null","1","2","5 February 2018"," Not too bad, had higher expectations
","I, Tonya had its strengths and was a decent film. <br/><br/>However it did not live up to its hype. The acting and performances are the strongest part of the film. Margot Robbie does a great job as Tonya Harding and fully immerses herself into Harding's troubled and spiraling out of control life. It was hard to not feel sorry for Tonya and the abuse was not easy to watch. It also had a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>The film could have had more laughs, been better directed and definitely contain less reflections from their older selves. Nothing kills the flow of a movie than disjointed confessionals from the cast that added little value to the film. A critic called this film 'The Goodfellas of Figure Skating', it definitely is not and does not have the same caliber or quality attached to it. The biggest weakness is this film lacked flair or style to weave it all together. Overall decent but lets not kid ourselves its nothing to brag about. <br/><br/>7.5/10"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","1","2","3 February 2018"," Margot Robbie gives a ferocious performance that leads this stylish true story to greatness.
","After about two minutes into ""I, Tonya"" I knew it was a new kind of epic work of nonfiction. Director Craig Gillespie knows how to tell a true story. Instead of the ""first I did this, then I did that"" style of most biopics, Gillespie and writer Steven Rogers give this film a ferocious energy that hits hard. Margot Robbie's performance as former Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding is legendary, one of the single greatest performances I've ever seen. She portrays Tonya perfectly down to the last detail, while also portraying a broken soul that allows us to sympathize with this historic figure. Allison Janney steals the show as her abusive, foul-mouthed mother who is wickedly funny and hateful. Tonya'a abusive husband, Jeff Gilooly, who was behind the attack on Nancy Kerrigen that put Tonya Harding under suspicion, is magnificent. <br/><br/>""I, Tonya's"" rich cinematic style and unique form of storytelling through mocumentary interviews is put together and edited beautifully. The ice skating scenes in particular are done impeccably. This knockout full-throttle true story hits harder than almost any film imaginable. The humanist performances full of rage and sorrow hidden behind a dark comedic undertone bring out a staggering amount of different emotions throughout the film, making ""I, Tonya"" a truly special achievement."

"loco_73","Null","1","2","24 January 2018"," I, Tonya, Everybody's Favourite Punching Bag
","The strength and crushing poignancy of ""I, Tonya"" is what lies beneath the perceived pedigree and nature of the movie. It is as much a dark comedy and fictionalized biography, as it is something else, something more, much more. <br/><br/>It is the sad and heartbreaking portrait of a deeply flawed and imperfect individual, who got caught in events that went way beyond her and her perceived or actual guilt. <br/><br/>It is the story of a human being screaming for help, in need of love and support, being ignored and overlooked at every stage of her strange, hard and often unforgiving existence. It is the story of a woman that was abused and brutalized while everyone, including the people that could and should have helped her, looked away and pretended it wasn't happening. It is the story of someone who was rejected and stepped on because she didn't fit with our idea of what a sympathetic character should be and look like.<br/><br/>Whatever Tonya Harding achieved in her life came through sheer will and yes, hard work. She also made mistakes, made a mess of things and failed often. What a human being should be allowed to do in life with the ramifications and consequences which come from that.<br/><br/>Ultimately this movie is an indictment of us as a whole, as a society, who turned on her and made her our distraction, a punchline to a sad and pathetic joke, exposing her to an unyielding torrent of cruelty and harshness. We cast the first stone and never looked back. Tonya Harding became everybody's favourite punching bag (pun intended), hung out to dry, transformed into the thing we most hate about ourselves, projected onto this one person. <br/><br/>All of this is wonderfully brought to life by Margot Robbie in a sublime performance, seconded most wonderfully by Alison Janney and Sebastian Stan. A well directed, acted, written and produced movie. <br/><br/>""I Tonya"" is not perfect, but it is an eye opener and in these troubled days that is saying something."

","1/21/18. Saw this today in the theater and it was worth seeing on the big screen. Janney and Robbie were phenomenal as the dysfunctional mother-daughter act that basically ruined the life of Tonya Harding. The movie was well-done and tried to make sense of the messed up memories of everyone involved with the clubbing of Nancy Kerrigan. While Harding was not viewed as an American sweetheart, she was very much a child of America's heartland, home of the working class. It was hard watching Harding being continuously abused by her mother and then her husband, but this is her story. Despite it all, Harding was a talented skater who never got the break that would have put her up where she belonged - the winner's circle. Worth catching. Hopefully, Robbie and Janney will get some recognition during movie awards time for their portrayals."

","Everyone has been raving about this movie, so I had to go see it for my self. Now that I have seen it I honestly don't have much to say about it.<br/><br/>This movie was interesting to watch, it was also educational because I was not familiar with the events that took place since I was young and living in a different country. ""I,Tonya"" doesn't really break any new grounds in filmmaking but it's a complete, enjoyable, entertaining and (for the most part) real story.<br/><br/>The only thing that particularly stands out in this movie is Margot Robbie's absolutely INCREDIBLE performance as Tonya Harding. I think without her this movie couldn't exist or would fall under every radar. I really liked the style and the seamless blending of genres as well as the fourth wall breaking, it made it more unique.<br/><br/>If you need to kill some time or you like movies about real people, this is a good choice. Definitely not the kind of movie you have to see on release in theatres, I'd say wait a few months and watch it in the comfort of your own home.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"bkoganbing","9","1","2","13 January 2018"," What did Tonya know and when?
","Comparisons come to mind when thinking of both Tonya Harding and this excellent film about her life and that notorious incident that led to her disgrace
and banishment. The film is done almost as a homage to the faux documentary
style that Gus Van Sant used in To Die For which was based on the Elizabeth
Smart story. Both even had Australians as protagonists, Nicole Kidman for the
Van Sant film and gloriously memorable Margot Robbie for I Tonya.<br/><br/>I racked my brain trying to think of a sports figure like Tonya Harding and the
closest I came up with was Shoeless Joe Jackson who came from a similar trailer park background that Harding did. He too listened to the worse angels
of his nature and got himself banned for life in his sport. Jackson had far less
education than Harding did, in fact he was almost illiterate. <br/><br/>One thing about Jackson though his choice of life partner was a good one. By
all accounts his choice of life mate was inspired as Katie Winn Jackson stuck
loyally by him and was never a bad influence.<br/><br/>That could not be said for Jeff Gillooly who had the same kind of trailer park
background that Tonya did and who let being the husband of a celebrity just
totally go to his head. Sebastian Stan whom I consider one of the best actors
around today plays Gillooly with an explosive intensity. As the sports press
built up this rivalry between Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, Gillooly tries to think
of ways he can make himself indispensable to his wife.<br/><br/>Thus was born the knee capping incident which gained both Kerrigan and Harding a celebrity status far beyond the world of women's figure skating. It
was done by a man hired by a dim bulb friend of Gillooly's played by Paul Walker Houser. The scene with Houser being interviewed by the FBI is laughable and the expressions on the faces of the agents just says it all.<br/><br/>The investigation went almost Watergate like up the ladder until the real target was reached by law enforcement and public opinion. It's such an incredibly plaintive scene as Harding begs the Figure Skating Association not to
be banned. It's all she knows. The film is purposely vague as to how much 
Tonya did know.<br/><br/>Best of all is Allison Janney and while the cast is great and many might get
Oscar consideration Janney I think is a sure bet for a nomination as the monster of a mother that Robbie has. Still alive she denies the child abuse
allegations. I kind of doubt it. Janney is unforgettable.<br/><br/>Two scenes are also real keys to Harding's character and how it developed. One is early on when Harding berates the judges. She knows she outskated
everyone, but they remind her that form and presentation count big for them.
And later on she's told she's not the right image. Figure skating champions have to be pristine princesses as they have from Sonja Henie to today. She
does make the effort to clean up her image.<br/><br/>She almost does and a scene that will break your heart just before the fall is her leaving an arena and being asked by a little girl for an autograph. In that
moment with dignity and class she shows herself the role model sports figure
she was expected to be. Poignant all the more because the audience knows
the fall is coming.<br/><br/>More than would be figure skaters should see I Tonya. It's the sad story of an
American tragedy."
"fletcherc21","7","1","2","9 January 2018"," A Sympathetic Perspective
","I don't remember the actual Nancy Kerrigan assault and the ensuing media fallout because I was too young, so I didn't enter with any preconceived notions of what really happened. They don't try to definitively say if Tonya Harding ordered the attack, because we will probably never know for certain, but they frame her potential innocence as a strong possibility. That seems absurd until you realize the incredible stupidity of her ex-husband and his friends. The film plays out as a dark comedy following the extremely unlikely rise of Tonya Harding from trailer trash to one of the top figure skaters in the world through all of the adversity with an institution that didn't want any part of her.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie is excellent, if a little too tall, as Tonya, channeling the anger and drive that propelled Tonya to greatness and may have led to her downfall. Allison Janney is fantastic as her abusive, hateful mother in a performance that will earn her a surefire Oscar nod. Sebastian Stan is also pretty good in an almost unrecognizable performance as her unhinged ex-husband. Ultimately, I was left feeling a little sorry for Tonya because they took the only thing she could do away from her by banning her from skating."

She also fights her boyfriend for fun like a pirate... later in the movie she still does the same....<br/><br/>It makes absolutely no sense, because if she's that conceited she would have no reason to try to amaze everyone with the triple axel...<br/><br/>Her real personality (not shown in the movie) is basically not being loved by her mother and so must try to overplease everyone around her, and treat older strangers as potential role models because she doesn't have one. When she's around her mother, skating for the competition she has no heart or soul in it except for an unholy will to be the best (to please her unpleasable mother). She decides to do a triple axel.

She portrays the role in an extremely convincing way, and her performance shows an extremely wide range of emotion. Her performance is absolutely outstanding, and I believe the real-life stigma against Tonya Harding is the only thing that held her back from the Oscar win. Robbie's performance outclasses McDormand's in every aspect.<br/><br/>As for the other characters, Stan is the only one with any complex emotions.

","All in all, this film is about 7/10. But uneven as it is, it has aspects worthy of a 10 and others worthy of about 3. It just tries a bit too hard to be entertaining resulting in a loss of credibility. It's hard to really relate to.<br/><br/>The most engaging thing about I, Tonya is its energy. Craig Gillespie is a talented film maker (wonderful Lars and the Real Girl) working really hard to keep things always on the move. He is helped greatly by editor Tatiana S. Riegel, nominated for an Oscar. On the other hand, Gillespie kind of shoots himself in the leg by rolling a never-ending collection of pop songs, some of which are way over-used already. Case in point: Gillespie doesn' realize/care that Supertramp's Goodbye, Stranger is, in a way, ""owned"" by Magnolia. It seems a dull choice here. Note, also, that the film is largely modeled after The Big Short's irreverent style.<br/><br/>Actors in this film written, surprisingly enough, by Captain America are uniformly great, but Margot Robbie really deserves to be up for an Oscar. She has scale, fury, presence and great technique to pull of playing the real Tonya she resembles in almost no way (really, the height difference, the face etc.). Robbie is the real show here. But they are all great, from Sebastian Stan to Paul Walter Hauser.<br/><br/>Then there's the hugely entertaining Allison Janney. It's a great performance, but also troublesome. Tonya's mom is a ""real piece of work"". A truly horrible mother. But, Janney makes her fiercely unapologetic character so charismatic and funny, that the true monstrousness doesn't surface. It's a sleazy choice, if you think about it, trivializing abuse. Same criticism goes for the marital abuse Tonya has to suffer. It's played here as entertainment.<br/><br/>And entertainment this movie is. That is why almost no time is spent with Tonya's grueling training, the greatest power that shaped her adolescence. Thus, we don't really get a grasp of the quantity of sacrifice she made as child and a youth. And the movie is still overlong.<br/><br/>Among the things I, Tonya does really well is putting things in perspective and revealing the falsehoods we've accepted in a different light. As the film's passionate claim goes, Tonya was responsible for next to nothing relating to the assault on Nancy Kerrigan. Yet, she suffered the biggest punishment and is still the main ""bad guy"" in the public eye. I, Tonya drives this point forcefully to home, and kudos for that."

","We went along to see this movie mostly because we wanted to see Alison Janney's performance. She doesn't disappoint and her Supporting Actress nominations are well deserved. Margot Robbie also delivers an excellent performance and appears to do most of her own skating in the movie. <br/><br/>The problem with the movie for this viewer was that by the end, I still wasn't any the wiser about Tonya's level of prior knowledge or involvement in the planning of the attack on fellow skater, Nancy Kerrigan, but actually I just didn't care. The attack on Kerrigan was a shocking thing, but she went on to win Olympic silver. At the end of the movie, I didn't care about who knew what and who was involved or about Tonya's upbringing and abusive husband. The whole thing left me indifferent.<br/><br/>I do think it's a shame that Tonya Harding is getting renewed attention and publicity with the release of the movie. There are thousands of people with more interesting stories out there waiting to be told on the big screen."

","I was 18 years old when this all went down and the thing I thought about was ""who cares, it's ice skating?"" and ""I'll jerk it to Nancy Kerrigan, she's hot...and the crying makes it better.""
Yes, that is the history of ""the incident"" where Tonya Harding, supposedly desperately wanted to be in the Olympics so bad, she supposedly coordinated the attack on Kerrigan.
This sort of resentment exists in anything where talent and skill are in full display. The same could be said about filmmakers. One loves to throw shade on each other. But there still exists a mutual respect. That it was even made. The resentment, no doubt, boils within the person. I'm victim to it. Others are as well, but it's never voiced as openly as ""I,Tonya.""<br/><br/>There is no way in Hell director Craig Gillespie didn't study ""GoodFellas"" when making this movie. It is the embodiment of that style to the exact whip pans and breaking the fourth wall. And he nails it! Like Tonya Harding's triple axel. Without even the story of Harding versus Kerrigan...it's still a fucking fun movie. There is so much energy and dark humor. This is the movie ""Three Billboards..."" desperately wants to be. Because the darkness to the humor is earned and doesn't have contrived brutality to make you believe it. In fact, there is a moment when she addresses us directly and accuses us of...well, it's all true, which sucked the air out of the theater. That is amazing filmmaking.
The performance of Tonya by Margot Robbie is a little bit caricature of the person. Though I think she walks a fine line. It's so razor thin and she does it so effortlessly. Like a perpetually dumb teenager who listens to ""New Kids On The Block"" it isn't a spoof. And that's the hard part about the movie. That she plays a notorious bad girl without playing it for laughs. She just...is. It sometimes is heartbreaking. And Sebastian Stan who plays Jeff Gillooly, whom I thought a buffoon back in the early 90's was a brutal guy. Never did we once believe he would end up killing Harding, but you get the feeling it was only a matter of time. The wild relationship they had almost excused it for love.<br/><br/>The trophy definitely goes to Allison Janney as her mother LaVona Golden. An unrepentant white trash Mom-ster who is either a stage mother or a wicked step-mother. Her physical attacks on Harding seem so effortless it's the shocking part of the movie. Like after so many attacks, it became normal. She should win the Oscar for Supporting Actress (though probably not because it's an awful mean person).<br/><br/>How do you make a film about someone everyone knows more about than you? This is the answer. Take the key players names out of the film, and you still have a fascinating film about the ruthlessness of the ice skating world (not much different than the beauty pageant). People also forget that Tonya Harding was the first American woman to landed a triple axel. Yes, folks, the only American woman who had the balls to do it. If she's chippy about her legacy, she deserves to be."

","Let's dive right into it: the acting was not good. The script did this movie no favors but there's really no excuse. If you're a good actor you shouldn't have to convince me you're a bad person by cursing every other word and if you're a good person by not cursing at all. Life is more complicated than that and, frankly, the people in this movie deserved better. In this day and age if you need to curse that much in a movie you're script either isn't very good and/or your characters are one dimensional. The language and behavior of all the characters make it really hard to care about these very real people.

"Mike_Devine","6","1","4","25 June 2018"," A dark comedy of many, many errors
","In the history of American competitive athletics, there are a few moments that stand the test of time and are remembered many years after they happen. One of these moments is profiled in 'I, Tonya' - the 2017 quasi-fictional documentary-style film that follows the tumultuous life of former U.S. figure skater Tonya Harding (portrayed here by Margot Robbie), who had a swift rise to the top of the podium and an even swifter fall from grace thanks to the actions of her former husband.<br/><br/>But 'Tonya' is about more than just ""the incident"" (as it's referred to in the film) - it takes us behind the curtain to see how the self-professed redneck was able to defy the odds, fending off constant verbal and physical abuse from her monster mother, LaVona (played brilliantly by Allison Janney), and her one-time husband, Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), to make the U.S. Olympic team twice in two years. 'Tonya' is filmed in an unusual way, where the story's characters are interviewed present day, reflecting back on the events, and we then see these events play out. Director Craig Gillespie takes liberties with this approach, doing things like having the actors break the third wall multiple times to dialogue with the audience and editing together reflections to tell a disjointed story.<br/><br/>But as serious as this story could be, since it's not a happy one, it's interesting to see how much sarcasm is injected into 'Tonya.' Of course, this was likely something that was cleared with Harding herself, but it still is almost shocking to see some of the things that are depicted onscreen and are then basically shrugged off. Because Gillooly and her mother were such domineering personalities who controlled Harding, the relationships are what drive the entire film more than anything else. Also not lost on us is the stupidity of nearly everyone involved here - from the attack on Nancy Kerrigan to the cover up, it's like a comedy of error after error - and everything is captured in a way that makes it feel almost unreal.<br/><br/>'I, Tonya' is not an amazing film in and of itself, but it's a vehicle through which standout acting performances are carried. And for that reason, it should be recognized."

","I saw the events live when they originally took place, and followed the news for a few years after. Right off, I was disappointed in this movie's one-sided interpretation. It was so overloaded w/negative behaviors you would think every one portrayed spent their entire lives doing nothing but being evil/hateful etc. It was loaded with continuous swearing, yelling, smoking, drugs, abuse, ego. It's what happens when fame & money govern our values. Although unusual in how this took place it is not without precedent in sports w/cheating & dishonesty the past hundred years (including quite recently) in baseball, basketball, football, tennis, cricket, track, cycling, gymnastics (e.g. using drugs that help a person focus), soccer (even to the point of fans dying)."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","1","4","10 January 2018"," One of the Best Movies of 2017
","I'm mad at this movie. No sooner have I just finished writing my ""Best Movies of 2017"" list, this film skates up to my doorstep and effortlessly wedges itself on my list of favorites. No sooner do I write off Margot Robbie as just a face for making the forgettable Legend of Tarzan (2016) and (gag) Suicide Squad (2016), she turns in this absolutely masterful performance. No sooner do I write off director Craig Gillespie for being a hack Disney hired-hand forced to make Driving Miss Daisy (1989)-level cheese, he comes up with this uniquely dark and comic masterpiece. It's not my fault I didn't catch I, Tonya before the New Year. I blame the distribution!<br/><br/>The story of competitive ice skater and sensational-media pariah Tonya Harding does have a lot of blame to go around. Harding, her abusive ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, her dimwitted bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, her mother LaVona Golden, the media, the Ice Skating Association and even you, yes you, all have a part to play in what Tonya refers to as ""the incident"". The running stitch the holds this dysfunctional collage together may surprise you but at the same time feels perfectly reasonable, tragic and despite this film being set in the early nineties, altogether timely.<br/><br/>Assuming you're under 25 and don't have the 90's Trivial Pursuit Time Capsule Edition, the story of Tonya Harding and her involvement in a vicious attack perpetrated on rival Nancy Kerrigan was very much the news story of the season. At the time, the exceptional ice skater became a punchline for the media and especially for late night comedians such as David Letterman. It certainly didn't help that her humble origins set against Nancy Kerrigan's prim and perfect media persona, aided in making her the biggest sports villain since the Soviet 1980 Hockey Olympic team.<br/><br/>What was never shown before, during or after the hoopla was Harding's battle with abuse. The film portrays the 20-year-old Harding (Robbie) coming to skating practice; makeup barely covering up bruises made by her husband Jeff (Stan) the night before. Before even meeting Jeff, the film portrays her home life with LaVona (Janney) as just as tumultuous; LaVona making it a point to destroy her confidence nearly every chance she gets. The film also portrays Harding's wings constantly being clipped by judging committees who see her homemade outfits and attitude on and off the ice as an affront to the sports' image.<br/><br/>I keep saying ""the film portrays"" because director Craig Gillespie and screenwriter Steven Rogers make it a point to state that I, Tonya is not an official account, but rather a Rashomon (1950) cobbled from different sources. Peppered in-between the unruly narrative are a host of mock-interviews where all the characters involved are given a chance to ""set the record straight"". This is despite the movie often juxtaposing what they say with beautiful levels of Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) irony. It's a ridiculous approach to a ridiculous story and it's pulled off with the same bullish grace as Nicolas Karakatsanis's cinematography and Margot Robbie's ice skating. Thus what we see in I, Tonya is a total marriage of pacing and tone, humor and depth, glee and sadness that gainfully tells a story you only think you knew.<br/><br/>There are some problems, largely stemming from the film's third act inclusion of what's essentially extra credit. It intones that due to our own addiction with sensationalist media, we as an audience are complicit in Harding's hardships. While I agree with the sentiment and the film does weave this new tangent into the fabric of the narrative, it does seem to come a little late to the party. Additionally while Robbie completely owns the role as Tonya, the twenty-seven-year-old actress playing her at fifteen looks a little...off.<br/><br/>Regardless, I, Tonya is a wonder of a movie. It's a slick, funny, wild and sad little showcase about wholly unlikeable characters who manage to simultaneously be sympathetic without necessarily being deserving of your sympathy. With documentarians are mining 90's tabloid journalism to create layered, hard-hitting features like Casting JonBenet (2017) and O.J.: Made in America; it's nice to see a movie go a completely different way without sacrificing perspective. Here's to hoping the soon-to-be-made Lorena Bobbit story also rises to the occasion."

","Haven't seen director Craig Glliespie's ""I, Tanya"" yet? Not to worry, you probably won't unless the amazing Allison Janney (""Mom"" and ""The West Wing"") gets nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Unfortunately, Glliespie (""Lars and the Real Girl"" - 2007) presents a big screen film that has a cheesy TV Lifetime Channel feel. Adding to his odd documentary interview style directing here, is the over the top costume design by Jennifer Johnson, whose period outfits and extreme hair presentations are a distraction to the story. Margot Robbie (Tanya), best known for her ""Suicide Squard - Harley Quinn"" character plays Tanya consistently hard, making it almost impossible to be believe her character and/or feel sorry for her predicament. The handsome Sebastian Stan (Jeff - Tanya's wild husband behind the mustache) is a pleasant contrast to Robbie and Janney's (Tanya's hardcore mother) bull in a china shop relationship. Character actor Paul Waiter Hauser does a nice job here as the guy behind the Nancy Karrington (played briefly by Caitlin Carve ""Paper Town"" 2015) attact. Odd as his character is, he comes across as the most believable in the film. Regardless of the above, enough can't be said for Allison Janney's commitment to her in-your-face, foul-mouthed, distraught, put upon character. Because Janney is so well know for her current and past nice gal character roles, watching her in this role is both hard to watch, yet somehow extremely satisfying. If Glliespie has any credit coming his way for ""I, Tanya,"" it's his casting of Janney in this Award worthy role."

","""I, Tonya"" is a difficult film to define, but is very creative in it's approach to the telling of Tonya Harding's story. This docudrama, is filled with funny moments of delusion and disillusionment. We can believe the words spoken by the actors, really did come from the mouths of the real life cast of characters. 
We can even laugh at the incredulous justifications and interpretations of events. Meanwhile, for Harding, her boyfriend, bodyguard and mother, they expect our understanding and empathy, because ""nothing was their fault"". 
Tonya came from a broken home with a chain-smoking, alcoholic and abusive mother who encouraged her to remain in an abusive relationship. It is amazing how far Tonya went considering the lack of support, education and poor role models in her life. She was a fighter, which contributed to her fearlessness on the ice. At the end, you feel sorry for her. Tonya was harshly judged and convicted of a crime she did not commit. Although Harding was not involved in the plot to injury Nancy Kerrigan, she paid the price for having dysfunctional people in her life. The US Figure Skating Federation ultimately won, because they never wanted Tonya to represent the USA and felt she was a stain to the image they wanted to portray."

","The following is just the first impression after watching the movie. I do n't understand figure skating or the rules behind it. There may be some places where the idea is immature. After all, it is a real event. You ca n't really understand the truth. Maybe everyone Due to his predicament, the movie makes a sound, trying to understand the truth!<br/><br/>Everyone has their favorite movies, and then there must be movies that I do n't like. For example, I do n't feel much about this movie. I do n't understand why it 's so high. Or for other reasons? American directors are very happy, because many real events can be adapted into movies, these movies show us different views of life, different values, and there are many classics, such as Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Many are adapted templates!<br/><br/>Let me talk about why I do n't like this movie. First of all, it 's acting. It seems that Margot Robbie was nominated for the best actress Oscar, but I found a problem, that is, when many movies show character personality , Most of them are smoking, no matter what you do, you must smoke, and that one is called a costume ×, I 'm not targeting this movie, it 's for all this type of movie, it 's really vomiting, you ca n't smoke less point? Is it okay to change a cigar? Or take a sip of a small wine glass? I feel choked across the screen. Maybe the director feels that women smoke is uninhibited, so the mother wants to smoke, the queen has to smoke, and the posture, method and tone are exactly the same. To be honest, I feel embarrassed! Yes, but not necessary. The only highlight of the performance is that at the end of the movie, Margot Robbie 's line to the judge 's verdict was painful, a wrong decision to bury a man 's half-life effort, I do n't know what else to say except to sigh!<br/><br/>In fact, in such a society ruled by law, there is no truth in such a thing. Even the movie can't make the truth. Do you know that she knows? As Tonya himself said, go to the truth of tmd, she knows that it is unclear, even if the truth others will believe? People usually only believe what they are willing to believe, so the best solution is to not do bad things, and the movie is Tonya's story, so our perspective is from her, and naturally there will be empathy when making judgments. Let 's change the angle of view and put it on the attacked Nancy. I think there is no f ** k except for deserving it. Even if the sentence is very heavy, the final caption comes out to tell you that Nancy attacked him after being injured. The mastermind of Tonya 's husband, Jeff, and who, who, what, how, how would you think from Tonya 's perspective? Do you feel too much?<br/><br/>There is another place in the movie that I do n't like, is its rhythm, is it light and pleasant? Even when his husband was playing Tonya, he thought it should not be serious, why is there such an illusion? Because the rhythm of the film makes you think that you are watching superhero movies, the fights inside are fake, it 's ridiculous, I do n't know how to describe it, if this story is not true, it 's okay to deal with it, violent aesthetics, all I have seen it, but this is a real event, even if the lifestyle of the male and female owners is like this, can't it behave like this? Black question mark face? ? ?<br/><br/>Tonya's mother, I think she is a good mother. She uses her tofu to save all her savings to help her daughter learn to skate. Even though she is smoking, violent, and stubborn, she cannot understand when she was a child, but when she grows up, I must I will be very grateful, and the emotions between the mother and daughter in the film are very subtle, seemingly non-existent, seemingly thin, I am really confused, I understand that one mountain cannot accommodate two tigers, both are too strong, To be sure, Tonya is very strong. If she really does n't know about the attack, the ending will be unfair to her. Or maybe her mother has already seen everything and said at the wedding that you can go to bed with a fool, but no ""It is necessary to marry a fool."""

I happened to be present while it was playing so I typed a review. Out of curiousity about the accuracy of the movie I read some articles online. I quoted two articles below that have some interesting tidbits of information.<br/><br/>The following questions and answers are part of a Newsweek interview from 07 December 2017 of ""I, Tonya"" Film Creator/Writer Steven Rogers.<br/><br/>What made you want to tell Tonya's story now? ""There were things about Tonya's story that interested me about truth, the perception of truth and the things that we tell ourselves in order to be able to live with ourselves-how we change the narrative. It's also about media and class in America. I tracked down Tonya, and I tracked down Jeff Gillooly, and they agreed to talk to me. Their stories were so wildly different; I felt like they were telling themselves what they needed to in order to be able to live with themselves. I thought, ""Well that's my in. I'll present everybody's point of view of what happened and let the audience decide for themselves.""<br/><br/>When Harding told you about her childhood, how her mother, LaVana Golden and her husband Jeff physically and emotionally abused her, did you feel more empathy for her? ""Of course. I mean, that's what I really wanted to do with the screenplay. I felt all the characters had been reduced to a punchline, or to just one thing. Nancy the good one, Tonya the bad one, and Jeff the villain. But nothing is that black or white. There were no heroes. I really wanted to make everyone human.""<br/><br/>Was Tonya involved in other aspects of the movie, beyond the interviews? ""No. You know, you're dealing with a real person, so I did let her read the script and she has seen the movie. But she wasn't involved in the making of it.""<br/><br/>What was her reaction to the movie? ""I was very nervous because can you imagine someone saying to you, ""I'm writing a movie about your life, which we're gonna whittle down to two hours. Here, watch it!"" But she said she laughed, she cried. She said there were things that she didn't like, but she's written me two emails thanking me. She's happy. I think it was just important for her to get her side of it out.""<br/><br/>The movie is both hilarious and unbearably sad. Like Harding said, it makes you laugh and cry. How did you find the right balance between respecting the seriousness of what happened and keeping it funny? ""I didn't want to tell a conventional story, and, to me, the story is very funny, as well as very tragic and very crazy. And it is very true-ish. (Laughs) It's all those things. Life isn't one thing, it's everything. So I used that tone very deliberately.""<br/><br/>What do you hope people pick up from the film? ""Life isn't fair, but to me there's a fairness you have to have with everything and everybody. There are people who are eager to write their opinion in the comments section without knowing anything about what they're talking about, and I hope those people see the film. We were all so quick to judge Tonya. I wanted this movie to say, ""You know what, just take a step back. Why don't you examine all of the facts before you come out here with your good opinion?"" I wanted to humanize the characters-that's really what I wanted to do-because Tonya and Jeff didn't have that then.""<br/><br/>After getting to know Harding and hearing her side of the story, do you feel she deserves an apology for how she was treated-from the Skating Association and the media? ""Absolutely, yes. Like I said, I remember thinking, ""Oh she just wants attention."" That's what we were fed. And she was kicked out of the Skating Association, which means that even if she wanted to train a skater, she can't. I feel like she was treated unfairly. Do I know if she was really involved in the Kerrigan attack? No. I'll never know. But I didn't care about that. I cared about putting all points of view out there.""<br/><br/>From another interview: Tonya Harding finally stated once and for all that she was aware of a possible plot to attack one of her fellow competitors ahead of the 1994 Olympic games in the ABC special Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story.<br/><br/>'I knew something was up,' says Harding of the clubbing that nearly ended Kerrigan's career. She denies playing any role in planning the attack however, which was later revealed to have been set up by her husband Jeff Gillooly and bodyguard Shawn Eckardt, who Harding describes as 'dumb as a post.'<br/><br/>'I did, however, overhear them talking about stuff where, ""well, maybe we should take somebody out to make sure she gets on the team."" I go what the hell are you talking about?' confesses Harding, marking the first time she has plainly stated she knew Kerrigan or another American was prone to attack.<br/><br/>CONTENT ADVISORY: F-word said often and in various ways, c'nt said once, probably a few other expletives I'm forgetting, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, scene's filmed in a bar.

","While I, Tonya offers a sympathetic portrayal of the disgraced Olympian, one should note that it is *her* sympathetic portrayal. The movie is based on interviews with Tonya and her ex and plays with the unreliable narrator; at one point Tonya shoots at her hubby, then turns to the camera and says she never did such a thing.<br/><br/>In spite of those moments, overall the movie does take Tonya's side, chiding her for never taking responsibility yet ultimately portraying her as caught in a cycle of abuse. While this abuse is often gasp-inducing, for the most part the movie has a breezy, humorous tone, taking great delight in its idiot-rogues.<br/><br/>Victim Nancy Kerrigan gets short shrift here. I read an article suggesting she should be rehabilitated as well from her undeserved ""ice princess"" reputation, but that's unlikely to happen. Whatever her level of complicity, Tonya is a fascinating character, and this movie offers an intriguing look at figure skating's bad girl."

","I can't believe people are commenting on how they feel bad/ ashamed for what they thought about Tonya. I lived and breathed skating and knew all about her and the ' incident"" It's like saying a serial killer is ok to do what he did because nature vs. nurture . She got her karma swiftly when her shoe lace wouldn't work or broke as she said I watched it live. Ok.. On to the movie. I think Allison Janney was the standout. Margot was good but she kind over did Tonya as some bad ass. Tonya was a meek little girl baby in front of the press. Her accent was way off ( and I know she's from OZ so is my mother) but se had her sounding from Min or Wisconsin or something. The movie was alright. Some compare it to Goodfellows.

"NickMacTurbo","7","0","2","22 February 2019"," ""Everyone has their own truth."" My truth; this film is a stylish triple axel that keeps you on thin ice.
","Margot Robbie and Allison Janney are a devilish duo that make this stylistic mock-doc biopic in a word-of-mouth presentation infused with '80's style and sound shimmer.
The film is an unflinching look into the life of Tonya Harding before, during, and after her infamous 'incident' involving Nancy Kerrigan before the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 1994. But while a lot of films that are 'based on true events' often present themselves in a very wary and questionable way, this film makes no attempt to head or misguide your judgment on the real, or even ambiguous, events portrayed. While the film opens with the statement, ""Based on irony free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly."" Seeing as how Harding and Gillooly presented vastly different stories, it feels as though her innocence is not forced upon the viewer; however, her possible motives are displayed on the screen.
Robbie fills Harding's skates with an encumbering exuberance that draws you in to her character. With Robbie producing the film as well it is very clear she was invested to this role and it shines through in her performance, making her Oscar nomination very obvious.
Harding's early life in rural Oregon, as portrayed by the film, was riddled with the disapproval of her over-bearing mother LaVona Golden (played by Janney). Janney's portrait of Golden is painted in greatness as Janney embodies the character in what seems like a natural fit. Providing the film with its most powerful scenes, along with comically dark and prudent dialogue. One of the titular scenes with Janney is when she first gets her daughter enrolled in figure skating. The scene has an incredulous feeling of the '80's, with Golden smoking on the ice while Cliff Richard's ""Devil Woman"" polishes the scene off with a comfy finesse. This eventually leads to a line that distinguishes Harding's character; Golden is arguing with Harding's coach, Diane Rawlinson (played by Julianne Nicholson), about her not fitting in with the ""rich, prissy"" types that are typically expected of figure skaters. Golden states her daughter can do triple axels and adds, ""She doesn't fit in. She stands out.""
Another scene between Harding and Golden later in the film emerges as the centerpiece of both Robbie and Janney's performances in the film. The interaction between mother and daughter in a café is hauntingly real and drenched in emotion. With Golden, rather explicitly, explaining to Harding that she gave her a gift delivering the line, ""I made you a champion, knowing you'd hate me. That's the sacrifice a mother makes!"" To which Harding's response is, ""You cursed me.""
Janney sends chills with her execution of a shameless and distant parent, making it evident why she won an Oscar for her role, and the relation feels real between the two actors on screen.
A lot of scenes felt like they were shot with a lot of thought behind them, such as the scene with her mother on the ice and one later where they explain her history of domestic abuse with intriguing 4th wall breaks. While other scenes fall flat, specifically when she fires her coach in the locker room it felt as though a lot of emotion was lost in the presentation of the scene. But for the scenes it worked, it worked well. Along with the fast-paced and smooth editing, it creates a very interesting and fluent tale. This seems fitting when you realize Director Craig Gillespie and Editor Tatiana S. Riegel had previously worked on the 2011 remake of the 1985 cult film Fright Night, both films have a similar feel.
Overall, 'I, Tonya' is an enjoyable ride, littered with sweet tunes, and dark humour. Harding's character may not be portrayed as likeable but you begin to feel a sense of empathy for her by the end. It is interesting to witness a glaring example of how the sports world always has its scandals, which often become bigger than the sport itself, and how the least expected sport can be ground zero for one of the biggest in history.<br/><br/>

Tanya Fell victim to bad associations with her loser husband. Pick your friends carefully. Make friends with people who have 'half-a-brain' and are psychologically 'Sane.' Run from dysfunctional Family Members as fast as you Can. And most certainly, run from so called 'friends' who are not going anywhere but down the drain. This was a great movie full of wisdom.

"jake-young96","6","0","1","15 May 2018"," Entertaining, darkly comedic and the right amount of informative but lacks real punch and impact.
","It's a story of the woman who gripped the western media back in the early 90s to her and women's figure skating. Margot Robbie plays the foul-mouthed and rambunctious Tonya Harding, detailing her life generally but most importantly ""the incident"" and the undeniable black comedy surrounding it.<br/><br/>Most biopics are there to serve the purpose of informing you about the person in question, I, Tonya does display the troubled childhood up to the success and fame of Tonya Harding but for a person with so much 'stranger than fiction' events in her life, it's a wonder why the film takes these stories in a fictional Coen Brothers comedy style. That's not to say it's ultimately a bad thing but I, Tonya could have been a very different kind of film and perhaps should have been considering the way in which Harding's story is being put across.<br/><br/>I, Tonya plays much like an apology note and reassurance that Tonya Harding is, in fact, a person worthy of respect, contrary to the way she was used as a punchline throughout the late 90s. That is not to say that Tonya Harding has not been misjudged but more to the criticism of the film, that it fails to give any background to important people in the events or really any opposing views. It certainly attempts to capture the conflicting reports and wacky nature of events that surround her life, the film even opens with a message stating the nature of these conflicting reports and these interviews are true to life. This would not be an issue if the last half of the film did not concern itself with this event and was more about Tonya but it decided to play more as a dark comedy focused on her instead.<br/><br/>Thankfully it does the quirky, offbeat and downright hilarious characters and events justice, in that the comedy is executed well and the film is very entertaining but the cherry on top, is just as the film wraps one of the more hysterical comedic moments is displayed from the real interview and its equally if not more hilarious. Coupled with the entertaining comedy is surprisingly some sweeping camera work, the figure skating routines are executed with gusto and precision which aids in the empathetic look towards Harding as her skating skills become apparent, however, the film could have benefited from doubling down on this sympathetic agenda to give this narrative more impact.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie does fine mostly as Harding to aid this sympathetic look at Tonya's life with a couple of stand out moments that push her performance to the highest it could be, sadly it's not overly captivating but Robbie is engaging and refreshing. The show is figuratively stolen however by Allison Janney, who plays Tonya Harding's estranged and monstrous mother, her performance is both lively and greatly amusing, as it is towering and sinister.<br/><br/>I, Tonya is an entertaining and hilarious darkly comedic look into the bizarre life and events of Tonya Harding, While the film does a great job of providing laughs and a fun time while learning a little about this pivotal women's figure skater, it does little in the way of impactful storytelling and doesn't quite give the film the eloquence it thinks it has."
"kirbylee70-599-526179","8","0","1","29 March 2018"," TROUBLED TONYA
","When I first heard a new movie was coming out about the life of Tonya Harding I wondered what type it would be. I mean sure it would be biographical but what direction would it take? Would it praise her, condemn her or attempt to straddle the line between both? Depending on your point of view concerning Harding the answer will be a personal one.<br/><br/>The film opens with Harding being led to the skating rink at 4 years old by her mother LaVona (Allison Janney). The chain smoking, hardworking, abusive and foul mouthed woman sees that Tonya has a natural ability and she plans to use that to help her make it through life.<br/><br/>But that life is not the best that a young woman can go through. On top of the failed marriages of LaVona that happen, she is also beaten by her mother at various moments. This leads to a lifetime of verbal and physical abuse in the decisions she makes down the road, both in how she treats others and how she is treated.<br/><br/>Tonya (Margot Robbie) begins developing as a skater but always makes the wrong choices when it comes to winning competitions. While others are taking the standard route of classical music and well-made costumes Tonya enters in costumes she or her mother sew and rock music that inspires her to a great performance but not what the judges want.<br/><br/>At 19 Tonya meets Jeff Gillooly (Stan Shaw), a young man attracted to her and from the same social strata she hails from. If you hadn't guessed it already Tonya comes from what is stereotypically referred to as ""poor white trash"". It isn't long before the pair begin dating, at first accompanied on dates by LaVona. In no time flat they marry and begin a tumultuous relationship with Jeff adoring her one moment and shoving her face into a mirror the next. The relationship ends in divorce but with the couple unable to part ways and Jeff always there.<br/><br/>Also always there is Jeff's friend Shawn Eckhardt (Paul Walter Hauser). As depicted here Shawn does little more than eat (he's seen with food in nearly every shot) and imagine himself to be more than he is, claiming to work for the CIA as an undercover operative. But he's there for his friend Jeff whenever needed.<br/><br/>In 1991 Tonya gets her big break when she becomes the first woman to do a triple axel successfully in competition. It's enough to pave her way towards the possibility of a chance at the Olympics. But after that year while her performance slide downward. Still, she has that chance. Before it can happen the ""incident"" occurs.<br/><br/>Gillooly and Eckhart formulate a plan to disrupt competing skater Nancy Kerrigan. The end result is the hiring of someone to do her damage by taking a telescopic baton and smashing her knee. As depicted in the film all Jeff wanted to do was send her death threats to mess with her concentration, it was Eckhardt that came up with the damage plan. The end result was not favorable for Harding.<br/><br/>The movie is quite well made with terrific performances by all involved, resulting in an Oscar nomination for Robbie and an Oscar win for Janney. That Janney can come off as such a despicable character shows how she well she did her job and that she deserved the award. One thing to marvel at, if it was indeed her, is the skating ability of Robbie. Not the leaps and such but just being able to skate convincingly in the role. The shots of her in competition show a great skill with the camera as well as editing techniques that are seamless when it comes to stunt doubles.<br/><br/>Now the personal issue. While the movie doesn't shy away from portraying the roots of Harding it seems to want to elevate her to hero status. It paints a portrait of a woman who finds the fault always lies in someone else and never on herself. Her mother, the judges, her ex-husband, the press, we the viewers are all presented as the reason she is who she is. How that makes her a hero or can be seen as an inspiration for young women is beyond me. And after all that we are presented with here I found it still difficult to believe she was innocent when it comes to the ""incident"".<br/><br/>If the language used here, dotted every few minutes with a wide assortment of F bombs, doesn't bother you then you might find this movie an interesting take on the life of Harding and the struggle she had. If you remember the ""incident"", the release of sex tapes, her appearances in reality TV and her recent outburst during an interview then you'll wonder at the altered view of her life as seen here."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","29 March 2018"," It's high time this subject/character gets a movie and it could have turned out way worse (but way better too)
","""I, Tonya"" is a new American movie that hit cinemas in Germany just recently. It runs for 2 hours exactly pretty much and was directed by Craig Gillespie, who has made some other known films in the past, and written by Steven Rogers, for whom this film resulted in his first BAFTA nomination and the two worked together for the first time I think. Fittingly with the director's nationality, the title character is played by Margot Robbie and I must say I have never been a huge fan of Robbie so far, but here she really won me over and I am glad she received her first Oscar nomination for this portrayal of ice skater Tonya Harding. Sadly she is not known for her huge talent these days anymore, but really only for the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. As this film is based mostly on interviews with the actual people depicted in here, it cannot be seen revelatory in any way when it comes to understanding what happened exactly back then. But it doesn't need to be in order to be a success. I thought it was very entertaining from start to finish, mostly thanks to Robbie who is in every scene almost. But also a thumbs-up to Sebastian Stan here, who impressed me as he has so much screen time and I never heard of him before. And then there is Allison Janney. Maybe I expected too much from her given the fact that she won an Oscar for her turn here, but well, I think it is much more about the costume, make-up (and the transformation resulting from it) and also the way the character was written and not really about Janney doing something outstanding here, at least not compared to some other far superior stuff she has done in her long and successful career. Of course, don't get me wrong, she isn't bad or anything, but nowhere near the standout I wanted her to be.<br/><br/>I am writing this review from the perspective of somebody who has not really witnessed the actual events back in the 1990s. I was alive back then, but I have no memory of Lillehammer or what happened before that. I think that the one component where the movie delivers the most is maybe its style. The atmosphere resulting from camera work, music and other factors was pretty unique and I read people comparing it to Goodfellas, which i find somewhat accurate. Still, something was missing for real greatness, maybe in terms of how the impact on society was depicted, the film playing a bigger role in the grand scheme of things or so. This is where I felt it came a bit short and smart references about how television stations were the reason Harding even got to participate at the Olympics despite the pending charges were not enough overall. I also did not like the interview parts too much as these somehow broke the flow in terms of chronology, but that's just my subjective opinion. As for Robbie's Harding, she is definitely among the most tragic characters of the movie year 2017/2018. She may act foolishly on many occasions, but her upbringing, her ""romantic"" involvement, her disapproval from officials are all areas where she suffered and really cannot by blamed from any perspective and these shaped her into what she became. There is one nice example where she really verbally abuses the chubby guy (who comedically thinks he is an expert on terrorism etc.) despite all the ways she was discriminated against before and these are the moments when it is hard to justify her actions because maybe she should know better because of what she went through. Anyway, a masterclass portrayal by Robbie and she really has many moments in which she truly shines and I think she pulls of the stunner-gone-ugly part as good as Theron in Monster, maybe even better. One final note before I close my review: Always nice to see Mckenna Grace, she really has amazing potential in the next decades I think. ""I, Tonya"" is a good movie and definitely worth seeing, but not among the very best of the year. Still, go check it out."

I, Tonya is a raw and emotional story of the hardness and unloving world she was surrounded in.

","I found out about the real-life story being put onscreen from Big Fat Quiz of the 90s, it sounded a perfect plot for a movie, and then of course there was its inclusion during Awards Season, so I looked forward to it, directed by Craig Gillespie (Mr. Woodcock, Fright Night). Basically in 1970s Portland, Oregon, four-year-old Tonya Harding (Maizie Smith) is driven to ice skate by her abusive mother LaVona (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Allison Janney). As Tonya grows up, her mother takes her out of school to focus on a career in skating, she trains extensively with coach Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson). Tonya quickly becomes one of the best figure skaters in the United States, but she cannot shake off her ""white trash"" reputation or move beyond homemade costumes and unconventional choices of performance music. At 15, Tonya (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Margot Robbie, also producing) starts dating 18-year-old Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), despite the disapproval of her mother. Tonya is able to move out of her mother's home and escape her physical abuse when she and Jeff are married, but soon after Jeff starts physically abusing her as well. LaVona scorns Tonya for putting up with it, but Tonya blames her mother for raising her in an abusive environment. Meanwhile, in competition, Tonya becomes the first American female figure skater to complete two triple axel jumps. Tonya has a dispute with Diane, she fires her and hires new coach Dody Teachman (Bojana Novakovic) for the 1992 Winter Olympics. However, Tonya fails to stick to her landings and comes fourth, she blames loose ice skate blades. Defeated, she decides to return to Oregon, finding a job as a waitress, but then Diane convinces her to return to compete in the Winter Olympics 1994. Tonya decides to visit her estranged mother, who criticises her for having put a lot of her money into Tonya's skating lessons, she says that she ""made her a champion."" During her training sessions, Tonya is disrupted, receiving death threats, her main rival is Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver), Jeff retaliates to the threats, instructing his friend Shawn Eckhardt (Paul Walter Hauser) to send threats to her. However, Eckhardt wants the notoriety and prestige, so he hires two crooks to attack Kerrigan after a practise session in Detroit, one of them, Shane Stant (Ricky Russert), hits her legs with a police baton. Kerrigan's legs are not broken, but she has suffered a bad knee injury, soon enough both assailants are found and arrested, and Eckhart bragging around town leads the FBI to finding and arresting him. Eckhart points the finger at Jeff, who is horrified by his involvement of the death threats, meanwhile, despite the allegations that she was involved in Kerrigan's attack, Tonya qualifies for the Olympic team. Tonya realises however that she will be found guilty of her association in the attack, she goes to the FBI to tell what Jeff and Shawn did, Jeff is shown her written testimony. In anger he races to her house to attack her, after this Tonya leaves Jeff for good, filing for divorce, while he implicates her to the authorities, claiming that she knew about the attack on Kerrigan. At the Winter Olympics, Tonya comes in eighth place, while Kerrigan is able to compete, and wins the silver medal. Back in Portland, Tonya is surrounded by media, LaVona visits her and gives her some kind words; she finally tells her she is proud of her and that she is on her side, but Tonya realises she is wearing a recording device, when she asks her about her knowledge of the attack, she ejects her from her home. Jeff, Eckhardt and Stant are all sentenced, while Tonya's trial is postponed until after the Winter Olympics, Tonya avoids prison, but is given three years probation, 500 hours of community service, and a $100,000 fine. Tonya is heartbroken when she is forced to withdraw from the 1994 World Figure Skating Championships and is banned from competitive figure skating for life. She begs the judge to send her to jail rather than take away the one thing she knows how to do; the judge declines. Jeff acknowledges that he ruined Tonya's career, changes his name and remarries, while Tonya embraces her notoriety and becomes a professional boxer. Also starring Bobby Cannavale as Martin Maddox, Dan Triandiflou as Bob Rawlinson and Alphie Hyorth as Judge Londer. Robbie really captures the rough edges and emotions of the real Harding, but Janney that gives the award-worthy performance as the abusive mother, she steals all scenes she is in. It is a very interesting scandal that I had read about, and the domestic story is also interesting, this movie has a good twist on how to do a biopic, with characters breaking the fourth, it is both funny and dramatic, while the CGI-assisted technical skating sequences are reasonable, it is a most watchable biographical black comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair, Best Original Screenplay and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

","I, Tonya<br/><br/>Watching girls perform vertical splits in their panties is only allowed during Olympic figure skating.<br/><br/>Sadly, the skater in this dramedy has been banned from ever flashing audiences again.<br/><br/>From an early age, Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) had been pushed by her abusive mother (Allison Janney) to be the best on the ice. Despite the cruelty, she grew into a talented skater. <br/><br/>Her abusive boyfriend Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) sees that Olympic potential, but also a threat in her main rival, so he hires Tonya's bungling bodyguard and his dimwitted crew to assault Nancy Kerrigan at the ice rink.<br/><br/>A bizarre true story made even stranger by turning the violent event and its participants into a comical situation executed by white trash caricatures.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","20 February 2018"," Comedy?
","Critics flatly question why this true story was adapted as a comedy. The answer though is right up front, at the start of the movie, with written introductions ""based on irony-free, wildly contradictory and totally true interviews"". Tongue in both cheeks (maybe not simultaneously). Perhaps it is the only sensible way the screenplay should be written. <br/><br/>Going towards the approaching Oscar, two lead actresses have each separately won a major award in a film with the protagonist's name as title ""I, Tonya"" and ""Lady Bird"". Both these awards are in a separate ""comedy"" category, which Oscar doesn't have. While both wins are fully deserved, it will be most unlikely that either of them can pull off an upset against Frances McDormand in Oscar, when they are all nominated in the same category. <br/><br/>The entire movie is framed within a set of ""interviews"" of a handful of characters, who are portrayed by actors. But this does not necessarily prove that there were no real interviews behind the scene with the real people. Nor does this prove that there were. Here's the thing. The ""Rashomon factor"" is very much palpable. What are said in the interviews are contradictory, particularly between the Tonya Haring's (Margot Robbie) and one-time husband Jeff Gillooly's (Sebastian Stan). The whole business of uncertainty reeks of quantum physics: depending on when you look, you can see side-splitting comedy, gut-wrenching violence or heart-rending tragedy.<br/><br/>The opening scenes show Tonya as a little girl at a skating rink, with foul-mouthed mother LaVona (Allison Janney) asking much-in-demand coach Diane Rawlinson (a very gentle Julianne Nicholson) to accept her daughter. The very opening exchange has Diane reminding LaVona that there is no smoking at the rink, drawing the flippant reply ""I'll smoke quietly"". In another quick character sketch of the mother, we see LaVona refusing to let Toyna leave the rink for a bathroom break (thereby wasting her hard-earned money), resulting in the little girl wetting herself. Totally unperturbed, LaVona said ""skate wet"". These little sketches say more about the mother than the graphic physical abuse she delivers at will at her daughter, even when she is no longer a little girl. The father is the polar opposite. He lovingly shows her how to shoot a rabbit in the eye so as not to ruin the meat. Unfortunately, father has to leave town to seek work, leaving her behind desperately yelling at the top of her voice ""take me with you"", to no avail. <br/><br/>These domestic scenes pretty well set up the background of Tonya's character, reinforced every time with a close-up showing the utmost intensity in her eyes at the start of her competitive performances, in which she achieves technical perfection. But athletic perfection is not enough, not even the ""triple axel"", the difficulty of which the movie takes pain to explain in detail. When confronted by Tonya in the parking lot, a judge flatly says that this is not all about skating. ""You refuse to play along"", he says meaning that Tonya fails to represent the image of ""a wholesome American family"". It is heartbreaking to hear Tonya's retort ""I did not come from one"".<br/><br/>This takes us to the midpoint of the movie, and ""The Incident"". I wouldn't go into the bizarre details which are all in public record. It was never conclusively decided if Tonya was the person truly responsible for the attack on her chief rival Nancy Kerrigan, initiated by Gillooly. The injury was not serious enough to affect Kerrigan's upcoming competitions. While Gillooly was sentenced to a moderate jail term, Tonya was banned from skating for life, something she would rather trade for a jail term. Skating WAS her life.<br/><br/>Tonya (I stayed away from her last name because in addition to the maiden sir name, she has three more, from three different husbands) has been depicted in sympathetic light in this film, and why not? Maybe the aforementioned opening cheeky introduction is intended to deflect any potential moral criticism. The single most touching scene I found is in the second half when the wicked witch of a mother breaks through a crowd of reporters and gets into Tonya's house, purportedly to support her, but then found with a tape recorded hidden in her coat pocket when Tonya clings to her for comfort. Such a heartbreaking moment when Tonya's hopeless longing for love all her life is torn open again like raw flesh in an old wound.<br/><br/>Margo Robbie's powerful performance is an interesting contrast to Saoirse Ronan's easy underplaying in ""Lady Bird"", different styles, both enough for their respective Best Lead Actress wins in Critics' Choice and Golden Globe. Both excellent, but then Frances McDormand in ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is something else! Allison Janney, on the other hand, has an almost clean swept of Best Supporting Actress, reminding me of Louise Fletcher's tearful thank-you speech in the 1976 Oscar for the same award ""Thank you for hating me enough..."", referring to her portrayal of an equally hateful character in ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest""."
"aarosedi","Null","0","1","11 February 2018"," A talented, uncouth redneck figure skater's fall from grace
","This biopic shows a series of interviews and dramatization of sometimes conflicting and unreliable accounts from the prominent people in the events surrounding Nancy Kerrigan's knee whacking in 1994. Robbie, Stan, Janney captures the essence of the characters they portray in this film. The various news clips and interviews of the real Tonya Harding and other personalities shown in the end credits serves as comparison to those said performances, and I got to say that the depictions really made those larger-than-life characters yet again larger than life.<br/><br/>Gillespie has profoundly presented Harding's life beset with hardships: of her and her mother's persistence in achieving mastery of figure skating at an early age and trying to fit (or not) to the expectations of a sophisticated sport, of her struggles in being a product of a broken home, of her volatile relationship with Gillooly, and of the insanity that surrounds the botched-up plan to scare her rival Kerrigan. The pst-modern approach that the director used in this film to handle the issues regarding the inconsistency with which we recount the events in the past, (I admit even I am sometimes guilty of that - Nobody's perfect). Not to mention the egotism in which people try to paint themselves a more pleasant, more agreeable version of the past to suits them or feeds them. And then there's those people who are just plain kooky.<br/><br/>Gillooly's meetings with his friend/self-proclaimed Harding bodyguard Eckhardt in that dreary strip club fancying himself as a criminal genius wannabe is quite a black comedy gold. The director superbly captured the cheesiness of the proceedings, and the resulting lunacy of having to rely on such buffoons in the first place to devise an idiotic out-of-this-world plan that went down in American pop culture history, of which he is amazingly immensely proud of orchestrating.<br/><br/>With the madness that have transpired that had her ending up as victim of a traumatic attack, there is no need for people to know Nancy Kerrigan's point-of-view or take in all of the fiasco. Not that her life isn't that interesting, it's just that boring for some people ain't palatable and Tonya Harding life is handing the all-consuming trashiness to the scandal-hungry public in spades. <br/><br/>Kerrigan and Harding's name are forever linked to each other, like marriage in tabloid heaven. Never shall Nancy's name will be mentioned and for people not to think of the other, a dilemma that is shared as well by Harding who still has protested her innocence regarding the incident. It's kind of a bummer for Kerrigan because that kind of undermines her career as a proficient skater, though to think about it, her name would not have been more resonant if she would have been only one of those Olympic figure skaters in America that come and gone. And Harding, in all fairness that she also deserves, she does not need that nasty publicity as well. She could have easily had a decent career being a product endorser or something for being the second female figure skater in the world to completely execute the triple axel in a major competition, nobody can take that away from her, a feat that hasn't been attempted since. Yet. <br/><br/>My rating: A-minus."

","Why should anyone watch this movie? The answer is in four words: Margot Robbie and Allison Janney. They are the movie. Both of them. One as the main star and the other one giving one of the best supporting actress performances ever. That both of them have been nominated to the Oscar for best in their respective category for playing these roles is not a coincidence!<br/><br/>This movie is not the so typical biopic of a sport star (or kind of). We are presented the main characters following some interviews played by the actors (no the real persons) and then we are told their story by them, in not the usual way and that might remind you of many Woody Allen's movies where there are interviews at the beginning. Because the mood is the same: realistic but funny, although what they are explaining is not funny at all. We are presented to the characters and to their past. How they met, what they were doing and what they must do, specially Tonya.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie is flawless in this movie. She portrays the main character with such energy that once you finish watching the movie, you only want to search for the real Tonya in the internet and watch her performances; and once you watch them you realize that you already know them, because you have watched this movie. On the other side of the coin is Allison Janney; who portrays Tonya's strict mother and every time that she is on-screen she just simply steals the show (poor bird, by the way). If you are not much into sports movies, just do us all a favor and watch this one just to enjoy these two women doing one of the finest works an actress can do.<br/><br/>The movie tells us a story that did happen, maybe not exactly like it is explained here, but it happened not so long ago. It's not easy to explain something like this and get the audience attention while the movie is still rolling, but this movie exceeds in that. We are attached to the screen for the whole movie duration and once we finish we want some more, and we can get more of the real thing, but that doesn't mean it better that the fictional one. A movie to learn something new while enjoying some good laughs."

","This is a perfect movie for the Age of Trump in three respects. First, as Harding says at the end of the movie, ""There is no such thing as truth; everybody has their own truth."" Second, it is the self-pitying tale of a talented prole who found the system rigged against her. Third, the central character turns her feelings of undeserved inferiority into energizing rage before she is undone by moronic underlings. Robbie's Harding is a blue collar Nixon.<br/><br/>Superior acting; Robbie proves that she is far more than this year's blonde, and Janney does a great embittered working class authoritarian. The supporting cast of idiots from the husband on down is maybe written and played a little overbroad, but then people that dumb are walking around out there. The shot in which a man carrying a metal club nevertheless uses his head to smash a locked glass door says it all.<br/><br/>The script claims to be based on interviews with Harding, her mother and her ex-husband. Missing from the list is her self-appointed ""bodyguard,"" Shawn Eckerdt, which is why all the blame for The Incident winds up on him and his minions."
"HollywoodJunket","7","0","1","6 January 2018"," Scene Stealers Stole the Movie in this Mockumentary
","From the very first opening shots of ""I, Tonya"", it is clear that this movie is unlike many others. Opening with a sequence of interviews from the main characters delvulging their take on the events to be recounted in this mockumentary style dark comedy, they state, these are ""totally true interviews."" And, in fact, they are! Most of the inteviews are re-enacted word-for-word from real-life on-camera interviews and transcripts.<br/><br/>Directed by Craig Gillespie, ""I, Tonya"" is a passion project picked-up by it's star Margot Robbie who produced the film under her production company LuckyChap Entertainment. In a Q&A session with the actress, cast members, and filmmakers of ""I, Tonya,"" Robbie stated that she had started the LuckyChap company to promote more opportunities in films for women.<br/><br/>During the Q&A, Robbie stated, ""reading this script was was not only the most original, there were also a number of incredible female leads (characters)."" The script broke every rule and had a rebellious nature. Robbie said she didn't know that the story was true at first (Robbie was four-years-old when it happened).<br/><br/>Tonya Harding, who introduced herself in the movie as a matter-of-fact way, ""growing-up poor or being a redneck which is what I am."" She was, in fact, the first U.S. woman to land a triple axle. But, unfortunately, had a tumultuous relationship with the Olympic judges which is also depicted in this fact-based moive. Because there are only three women in the world who can land a triple-axel, Harding being one, director Gillespie said they used CGI to bring the stunt to screen.<br/><br/>""I, Tonya"" is based on the true-life events of Olympian ice-skater Tonya Harding of what drove her to conspire against her lead opponent at the time, Nancy Kerrigan. Set-up in a mockumentary with a splash of real-life like interviews, ""I, Tonya"" is reminiscent of another film that was released in 1995 (ironically, one year before the real life Harding and Kerrigan incident) ""To Die For"" which starred Nicole Kidman and Matt Dillon, also based on a true story.<br/><br/>Unique in itself, ""I, Tonya"" as stated by its director, is a movie that breaks the fourth wall - all the characters are very rebellious. ""I wanted the script to mirror that."" In that, audiences see the characters addressing things like the script, the cameras and are very aware of the filming of the movie, which is done in a documentary style. Also, as a viewer, it's refreshing when the characters, who are clearly aware that they are playing real-life people, turn to the camera to confirm scenes that they are acting-out by stating ""this really happened."" Okay! Great! I was wondering that!<br/><br/>Similar to other movies like it, i.e. - ""To Die For"", ""Borat"", ""Best in Show"", ""This is Spinal Tap"" - ""I, Tonya"", while a very entertaining film, has it's flaws. One of which is having star Margot Robbie also play her Tonya character as a teenager. Sorry, it just wasn't believeable. Unless it was part of the gag. Also, distracting and unbelieveable was having the same actor play Jeff Gillooly, Harding's boyfriend, as a 17-year-old, who actually looked like an older man she was dating. Again, maybe it was part of the movie's many underlying jokes. Perhaps it's their characters who are reflecting on the events, re-enacting themsleves in their own minds eyes.<br/><br/>Because I feel like I've seen this movie before with a combinatin of the actual events as they transpired and in movies like ""To Die For"", ""I, Tonya"" was a bit of a let-down. But, for those who are too young to remember either of these, the movie will be quite an entertaining and original treat. A few things that weren't let-downs were scene-stealing peformances by actors Allison Janney (LaVona, Tonya's mother) and Paul Walter Hauser (Shawn Eckardt, Tonya's bodyguard).<br/><br/>Interesting enough though, is how the movie also addresses the fact that for those who were alive and living in America at the time, will remember the Tonya Harding and Nancy Karrigan incident differently. Most people, as the movie points-out, remembers it going down with Tonya hitting Nancy's knee with a crow bar herself. Not true! Others, will remember the incident happening at the Olympics. Also, not true!"

Tonya Harding (Margot Robie)<br/><br/>Director Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya may change the way you view Tonya Harding. This gritty docudrama chronicles the life of the competitive skater who worked a lifetime to become a member of the Olympic team only to see the dream shattered by her ex, Jeff (Sebastian Stan) in the now infamous assault on superior skater Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver).<br/><br/>Although Tonya admits to coming from ""white trash,"" she dreams of entering a world that mostly coddles to girls from proper families, hardly a term for the Hardings. Their incessant smoking and Eskimo-Pie eating are small reminders of how difficult she would have it in the culturally rarefied world of Olympic competition.<br/><br/>Tonya displays an astounding naivetÃ© as she places her confidence in boyfriend turned abusive husband, Jeff (Sebastian Stan). No question she knew he wanted to harass competitor Kerrigan through the mails, but she doesn't seem to have sanctioned assaulting her. Harding's hard shell makes it difficult to sympathize with her nevertheless. <br/><br/>The crux of this revealing and ultimately sympathetic chronicle is that Harding, as bluntly competitive and rough as she is, is easily buffeted by her rude mother, La Vona (Allison Janney), whose drill sergeant ways and seeming lack of love set up Tonya for feelings of inadequacy for the Olympics and life.
 
The action of the film, well known for anyone aware of the turbulent 90's and Harding, arguably, as she says, secondly famous only to Bill Clinton, doesn't play as well as other docs that keep the audience on edge but eager for more. Harding is deeply in need of real love, a circumstance that gives the film less suspense than that of a more stable hero. I might even be challenged calling her a ""hero."""

The film was good because it wasnt your typical straight forward biopic drama, no it was a fresh, foul mouthed comedy with some little thriller elements and of course some tragic turns as well. It was film to really give Margot Robbie the chance to put out all her acting weapons and boy did she deliver! This is so far the role of her life and she deserves every kudos she receives for it. I am sure this will not only end up with an Oscar nomination but also with one of the top candidates for the Best Actress Oscar. Excellent and brave performance. Funny, tragic, sad and always with a bad mouth. Allison Janney was just as good. Sure it already was a showy part to begin with but Janney even put something on top. You never knew if you should just straight up hate her or if there is something good in her. Very cynical, very sarcastic performance. Unlike everything Janney ever did on that level and one of the best performances of this year. She really owned every scene she was in (although some scenes were stolen by her bird). Sebastian Stan was okay but couldn't stand himself too well against those two powerhousse women. The soundtrack was excellent, the direction fine and I really liked the script."
