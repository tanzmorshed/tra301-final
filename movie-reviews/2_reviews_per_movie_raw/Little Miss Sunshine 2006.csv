"imaginarytruths","8","353","457","26 July 2006"," a scathing black comedy that is also emotionally resonant, pro-family, and joy-inducing
","I hate to admit it, but my primary interest in showing up for the screening was to see Steve Carell try his hand at a semi-serious role as the suicidal gay literature professor.<br/><br/>But it's not Steve Carell's film. It's a startling departure for him, a nuanced and heartfelt performance that's just as strong as his career-making turn in 40 Year Old Virgin. Likewise, this film does not in any way belong to Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, or Alan Arkin, all of whom are at the absolute top of their games and each of whom is allowed many moments within the ensemble structure to create a complex and compelling character. Hell, the film doesn't even belong to Paul Dano, who's just as good as his more experienced co-stars even though he doesn't have a single line of dialogue in the first 80% of the movie. <br/><br/>No, this film is owned wholly and entirely by a nine-year-old actress named Abigail Breslin. I think a lot of viewers might miss it because she's surrounded by enormously talented performers and is ""golly gee whiz"" ""aw shucks"" cute, but this performance is, all hyperbole aside, Oscarworthy. The entire film hangs on her emotional vulnerability and she is achingly real in every moment of joy, sorrow, confusion, desolation, and determination. The closest comparison I can think of is Amy Adams in Junebug. She's that good.<br/><br/>OK, I seem to be writing this review backwards. Let's see if I can pull together a plot description. The film is basically a dark comedy dysfunctional family road trip. It starts out resoundingly bleak. Richard (Kinnear) is a wannabe motivational speaker who in his desperate drive for excellence has become deeply alienated from his family. His wife Sheryl (Collette) tries to keep their family together but is so frustrated with her husband and nerve- shredded by the stresses of her home that it seems like she will cave in at any moment. Also in the home is Steve's elderly father, who is perpetually profane and angry and copes with the disappointments of his life by snorting heroin. Richard and Sheryl are raising two children, the cute but seemingly unremarkable Olive (Breslin) and the perpetually silent, glum, and angry Dwayne (Dano), who is marking off the days until he can go join the Air Force and escape this familial hellhole. Into this enclave of joy and bliss enters Sheryl's brother Frank, who has just been released from the hospital after trying to slit his wrists due to his unrequited love for one of his grad students. When Sheryl tells her brother that she's glad he's alive, he tonelessly responds ""that makes one of us."" <br/><br/>These are the characters. I know they must seem like pathetic indie stereotypes, but over the course of the film each of them is revealed as a multi-dimensional person struggling miserably but nobly to make the best of a life that is not working out the way they had hoped. And despite the gloomy set-up, this twisted thing becomes the most life-affirming film I've seen since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect film by any means. At times it feels a little contrived, as if several years of trauma were compressed into two days. And while the climax undeniably represents the most ruthless skewering of beauty pageants in the history of cinema, skewering beauty pageants doesn't in itself really qualify as daring satire.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film packs an emotional wallop that's going to take a lot of people by surprise.<br/><br/>And I haven't even mentioned that it happens to be the funniest movie of the year."
"cchase","9","385","514","26 July 2006"," One Of The Best Movie ""Gifts"" I've Gotten This Year...
","It is very rare to see a movie that can charm the hell out of an audience without the use of special effects, worn-out clich√©s and bombastic action set pieces these days. It's even more ridiculous to hope that you will see such a film for FREE. But that's exactly what happened to me tonight at a sneak preview of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.<br/><br/>I ""discovered"" this movie right here at IMDb, having heard not a peep about it beforehand. By the time I finished watching the second trailer for the THIRD time, I was floored...and hooked. Luckily, the Bulletin Boards steered me toward the proper link to access sneak passes for tonight's showing, and all I can say is that it will not pain me one bit to pay for the privilege of seeing this gem a second time.<br/><br/>Assembling the best and most unlikeliest of ensemble casts you may probably see all year, SUNSHINE on the face of it is a relatively (pun intended) simple story. Little seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) has one wish in life: to be considered for the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in Redondo Beach, CA. When her big chance comes at the most unexpected time, it's up to her unbelievably fractured family to pull themselves together and make it happen for her, no matter what it takes.<br/><br/>And what it takes is a sad, painful, tragic and yet unendingly hilarious trek in a barely operational VW bus from Albequerque, NM to the Pageant. And although getting there is only half the fun and family drama, you have got to see what happens to believe it when they finally arrive and Olive gets to ""do her thing."" The strong cast sounds not a single false note, and when the more touching moments arrive, they don't seem forced the way they would in most other big-budget behemoths, because these moments are truly earned. But WHAT a collection of characters this is. Greg Kinnear is letter-perfect as Olive's judgmental, failed motivational-speaker father; Steve Carell finds new shades of darkest despair and human comedy as her suicidal gay uncle, a leading Proust scholar; Paul Dano does amazing things with little more than facial expressions as Olive's older brother who's deep into Nietzche and a vow of absolute silence, and Alan Arkin, though he has played this kind of role with both hands tied behind his back and his eyes closed, still shines like a crazy diamond as her cantankerous and hedonistic grandfather.<br/><br/>And barely holding this motley crew together is Toni Collette, who amazes by playing a mother again and yet manages not to portray the role exactly the same way, (you might recall her Oscar-nominated turn as Haley Joel Osment's put-upon mom in THE SIXTH SENSE.) I'm not at all familiar with the work of the two directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer, Michael Arndt, but they have definitely raised the indie film bar with this effort. Not a single moment is wasted; not a single scene is in this film without having a reason for being there, and it's all character-driven. There's also nothing fluffy about it - commentary about everything from how twisted our pop culture can be, to how our drive for being #1 winners can blind us to all of the things that are the most important are all there under the bittersweet laughs and tears for the audience to discover.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this one highly enough. And I can't wait to see it again."
"MatthewInSydney","9","351","471","22 June 2006"," A highly enjoyable ensemble road movie - funny stuff
","I saw Little Miss Sunshine a week ago at the Sydney Film Festival, and the audience I saw it with loved it. There was a lot of laughter going on - especially at the hilarious ending. And amidst the jokes it deals smartly with it's theme of the value of chasing your dreams and being one of life's 'winners' versus valuing what you already have. Or put another way, it celebrates the joys of losing in a culture obsessed with winning.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into detail about the plot, as the film hasn't been widely released yet. There are no huge plots twists, but I think you'll have more fun with this film if you don't know exactly where it's going.<br/><br/>As the film started I wasn't so sure about it. All the characters (apart from Toni Colette's perhaps) seemed to be written as being amusingly quirky in a predictable indie-comedy way. But as the movie went on it became easier to warm to them. I think it helped that the actors appeared to be having genuine fun together. These guys don't feel like much of a family at first, and I wondered a couple of times why these people would bother sticking together, but as things progress the strengths of this particular family unit become obvious. And just as all comedies should, it gets funnier as it goes on. I was pleased to see the script stayed true to it's messages all the way to the end, and didn't turn preachy or maudlin. The whole cast work excellently together, and I hope this film has all the success it deserves once it's released."
"aharmas","9","341","469","7 July 2006"," More than a fresh ray of sunshine!
","Here is a film that lives up to the expectations of a very funny trailer. It's an oddball comedy, and it's dark, and it's funny, and it's touching, and it will charm the pants off many in the audience. Here is a simple story in which our lovely contestant and her family try to find their way to California so that she can prove to the world she is not a loser! The premise itself can lead to years of therapy for a family that should get a group rate in psychiatric care.<br/><br/>Expert editing and superb comedic performances from all the principals involved will have many overlook the fact that the plot line is a little too contrived at times. The set pieces will have the audience howling with laughter as we see different characters trying to overcome some pretty irreverent obstacles. The scene at the gas station contains moments of deep sadness and offbeat humor, something that Carrell pulls off wonderfully, and none will be able to look at the trunk of a car, some dubious literary material, and highway patrol the same way after seeing the infamous scene in the film.<br/><br/>The best is of course, saved for last, and by this time we are waiting for something outrageous which ""Little Miss Sunshine"" delivers unapologetically. A classic track will probably be recharged for a new generation, as the bonds of family precariously balance a moment that could be as tacky as they come.<br/><br/>""Sunshine"" is one of the best things to come out of American cinema this year, an original film that relies on a script that understands the differences between generations in the same family. It doesn't explain why each character is as quirky as can be, and it doesn't build much background because it is not needed to make the film work. Kinnear, Colette, Abigail, Arkin, and Correll are a fine team and keep the film's feel fresh throughout the film. Here is a family that has no special qualities or powers, a family that will make us rejoice that creativity is still alive in Hollywood, a film that will provide us with plenty of much needed sunshine in an otherwise pretty dull summer."
"Monotreme02","8","186","254","2 December 2006"," delivers in the most charmingly sweet, pure, honest, and innocent way
","It would be unfair to limit the film to one adjective. But charming is the first one that comes to mind. I really don't know how they did it, but the screenwriter Michael Arndt and directing team Dayton/Faris (Jonathan and Valerie, that is) have managed to create a movie in which we are simply so connected to the characters it's frightening. This is a very quirky bunch, and while their traits can be found in everyone we know, they are certainly extremely weird and I certainly don't know any families who are quite as odd as the Hoovers. And yet, we forge such a strong bond with each and every one of them, right from the opening pre-title introduction sequence ¬ñ probably the best character introduction sequence I've seen since Magnolia. These people are just so real! It's unbelievable just how three-dimensional these characters are. They remind me of The Squid and the Whale ¬ñ another recent movie that comes to mind when I think of this type of character development ¬ñ these are just normal, regular people, and the filmmakers developed them as such in the most in-depth, well thought-out and just ingenious way possible.<br/><br/>That brings me to the second adjective: Realism. If you've seen the film you know that some pretty wacky things go on in it, but in the end, these people are just plain real. They are real human beings ¬ñ at least we the viewing audience come to believe. If they weren't so incredibly well thought out and detailed and rounded, we wouldn't forge such a strong bond with them. But fact of the matter is, the Hoovers have quickly become one of the most memorable cinematic families. Their traits. Their flaws. Their dreams and ambitions. Their dynamics, mannerisms, nuances. Every tiny little detail about these people is just so incredibly portrayed.<br/><br/>Obviously, it would be unfair to say that a comedy isn't funny. When Little Miss Sunshine gets funny, it's hilarious ¬ñ we're talking pitch-black dark and very quirky comedy, but it works admirably, reaching sort of a peak in the infamous, hilarious and totally wacky traffic cop scene.<br/><br/>The acting is. Simply put, amazing. You won't see any Oscar moments here, no characters that have some particular traits that require various forms of ""method acting"" to perform. This is simply actors playing a bunch of people who they are clearly quite unlike, but playing them as if they are. The shining star is young Abigail Breslin, who out-acts pretty much all of her older cast-mates. How she can embody a completely other character at such a young age is completely beyond me ¬ñ and she's been doing it since age 6! Dakota Fanning, watch out! Paul Dano, the other young actor, also delivers an amazing performance. Myself being fresh out of that period of my life, I can say that his portrayal of a frustrated teenager ¬ñ specifically in the scene where he just explodes (those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about) is just so true and realistic. Arkin is brilliant as the old grandfather, who is at once quite annoying and vulgar and at once the most human of all the characters. The three adult leads also deliver wonderful, nuanced performances ¬ñ Toni Colette, who has quite a streak of wonderful performances in various films, particularly impressed me.<br/><br/>But what makes the film so special is its message ¬ñ and even more so, how it delivers it. Basically, the film's message can be summed up in one brilliant line delivered by Arkin's character, Grandpa Edwin: ""A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try."" This is a family who see tragedy after failure after disappointment, and it's just so, so sad to see them so down, because we love them all and we know that they don't deserve it, despite all their flaws. Seriously, this movie is absolutely brutal to its characters. But ultimately, it's absolutely inspiring. Because despite disappointment after tragedy after blow to the stomach, this family just keeps their head up and say ""so what; we'll find another way"". Their determination and devotion despite all the obstacles in their way, and their ultimate removal from their anxieties and un-winding is simply and absolutely inspirational, and extremely heartwarming.<br/><br/>The flaw of many independent films that carry a message is that they insist upon themselves. Sometimes it works admirably ¬ñ a recent example I can recall is The Fountain; it's undeniably pretentious, but by fulfilling its own expectations it works as a message film. Little Miss Sunshine delivers its message in simply the most incredibly, charmingly sweet, pure, honest, and innocent way you could ever imagine. It's just so¬Ö pure. And that's really the single most engaging and appealing aspect of what is already an amazing piece of work."
"boredhousewife-1","10","500","733","5 July 2006"," The story of a young girl who wants to be in a beauty pageant.
","I went to a screening of this film at Sundance earlier this year, and this is what I wrote about it immediately following:<br/><br/>This was a little less indie, cast-wise, but was jarringly real in a way that Hollywood rarely fosters. The story is of a limply-functional family, whose good leg is dysfunctional, and of the way that their love for each other is solid, somewhere underneath the varying shades of crazy. This film. Oh, this film! I have never laughed harder, and at such true-to-life comedy--nothing silly or goofy or forced or fake about the lines. It felt more like watching a documentary (minus all the familiar faces) and every time the laughter became almost unbearable, a little dash of agony or melancholic sadness was thrown in, and spawned aching tears. I sigh still, thinking of how completely in control of my insides that cast, that writer, that director all were. They owned my ass, and I will love them forever for it.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see it again. Do NOT miss it."

I laughed,I cried and laughed until I cried. I heard that this film only cost three million dollars to make...it just goes to show that tens of millions need not be spent to get a treasure. Go see it and be thoroughly entertained. This is one good old-fashioned movie for everyone over 13 (if you preempt the grandfather's language, which is really part of his character).

"ArizWldcat","9","259","397","10 February 2006"," Hilarious! I loved this fun, but slightly dark comedy
","We were happy to have had the chance to see this at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. I loved the cast: Greg Kinear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano and Steve Carrell were ALL marvelous as the dysfunctional family. Little Miss Sunshine refers to a pageant to be held in California (the movie never states where the family lives, but most of the road scenes were definitely in the Phoenix, Arizona area. (added 8/2/06: I know now that the movie is set in New Mexico, for those of you who are interested in that sort of thing!)<br/><br/>The story follows little Olive, a normal child, who by a fluke wins her way into the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The family decides they must accompany her in their old VW bus, so a road trip ensues.<br/><br/>The final third of the movie, which deals with the actual pageant, is by far the funniest part of the film. It illustrates, with great hilarity, the frightening people who are involved in child pageants. You can't help rooting for Olive, who is refreshingly normal amongst the frighteningly plastic other contestants.<br/><br/>(After discovering that I was in the (opposite of loved it) category on IMDb, I changed my subject line, because this was one of the best movies I've seen all year!! I LOVED IT)<br/><br/>This is NOT a movie for children. After reading through some other user comments, I have to say I'm dismayed by the amount of people complaining about the F word. This movie is rated R, mostly because of its frequent use of the F word, along with some drug use. If you do 5 minutes of research before you go to a movie, you should educate yourself as to WHY a movie is rated the way it is. If you are offended by swearing, then, if you go to a movie that is rated R because of language, be prepared to be offended! Okay, I'm off the soapbox. This is NOT a movie for children."
"Pavel-8","8","135","202","9 December 2006"," Probably the best comedy of 2006.
","Comedies about families usually come in one of two genres. Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy (""Cheaper by the Dozen"") or dark and abstruse (""The Royal Tenenbaums""). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is ""Little Miss Sunshine"", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.<br/><br/>The title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of ""Signs"") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.<br/><br/>But ""Sunshine"" is far more than the slapstick of ""Vacation"". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.<br/><br/>""Sunshine"" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.<br/><br/>Rather crude at times, ""Sunshine"" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10."
"jaredmobarak","9","177","270","20 August 2006"," A little sweet sweetness¬ÖLittle Miss Sunshine
","Keeping up with the recent buzz-worthy films coming out of Sundance the past couple years, Little Miss Sunshine is a gem of a movie. After loving crowd favorites Primer (2004) and Hustle and Flow (2005), I wasn't quite sure if the hat trick would be made. Sunshine seemed to have the cast, and direction (the debut of husband/wife team Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, who have helmed some of my favorite music videos including the Smashing Pumpkins' Tonight, Tonight and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Otherside), but the big question would be if it had the laughs to sustain the quirky indie comedy from not being overwrought and boring. While the film definitely has a couple moments where I was about to be lost, everything ends up happening for a reason; emotions are on a roller coaster ride and the lows always come out with meaning and momentum for the highs. Do yourself a favor and see this sweet, subtle at times and gut-bustingly hilarious at others, perfectly pitched ensemble piece.<br/><br/>The co-directors set us up for what is to come in a very nicely designed opening sequence by going character to character, showing us each person in a small vignette of their personalities. This is the quintessential messed-up family with good intentions. Mom and Dad are bickering on how to tell their young daughter about her uncle's attempted suicide, while he sits and stares in a strange melancholy next to the mute, troubled son, (on vow of silence in honor of nihilistic mind Nietzsche), while grandpa spews profanities about the lack of dinner variety. I mean this is the epitome of every family function I've ever been privy to. There is so much a viewer can relate to in each member, allowing for a certain amount of compassion for the views of all involved and seeing that each really does want the best for one another, even if they have a messed up way of showing it.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are wonderful as the patriarchs, proving as always that they are probably two of the most under-appreciated actors working today. Very rarely do you get to see them in a starring vehicle, and even though this is an ensemble through and through, they definitely carry it as the driving force. Alan Arkin does his kooky, quasi-angry, sarcastic yelling that he is known for, kind of his role from Edward Scissorhands but r-rated and un- pc. Everything he has done comes to a surprising result at the eponymous beauty pageant for the biggest laughs of the movie, really great stuff subverting the grotesque surrealism surrounding any pageant of this kind. Paul Dano is great as the troubled teen, trying to find a place in the world for himself, and coming to grips with the need for struggle in order to grow as a person, and Abigail Breslin is phenomenal as the happiest girl alive. Once she finds out she has won her regional on default, (those primary school children and their diet pills), she is on cloud nine as the family makes the road trip all for her. She has the acting range of a pro and actually does the Dakota Fanning, but better, as she can act while still being a young child and not an adult in a child's body. Her emotional reactions are spot-on and she has remarkable presence and a self-effacing nature that allows her to be who she is and not be ashamed about it, which is the main purpose of Olive Hoover.<br/><br/>The real revelation to take from the antics on screen is a career-role for funnyman Steve Carrell. I've always liked his na√Øve, teddy-bear persona used to successfully in the Daily Show, The Office, and as the only funny part of Anchorman. Here however, he shows that he has the acting chops to not be pigeonholed and typecast in the over-the-top, lug roles his peer Will Ferrell will never be able to breakout of. Carrell has genuine talent and his suicidal, top Proust scholar in America, uncle is the shining moment of the film. He maintains the dejected quality throughout; even when doing something for the family, doing good, he is always a beaten man. That kind of character is what is needed for all his sharp, dry sarcastic retorts thrown about. He barely outshines the prop of the year, though, the family's yellow VW van. You will not see better prop-gags as the van takes a licking and keeps on ticking although the tick is faint and slowly fading away.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine lives up to the strong buzz that surrounds it. It is heartwarming and funny at every turn. There are some dark moments, though, as there are in life. This film is a slice of reality, heightened just the right amount, for all to enjoy. While definitely in the vein of films such as I Heart Huckabees, Thumbsucker, and any Wes Anderson film¬óit wears its indie cred on its sleeve¬óit is still accessible and hopefully with the drawing power of Carrell will garner an audience that would not otherwise see it."

"jluis1984","9","23","32","20 December 2006"," A black comedy with a Little Big Heart
","The world of Independent film-making is definitely a tough one, as often the difficulties of getting a good budget or a good cast can become a difficult test to even the best directors. For that and many other reasons, it's always good to see a good independent films receiving the praise and recognition they deserve, proving that the support of a big studio is not necessary to make a product of high quality. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" certainly has been luckier than most Indies in terms of budget and cast, but it still is a modest black comedy that takes advantage of its own limitations and relaying only in great acting and a lot of heart, makes more than the hundreds of comedies the big studios make in a year.<br/><br/>The plot is the story of the Hoover family and their trip from New Mexico to California, in order to take their little daughter, Olvie (Abigail Breslin), to the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. However, the Hoovers are not a very functional family, the father, Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a neurotic motivational speaker obsessed with winning, so immersed on his book that is barely in contact with his wife, Sheryl (Toni Collette), and always is arguing with his own father (Alan Arkin). Sheryl is no less neurotic than her husband, and her troubles increases as her brother Frank (Steve Carell), a literature professor, recently attempted to commit suicide and is now stuck at the Hoovers' place. Dwayne (Paul Dano), Sheryl's teenager son, is the mute (by his own choice) witness of this debacle, as he tries to live enough to get out of the house and make his dream come true: to be a jet fighter pilot. The road trip will prove to be a test not only to Olive, but for the rest of the family.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the very first work by writer Michael Arndt, and for the most part he makes an amazing job in setting up what's basically a character driven road movie. Arndt's script may not be very original (and that's probably the film's biggest problem), but he uses the conventions of his genre in a very clever way, mainly by focusing on his different characters and letting them and their own personal stories to carry the main plot. This approach to the character development makes it so realistic that one can't help but feel identified with at least one of the Hoovers. Sure, it's an overtly exaggerated portrait of that dysfunctional yet lovable family we all have, but this delicious black comedy it's done with such charm and heart that it actually works, and even makes the story feel fresh despite not having a really original plot.<br/><br/>This movie not only marks Arndt's debut as a writer, it's also the first feature film by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, a team of music directors famed for their work with rock bands across the 90s. It's kind of surprising that, unlike most former music video directors, their transition to film comes with a really subtle film that focuses on the plot and the characters instead of the visuals. However, this doesn't mean that visually the film is unpleasing, on the contrary, it features an excellent cinematography (Tim Suhrstedt) coupled with a subtle score by Mychael Danna and Devotchka that work perfectly to set the tone and mood of Arndt's little story. The subtle approach taken by the Dayton-Faris tandem succeeds in giving life to this charming story by letting the actors to completely own their characters and be the most important part of the film.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine""'s magic would not be possible without one of the best assembled cast in years. The entire group of actors that play the Hoover family really show big chemistry together and deliver a believable portrait of this dysfunctional family. Starting with Greg Kinnear, who makes the best of a character that easily could had been a two-dimensional cartoon. Toni Collette really shines in her role, and is one of the film's best surprises. The experienced Alan Arkin tackles with dignity and funny enthusiasm on the role of the grandfather, delivering another of his excellent performances. Steve Carell proves that he is more than a mere comedian in a complicated, yet essential role for the film. Abigail Breslin is literally the film's heart, bringing her spark to the film in a wonderful performance. Comparatively, Paul Dano comes up as the weakest link, but that has more to do with the high quality of his cast-mates, as his work is still effective and worth of praise on its own.<br/><br/>Many have criticized the way ""Little Miss Sunshine"" remains too close to the road movie formula and its use of overused clich√©s, however I find that to be unfairly harsh, as well as misdirected, as it's not really the plot what matters in the end, it's how the characters react to the situations that this trip presents them. Exaggerated or not, the characterizations are really believable, and that's the element that makes the film to stand out among other similar films. The characters here do have a soul, and as the family gather the necessary strength to push the old VW van, they gather the courage to overcome their inner personal demons. While probably predictable, few movies of this optimistic feel good style could carry its plot keeping the same energy from beginning to end.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the little big surprise of 2006, a black comedy that attempted to do a lot with very little, and that for the most part succeeded in its attempt. The young talent here shows a lot of promise, and hopefully will keep delivering works as good as this one in the future. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" may not be the most original film of the world, but this little jewel can easily be considered among the best of the year. 8/10"

What makes the film even more impressive is the outstanding ensemble cast that captures every moment of comedy in such a twisted manner that you almost feel guilt for finding the absolute hilarity in their mixed up and disturbed road trip. On top of that co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are long time partners who have pioneered direction in music videos and documentaries but never truly a feature film and yet they smash one out of the park with this incredible story.<br/><br/>In essence everyone in this film is a ""supporting actor"" because no one character is more important than the other or more featured. They all have this goal and this way of supporting each other's brilliant performances and ironically the one actor to be nominated for a Golden Globe, I thought, was one of the weaker characters and roles. Greg Kinnear is Richard in another brilliant turn as a character actor for Kinnear. Richard is pig headed, stubborn, well meaning but very demeaning at the same time. He doesn't realize the importance of his family and yet he strives and struggles to do the best by them. This is hands down his best role since ""As Good As It Gets"" and he still shows he can pull off a powerful performance. Impressive as well is the young Paul Dano who plays emotionally tortured and self inflicted teenager Dwayne who has taken a vow of silence until he completes his life goal of joining the air force and flying. Dano captures the tortured teen perfectly and considering he has fewer lines than any other character he has to rely on his body language and talent to carry the role and he does that wonderfully. He also puts forth some of the really emotional parts in the film and I think he should be recognized for his brilliant part. Steve Carell....STEVE CARELL...well as many truly great comedians do (ie: Robin Williams, Will Smith, Jim Carey etc.) Carell finds the role that might show the world he is far more than a slapstick comedian and he really can't hold a serious role. His role is the best in this film hands down. It's more of a subtle performance as Frank, the suicidal, brilliant and gay brother-in-law/brother who is forced to go on the trip because he is on suicide watch. He immediately bonds with the tortured soul of Dwayne, plays provocateur to the overly emotional Richard and ultimately teaches each member of the family something. This is hands down an amazing feat for Carell who should get an Academy Award nomination for this part!! He never breaks the drama to show off a funny side except to be ironic and satirical the way the movie needs to be. Multi-Oscar and Emmy nominated actor Alan Arkin plays the rough and rugged Grandpa who is soft at the core and loves his family dearly but has many regrets about his life. His crazy antics, foul mouth and love for women makes him absolutely hilarious and an outstanding addition to the cast. Arkin is spectacular. And there is young Abigail Breslin who already has an impressive resume of performances including her debut which was in M. Night Shyamalan's Signs where she did an outstanding job. She further proves her young acting ability by playing the baby of the family, Olive whose desire more than anything else in the world is to be in the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. She is the soul of the family in many ways and she is the reason of the trip and ultimately she is the one that brings them all together in the hilarious, unbelievable climax. She does a terrific job!! Finally Toni Collette plays the disenchanted mother Sheryl and I don't mean to downplay her performance but I don't think the character is as strong as some of the others and therefore her performance suffers but she got the Golden Globe nod so what do I know?? As the head of the family desperately trying to hold everyone together and bring some sense of normality to their lives she seems almost like she's falling apart but we don't really get to look too much into that.<br/><br/>So very few films could pull off being so touching and dark and yet make you howl with laughter so loudly. It is such an incredible road trip film that does without special effects, unrealistic, silly premise or anything else but relies on an incredible cast, a real story, and something and someones that anyone could relate to. It's truly the ultimate story of a wacky family that just loves each other and sticks together. If nothing else the climax of the film when Olive performs at the pageant just might become an instant classic moment in film history and will have you laughing to tears. Everyone and anyone could enjoy this movie and is sure to be an instant classic!! 10/10"

","Little Miss Sunshine review<br/><br/>People see film to be entertained and forget about life for a bit. Other go only for thrill of what going to happen next, others go to fell in love again with their couple. But there certain crowd that growing increasingly this few years this crowd goes to the theater to be blow away not for big explosion or insane car chases. But With imaginative clever design that is rarely shown every year I I included in this group. Every year few movies cause that impact on this people last year was Slumdog Millionaires, the year before Juno the incredible story of pregnant women trying to live life as simple as possible. This movie captures the attention and imagination of millions not because of heart pumping action, laughter or anything between. The reason is so simple clever writing and excellent direction that so few can achieve.This category movies are view like art not like a piece of entertainment. Back in 2006 a movie emerge from nowhere, it came from the most unexpected places. That movie is called little miss sunshine. At first it looks like different movie with no impact that was fairly common in this time, it took the theme of a dysfunctional family that isn't a common theme for many reason. One of the reasons is not so easy to elaborate but that wasn't for screenwriter Michael Arndt, many say that it was taken from his life and that all character where from there he, himself confirmed that when he won the Oscar for best original screenplay. Little miss sunshine went and sold 100 millions worldwide, in the united state it sold 59.8 million , from that standard this movie sold really well because the movie budget was only 8 millions and it was sold to fox search line for 10.5 to recover all it production money. But no one expected to be such a success this movie was nominated for 4 Oscars of those it won 2 of them including best original screen play and best actor in support ion role and many more prizes. This movie was so usefully for many reason one was the excellent cinematography, the great cast that all of them where Oscar worthy and from my stand point by far was the best movie in 2006.<br/><br/>But what make this movie truly epic was the sincerity in part from all the cast, especially the connexion between the grandfather and Olive Hoover that you can feel the bond between the two of them. Also Steve Carell give and outstanding performance he demonstrated to everyone that he can make comedy but he can excellent piece of dramas. The direction in this movie was truly outstanding it unique feels is like nothing you ever seen before. The original score of the movie give it a flavor and taste that was truly remarkable. To sum up little miss sunshine is by far the best movie of 2006 it was worthy of every it was nominated but sadly the academy are more commercial than true critics. This movie taught us something that we don't to see picture of fantasy or adventure to be truly amazed like most of the people think. But the true story that causes an impact in our heart hearts are the ones that comes that come from the real life mix up with some clever ideas that to me is little miss sunshine is one of the best achievement in cinemas of all time.<br/><br/>--Goyolap"

","Most people have commented on the brilliance of the acting in this movie. I agree with all they said. Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear and Alan Arkin are as good as we would expect them to be. Add sensitive and characterful performances from Paul Dano & Steve Carell. Spotlight the amazing Abigail Breslin as a believable little girl trying to break into the Child Glamour Business through pageants like ""Little Miss Sunshine."" It was when I contrasted her less than movie-star appearance with all the adult-glam of the other lacquered and made-up girls that I realized the subliminal message here.<br/><br/>Olive's striptease is an honest (but disturbing) expose of what these pageants really are. It's only when Olive's family join her in making this into a game that we can begin cheering for her while being horrified by the hypocrisy of the whole pageant-thing.<br/><br/>A brilliant movie!"

Movies are not supposed to take two hours of my life and leave me feeling vacant and hopeless. I want to spend those two hours with good people who are flawed, like those in my life I love most.<br/><br/>That's what Little Miss Sunshine has, and much more. In the beginning, you won't be sure whether you like anyone. By the end of the movie, you'll wish they were real so you could get to know them better. Their history and their dreams about the future. Bravo, Michael Arndt, for creating something truly memorable."
"pookey56","10","16","23","19 December 2006"," a bright, sun-shiny day....
","Little Miss Sunshine is a bright, gentile, sweet-spirited film with an outstanding ensemble cast and a fresh and enchanting screen play by Michael Arndt. I have nothing but respect for Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, and Steve Carell; and Paul Dano, whom i remember from his small stint on THE SOPRANOS, and Abigail Breslin, with such raw and natural talent, are fresh and flawless additions to this amazing mix of actors. Dano spoke volumes about his character with a minimum of words. These characters are flawed, complex, and fully fleshed with idiosyncrasies and quirks that we can relate to, characters we have probably met or perhaps are ourselves, part of the charm of this movie. Alan Arkin left the film all too soon, but he is memorable and likable,like all of the principals in this adventure. i took a road trip across Canada a long time ago in a Volkswagen van, and the landscape and ambiance, the lay of the land, brought back some great memories. The unexpected happens and the good times too. These are real people with intriguing personalities, and the getting there, is most of the fun. There is physical comedy here too, subtle and funny. When they finally arrive at the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant, there are girls dressed in glittery outfits, primped and excited. And yet, i didn't get the feeling that they were being exploited, nor that their dreams of being beauty queens were derided. The twelve little contestants were hilarious, and with the exception of Olive, were already seasoned pros. The MC was hilariously terrifying with his glib parody and terrible singing voice. Dano says, ""i don't want these people judging Olive"". And really, who could disagree with him? but in the end, this was Olive's dream, and she's entitled to them. Olive's dance was a tribute to her grandfather, and a tribute to the sheer joys of life. Shake up the conventional, kids. Put that fly in the ointment. Little Miss Sunshine is an absolute joy. We can all get behind a dream, and the dreams of our loved ones. We don't always have to win, as long as we enjoy the journey. And if we keep our individuality and our sincerity, then, we are winners. i loved this film. Proust, nihilism, brilliance, support, and joy...i have to admire how Dayton, Feris and Arndt mixed that concoction together in such fine fashion. warning*** if you think you are ""normal"" and that there is no dysfunction in your family; if you prefer big-budget action films;if you have LITTLE MAN, THE ANIMAL, and WHITE CHICKS in your DVD library; if small films which succeed despite everything doesn't interest you; or if you are mildly offended by subtle smarts, and familiar themes even when performed and produced exceptionally well, all of this is OK. For me, this is the message i received from this wonderful film. Be your glorious self. Life is a wild ride. I'm guessing this film wins best original screenplay at most of the awards this season. brace yourself, because Abigail has a shot here too, along with the venerable Alan Arkin...actually, simply a great ensemble cast."
"MarkOConnell","Null","119","216","26 February 2007"," Thank God it didn't win best picture!
","There is some sanity after all: LMS didn't win best picture.<br/><br/>I have read a lot of the negative comments here and agree with most: gags ripped-off from ""National Lampoon's Vacation""; the sickening, cynical, hypocritical final act; and of course, the fact that it's Just Not Funny. All shameless, glaring flaws.<br/><br/>I could add a few more: the clumsy plotting, for one. Did you think for one second that the Dad's book deal was going to go through? The outcome of that story was telegraphed five minutes into the film. Did you really believe that no one in the family besides Grandpa had any idea what Olive's big act consisted of before piling into the van to drive to the competition? Did you buy for a moment that the object of Steve Carell's affection just happened to walk into the same mini-mart in the middle of noweheresville, Arizona? Or that the traffic cop would react the way he did to the porn magazines? Or that the entire family would stand like stumps on the roadside as the teenage son had his screaming fit about not getting into the air force? Or that a kid like that would even WANT to get into the air force?? (By the way, why would you cast Toni Collette, the most talented actress in the business, and then give her absolutely nothing to do??) <br/><br/>All of which leads to the movie's biggest sin... It's one thing to create a family of dysfunctional misfits and then lead them through trial and redemption, but it only works if the writer and director(s) treat those characters with affection and respect. But there was none of that in LMS; both the writer and directors treated the characters with utter contempt from the first frame to the last. They created a family of dysfunctional nit-wit stereotypes, and then threw crap at them for 90 minutes and expected us to laugh.<br/><br/>I know I'll get endless crap for this, but I don't really care. I don't see how anyone could watch the last act of LMS and not feel like they've just been barfed on."

","I have to admit, I was drawn to this movie because of the great cast and a lot of positive word of mouth. I watched the movie in a very good mood and when it was over, I said, what is the big deal? I did not laugh, I did not cry, I did not feel anything, except that I had seen this movie a dozen or more times already. It really was nothing special. Arkin's comedic performance was a rehashed role that I have seen others play. I remember a film called ""Flirting With Disaster"" which was kind of a road movie as well, it was better than this. ""Raising Arizona"" was much funnier than this. The so-called side-splitting ending with the dance to Super Freak was so tipped in commercials that you knew what was coming. Moreover, the dance just keeps going and going, it got so tedious and unfunny. I'm sorry, I don't want to be a cynic, but this film is just being played up way too much and I cannot believe that it was nominated for Best Picture, it was a weak year, but not that weak."
"herbqedi","1","106","197","23 January 2007"," Misanthropic road trip with dysfunctional family substitutes derision for wit
","Everyone I know and trust loved this movie and told me they howled with laughter. I simply do NOT get it. If you loved Borat and Napoleon Dynamite, you'll also love Little Miss Sunshine -- I suppose because they are both misanthropic comedies about stupid people. But even though I liked neither I will say that both had far better sight gags and funny albeit stupid lines than Little Miss Sunshine. Me, I really don't get the raves at all considering I think this is one of the 50 worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I don't find stupid people doing stupid things especially funny. I find hip pot-shots at easy targets that have been the targets of other hip comedies in the past even less funny. This movie is devoid of the delicious irony, politically savvy subtext, witty lines, or wry observations that would make a satire satirical. A wasted Alan Arkin whose physical vibrancy belies his character's supposedly frail physical condition is embarrassing to watch as a male version of Sophia of the Golden Girls who then dies in much the same way as Imogene Coca in Vacation. The ensuing problems of what to do with the body also are more crass and derisive than funny. Greg Kinnear plays the father as a cross between Bert Convy's character in Semi-Tough and Harrison Ford's character in The Mosquito Coast -- an obsessed and self-destructive self-help guru. What a novel idea, showing a self-help guru who cannot help himself, much less others, but cannot see it. That's all the humor allowed his character with no funny lines or development or delicious irony to make him interesting. The fact that Kinnear is such a good actor that he keeps struggling to find humor makes it all the more tedious. Steve Correll is making a different movie than everyone else, playing his gay, suicidal brother character absolutely straight (pun intended). I'm not a fan, but he's very good and is the only character that doesn't give the viewer the impression that he knows he's playing an object-of-scorn and derision. Toni Colette and the girl playing Olive do salvage a few funny moments at the Beauty Contest itself. But, by then, it was too late for me to care about any of the characters.<br/><br/>It must be a generational thing. I am a 50-year old male who knows what I find funny and this certainly was not it!"
"Lego_Darth","7","57","101","2 September 2006"," Nothing special
","Little Miss Sunshine was trying to be something it wasn't. It tried to be the amazing feel good dark comedy of the summer, however it just came off average. The problem isn't anyone thing, it just seems to have holes. There are truly beautiful moments, followed by really awkward moments. The acting is wonderful, but there doesn't seem to be an arc for any character; no one seems to progress at all. Steve Correll's(sorry for misspellings) character didn't slowly become less suicidal over the course of the plot, and Greg Kinnear's character seemed to become even more idiotic as time went on. The death of the grandfather and the bringing him along was taken straight from National Lampoon's Vacation, however, it was handled much differently, more serious. The only real character progression was in the character of Dwayne. His story was by far the most well put together. Yet, the setup in the beginning left you ready for a great ride. And, the acting was superb. There isn't any reason not to see this movie. Just don't get your hopes up. Come in with low expectations and you may be surprised."

"jboguslaw","2","98","185","25 August 2006"," Painfully Bland
","Now, my problems with the movie in question mostly deal with the fact that it appeared to me to be a painfully contrived and synthetic. Rather than focusing on the plot, characters, or themes, it appeared to me as though the filmmakers chose to put more effort to conform to what has been deemed aesthetically ""indie"". Through this, the characters as well as the situations in which they are placed are placed on the back burner.<br/><br/>It almost feels incorrect to me to refer to the individuals in the movie as characters. Granted, I walked into the movie knowing it was about a dysfunctional family. With that comes a certain amount of expectations. But the characters in it are hardly even two-dimensional. Their sole purpose is to advance the movie from one ""comedic"" situation to another. They have no other reason to exist.<br/><br/>We could talk about the importance of having situations not directly relating to the story of the movie to make the characters more vital, but I'd be willing to overlook it if the individuals were interesting. I did not find one of them to be of the slightest bit interest to me. The grandfather curses? Wow, that would have been funny twenty (maybe even more) years ago, but it is now a tired old joke. A failed motivational speaker who preaches that there is a definite and sure way to success coming to terms with his own imperfections? Brilliant! A suicidal man forced to leave a hospital because his insurance won't pay for him to stay there? I'll be honest, I do like the social commentary. But the sequences that follow (specifically involving the fact that the family does not use any glass at the dinner table) treat the audience as though we are as stupid as the poorly written villainous beauty pagent organizers.<br/><br/>The beauty pagent is just one of the many hackneyed situations that these ""characters"" find themselves poorly thrown into. When I say thrown into, I mean that the writers have abandoned logic in hopes of providing the audience with laughs. Of course, this aspect of ""believablity""can be overlooked so long as the omission provides the viewer with an intriguing and generally somewhat original situation (e.g. just about any Hitchcock movie).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the situations in this movie are of a sort that are very similar to any audience memeber. Perhaps the most blatantly common film occurrences of the movie is when an elderly family member dies. But wait, the other family can't dispose of their departed in the accepted fashion. This situation, down to a run-in with the law, is taken directly from National Lampoon's Vacation.<br/><br/>I have actually heard a person describe this movie as National Lampoon's Vacation for people who think they're too smart for National Lampoon's Vacation. I agree with that statement.<br/><br/>It did, like any movie, have certain somewhat redemptive qualities. Alan Arkin will never fail to be amusing at some point. That is a given. Also, Paul Dano gave a surprisingly good performance in spite of the limitations the role he had provided him with. I look forward to seeing him in other movies in the future. Probably the best part of the movie was when the characters need to rush towards the Volkswagen bus, which, I'm not going to lie, was one of the best sequences I've seen in a while (but not nearly enough to redeem the movie).<br/><br/>Of course, I'm not going to end this post in a positive way. I could point out so many more issues I had with the movie, but I'm just going to refer to the amount ""Oh, he's gay"" jokes that this movie had. Is it too much to ask for a character that is ""stagnantly"" gay?"

","Wow. <br/><br/>I'm stunned.<br/><br/>Every once in a while a movie comes along that is jaw-droppingly horrible to the point that it leaves your mouth hanging open. I lack sufficient terms to express how trite and repellent I find this simpering movie. It's an exhausted ""human spirit"" movie so cloying that it needs to be taken off life support. From the first time I saw the TV commercial which featured the hackneyed ruse of getting the whole family in one vehicle for the duration of a movie, I suspected the script would have difficulty making that premise believable. It certainly fails there, but that's the least of its problems. But still, the wealth of good reviews drew me to buy a ticket. My initial reservations were right. This script is an inept piece of garbage long before you evaluate it on moral grounds, where it collapses spectacularly.<br/><br/>The family here is a mix of characters so drippy and dense that they never realize their dumpy, uncoordinated, bespectacled daughter isn't the Junior Miss type. It takes them exactly one pageant (following a needless cross country trip) to figure that out. The same family doesn't realize that a heroin-snorting, horndog grandfather shouldn't be the one teaching their adolescent daughter her beauty pageant dance number. Why not go all the way and include a ""funny scene"" of grampa molesting her? The setup is practically there; a scene so distasteful feels like it's just off-screen (or on the cutting room floor) in this wholly objectionable movie.<br/><br/>Long after a ridiculously unbelievable ""chance meeting"" in a gas station, long after paper-deep villains have been thrown at the screen, long after the annoying Murphy's Law plot line is exhausted, comes the most sick, saccharine, crappy moment in all of film history which involves a family attempting to redeem their seven-year old daughters failed, inappropriate talent routine (a strip tease) by joining her on stage. Sexualizing a seven year old girl without her being developmentally able to understand it... mmm, that's comedy gold. This ""edgy material"" is about as palatable as a cup of bleach.<br/><br/>I'm not one to look for messages but here we've got something like ""Let's all support each other as we swim up the cr*p river of life!""<br/><br/>I'm sure it's supporters think I've missed the point and that the humor is just dark. It's not dark. Making a dark comedy is an art. This comedy has no edge in it's delivery. It's filmed straight. It's acted and presented ineptly. It's about as edgy as a smutty episode of Seventh Heaven. This is the rotten family-values homily to end them all. Drawing big saccharine payoffs to support a family values theme also places this squarely in mainstream whitebread entertainment.<br/><br/>It makes perfect sense that idiotic Hollywood would nominate this tripe for a bunch of Oscars, but I can't believe I respect people who like this atrocity. The Oscars have become so gratingly self-impressed, and the nominees so limp, that all you can really do anymore is root against films you don't want to have any further influence on the culture. I am so glad it lost the Best Picture award last night; Today it starts a long descent to the bottom of time's toilet, exactly where it belongs, where it will be forgotten."

Further, to nominate the little girl in the movie for an Oscar is a puzzle as well. Nothing that she did in the movie is award worthy, there are any number of children actors that act better and have done a better job in roles than she did, Will Smith's son in Pursuit of happiness for example.

I saw this film paired with ""Forbidden Games,"" which is a truly wonderful experience.<br/><br/>So here we are given a show that celebrates the cuteness of little girls and we are repulsed. But what have we been watching for over an hour? A family disaster that revolves around the cuteness of our little girl. Its a relentless cuteness show, which we allow in part because we know our actress has been made less ""pretty"" by over-sized glasses (another movie shortcut) and a prosthetic belly. But its cute that we are sold. <br/><br/>So in the damning at the end, I damned myself and felt dirty coming out. Movies do this a lot, especially teen movies that poke fun at teen humor and then have all the jokes dependent on that same humor. More clever ones do it with heavier subjects. ""American Psycho.""<br/><br/>But this is just too much. The writers give us an escape hatch. We can pretend it isn't cuteness and innocent charm, but a more prurient interest we are damning. The contestants we see do try to look sexy and our girl's routine is targeted at blowing that up. So we can pretend it is sex that is the reversal. But be honest. It isn't.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","Well done movie. The bus scenes were so funny. Definitely a bumpy ride, but worth it! Steve Carell as the number one Proust scholar was excellent. Paul Dano's anti-social Nietzche loving teenager was so impressive, his role for more than 3/4 of the movie involved no speaking. Toni Collette filled the role of Olive's mother-Sheryl beautifully. Greg Kinnear was perfect as the annoying emotionally disconnected dad. And Alan Arkin was the character that kicked it out of the mainstream all together. <br/><br/>I laughed so hard I cried, a clich√©, but its been a rare experience for me in the movies. <br/><br/>In the end Family-real life experience was what they discovered and won. The beauty pageant finale with Olive is going to be a classic, a send up on the insanity of primping or pimping little children right out of all childhood innocence. <br/><br/>Can't say more without giving something away."
"sbrizzi","5","45","87","3 September 2006"," Good Spirit Half Baked
","I'm disappointed that audiences are so easily wowed. This movie has some very funny lines and situations, some excellent acting, and a nice madcap sense of humor, but it's also very sloppy in places, blithely contriving a number of unlikely plot twists.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is pitch-perfect, particularly in the early scene where he describes his suicide attempt to Olive. Toni Collette is also good in a blah role. Abigail Breslin is a great find: totally believable and great at turning on the tears. Alan Arkin is funny but something's a little off in his performance; his foul mouth is a good idea but it feels contrived -- he's not senile, so it seems like his behavior should come across as motivated by anger or manipulation. It's odd that the family gets shocked by his language -- they must be used to it, and should have developed a mechanism for dealing with it. Paul Dano also feels surfacey, actory and inauthentic -- again, a wonderfully conceived role, but his performance needs something. Some kind of vulnerability maybe. Greg Kinnear on the other hand looks and feels the part and totally drew me in. His performance in the opening scene is possibly the best thing in the movie. The part is a bit one-note, but he transcends. Also there's an outstanding performance by Paula Newsome as Linda, the bitchy grievance counselor. Beth Grant is very good as the pageant official, and Matt Winston is perfect as the pageant MC.<br/><br/>Some people have complained about the family smuggling Grampa's body out of the hospital, but I believed they might do it, although they might have come closer to getting caught. But the lack of any real grieving beyond a few moist eyes strains belief and makes the family seem pretty callous. And the police officer picking up the porno mags in the back of the van but not noticing a great big sheet-covered body also feels unlikely. <br/><br/>Steve Carell running into his ex-lover and the Proust scholar who stole his thunder in a gas station somewhere in the Arizona desert is possibly the most contrived plot point in the history of film. And Paul Dano suddenly finding out that he's color-blind and Steve Carell somehow knowing that this means he must give up his dream of being a pilot -- and telling him so! -- runs a close second. Also Dano's reaction, immediately throwing a tantrum and giving up his vow of silence, doesn't seem realistic. I imagine it would take time for him to accept that everything he's been striving for has been lost; he wouldn't just take an adult's word for it. <br/><br/>There are many more such moments throughout the film that make me feel that the filmmakers should have spent a little more time on the script; messy little moments that took me out of a film that I wanted to like. Very irritating.<br/><br/>The production design is just outstanding. The very lived-in suburban house, Greg Kinnear's dad-wear, Paul Dano's angry-teenager art, everything is done with accuracy and style. The whole look of the Miss Sunshine Pageant is perfect. Gaudy, grotesque and hilarious.<br/><br/>That Olive's routine turns out to be a stripper's bump and grind is pretty great. I didn't see it coming and it totally made sense. It was nice that they teased it by showing Arkin teach her to do the tiger move early on, but again it should've somehow been established why no one else in the family had ever seen her practice. The pageant itself is wonderfully staged -- very realistic, up to the point where the whole family gets up on stage -- another feel-good moment unearned.<br/><br/>Another quibble: it's mentioned that the family is from Albuquerque, but I didn't get any sense of a regional culture from the way they spoke and acted.<br/><br/>I did like Steve Carell's anecdote about Proust, that the part of his life in which he struggled was the best part. And I also liked Greg Kinnear's line that the only losers are people that don't pursue their dreams because they're afraid of failing.<br/><br/>A fairly enjoyable movie but it could've been so much better."

","A father looking to sell a ""9-Step"" program, an avowed 'winner.' A beleaguered mother with unflagging hope in her daughter's potential. Her troubled, homosexual brother, fresh out of the hospital after a suicide attempt. A Nietzsche-obsessed brother who has taken a vow of silence. A porn-ogling, foul-mouthed grandfather regretful of having ""not f--ked a lot of women"" in his lifetime. A precocious little girl determined to be the winner of the titular pageant. If I had read a description like this, I would have written off ""Little Miss Sunshine"" without a second thought--it looks and sounds like a standard-issue, deliberately 'quirky' road-trip comedy where the standard-issue dysfunctional family bonds and learns an Important Lesson at the denouement. And you know what? It is. But it is also laugh-out-loud hilarious, brilliantly acted (would someone please give Steve Carell a Best Supporting Actor nod?), and genuinely moving (the climax made me want to laugh, cry, and cheer, all at the same time). The feature debut of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (known previous for music videos, including The Smashing Pumpkins' 'Tonight Tonight') plays with the style and attention to character of a Wes Anderson film (though with a lot less inhibition in its comedy), and the breezy humor and hard knocks of, say, ""The Squid and the Whale"" (another excellent dramedy). But any way you cut it, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is one of the most inspired films of the year...under a conventional-looking surface lies a tremendously moving experience."
"Pasafist","3","51","103","21 September 2006"," That's what this film needed, Uncle Eddie!
","Just before I sat down to watch the film LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE I was leafing through a copy of Douglas Adam's final anthology of writings called The Salmon of Doubt. In an article he wrote called ""Turncoat"" he mused ""I wonder if we don't have too much comedy these days...nowadays everybody's a comedian, even the weather girls... We laugh at everything. Not intelligently anymore, not with sudden shock, astonishment, or revelation, just relentlessly and meaninglessly."" After the movie was over I couldn't get that thought out of my head. Here is a film that attempts to be dark, attempts to be charming, attempts to be edgy, attempts to be independent, and is yet drops the ball because in the end it has nothing cohesive to say.<br/><br/>Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) is the cutest little kid in the world. The kind of kid who just looks at the world with wide-eyed wonder. She sweet even if the world around her isn't so. Her Dad (Greg Kinnear) is a bad motivational speaker and an even worse role model, her mom (Toni Collette) is far to permissive, her brother (Paul Dano) hates his life and has taken a vow of silence, her grandpa (Alan Arkin) snorts heroin, and her Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) has shown up on their doorstep after a botched attempt to take his own life. This motley family is about to make a 700 mile trip in a beat up VW Van with a busted clutch to get Olive to the National Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest in Redondo Beach. Will they survive each other? Or will Olive's dream of becoming a beauty queen come crashing down? LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is the kind of movie that will leaving you feeling good at the end only because it ends on such a high note. The last ten minutes of this film are easily the best. They're what you're going to talking about as you leave the theater. As for the other 90 minutes well that's up in the air.<br/><br/>The film is far to moody. There is a fine line between dark humor and just plain darkness. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE spends too much of it early scenes developing realistic characters. They laugh, they cry, and then the film betrays this honesty by asking them to fall into farce. The screenplay goes into auto-pilot and the characters turn into independent film clich√©s'.<br/><br/>The actors do the best they can with the material but alas the film feels so artificial. You start to see some themes pop out that would make good talking points in an article or interview, but in the context of the film it's all just filler. Every character gets to wax poetic then they get to do something silly. Then the film makes some blanket statement about how life is as phony as a beauty contest, there is an act of rebellion, and then everybody hugs.<br/><br/>The films biggest problem is that the screenplay is such a rip off of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION. Except instead of Wally World the Hoovers are on their way to Redondo Beach and there is a Proust scholar in the car. There is even a scene in which a dead body shows up and they have to put it in their car. I was waiting for Randy Quaid to show up and ask Greg Kinnear's character for money. That's what this film needed, Uncle Eddie! LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a ""dark comedy"" that's far too dark and not really all that funny. It has it's moments, and on the surface it is very sweet and charming. Little Abigail Breslin steals the show, giving Olive a wisdom beyond her age, and a wide-eyed wonder. But unfortunately the film is not worth the price of admission. I'd skip this beauty contest."

","My anticipation was that this movie would have been a comedy. Indeed, it is subsumed under comedy, which to me indicates that I'm going to LAUGH. That didn't happen. As soon as I saw the cast, of course Steve Carell popped out and after his performance in The Office and in 40-Year-Old Virgin, I was expecting something that'd make my tummy rumble. However, none of that happened. I want to know where the humour is in this movie. At best, you get the elitist humour one expects from these motion picture festivals. Perhaps it lived up to that. Instead of humour, I was wanting to turn off the movie because I was so often embarrassed for the character, and not the kind of embarrassment characteristic of Carell's behaviour on The Office. This embarrassment was just pathetic. I'm certain that objections to my opinion will come in the form of ""But this is dark humour."" Dark humour? It was dark, in its own jejune way, considering how jejune every character was, except for the divorc√©e mother. Anyway, even dark humour should involve some sort of irony more intelligent and less visible than the father's commitment to an idiotic system for achievement. As far as acting goes, I give out top marks to everyone except for the adolescent male. His ""breakdown"" after that predictable plot ""twist"" about his dreams wasn't believable at all. (Indeed, I didn't know that he'd be colourblind, but you could just tell that his dream, like everyone else's, would go unfulfilled.) In sum, I'm glad that I burned this film, because if I'd paid for it, I'd be even more upset about watching a ""comedy"" that has no humour."

","I don't know where to begin with this one. It starts off well enough, and goes on that way for fifty minutes or so. Never great, I'd say, but it's a perfectly acceptable little indie comedy. Alan Arkin and Steve Carell are both excellent, and Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are fine, too. But then it takes a majorly wrong turn (think grandma from National Lampoon's Vacation, miscalculated at an astronomical level), follows that up with some incredibly forced bits and ends up at one of the most outrageously appalling climaxes I have seen in a long time. I went from moderately enjoying it to downright hating it. It's too bad, too, because I do like some of the things it's trying to say, some of the things it's trying to do. But what a disaster! I guess I'm the only one who feels that way, though. My movie-going companion (whose opinion I respect, I should add) was enamored with the picture all the way through, even laughing uproariously at what I thought were some of the most cringe-inducing moments in some time. It's already ranked on IMDb's top 250, though that's hardly a sign of high quality. Oh well. I'm happy enough in hating it. Easily the worst I've seen so far this year."

","In one word: baffling.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine manages to present almost every stereotype of the ""hip"" indie-intellectual film-making scene.<br/><br/>The major flaw is that such approach could work on two directions: either the dark-humored drama or the full-fledged, over the top farce.<br/><br/>Unfortunately LMS fails to pick a path, and instead keeps on going back and forth from a serious, almost pompous, mood to a campy tone.<br/><br/>The Dysfunctional Family trope is brought to the limit and beyond already in the opening phase of the movie. Too bad there isn't enough depth to any of the family members to connect with the audience.<br/><br/>The whole premise of the movie is so unrealistic you really wonder for a while if the whole thing is supposed to be taken seriously or if you're actually gonna see Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson popping up in the following scene. A pudgy little girl wants to be at a Pageant in California, so the whole dysfunctional family is gonna drive hundreds of miles (in a Hippie Van, of all vehicles...) just because the kid wants so... I learn now it's just a matter of WANTING to take part to a pageant then... no casting, no preliminary selections... Just show up (late) and you're in! <br/><br/>Also, every decision the family makes on the road leads to more silly shenanigans, as if they're actively trying to make the trip (and the movie) longer.<br/><br/>Let's not forget, as a side-note, that every subplot ends up being meaningless, or so bland it could have been left out with no major damage to the main plot.<br/><br/>Oh, I'll gracefully gloss over the actual pageant show and the ""moves"" the little girl has been taught, behind closed doors, by her drug-'n'-porn addicted grandfather...<br/><br/>What happened to American's infamous prudery? How comes Chris Hansen and his ""why don't you get a seat over there?"" jokes didn't flood the net and/or the theaters? If it's beauty pageants it's OK enjoying little girls strutting and acting like kinky adult women? Go figure... America must definitely be a funny place...<br/><br/>And before someone chimes in ""ohhh but it was soooooo ironic, it was meant to denounce and ridicule it! You didn't get it?"", I say no, sorry, the irony got lost in the mix, and died when the girl was dancing like a stripper, while her family was enjoying it.<br/><br/>In the end the message is pretty clear and clich√®... ""We are dysfunctional but we love each other. We aren't rich and successful but we're REAL!"" This has been done before, and better.<br/><br/>Also the wacky family road trip has been done better and more funnily before.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine brings nothing new to the table, probably not even the shock value, because in the end there's little to be shocked about. The dominant reaction to it is bemusement, not disgust.<br/><br/>The movie is not funny, not insightful, not enjoyable in any way.<br/><br/>I suspect it's another of those ""cool movies"" you just have to pretend you liked and ""got"" so you can act all smart and ""with it"".<br/><br/>Quite frankly I don't care if I'm not cool or smart enough.. Little Miss Sunshine is an over-hyped piece of intellectualoid drivel; tame drivel to be brutally honest."

","'Little Miss Sunshine' tells a fascinating and hilarious story of a dysfunctional family that includes a cigarette-addicted mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), her suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell), her voluntarily mute son Dwayne (Paul Dano), her obsessed-with-winning husband Richard(Greg Kinnear), his eccentric father Edwin (Alan Arkin) and her 7 year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin). I usually enjoy movies and shows about dysfunctional families, perhaps because my family's that way and it is this dysfunctional quality that makes them more fun for me. Directors Dayton and Faris do a good job as they stick to the main story. 'Little Miss Sunshine' can also be watched as a fun road movie where we are presented with some beautiful landscapes and some of the dialogues during the characters' journey are of laugh out loud quality and yet it keeps the authenticity of the relationships and situations intact.<br/><br/>The film consists of a delightful ensemble cast. Toni Collette, as the mother and wife who tries to keep the family together is amazing. Alan Arkin is brilliant as the father who doesn't give a damn. Greg Kinnear too is superb as the judgemental moron and he's great in displaying his character's vulnerability. Steve Carell is excellent, especially in showing Frank's transformation and his dialogue delivery is impeccable. Paul Dano holds his own. And, Abigail Breslin is the surprise package. This little girl is breathtaking. The scene where she has the last conversation with her grandfather and breaks down because of her fear of losing the pageant was very moving and of course there's the climax shot.<br/><br/>About this particular shot, many have labelled it as child pornography and this is an ignorant statement. That scene was not meant to be pornographic in any way. It was supposed to be hilarious and it got me rolling on the floor laughing (not literally but you get the idea). The importance of that scene was that it was a punch in the stomach to the parents and all those associated with the children's beauty pageant. We are shown little girl's (as young as ages 3) with heavy makeup, wearing these revealing outfits, doing these provocative moves on stage (this was one horrifying sequence)...all in the name of talent, self esteem and whatever. Olive's act stresses on the hypocrisy of this ridicule and the young actress does a fine job.<br/><br/>On the technical front, the cinematography is good and the soundtrack is brilliant. But, it is the characters and their relationship that makes 'Little Miss Sunshine' a treat. It starts off on a gloomy note where all the characters, except Olive, are more or less depressed but as the film proceeds the layers unfold and as the story is told. Not a single moment is wasted on irrelevant trivia. By the end, the experience is very positive, like a ray of sunlight entering the lives of these characters."

I had heard the hype and was aware of all the award buzz and thought to myself, ""this must be a really good movie"". Having finally watched it, I felt like I was letdown. I got that emptiness you feel when you expect something big and receive something small. Don't get me wrong, the movie was definitely good, but that's it....just good.<br/><br/>I'm a total Steve Carrell bandwagon guy since Anchorman and the 40 year old virgin and felt he really did a fantastic job blending in with the rest of the crew so its not only him you notice. And kudos for showing us his broad range when it comes to acting, I totally believed his suicidal character 100%. He pulled it off with ease. And the rest of the crew deserves nods too, especially Alan Arkin as Grandpa.<br/><br/>Though the acting was really good, the story was average. A simple feel good road trip movie is all you're really gonna get. And wow! that gas station scene where somehow they realize the youngest one in their group isn't with them anymore when they start to drive away...that's just silly.<br/><br/>I can't say anymore because I don't want to be portrayed as someone who dislikes this film, I enjoyed it overall, just not as much as for example, ""The Illusionist"". So really, this movie is basic proof that you should judge for yourself and not be consumed what everyone else says until you've seen it first."

","I went to see this movie at the theater, not expecting too much. I was wonderfully surprised! So many things reminded me of my own home and growing up. Especially the ice cream scene. Very funny. There were several parts in the movie where i just couldn't stop giggling. My husband and my aunt were also laughing and enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>The ending is great and its truly a feel good movie. I am going to buy the DVD. This is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a few years. A great portrait of real family life. Greg Kinnear is also just perfect in his role and does a spectacular job. Toni Collette is always good too. Everyone in this picture was just fantastic and endearing. A wonderful family movie for adults and young adults."

","It's a touchable film. Most of all I think this movie has a clear message, that is transmitted to the viewer in a growing way¬ÖFirst, it just seems to be a slogan, one of the ""nine steps"" to win, but then we start realizing that it's really a strong message, the main idea of the film: be yourself, do what you want to do and don't care about what other people will think, never quite, never give up, even if you are afraid to lose, and you will be a winner¬Ö because ""losers are people who are so afraid of not winning, they don't even try"" (it was said by ""grandpa"" in the movie)¬ÖAnd that's so true! Sometime we are so afraid of what can happen that we just give up and don't even try to do something that we would like, just because we are afraid of the consequences! I see myself here, and I think that's the point of the movie, make people think about themselves, and the others around them, especially the closer ones, family and friends¬Ö <br/><br/>I won't say it's a comedy, in my point of view it's far from that. I think it's a drama with a sarcastic humor. It had some comic moments, but I guess that many people will review themselves in those moments¬Ö <br/><br/>I really appreciated this film, it's not so hilarious as many people told (it's not the comedy of the year!), but it actually has a refreshing touch and made me think about some issues that I didn't expect to when I decided to see this movie."

","I liked this film! It had many funny situations and dealt with real problems that people face. I would have voted higher but for the dance routine of Olive at the end. I thought it was highly inappropriate for a girl of her age to move and dress like that. If they would just take that routine out I would have given the movie a 10.<br/><br/>The film touched on many parts of life. A gay Uncle that is very smart and almost commits suicide because his life all but goes down the drain. And then you see him in many scenes with his straight nephew that is a classic goth type yet is in to Nietzche.<br/><br/>The fathers self help step spiel was a riot. Yet one more person with a method to achieve anything that no one will listen to.<br/><br/>It was touching how the whole family was willing to back this little girl."

","This movie is cynical, heartless, boring, derivative, and insulting. <br/><br/>It is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. During one of the big scenes, I actually walked out and stood in the hall for five minutes, not because it was terrible, but because it was so boring and I couldn't care for the characters.<br/><br/>There are no real characters, just sets of quirks who behave out of no conceivable self interest. Most of the actors do a great job of trying to turn these quirks into humans, but they are sabotaged by the ridiculous script at every turn.<br/><br/>Everything the character do seems arbitrary and exists only to disgust the audience or move the plot forward towards its big ending -- an ending that is exceedingly derivative and clich√©d yet comes as a breath of fresh air after the preceding couple of hours of fake dysfunction. <br/><br/>I know that many people like this movie, but I honestly cannot fathom how anyone could."

","This was very much a ""nothing"" movie. Too little plot, too little real acting, too little charm, too little to hold any interest. The movie was not funny. There were no laughs, though maybe a small chuckle - when the funniest moment in the movie is when the door falls off the bus, it is sad. Which is more what this movies was about and what the movie was like. It was sad. If the movie had any message, it was that dreams get squished and there isn't anything you can do about it besides move on. In the movie, everyone's dream is destroyed, and they show no end in site, no remedy, no better future for anyone. Overall, the movie was tedious. It is hard to understand how anyone would like this movie at all, much less really think it was even good. Apologies to ""trendy"" people who want to vote FOR this movie, but it really was bad."

","I just got done seeing this movie. I ordered it from my Netflix account. Let's just say that I am glad I didn't go waste my money to see it at the theater. First and foremost, I was appalled at the foul language and sexual references that the movie could have done without. Also, while the movie was playing, it was just ""okay"" form the beginning. I kept waiting for it to get better as the movie went on. But it didn't. When the beauty pageant scene came on, I thought ""oh great, now the movie is going to get better"". Nope--that is when the movie took a turn for the absolute worst. And as I mentioned before, the rest of the movie was only barely bearable to sit through. I couldn't believe that I wasted 2 hours of my time watching this movie. If you believe that you can spend 2 hours of your time doing something better than listening to foul language, crude and unnecessary sexual references, for a movie that isn't great to begin with, an overall ""1"" movie on the 1-10 scale, I would say you ix-nay this movie and you will be better off."

","Little Miss Sunshine is riddled with clever and witty dialogue, compelling character development and a disheartening yet delightful narrative. Little Miss Sunshine is the perfect drama, with a beautiful underlying message. I could watch Little Miss Sunshine on repeat, for days on end. The on-screen chemistry between the characters, and the intense performances from everyone create an extremely enjoyable experience (even the child actress was incredible).

"MaximusIX","1","17","34","10 September 2007"," Unbelievably Awful
","I find it hard to understand how people enjoyed this movie. There is nothing remotely entertaining about it.<br/><br/>The characters are all weak and hugely stereotypical. The family unit that exists throughout the film is so dysfunctional as to be unbelievable, mainly due to the father character who was such a loser that no wife or family would remain with him. The son who takes a vow of silence for 9 months (kids that age would never have the ability to pull that off). The grandfather is the only remotely funny character but he is so argumentative that he would not have been allowed to stay (he was thrown out of a home, but they would have found him another by then).<br/><br/>The major problem that I had with this film is the ending. The whole film leads up to a moment, which was far too long in coming and as a consequence I really didn't care when it arrived, but when it did I was sickened and disgusted. To think that kids that young are paraded around like that made me feel physically sick. Then the dance at the end. Even the fact that it was supposed to be humorous. I found it gut-wrenching even to watch it.<br/><br/>Overall 1 out of 10. I would recommend everyone watching this however because the rating of this film need to be lowered. Too many artistic film lovers around these days."

They earn all of their jokes and their chemistry together is just perfect. This family is so funny and the classic road trip set piece is pulled off very well with lots of good twists and turns. I saw it in a packed theater and people clapped when it was over. Lots of big laughs. All the jokes are earned and the script is excellent. Paul Dano has a great part and Greg Kinnear actually does a wonderful job as the Dad.

One may be interested at the start of the movie however as it ""builds up"" so to speak it doesn't build up for the good. It is just a boring tale of a dysfunctional family that tries to take their untalented daughter who thinks she is great to a little miss sunshine contest where in actual fact she is possibly the worst candidate.The all star cast made me excited at first but the film was just generally boring with no twist and a very expected ending. not exciting and I wouldn't recommend seeing."
"BushLiedMarinesDied","1","19","39","24 January 2007"," What is the point of this?
","This is the worst kind of by the numbers Hollywood junk saved only by a handful of competent scenes & some good acting from 2 of the cast. This is a pity, especially given the presence of Greg Kinnear who has shown his talent in the past.<br/><br/>For a start Alan Arkin shaves his head, scruffs up & plays, a scruffy, bald Alan Arkin. He's the same in every movie I see him in & he bores me to tears. Will this guy ever take acting lessons & play a character for once that ISN'T him in jeans/ T-shirt... suit....army fatigues.... etc etc? Greg Kinnear plays a motivational speaker who's so afraid of ""losing' that he is unable to win. Sadly this is a common theme in the US today, few, if any, such saps stop to think that not everyone can be a millionaire (because your millions will become devalued by the cash all the other millionaires are throwing around) & not everyone can rise to the top (who would clean the streets & stock our supermarket shelves?) etc etc.<br/><br/>The saddest thing about this pile of horse poo is it follows the same, old, tired, sexist line. See how all the male figures in the group are flakey in some sort of way. The son doesn't speak, the grandpa is a coke head & degenerate, suicidal Frank is... well suicidal, dad Richard is delusional about his motivational guff & so on. Only mommy holds things together, in a quiet, suppressed screaming way kind of way.<br/><br/>It is completely to very tired & highly sexist formula.<br/><br/>Olive, the daughter, seems almost like a doll dragged along, completely without any direction of hr own. Anyone can guess the outcome of her pageant appearance. Boring! Also predictable is the device of the dead body. This has been done a thousand times before & often a lot better, most notably in that laugh-until-you-need-oxygen Fawlty Towers episode.<br/><br/>Correll as Frank shows some talent, completely different from any of his previous appearances (something Alan Arkin could learn about). Dano as Dwayne must have had a hard time not talking on camera his face having to carry much of his emotions, but his lines must have been real easy to learn. His eventual implosion/explosion was impressive too.<br/><br/>Othe than that I see nothing new, it is an assembly of threads & scenes all seen & done before. Why on earth this is up for an Oscar I'll never know."

","Can a movie possibly be more overrated? The answer is no. Give LMS credit where credit is due: It's pretty much single handedly responsible for the recent wave of horrendous ""quirky-clever"" comedies, where eccentricities are substituted for character development and the plot is easily reduced to a platitude suitable for a Ziggy cartoon. LMS is a perfect example of a comedy that people who wish to distinguish themselves from the Scary Movie/Date Movie crowd often list as one of their favorite comedies---a movie that appeals to their cultured sensibilities and refined comedic tastes. The moral of the film is trite to the point of offensiveness, but the real crime are the pointlessly, helplessly quirky characters who play off each other in a predictably dysfunctional manner. Man, a gay Proust scholar? Hi-Larious! I'm sure all the college educated audience members are chuckling to themselves at the literary reference--despite that fact that his being a Proust scholar contributes nothing to his character except to make him quirky. Same goes for the moody teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Airforce. Same with the self-help seminar obsessed dad who is actually a loser in real life. Oh and please lets not forget the adorably precocious beauty pageant grade-schooler and her uproarious cussing grandfather. You wont believe your ears when the grandfather, (who is really old!) cusses, and then does drugs! O to the M to the G! Way to defy our expectations and challenge our preconceived notions about the elderly, movie! Even the god damned van they drive in is quirky. Worse still is the effect that this movie had on the industry---spawning even more vapid dreck like Stranger Than Fiction and other quirky for the sake of quirkiness comedies. And a nomination for Best Picture? Really? That's got to be a low point for the Academy. Avoid LMS. At all costs."

","The only thing that made this movie somewhat watchable was because any  second you expected Steve Carrel to do something humorous. Never  happened, but everyone has a bad day I suppose. I finally broke down  and watched this movie when I heard it had been nominated by the  Oscars. I don't know why I fell for it, one would think the Oscar  committee with it's combined knowledge and expertise would pick a  noteworthy movie to give an award to. Obviously they're all new hires,  or the writer/directors and/or grips blew the committee to get this  movie nominated. Best actress for a 7 year old, wow, right? It's a 7 yr  old girl acting like a 7 year old girl...hell of a stretch I know. The  number 1 Proust scholar in the country attempting chopsueycide because  his gay lover left him for the 2nd best Proust scholar in the country?  Then we have a ICP  lookalike 15 year old who hates everyone and takes a vow of silence  until he becomes a test pilot for the service. This kid's not going to  open his mouth until he's done with college and flight training school?  All that hard work, effort and he didn't take the time to check and see  that you can't be color blind and be a pilot, maybe that's why the 7 yr  old got an Oscar nod, she crushed her older brother's dreams by telling  him he's color blind in a VW bus. Which would probably be preferable to  letting him in on the secret before school when he could pick up a  trench coat and a semi-auto rifle to take his spaz breakdown out on the  kids in his school. Then you have the dysfunctional parents that can't  get along and yell at each other throughout the movie, the pervert  grandfather who teaches his 7 yr old grand daughter how to dance like a  stripper for her talent portion of the Lil Miss Sunshine pageant. This  should be a Greek tragedy, minus all the interesting stuff. When you  see the little girls in the pageant with spray on tans, their hair and  makeup that would have done an adolescent whore house in Tijuana proud  and you think it can't get any worse, you get the star 7 yr old on  stage grinding her ass and gyrating to a popular 80's stripper song.  The only Oscar this should get is if they create a section for  pedophilia, or for over hyped crap. If you are male this movie equates  to about 3 chick flicks at once."

","I was quite disappointed with Little Miss Sunshine. From the trailers, to the critics reviews, to the incredible cast, I expected this to be a movie that I would have enjoyed just a bit more. I suppose we are meant to sympathize with the losers in this movie, but I just found the whole theme of the ""lovable losers"" to be exasperating. This compounded with the fact that the outcomes for three of the characters were so easily decipherable that I checked out half-way through the movie, makes Little Miss Sunshine only worthy of a Sunday afternoon HBO waste of time. Lastly - Steve Carell is not the same actor we've been seeing on television and other movies as of late. I understand that comedic actors often try to bust out of their proverbial mode, but I almost felt as if he was holding back his usual wild antics, or they were otherwise edited out of the film. Bottom line: if you're looking for a comedy that makes you laugh because you are uncomfortable with the characters, see this movie. If you want to see a comedy that's actually funny, don't waste your time."

Parents who have kids who need glasses...don't make them get the kind this poor little girl was wearing! And, I'm sorry, I have a 5 year old daughter and wouldn't let her look like she did. There is no way she would be in a beauty pageant. You won't believe how they make the other little girls look! They were more beautiful and sophisticated than I could ever feel!

","Little Miss Sunshine is a funny and entertaining independent movie about a strange and ambitious family called the Hoovers who take a road-trip. Their 7-year year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) enters the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California. The Hoovers can't afford to fly so they drive an old VW bus from their home in Albuquerque. <br/><br/>The Hoovers are a family with big dreams who seem to lack the talent or ability to realize them. Richard (Greg Kinnear) plays the dad, a motivational speaker who specializes in telling people how to become winners. Sheryl (Toni Collette) is the mother, who tries to make sure everybody is happy, but is becoming disillusioned with her husband's lack of success. Her brother Frank (Steve Carrell) is recovering from a suicide attempt. Frank is a gay, Proust scholar who believes he is the leading U.S. expert in his field. His boyfriend has just left him for a more successful rival. The teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano) reads Nietzsche, and wants to become a jet pilot. He has not spoken for nine months and communicates by writing notes. Richard's father (Alan Arkin) recently got kicked out of his retirement community for swearing and snorting heroin. When Grandpa dies he is thrown in the trunk. Olive is a short, overweight little girl whose beauty queen ambitions are at odds with her physique. <br/><br/>The Hoovers start the movie unable to communicate with each other. Their VW has a broken clutch and to get the vehicle going they have to push and leap into the moving van. Somehow the absurdity of their situation helps bring them together. Once in California the Little Miss Sunshine competition seems like a grotesque freak show. Underage girls perform adult dance moves and look and dress like drag queens. Olive performs an unfortunate dance routine choreographed by her Grandpa. The Hoovers are appalled by the misguided dedication and professionalism surrounding the competition.<br/><br/>Most family members end the movie with their hopes and dreams crushed. After sharing numerous humiliations they learn to bond and realize they at least have each other. The smart and witty script by Michael Arndt seems to pose a number of questions about the destructive power of ambition for those with no talent. You conclude the Hoovers might be better off if they tried to just live ordinary lives without the striving to be winners. <br/><br/>The movie has a talented cast and Carrell gives a memorable impression of a gay man running for a bus. By the end of the film you care about the Hoovers and although they seem happy, you worry about what will become of them. The film was directed by the husband-and-wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris who do a remarkable job on a production budget of $8 million."

In the midst of the death scene also one does not stop laughing ¬ñ but reflecting back ¬ñ one does not get convinced with the situation.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is the most inspiring and sends out a strong message against ¬ñ the relevance of beauty pageants and humans have started considering everything in life like beauty pageant. This is reflected in a very lovely exchange between the professor and the young boy ¬ñ who says that ""everyone's whole life is like this silly beauty pageant"".<br/><br/>At the end of the movie it is so pitiful to see the young girls of 5-10 years being tortured to act and behave like beauty queens ¬ñ and it tells the story of today's times.<br/><br/>A very good movie!"

This movie, crippled by sloppy, incomplete characters, painfully drags the viewer through a series of unfunny, awkward and/or inane situations with little to no cohesion holding it all together. The acting is below the standard I would expect for any of the stars - especial Alan Arkin - who, as the only character in the movie that was remotely funny, probably could have single-handedly made this movie worth watching had he been given more screen time.<br/><br/>If you want a cute take little girl pageants, watch Happy Texas.<br/><br/>And there are dozens of ""dysfunctional family"" comedies from which to choose that are actually funny - The Royal Tenenbaums, Home For The Holidays, Pieces Of April, The Family Stone, etc...

"saturnalia33","8","7","12","11 December 2006"," Charming, laugh-out-loud family road movie for adults
","I wasn't sure what to expect from Little Miss Sunshine. From the trailers it seemed like an indie-orientated family road-trip movie and I suppose to a certain extent it is. You have what could be construed as clich√© family members: self-righteous dad who tries his best to force his opinions and beliefs on everybody else even though he's a loser; an angst-ridden teen; gay uncle working out his own issues and a grandfather who has reached a certain age he doesn't care who he offends. However, it is how these characters work together and the situations they find themselves in that elevates this film to hilarious heights instead of hitting comedy rock bottom.<br/><br/>The film begins as a young girl, Olive, is reviewing a Miss America pageant and mimicking her winning emotional behaviour. Meanwhile the father, Richard, is presenting his 9-step plan to a group of school children and the mother, Sheryl, is picking her brother Frank up from hospital after a failed suicide attempt. As they congregate at the family house for dinner, we are introduced to Olives older teenage brother Dwayne who is on a self-imposed silence and hates everyone and their grandfather Edwin who is snorting heroin before dinner.<br/><br/>During the less-than-successful family dinner where arguing and bickering ensues, a phone call is made whereby Olive finds out that due to a drop-out she is now in contention for the Little Miss Sunshine title. Leaving no-one behind, the family jump into their VW wagon and set off across the country to the pageant where comedy drama ensues.<br/><br/>The key to the laughs in this film are mainly down to two things: the actors delivery of the material and the material itself. Some of the best lines are delivered by Alan Arkin who plays the free-talking grandfather who has been secretly training Olive for her routine for pageants. He speaks his mind about whatever he feels like including his own life-experience advice. Naturally, this being a road-movie, everyone learns something and they are richer for the experience. The bonus is that the audience is richer for the laughs they are given. Despite the apparent un-original set-up, Little Miss Sunshine is far greater than the sum of its parts and is a charming, laugh-out-loud family road movie for adults."
"oldskoolgeek","6","28","65","10 September 2006"," Aren't indie flicks supposed to be original?
","With all the hype surrounding this film I went expecting to see the best movie I'd see all year, but nearly two hours later when the credits rolled I felt cheated. Following yet another road trip taken by a dysfunctional family, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is at times painfully predictable and sadly unoriginal. The family itself is so generic in its dysfunction: there's the the ineffectual motivational-speaker dad who hates losers (meaning he secretly hates his family), the stressed out mom, the chubby 7-year-old daughter with beauty pageant dreams, the brooding Nietzsche-reading teen, the suicidal gay uncle, and the drug-abusing horny grandpa who decides he's old enough to say whatever he wants. As you might expect, EVERYTHING on this trip goes wrong. Along the way to the beauty pageant, each family member is confronted with expectations and rude awakenings. What is supposed to be an ensemble piece about a family never quite comes together and we are left with a series of scenes meant to showcase a particular cast member's talent, but the problem is no one really reacts or relates to anyone else. The one sweet scene between Grandpa and 7-year-old Olive is a relief, but also feels glaringly underlined by the director. As an audience member I didn't miss any of these heartfelt scenes, but I didn't buy them either. So that I don't sound like I'm trashing a film that I almost enjoyed, I should give credit where credit is due. Part of the film's obvious irony is that depressed Uncle Frank (played by Steve Carell) is the only person who can see how weird this family is, but watching his calm bewilderment is a delight. Toni Collete is also so darn likable, but I was bored with just about any scene that focused entirely on father Greg Kinnear's character. The finale at the beauty pageant exaggerates and replays all the lessons that have come before: such competitions are superficial, and displays of love come in all forms. The family embraces its loserdom and becomes winners by showing how grotesque the child beauty pageant world is ¬ñ wow, now that's a fresh idea! The film saves its one big laugh for the end, but it was too little too late. While it had its moments, Little Miss Sunshine isn't as wacky or clever as it believes itself to be and this ticket holder walked away disappointed."
"gus-148","6","20","44","2 August 2006"," Fine Performances, Weak Script
","*Possible Spoiler Alert* I think the main reason I went to see this movie was the fact Steve Carell is in it. Although I was extremely disappointed with ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" I am still very optimistic that Carell will make that amazing comedic feature film we're all waiting for. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is not that movie, but it still is an encouraging step in the right direction. Carell, shows incredible range here as an actor, blending extreme pathos with a genuine comic likability. In short he's a real person here.<br/><br/>There are several aspects of the film which I really did admire but overall the weaknesses of the script kept this thing from truly taking off. In fact the entire ensemble cast is heaven-sent. Each one, from Toni Collette to Alan Arkin and Greg Kinnear made me forgive many of the shortcomings of the script. The directors have this Williamsburg Brooklyn hipster pose that annoyingly tries to camouflage itself in the ""average everyday American"" life of Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm sure they didn't mean it to come off as condescending, but it does sometimes.<br/><br/>The script is actually not much more than a poorer man's version of a James L. Brooks film filtered through ""National Lampoon's Vacation."" The script is frustrating because there are some genuinely tender and touching moments (like Grandpa's scenes with Olive, Olive getting her brother to get back in the van)--in fact those moments were for me the most effective parts of the film. More frustrating is that believable situations are constantly undermined by stupid, desperate plot devices. The movie hopped off the train track altogether when the whole family agrees to follow the charmless Kinnear's insane lead and smuggle the corpse from the hospital. The fact that the family goes along with that so easily rings false like nothing else. Nothing we see before that moment indicates that they would all do such an unreasonable thing. The winner and loser theme is top heavy and characters even spell out the film's themes in the dialogue. In fact it's never truly believable that Collette and Kinnear would be so loonily passionate about getting their daughter to a beauty contest in the first place or that they would be so clueless as to how horrific the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant is! Instead of trying to patch up these holes, the writer and the directors try to zoom past them hoping the audience won't notice them."
"dallas_viewer","2","6","10","19 February 2008"," The ""Feel-Nothing"" Movie of the Year
","I'm really shocked by the number of people who liked this movie. I found so little to like about it. I didn't care about any of these people. Maybe if their van had careened off the side of the road at the end of the movie, exploding into a fiery blaze, I'd have given this a few more stars.<br/><br/>Specifically, what did I dislike? <br/><br/>First there were the unbelievable plot contrivances. <br/><br/>Like, somehow, Olive is the runner up in a local pageant. Does anyone really think that, with her outfit (and what talent was she doing at that time, since Grandpa was still working with her on developing a routine), hair, etc., she would have been runner up? <br/><br/>And even if this were possible, at the higher level, things were so radically different, and no one had an inkling? And no one happened to have seen her routine prior to the big show? <br/><br/>And, oh, yeah, Olive happens to find some eye exams in the doctor's office (because we all find eye exams in waiting rooms), so that later her brother can conveniently learn that he is color blind and therefore unable to fly planes.<br/><br/>Oh, and could I just mention how I loathed the little plot lines featuring the dirty magazines? I don't mind a little clever smutty humor in a movie. This was not it, however. It was not clever, and it was not funny. It did, however, serve to underscore how, indeed, Frank et al. were losers. <br/><br/>Enough, though, of the stupidity of the plot. Let's talk about how unlikeable the characters were (well, except for Olive, who simply wasn't enough of a force on screen to counter the other characters).<br/><br/>Grandpa: Heroin addicted (dies presumably of an overdose), vulgar and foul mouthed, urges his minor grandson to go out and screw girls as much as possible (of course, he said it in cruder language), and teaches his granddaughter a stripper routine. <br/><br/>Am I the only one who does not find this kind of thing amusing? I kept hoping he would die--unfortunately, it wasn't until about half way through the movie.<br/><br/>Frank: Another loser. A pompous ass who spouts about being a Proust scholar. Oh, and the minute they happen to discover that the brother is color blind--the very minute!--he comes right out with the info that the brother cannot fly planes. Because he's an insensitive, self-centered jerk. Why oh why didn't Frank do the job right when he tried to off himself earlier? Then I wouldn't have been subject to him either.<br/><br/>Dad: Just when you think maybe Dad might have a few redeeming qualities, he implies that Olive is fat. Because he's a loser.<br/><br/>Mom and the brother: Just there. I didn't care if they lived, died, whatever.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for some sort of closure--mom and dad smiling conspiratorially at the end, everyone in the car doing a very Bradyesque ""Yeah, as long as we've got each other, nothing can keep us down"". I would have liked the movie a tad better if it had had closure, and more positive closure.<br/><br/>Or the van careening off the road in a fiery blaze.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time."

It felt padded by extended road scenes, and asides unnecessary to the plot. <br/><br/>Was it supposed to be funny? Other people seem to think so, but I did not laugh once at this celebration of mediocrity. The characters began as losers, and finished as losers.

From the good-natured little girl to the heroin-sniffing grandpa to the Nietzsche obsessed son. The directors tried very hard to fit in as many bizarre traits as they could think of. Almost none of them had any impact on the story.<br/><br/>The character that we're all interested in seeing, Abigail Breslin as Olive, takes a back seat (literally) to the other characters, who, after a while, began to get on my nerves.<br/><br/>The journey to get to the pageant happens pretty fast considering they're from another state. It just seems like they travel from desert to desert until they're in California. There aren't any amazing sights along the way. It's just them in the van.<br/><br/>If you want funny, watch any of the ""Vacation"" movies again. Those are essentially what this movie is attempting to be.<br/><br/>Basically, had the screenwriter actually bothered to make the character flaws go somewhere and place the story in a more inspiring scenery, it could have gone over a lot better. As it stands, I don't see how people can forgive the shortsightedness in the writing. Its worth a rental and I will weep for the Academy if this film manages to grab an Oscar."

Surely, you will find some thing or event that will make you feel very normal. Just a few comments from the rental box ""There's been no more satisfying American comedy this year."" - Newsweek.

It must've been a terrible year for comedies. Yea, Alan Arkins character not waking up had me in stitches. Not! Funny and Hilarious, this movie is not. Well, maybe for a 15 year old but not for adults or should I say grown up adults. I guess the crowd that loved this movie also loved O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Bean and Borat.<br/><br/>I expected far more from Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell. They are very talented but what possessed them to sign on to this piece of garbage. What's worse was that the day I rented this movie, I had gone and seen Evan Almighty and thought Carell did a wonderful job with that role and laughed throughout the movie. I didn't laugh once for this one.<br/><br/>The grandfather dying and left in the vehicle was a reminder of the movie ""Vacation"" along with getting stopped by a motor cop who always seem to be portrayed as a bunch of dimwits even though in Vacation, the aunt was still alive. How that van must've smelled after having left the body in the van and in the heat for so long.<br/><br/>As for the beauty pageant, it must've been a pedophiles delight. They must love seeing all those young beauty queens dressed as Jon Benet Ramsey. And how about all the Patsy Ramsey's sitting in the audience, which Olive's mother was one of them. And just what talent did Olive have to get her in the beauty pageant in the first place? They also needed to cut out the Burger Kings for the kid. And I busted a gut laughing with this kid jumping around on the stage like she had ants in her pants. That was the most ridiculous scene of the movie.<br/><br/>Then you have the son who won't speak until he gets into the Air Force to fly jets then goes berserk when it's found he is color blind. What makes him think he'd even pass the psychological in the first place? I'm just glad I rented this movie instead of seeing it at the movies. I'm only out $3.69 for these piece of crap of a movie rather than 30 plus dollars (after paying for 2 tickets, 1 popcorn and 2 drinks).<br/><br/>My advice for you all is to rent.

","Yesterday afternoon I was standing in front of the cinema. Basically, I had two choices for the 17:00h screenings. This one and Paul Verhoeven's ZWARTBOEK (which is developing into my nemesis, I still haven't seen it). I decided I wanted to go for a laugh and because of all the good publicity about LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, I was confident it was gonna be a well spent two hours.<br/><br/>I was wrong. It's a total clunker. Within ten minutes the set-up with the little girl is clear. We've been introduced to all the members of a dysfunctional family and from there on, we have to cope with an endless string of jokes, ideas, and sight gags (Greg Kinnear on his moped on the freeway, the audience can laugh now) that have been done many times before in other films. There's not a single original idea in the entire movie. And the actors can't do anything about it really. The direction is one annoying close-up after another with overly cute music to underline our emotions, and how about a little probability? A 15-year old guy, who wants to be an airline pilot and never had any idea he was colour blind? Come on, please! And after he finds out, he explodes (I think he really did explode) in frustration and anger. How can you work with this as an actor?<br/><br/>Perhaps the whole thing is worth a peek after all for ""The Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Contest"" at Redondo Beach at the end of the film. It was the most gruesome freak show I have ever seen in my entire life. I still feel shivers down my spine when I think about it.<br/><br/>In the end there is some kind of muddled message: Winning is all about our inner selves. Do what you like best or have fun at it. Nobody is a loser when he's trying, and beauty is not about looks. Or something... This was already spelled out in the first ten minutes and I didn't think for a moment that they were gonna end with this one, but they did. What contempt for modern audiences. If this is where modern comedy is heading, we're in trouble. But half the world has seen this film already and clearly fell in love with it, so any resistance on my behalf seems futile.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to develop a certain hatred against all Sundance-endorsed indies.<br/><br/>Camera Obscura --- 3/10"
"TOMASBBloodhound","4","5","8","24 June 2007"," Permission to disagree with the masses?
","Not since viewing Magnolia some two years ago has this critic been so willing to disagree with the majority of users on this site and critics around the world. Little Miss Sunshine is a tedious, unfocused, and downright boring film. There are some laughs here, but nothing near as many as you'd think they could have come up with for this subject material.<br/><br/>Less than five minutes into this film, we are introduced to a teenage character who won't talk. That's right, he will not utter a word. He only writes things down on a small pad of paper or scowls at anyone who tries to communicate with him. As soon as this character was unveiled, my heart sank. I knew I had stumbled into and ""indie"" film that thinks having ""quirky"" characters equals good writing. How unrealistic is such a character? Too unrealistic to film. The parade of annoying characters is just getting started, though. Alan Arkin who plays the grandfather of this family has some funny lines. His character however is little more than just the stereotypical ""dirty old man"". And his character's early death basically means that the laugh well dries up pretty quickly. Greg Kinnear is hardly funny as a would-be self help guru trying to get a book published. Toni Collette as the mom is lost in the shuffle and doesn't add much to the story.<br/><br/>Oh, speaking of the story.... the film claims to be about a family taking a young girl from New Mexico to California for a beauty pageant. And yes, a road trip of this sort is made, but surprisingly little dialog is dedicated to this girl and her upcoming pageant. Maybe that was the overall plan by the writer, but the little girl named Olive just seems to get lost in the shuffle for most of the movie. I was expecting the film to be more about these types of pageants and the overbearing parents who sign their kids up for them. The film never seems to focus on any of that until the final fifteen minutes or so when it actually makes some good observations. Why did the film wait so long to attack a subject so ripe for critical observation? Why was so much time wasted on subplots involving annoying characters? Why was the scene included where Kinnear borrows a moped to meet up with his agent at a hotel to discuss the impending failure of his book? The funniest thing about this situation would seemingly be how Kinnear acquires the bike. Yet we aren't even shown how he does this!!! I could come up with several funny ways he could ask these guys for one of their bikes. Why couldn't screenwriter Michael Arndt? Was it filmed, and then cut? If so, why? Other beefs include the misuse of Steve Carell. True, he wasn't as well known when this was being made, but his character needed more development. Other than the fact that he's a gay suicidal intellectual, he seems to have not much purpose. Is it possible to write an original story anymore that doesn't have a gay character? Does having a gay character give any script some immediate indie cred? There are some funny incidents involving the old VW bus that the family uses to take the trip. Trouble is, they seemed like they wandered in from another kind of movie. They belonged more in a National Lampoon's Vacation or some type of road picture which relies more on physical comedy.<br/><br/>The film saves a little face at the end when it documents the insaneness of these beauty pageants involving little girls made up to look like slutty women. There is something truly unsettling about parents making their kids up like that and parading them around like Jean Benet Ramsey. The film actually ends on it's best note with these observations. But watching the family get to California..... forget it! 4 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

Arkin was good, I just thought Carrell was more commanding. In fact, I found his character and Dano's the most compelling ones.<br/><br/>I'll say nothing about the plot other than what you already know, that the movie centers on a trip from Albequerque to Redondo Beach, California, for a juvenile beauty pageant.

Commericals for the film feature a snippet from another review proclaiming (and I paraphrase here): ""...a real crowd pleaser!"" Yes, it is, but...<br/><br/>There is a place for the exploration of family dysfunction in films, but its a tricky topic to tackle without tipping into over-the-top, ham-fisted characterizations and plot developments. Just because real-life families can be constituted of diverse, bickering oddballs, doesn't mean making them into caricatures on screen is the most accurate way to portray them.<br/><br/>Enter Little Miss Sunshine, a film mired in the faky and obvious. The plot (whole family piles into VW bus for road trip to little girl's beauty pageant, and they gotta hurry!) has a built-in urgency already that needs no augmentation: the traumatic curveballs thrown at the characters seem piled on for the sake of being piled on. The film's two themes (beauty comes from within, family bonds can triumph over a family's differences) aren't told in any particularly new way: they just happen to be told by a stellar cast under the guise of an indie film.<br/><br/>From the beginning we're given stereotypes that occupy only one dimension: <br/><br/>* The motivational speaker dad (Greg Kinnear) whose actually the loser he fears he and his family will hopefully never become;<br/><br/>* The shrill hapless wife (a wasted Toni Collette) who, save for a few touching scenes, does nothing but act helplessly flummoxed by the madness of her family; <br/><br/>* The heroin-snorting raunchy grandpa (Alan Arkin, who usually picks more complex roles than the ""Hey Look!

He can make most anything funny, but he's powerless here); <br/><br/>* The gay suicidal uncle (Steve Carell, shining in an against-type role) who, though perhaps the film's most sympathetic character, can't escape the too-convenient gauntlet of troubles thrown down by the film's plot contrivances; <br/><br/>*The sullen, vow-of-silence-taking, weight-lifting, Nietzsche-loving, wanna-be fighter pilot (whew) teenage son (Paul Dano), who explains the Message of the Movie with the line ""Life is just one ****ing beauty pageant after another!"" long after we figured the movie's point (or what it thinks its point is) out; <br/><br/>*And finally, Little Miss Sunshine herself, Abigail Breslin (the cute little girl in ""Signs"") as Olive (with Carell, the film's other bright spot), who thankfully is too involved in being a little girl to be fully affected by the toxic ""Don't be a loser!"" claptrap her dad peddles. (The sweet relationship with her grandpa seemed out of place, but only because it seemed so *geniune*.) <br/><br/>Characters such as Greg Kinnear's in Sunshine -- those who think they know best and make darn sure the rest of the world knows it -- are unpleasant to watch, but are tolerable if there is a shred of sympathy within them. The shreds are few in this film, and coalesce far too late to make us care about what happens to him; by the time the film reaches its climax (an amusing and clever, if not a too-tidy we-love-each-other-deep-down, moment), we're hoodwinked into thinking he (and the others, for that matter) have changed. The film wants us to believe that these are real characters despite their looniness, but asks us to accept the lie of its conclusion. We all want happy endings, but they only work if they're believable.<br/><br/>The film does indict the child pageantry industry with a great eye for detail that shows just how creepy it really is, but its nothing no one hasn't gathered from even a few ""We confront controlling mothers!"" promos for Dr. Phil or Oprah. All anyone really needs to bridge family gaps, according to the film, are a few days on the road, an endless string of can-you-believe-it? challenges, and a rickety excuse for transportation (here, an annoyingly malfunctioning VW bus held together by unfunny running gags).<br/><br/>Early in the film, Carell's uncle and Dano's teen consider staying at home while the family makes the trip. I truly felt a deep sympathy pang, then, when they had to go (because, well, that's what the plot demands, and because I've also been on similar trips). Later, avoiding the pageant like the plague, Carell comments that one should relish life's misery, or else you'll never learn anything. To that end, you'll learn a lot from this film. Here, then, is something I learned: If you think happy endings come from nowhere, you'll probably buy what it's selling. Me, I'm staying at home and reading Nietzsche."

","Little Miss Sunshine is in a word, fantastic. If you want in more words, it is the story of a family's journey together; helping each other through their ups and downs and showing that although you may not have everything you want- that does not mean your required to be unhappy. It centres around the family of Richard Hoover ( Greg Kinnear ); a man whose '9 steps to becoming a winner' program is not only a job for him but a way of life. He is truly someone who brings his work home with him; much to the chagrin of his wife, Sheryl ( Toni Collette ) and his children Olive ( Abigail Breslin ) and Dwayne ( Paul Dano ) who has taken a vow of silence before he reaches his goal of becoming a pilot in the air force. Their world is turned upside down when Sheryl's brother Frank ( Steve Carell ) attempts to commit suicide, thus bringing him into the family as a precaution. Also there is Richard's dad ( Alan Arkin ) who was kicked out of a retirement home for snorting heroin.<br/><br/>When the family's at the dinner table, the news comes that Olivia is invited to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California- which involves a road trip across the country.<br/><br/>However this movie really proves the saying that the journey is as important as the destination, and it is proved by a great cast. But particular credit must go to Steve Carell as Frank and Paul Dano as Dwayne- their scenes together seem to just move so naturally.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a movie that will help you out of whatever doldrums your in. It's not clich√©d or corny nor pious or preachy but it is still heartfelt in a time where these sort of movies are becoming lost to much more Disneyfied shallow emotions."
"secondtake","7","3","4","13 May 2013"," Totally joyous, funny, fun, fast, and more mainstream than indie overall
","Little Miss Sunshine (2006)<br/><br/>What a wacky, funny, sweet, feel-good movie. It's fast, well made, well written, and fresh faced all the way through.<br/><br/>What else do you need from a warm comedy? The star has to be the little girl, who is in fact the title character, Olive, played by Abigail Breslin. She is the real deal, a great little kid with a heart and with smarts and cute and talented, too. And for some reasonable reason she wants to compete in a beauty and talent contest, and her loving and doubtful family give her total support. Of course, the genuine things that Olive represents are the exact opposite of what is encouraged by beauty pageants, so a kind of crisis is inevitable. <br/><br/>But you know it'll be a funny crisis, and not quite like the comedy in the adult version of the film from six years earlier, ""Miss Congeniality,"" with Sandra Bullock. Because Bullock has the goods to win, despite her outsider sensibility. Olive is set up to be a geeky, cute but not a bit glamorous or fakey kid.<br/><br/>Her grandfather, played by Alan Arkin, is also the real deal, a nutty caricature, for sure, but funny and a great perk in the movie. The parents are fun but for me in a more expected way, and the brother of one of them is fun and funny in a Ben Stiller kind of way. <br/><br/>Production involved some quirks in filming, such as the use of five different yellow microbuses, and the genuine use of headphones by the little girl (as shown) when Arkin is swearing his head off. And the whole thing was a fairly well budgeted indie with a debut at Sundance. And a huge rise to the top of critical and popular charts.<br/><br/>So it's easy to like this movie and even to love it. For serious movie lovers you might find it like other feel-good, well made, but in some ways ""in-the-box"" movies (another that comes to mind is ""Shawshank Redemption"") so it won't strike some people as exceptional. Just exceptionally fun. Don't expect anything truly moving or thought provoking or experimental or probing. It is what it is, which is pretty much self-sufficient."

","""There are two kinds of people in this world, winners and losers.""<br/><br/>A must-see comedy with a bit of a darker side and great characters make this film a winner. The Hoovers are a modern day, even more dysfunctional version of the Griswold's in National Lampoon's Vacation (1983). Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker who cannot sell one book, while his wife, Sheryle (Toni Collette), is the optimistic breadwinner. Together, they attempt to have a normal family with little Olive (Abigail Breslin) dreaming of being in a beauty pageant, the non-speaking Dwayne (Paul Dano), while Frank (Steve Carrell) has a mess of a life, and brutally honest Grandpa Hoover (Alan Arkin) provide great laughter.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine shows that even the most dysfunctional of families can come together and count on each other through the struggles of life. This is represented by the rickety, old Volkswagen van that manages to make it through the whole road trip, taking the Hoovers to the beauty pageant. This journey would not be the same without Richard's awkwardness or Grandpa's humorously insulting comments.<br/><br/>Sprinkled within the humor is a darker side that touches on things like death and not being the winner. There is ""sunshine"" for Olive as she competes in a beauty pageant and living her dream, but they all realize that winning is not everything.<br/><br/>This film is great to watch because it is a simple, true-to-life portrayal of a typical, middle-class family. Each character has their own quirk and defining personalities that exemplify the imperfectness of their family. Yet, the Hoovers give proof that even through the struggles of life; families can come together and be a supportive group."

The plot was not enough to keep me interested. The cute kid thing doesn't do much for me so that didn't keep me either. Save your money and your time - pick another movie.

The grandfather's death, the business deal, whether she becomes little miss sunshine, whether the flight school thing will work out. That last one you had to at least be somewhat awake to notice Olive was playing with the eye tests, I immediately realized that she's probably gonna give the test to him, he'll probably be colorblind since eye surgery can give you 20/20 vision, and he's probably gonna flip out and start talking again.

You would think 2004/2006 was a golden period in the history of movies -yet I feel there was a whole lot of crap too, these three were just jewels in the mud.<br/><br/>LMS is, in many ways, like many other indie movies. Characters are dysfunctional, weird, losers -in other words, ordinary humans. There is a lot of comedy, some drama, and some variable material that can make you laugh or cry depending on your mood. Family members hate, ignore and sometimes tolerate each other. And then comes the unlikely, improbable, crazy happy ending -one that must have seemed so ridiculous in words, in a script, that I am amazed a crew of directors, actors and producers made it into a movie, no matter how indie minded they were.<br/><br/>And yet it is believable in a way a group embrace and a chorus of tearful ""I love you!"" would not be. It is screw-it-all liberating, something that rarely ever comes out that neatly in real life. But it is heart warming as very few other movie endings, yet crazier than most. If the standard Hollywood recipe for losers-turned-winners is just silly, and the most common indie ""it is what it is"" finale is typically bleak though believable, this one broke the mold.

Frank has just survived a suicide attempt after suffering a unrequited love affair, Dwayne is a depressed teenager only interested in achieving his dream of becoming a pilot, Olive a seven-year-old dreaming of becoming a beauty queen even though she is not one, Grandpa a heroin addict, Richard a failed business man with an obsession for winning, and Sheryl who only wants her family to be happy. <br/><br/>'Little miss Sunshine' has brilliant, strong performances from all its actors, and completely deserved to win the Oscar for best screenplay. It is a great, funny, sad and very moving film everyone should be able to relate to in some sort of way. Seriously don't listen to the people who are unable to see the beauty of this film, it's powerful and may just be able to change your view on the world.

The characters within the film play wonderful parts for separate reasons. They convey all sorts of emotion and feeling within the screenplay and acting itself. Ranging from the typically misunderstood, depressed teenager, to the crazy grandpa who has his heart in the right place and of course the smiley little girl who just wants everyone to happy. I think I liked the film because I can relate to each of the characters in their own little ways. The family itself are not your typical run of the mill ""happy as larry"" family. The determination and bonding of the family mixed in with the arguments and disagreements make it very bittersweet.

","I didn't found this movie as special as i expected, and i can't understand the Oscar awards that this movie won (1) Best writing original screenplay?, well i can say it's original, but it isn't a good script, i disagree with the academy in this; i didn't felt a good writing showing this loving family with not much success in their professions going together in a not very successful car, all this when Richard motivating encouraging talk about being successful is repeated trough all the story. (2) Alan Arkin for best actor?, If Alan won an Oscar for this short acting (he appears in less than half of the movie), and for taking drugs, i think that the actors Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly of Requiem for a Dream (2001) should have won the Oscar also; why the academy gave the Oscar to Arkin a lot of years after he was 2 time nominated in the 60's, well, i really don't know, but surely in those 2 nominations he acted the whole movie instead of this. Well i get laugh and really liked the character of Frank (Steve Carrell), as the funniest and more touching of the movie; i also liked Toni Collete as Sheryl, simply great!. I was also impressed knowing that this movie took 5 years to accomplish?, come on! 5 years!?, by matters of money, i really don't see the expenses in this film, besides the payment to the actors; and why they needed 5 different VW van for the filming?, i don't understand. But well, for the professional critics (i'm not one of them) this film is great and a masterpiece, for the IMDb voters, this movie is already in the top 250, but believe me, i tried but didn't saw too much good things in the movie, it was pretty standard to me and sometimes even boring.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE MOVIE: This film tells the story of the Hoovers, a particular family of Albuquerque, who consisted of: (1) Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin), a little girl that loved the beauty contests and her dream was to be in them, although she was a little fat and had big notorious glasses. (2) Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) the father of the family, who is a motivator speaker who promote his 9 steps theory to audiences, but his audiences where rather short (4 people average) (3) Dwayne (Paul Dano) the 'not Hoover' of the family who followed Nietzsche toughs and was having a vow of silence until he was accepted to the Air Force (4) Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) the number one Proust scholar, gay and failed-suicide uncle (5) Sheryl (Toni Collete) The mother of the family, who loved them all but not was very good at kitchen (fried chicken was the meal of almost every day) and (6) Grandpa Edwin Hoover (Alan Arkin), a heroin addicted old man that stayed in home all day.

Although 'Little Miss Sunshine' aims at satire, it is completely overwhelmed by perfectly acceptable clich√©s for the US mainstream public of today.<br/><br/>Take, for example, Uncle Frank: if you are gay, you can either end up bashed to death (as in 'Brokeback Mountain') or be a poor effeminate failure attempting suicide as in 'Little Miss Sunshine'; if you're rebellious, like brother Dwayne, you can take a wow of silence, but of course, your dream should be a correct one, that of becoming an air force pilot, and, of course, you definitely have to cry aloud that you f*** the entire world after discovering you can't. Of course, like the mother you should not smoke (THE crime in the US): notice that the husband blames her for that, but that nobody blames the grandfather for taking hard drugs every day: no surprise, since, as 'Traffic' has shown it brilliantly, the Americans have long ago lost their war on drugs: it has therefore become an acceptable vice. The only compassion might come from the fact, that, although Olive is fat, she is encouraged to go to the contest: again, this is no surprise, since America having become the fattest nation on Earth, you would offend about half of its 300 million citizens if you did not show this compassion. For what affects the final dance scene, it is totally ridiculous, with Olive being dressed almost like a prostitute. it is even bordering pedophilia, which does not seem to annoy the Academy Awards that much. To sum up, compared to various good satires of the '90s, for what affects social satire and family dysfunction, 'Little Miss Sunshine' definitely feels like a 1949 maccarthyst- approved satire."

The suicidal uncle, the failure father, the rebel without a cause brother, the drug addicted grandpa....all of them face their demons, so we get to all watch. The exposition of these sub plots is where the movie really loses its way. The coincidences involved in some of these things happening defy belief. (You go ahead and see how long you would have to wait at a gas station in the middle of Arizona for someone you know to wander by...as a for instance.) Of course such an event happens in this movie, The always underrated Greg Kinnear does a fantastic job as the driven, yet doomed to fail father. Steve Carrell is not called on to act much, as the Uncle, (Unless staring with glassy eyes, and speaking with a monotone is acting) however he does have a few good moments. The most interesting and funniest character in the movie is the grandfather, played by Alan Arkin. For a guy that is so familiar to so many movie goers, you will forget its him in just a few seconds of film time, and really believe he is this whacked out, obnoxious yet loving grandfather.<br/><br/>All in all, see the film, enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it to be a life changing experience."

Checking the brief TV review, I became aware that Alan Arkin had won an Oscar and the announcer before the start declared it had a wonderful script.<br/><br/>Surely this was a treat not to be missed!<br/><br/>The opening sequence did not seem to promise much with its series of misanthropic and narcissistic characters. A boy who refuses to speak and communicates via writing is a poor cinematic effect since the action always has to stop for him to write down. Alan Arkin appears with some foul mouthed whining. Surely this would improve.<br/><br/>The next outburst from Arkin is in the back of the van advocating underage sex in the crudest terms to the mute boy in the full presence of the family. This does not raise any questions about his suitability to spend the night alone in the same room as the girl (who is present at the time although conveniently doesn't hear) from any family member. Not even Steve Carroll though he is required to buy some hardcore porn for the old man to use.<br/><br/>At this point out of the blue my lodger said to me ""Who ever described this as a comedy should be sued under the trades description act."" Little did we both know that this was the comical highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Then Arkin died suddenly. Myself and my lodger looked at each other. Surely such an unpleasant incident was out of place in what I thought would be a fairly light comedy. We both speculated that maybe he wasn't really dead and a moment of comic relief would arise. But no. Arkin had won his Oscar for a crude walk-on consisting of only a few lines.<br/><br/>That not many tears were shed for this old horndog shows the lack of sympathy shown in this ""wonderful"" script. Instead he becomes a cheap (and disposable) comedy prop for some inept sequences which we've all seen before done before (Fawlty Towers has a great show around getting rid of a corpse, but that corpse is not related to anyone which would make it too tasteless).<br/><br/>By now, I was not only not laughing (nor was my lodger) but rather depressed. But such was the reputation of this film I'd received that I felt I had to watch it to the end.

Irony, irreverence, hyperbole and humor are actually used to good effect, to deliver an actual message. LMS gets its tone all wrong: it's slapstick meets sentimental with corny and crude thrown in. The overall outcome is a plot so obvious in its desired effect, so contrived, so dumbed down and so painfully executed, I still can't believe people defend it.<br/><br/>Toni Collette is one of the actresses I respect the most, so to see her talent eclipsed by bad dialogue and faux-emotion is very depressing indeed. <br/><br/>If this film has something to say about family dysfunction or the hypocrisy of child beauty pageants, it fails miserably. Much, much more is achieved in, say, an average ""intelligent"" sitcom episode. <br/><br/>One final point is that the characters are utterly unlikable.

It is a comedy of embarrassment yes,but one is embarrassed by the actors rather than for them.Their performances do not rise above the level of a TV soap opera but they clearly think they are involved in a cutting - edge movie that is daring to be different.Equally clearly,a lot of paying customers thought so to,but I beg to offer a dissenting opinion.

","LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE 2006 (TONI COLLETE, GREG KINNEAR, STEVE CARELL) DIRECTED BY: JONATHAN DAYTON & VALERIE FARIS ~ THE RUNDOWN: 'Little Miss Sunshine' is possibly the year's funniest film; a highly entertaining social commentary of originality and realism made with care. ~ When it comes to quirkiness and unintentional laughter it doesn't quite pack the wallop of Napoleon Dynamite, and even though the movie's funny in a satirical, realistic way instead of being goofy, it is comparable due to the pure originality and style of it in an increasingly formulaic genre plagued with clich√©s and stupidity. Also, it's really well shot and visually appealing. ~ It's true that people love to laugh at themselves; the best humor comes from simply observing ourselves, our families, our friends and the situations of the world that we live in. And, that's what 'Sunshine' does; as this family embarks on a troubled journey to help a family member take on her dreams it acts as a mirror that, through dialog, emotions, and comical situations, realistically reflects the silliness of our lives and the so-called horrors that haunt us on our road to death. Of course, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is indeed a little on the unlikely side at times and does side with conventionality quite a bit to get the necessary laughs, which isn't a bad thing because there's no reason to rely on quirkiness alone when you have brilliant acting and ingenious writing at your disposal. However, the only real negative aspect of the movie that comes to mind is the fact that it really is too depressing at times; this is after all a comedy, and its dramatics interfere too often with the film. ~ There's no doubt about it - this is a special movie...the type of movie that only comes around once a year on average, and is the type of the movie that when you see it, you know you're watching something unusually good. Overall, it's definitely worth a watch, and depending on who you are, it'll be worth many more."

","When the movie started, I wasn't sure from the feel of it that it was going to live up to what I thought it would be. However, as the movie progressed and everyone's personal and familial problems began to surface and resolve, I was very impressed. <br/><br/>Not to mention the 'broken horn' scene. I honestly do not think I have laughed so hard at a specific scene in a given movie. There were tears running down my face. I'm not sure if this just struck a cord with me in particular, but I think my fianc√© was laughing at the fact that I was laughing as opposed to what was happening. It was very refreshing. <br/><br/>See this movie."

","Often first feature films are flawed in a unique way. Dayton and Faris, the two directors on this picture, took years before they made their first feature film and their patience pays off. This is a brilliant funny film that perhaps suffers a little from being a lot like other American independent ensemble films, but it's just so whimsical and funny that I just didn't care. Great cast, great writing, patient directing (especially coming from two music video directors, although their videos are some of my favorites like Janet's ""Go Deep"" and all the Red Hot Chili Peppers videos they've done). <br/><br/>Not to mention the directors were there for a Q & A at the promotional screening the other night. They are lovely people, and capable filmmakers and I hope this film does really well so they can have carte-blanche with their next film.

But, I will tell you why I didn't like it very much.<br/><br/>Actually, I found each of the characters to be quite likable -- at the end of the movie. But, for the first half-hour or so I felt as if I were trapped in a room full of unruly children. I just wanted to get outside and take a deep breath. I guess it's just me, but I don't find humor in people being mean to other people.

","After the regional winner of the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant is withdrawn, young Olive Hoover (splendidly played by Abigail Breslin) is invited to Redondo Beach, in order to take part in the national beauty competition for pre-teens. Only she has two problems: (a) her family are too broke to fly there and (b) due to various circumstances, the road trip requires all barmy combatants of the family to travel as well. Among them includes the heroine-addicted grandpa (Alda), older brother Dwayne (Dano), who has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his goal of becoming a navy pilot, and her suicidal gay uncle Frank (Carell, playing against type) who has to be monitored at all times. And, of course, they encounter any number of problems and mishaps along the way. Whilst the movie ends on a misjudged elaborate comic set piece, for the most part Little Miss Sunshine is consistently funny, if not nearly as acerbic as it could have been. This is thanks largely to both Alan Alda, as the foul-mouthed, bawdy grandpa who says whatever the hell he likes, and Greg Kinnear as a relentless self-improving dad, and failed motivational speaker."

The way Dwayne desperately tried to connect with his mom by telling Olive to ""go hug mom"" in writing. The way Frank looked at Dwayne with a gradual realization that they are one in suffering. Even minor characters such as the doctor checking himself when telling the family the cause of death bec. a child was present. The waitress smiling knowingly because she has seen this family dynamics so often times before. Linda, the bereavement liason from hell, trying desperately to appear symphathetic but finally cracking from all the maltreatment from the aforementioned md.<br/><br/>All these and more little moments like these added to the big showcase scenes make for a satisfying time at the movies.

"gunigunilamang","10","8","16","18 August 2006"," Exuberant and touching comedy
","Why can't I give this movie more than 10 stars? What a wonderful, funny and joyous movie! Storytellling at it's best, Little Miss Sunshine begins with little Olive's eyes as she peers into a beauty pageant on video over and over. We are skillfully introduced to the characters---all robustly interesting---via quick, snappy shots of the camera. It is enough to draw me in hook, line and sinker. As they all converge in the dining room, mother, father, son, little Olive, her grandfather and uncle, we suddenly realize that we are not just observers but participants---cleverly being engaged into investing emotionally with the family that we suddenly find disturbingly familiar. Before we realize it, we are taken on a hilarious 'roadtrip. But lest I give you the impression that this is a roadtrip movie, (it's not...) let me just say that every turn this movie makes is a revelation---a new and refreshing metaphor of dreams and hopes; of that journey that we all want to take--- the one that leads up to the summit of our innermost desires.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect. Duane, the son, has taken a vow of silence and is turned on to Friedrich Nietzsche. The grandfather, recently kicked out of his retirement home after being caught snorting coke, is played by the wondrous Alan Arkin who gives the character its heart. He is perfect in the role. The uncle, Frank, has just been released from the hospital for a failed suicide attempt. Played by Steve Carell, we were transfixed by his mesmerizing performance---a man full of hurt, disappointment and loss but never losing that comedic quality perfectly pitched to make us fall inlove with him. The father, Richard, played by Greg Kinnear, is a 'motivational speaker' intent on reaching the summit of success but sadly, does not have what it takes to get there. The development and evolution of his character is an Oscar worthy tour de force. Every tick, every wrinkle, every tilt of his head is magic. We clearly see what goes on inside. We can almost hear him talking to himself. When the movie reaches it's joyous pitch perfect denouement, Greg Kinnear shines the brightest as his character lets loose. We want to root for him. I found myself laughing and then crying joyously with him and his family as they all unite in a sweeping gesture of solidarity, pride and joyous opposition. Toni Collette, who plays Sheryl, Olive's mother, is phenomenal, as usual. She is the glue that holds the family together.<br/><br/>Watch for two of the most poignant and unforgettable scenes in the movie. The first one, between Olive and her grandpa, the night before the big pageant. Beautifully nuanced, the characters seem to jump right out of the screen and into your heart. The second, between Olive and her brother, played by a gem of an actor, Paul Dano, as brother and sister whose magical connection to each other is so palpable, you'd swear you heard some dialogue. Then you realize there's none. And yes, what you clearly hear is simply the beating of your own heart as the audience holds its breath in utter tenderness. It would be a travesty if this movie eludes multiple Oscar nods. But then again, I would not be surprised.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is rated R for language and some reference to pornography. Some may find the pageant scenes offensive. They would be looking at the glass half empty for this movie is full of heart, soul and magic. They rightfully do not deserve to see nor enjoy the beauty and pathos that this wonderful movie carries in spades. This one's a definite treasure trove of art expressed in the images of fine movie-making."

","Every year there seems to be some sort of miracle film that drops out of nowhere usually associated with the independent scene and The Sundance Film Festival and the latest of its breed, is a real winning gem about what it means to be a loser winningly and with deft melancholic grace. <br/><br/>The Hoover family is your atypical loving yet dysfunctional American brood (whose isn't, am I right people?!): Richard (Kinnear giving his best performance to date with canny deftness) , the patriarch, is a budding self-help 9-step motivational speaker who dreams of going onto national acclaim by investing his family's wealth and spirit into a venture best described as self-fulfilled; his wife, Sheryl (Collette excellent as always and ditto for her turn here), is a loving yet tired woman who only wants what's best for everyone even if it means living vicariously through their ideal wishes; her children, Dwayne (Dano channeling a mute John Cusack), is a rebellious 15-year old who worships Nietzsche, and has taken a nine-month and counting vow of silence until he gets accepted into the Air Force as a fighter pilot, communicating only through a placid, vacant stare of contempt and angst and a memo pad to scratch his replies; and youngest daughter Olive (the adorable Breslin, arguably the finest child actress of recent memory; the anti-Dakota Fanning if you will; natural to a fault), a 7-year old whose reservoir of good cheer is only superseded by her desire to enter the titular talent contest. <br/><br/>Adding to the mix is Grandpa (Arkin, always welcome on screen and is a hoot here), a cranky counterrevolutionary whose expulsion from his retirement home due to his ongoing heroin dependency forces him to shack up with his son and family, including Sheryl's brother, Frank (Carell, scruffily bearded, giving a stunningly poignant and hilarious performance), 'the nation's preeminent Proust scholar"" (a running gag throughout the film) recently released from the hospital after an unsuccessful suicide attempt due to a broken heart, misjudgment of an affair and the subsequent loss of his job. <br/><br/>As the recently reunited Frank is about to have dinner with the Hoover clan they are interrupted by an answering machine message by Olive's aunt proclaiming her a finalist for the pageant prompting the little girl in a fit of ecstasy running pell mell throughout the house, haphazardly packing for the trip from her Albuquerque environs to California where the contest is. Amidst the brouhaha, Richard finally acquiesces to his daughter's destiny and figuring to seal the deal for his foray into public speaking packs up the entire family in their vintage mellow yellow VW bus en route for a truly memorable (and ultimately touching) adventure.<br/><br/>What follows are a series of hysterical and warmly felt emotional sequences running the gambit from life lessons, to moments of clarity and even an epiphany or too but with some seriously funny pieces of dialogue and sight gags (the VW's gears are stripped when Sheryl unsuccessfully attempts to learn stick forcing the entire group to push start and then scramble back into the vehicle) that will have you laughing out loud long and hard (it certainly did me!)<br/><br/>Directed by husband-wife team of Dayton and Faris (successful video auteurs) in their big-screen debut the film rollicks along with its punchy humor, insightful digs at societal ills (pornography, straight, gay and decidedly pre-adolescent in the form of the final act's grotesque freak show of little girls in fashion model make-up and Bobble-Headed frozen grimaces masking smiles); familial discord (life and literally death is decided upon at the drop of a dime); and making judgments that will solidify the actions leading up to them. <br/><br/>Novice screenwriter Michael Arndt's arch and melancholic screenplay is right on the money at the black satire and human drama that he etches with real characters you root for and surprisingly identify with as they face one pitfall after another in the giddy yet ice-cream ache of their quest. It is one of the few screenplays in recent memory where I was laughing through tears and vice versa.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is one to die for and kudos to all of the primary actors. Each has their moments that are too numerous to mention but I seriously mean it when I think this film is the best comedy and perhaps the best of the year and should be recognized in various Oscar categories , not the least of which is its sterling, affective acting from Kinnear as the control-freak daddy with blinders on to his own arrogance until he sees the light; Collette, one of my faves of all time, with such nuance that nibbling angrily on a Popsicle dessert speaks volumes; Carell, miles away from his doofus roles of the past, gives a remarkable balance of sadness and sarcasm, as his troubled soul; Arkin, a national treasure as arguably the hippest cinematic grandpa of all time and wise (""Sleep with a lot of girls! Not one; a lot!"") despite his foolish substance abuse; Dano saying so much with barely a raised eyebrow of the insanity he must witness (his ""Give Mom A Hug"" note a highlight of hilarious poignancy); and Breslin, who gave such a heart-rending turn in last year's indie ""Keane"", is downright perfect as the so-full-of hope Olive that her innocence is never betrayed in spite of its razor- thin tightrope of loss (trust me, you'll never be able to hear ""Super Freak"" again the same!); she is the heart and soul of this winning comedy that tickles the funny bone and warms the heart. <br/><br/>I need to add one other little thought before concluding, when I heard the hauntingly beautiful theme music of Devotchka's ""How it Ends"" (it appeared in ""Everything is Illuminated""'s trailer) my heart raced and a smile spread across my face that practically never left. It is perfect. And so is the film."
"jotix100","10","9","19","17 August 2006"," The road to Redondo Beach
","I don't know why, but the tragic image of JonBenet Ramsey came to mind as I watched this acerbic commentary in the way children are exposed to an early age to the fantasy and phony world of beauty pageants. Imagine our shock when that same night we heard about the capture of the murderer of the little girl, ten years after she suffered a death she didn't deserve.<br/><br/>But, we are getting side tracked here. Although the competition for Miss Little Sunshine is at the center of this film, the movie is a sad commentary on the American family. To say that this family is dysfunctional, is to put it mildly. After all, both parents work for a living. That leaves little Olive and Dwayne without real supervision at home. The grandfather, although well meaning, has a bigger problem of his own, he is a drug user! Right by watching at the earthy Olive, one realizes, she is no beauty pageant competitor. By a fluke, she gets a slot in the competition because another girl has dropped out. Since we never see her doing, or practicing, her routine, we have no inkling as what it will be like when she takes to the stage.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, uncle Frank, has attempted to commit suicide as the story begins. Frank who is gay has been abandoned by the hunk he was in love with, only to see him go to another, more famous, and wealthier guy. He is made to share Dwayne's room, something that doesn't go too well with the teen ager nephew. Frank is rescued by the kind Sheryl, a working mother who barely has time to cook the family dinner and has to resort to bringing fast food chicken almost every night, something that irritates Grandpa, and the rest of the family.<br/><br/>Sheryl and her husband Richard, are having a crisis in their marriage. Richard, a motivational speaker with little talent, has no control on what's going on in his life and his family. When Richard learns about Olive's invitation to participate in the pageant, he happily agrees to take the road trip from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach, a trip that will, in many ways help him and the family bond in ways they never thought possible.<br/><br/>This film boasts two directors. Sometimes, when this happens, the end result, in most cases, turns out to be bad, which is not the case with this endearing independent movie. Jonathan Dayton and his wife, Valerie Faris, have their hearts in the right places, and it shows. They directed with great style helped by the wonderful screen play of Michael Ardnt. It's no wonder the film was loved in Sundance last winter.<br/><br/>The directors got an ensemble acting from their wonderful cast. Gregg Kinnear has one of his best roles in quite some time; he shows he was the man for this part. Toni Collette, who plays the grounded Sheryl, once again gives an effortless performance as she transforms herself into this woman. Not having been a fan of Steve Carell, we must recognize he makes a valuable contribution to the success of the picture. Veteran Alan Arkin doesn't have much to do. Abigail Breslin's Olive is one of the best things in the film. She is not bratty or obnoxious. She is a little girl who, like many of her peers, is manipulated by the media business into becoming adults when she should be playing and having a great time with other little girls, instead of being what she is not. Finally, Paul Dano, who doesn't speak for most of the length of the movie is good as Dwayne.<br/><br/>The pageant sequence showed to what extend little girls are transformed into travesties of older young women with their excessive make-up and big hairdos. It is kind of sickening seeing these girls try to imitate adults in ways that rob from their childhood. It is indeed, a sad commentary on parents who encourage their children to participate in these competitions."

","I have seen many movies about dysfunctional families, but rarely if ever have I seen one as good or as funny as ""Little Miss Sunshine"". It not only shows the fictional Hoover family's messed-up existence, but shows how daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the least damaged; maybe it's because she's the youngest, so there's hope for her.<br/><br/>Anyway, the family. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) hosts pep talks where he reminds people of the nine steps to becoming a winner (because, as he puts it, winners know that they're going to win); none of his steps really seem to amount to anything in his own home, especially with the advice that he gives Olive. Mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) tries to be a homemaker, but is clearly unsatisfied with life. Son Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence in hopes of becoming a jet pilot. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) prides himself on his perverted - but quite hilarious - lifestyle. Uncle Frank (Steve Carell) recently tried to commit suicide and seems to have a slight form of Asperger's Syndrome, making it hard for him to read social cues. And daughter Olive, she's participating in a beauty contest.<br/><br/>When they have to drive to Redondo Beach for the beauty pageant, they have an experience that they never could have imagined. Each one gets to see just how messed up s/he is. Even though they all seem weird, we can't help but admire each of them. But the beauty pageant itself is the highlight. It affirms that there is definitely hope for Olive, and not the kind that dad suggested! Anyway, I can't recommend this movie enough. It's one that you just gotta see."

","This movie made a pretty strong statement about the world of child beauty pageants. The sexual nature of Olive's routine was shocking, initially, but was soon put into perspective when you considered the routines of the other contestants. The other little girls weren't using sex directly in their routines, but the hair, makeup, bathing suits, striking a pose for the camera...all of those things are part of the sexualization of children in these disgusting pageants. Although the pageant scene itself was uncomfortable, the movie did a great job of capturing the ickiness of child pageant, but leaving the audience to draw their own conclusions. Watching those little contestants brought Jon Benet Ramsey to mind, and I wonder if her tragic fate had any part in the creating of this movie?"
"majikstl","2","8","17","10 February 2007"," Little Miss American Beauty ...
","The film LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE builds, not surprisingly, to the ""Little Miss"" beauty pageant of the title. As the pageant unfolds, we -- I guess -- are suppose to be appalled by the sight of little girls strutting around on stage doing make-believe provocative routines, while dressed in sorta sexually suggestive clothes. Yet, when the film's little protagonist, Olive Hoover, takes the stage dressed like Diane Keaton in ANNIE HALL, but does a dance routine more like Demi Moore in STRIPTEASE (while ""Super Freak"" plays in the background!), we -- I guess -- are supposed to be amused by how cute she is. Am I missing something here? Why do the filmmakers take such a condescending view of child beauty pageants, with the implications that the participants are being somehow exploited, yet they seem to celebrate when their little darling behaves in a manner that is infinitely more tasteless? <br/><br/>After I finished watching LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE the first time, my reaction was a shrug and a ""So what!"" I didn't see what all the fuss was about. This R-rated ""family"" comedy just didn't seem like all that much to me. Plus, as the weeks passed and I thought about it more, the less I could remember about any of it that was even just okay. After seeing it a second time, the thought of the film just flat-out gives me the creeps. It is like someone took a nice banal and benign Disney film and did everything they could to dirty it up, while trying to retain a thin veneer of it being sweet and innocent. Ironically, as the film seems to condemn beauty pageants for making something sleazy out of something cute, that is exactly what the filmmakers do with their story. A slight tale about an ugly duckling hoping to be a swan ends up having the moral that ""life is just one f*****g beauty pageant after another!"" That's not how I remember Hans Christian Andersen phrasing it.<br/><br/>There is never a moment in the film where the heavy hand of contrivance doesn't manipulate the actions of all involved. For some illogical reason, little Miss Olive is at the last minute notified that she can compete in the title beauty pageant, despite the fact she lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico and the pageant seems to be a local event in Southern California. Because the plot hinges on it, the entire family is forced to go to the event, all piling into a beat up, old VW minibus that has ""phony plot gimmick"" written all over it. What follows is a series of scenes where nobody seems to like each other, but where the story stops regularly to show just how much they really, really, really love each other. Yawn!<br/><br/>I guess we are suppose to find this dysfunctional bunch adorable. Abigail Breslin is cute enough as the 10-year-old wannabe beauty queen and Steve Carell does well as gay Uncle Frank, though just what point is being served by making him a suicidal depressive is not obvious. And with heavyhanded irony, the film makes it clear that step-dad Richard (Greg Kennear) is a motivational speaker whose positive thinking theories for success clearly don't work for him. Toni Colette is given the thankless job of being the almost-invisible mother. And it says something about this family that brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is fifteen and no one has yet to notice that he is color blind and can't tell red from green. Don't these people even celebrate Christmas? No wonder the kid is angry and has taken a vow of silence.<br/><br/>But the film stretches its creep factor to the limit with Grandpa Edwin; played by Alan Arkin, Grandpa would be nothing more than the stereotype of a cantankerous foul-mouthed old coot accept that he is also a heroin user and has a porn habit -- both of which he indulges on this family outing. This is the filmmakers' idea of charming. When we find out that sex-obsessed Grandpa is apparently Olive's frequent babysitter and pageant coach, the thought of Grandpa locked away with Olive in the basement, high on drugs as he teaches her how to shake her groove thing and do a crowd-pleasing burlesque, should make your skin crawl. Even assuming that nothing funny is going on between Gramps and Olive, it says something that the filmmakers don't even recognize just how improper and unhealthy the idea appears to be. Do they actually think this is a typical American Family?<br/><br/>The only fascinating thing about the film is that it was one of the most critically praised films of 2006, despite its fake sentimentality, contrived plot twists and sleazy dishonesty. I can only assume that its mean streak has somehow been mistaken for satirical bite.<br/><br/>There is a smug and demeaning attitude that permeates this entire film, yet there is little justification apparent for the film or its makers to, in any way, feel superior. It's rancid cynicism doesn't even make the film hip and cool, or even dark and thought-provoking. Being no more a ""feel good"" family comedy than AMERlCAN BEAUTY was an honest look at the middle class, the film is shallow and crude and just not very nice. I suppose screenwriter Michael Arndt thinks he is making a bold statement about our competitive society, but what that may be is hard to see. The film ends with officials trying to yank little Olive off the stage, only to have her entire family join her to show their support for her mock striptease, disrupting the entire pageant. The message seems to be if you can't win, then ruin it for everyone else. It scores no point for congeniality either."
"jcwla","1","21","56","27 August 2006"," Movie I've Hated Most in 3 Years' Time
","This movie plays with ""Pieces of April"" in an endless double feature in Hell.<br/><br/>Each character has only one personality trait, but has several cutesy-poo idionsyncrasies. Everybody argues nonstop. Everybody is loud and vulgar. Nobody is likable, pleasant or enjoyable to be around. Every line of dialogue is so false you can see the script as these (in some cases) talented actors mouth these god-awful words. The poor little girl's routine is so age-inappropriate it feels truly queasy and in no way humorous. The plot contrivances creak so badly you can hear the strain. Steve Carell's nemesis and the object of his affection look less like Proust scholars than a Fire Island maven and his kept boy. The film overrelies on broad, unfunny physical comedy and shtick.<br/><br/>In short, it's torture to sit through."

","This movie, with its deceptively benign title, was recommended to us by an acquaintance. We were looking forward to a nice, heartwarming movie about a girl in a pageant. We tolerated perhaps 25 minutes of profanity, especially from an older man who was adamantly, and profanely, promoting a promiscuous lifestyle, before we let ourselves off the hook and shut it off. We found the entire thing to be incredibly offensive. We were embarrassed by it. We cannot imagine showing it to children. We cannot imagine recommending it to anyone. We sincerely hope it never wins an award of any kind. It is deeply disturbing to me that this movie is being promoted as 'pro-family'. It is certainly not pro-MY-family."

I need a good story as well that holds my attention. This one is just a stupid, boring movie. Greg Kinnear for example has become a very good actor and I enjoyed him in Invincible which I consider an enjoyable movie. Will that one win any awards? No but this junk will.

","What an awful movie. I really did not see why The Washington Post and WETA film critics thought this movie was the comedy of the summer or why the Sundance Film Festival people thought the movie was laugh-out loud funny. From start to finish, it's a string of dirty little jokes told or acted out by the unlikeable little characters of this dysfunctional family and the people they encounter along their way to a kiddie beauty pageant with its 5- and 6-year old JonBenet Ramsay look-alikes in bikinis being ogled by dirty old men. <br/><br/>The characters cannot even claim credit as endearing eccentrics like the characters in Anne Tyler's novels and the film made from her story, The Accidental Tourist. There is nothing endearing about any of them, except perhaps chubby little Olive, and even she doesn't really win your heart. Since the reviews said this was a laugh-out-loud comedy, I kept trying to find appropriate places to laugh. No one in the audience helped cue me in by laughing either. Maybe a laugh track like the TV sitcoms would help us find the humor in this movie. Until then, save your money! Or better yet, for a first rate flick, go to see the Devil Wears Prada!"

"aurora7","10","6","12","25 July 2006"," Beautiful losers indeed!
","I just came out of a packed house preview here in Montreal with a buddy of mine and like *W*O*W*! Were we ever surprised! Not only did the house literally come down with the amount of laughter coming out of the audience, but I kid you not, every single person who walked out after wards had a wistful but goofy smile plastered across their face.<br/><br/>First off, this cast was superb all round. It goes without saying that Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear and Alan Arkin are all talented - we already know that given their respective bodies of work. Thank heavens that Dakota Fanning wasn't cast as Olive and I hope Abigail Breslin starts to put a dent in Dakota's career from now on. This little girl really has some serious acting chops and testament to that was her ability to be absolutely sweet and insecure at the same time without looking wide-eyed, spacey and screaming all the time. Steve Carell was another revelation, we already know what a talented comedian he is but who would have guessed this guy can also do serious acting? In the beginning he is an extremely tortured soul, life has thrown him enough knocks in a relatively short amount of time where he is literally at the brink of losing it. His embarrassment at facing a lost love, his shame and his pain are all very, very palpable, more so because in some ways we've all been there. This isn't Shakespearian tragedy on a mythic scale, this is the wear and tear of everyday, commonplace loss we have all to some degree felt. He really brought a level of humanity to his role, something we barely see in Hollywood anymore. Another name to keep a look out for the future is Paul Dano, who play's Dwayne, the Nietzche-reading angst-ridden goth teen-aged older brother who has taken a vow of silence until that time he is accepted to become an Air Force pilot. Literally without saying a word for 80% of this film, he was able to express the magnitude of his disgust at his family, his situation and ultimately himself with nothing more than body language, facial expressions and pure presence. His scene where he discovers the reality of his situation was easily the most intense in the film and one of the most honest and emotionally painful to watch.<br/><br/>In many ways, this movie is about beautiful losers, one by one as each main character faces loss and needs to deal with the reality of lost dreams and hopes, they start to place their hopes and wishes on Olive and the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach, California. What you also realize is underneath this picture of a completely dysfunctional family and the personal ""issues"" each individual carries, beneath it all, every person in this family ultimately has a lot of love for one another especially for Olive. Once they realize that they're not going to get what they want, they take that hope and drive and give it to Olive unselfishly.<br/><br/>The film is also a literal and symbolic meditation on journeys - yeah, they're on a road trip from Arizona to California and some of the scenes were indeed shot beautifully but it's also about how members of this family also had to journey far inside themselves to help Olive in this one crazy weekend. It is also an indictment on the culture of fierce competition which we are all living in, winning at all costs and the insanity of how these ideas are already, insidiously affecting children from the get-go. Watching some of the kids in the beauty pageant alone was sickening. In some ways, it shows that it's not competition which is always the best thing but cooperation can do the job just as well minus the neuroses and emotional damage.<br/><br/>Did I also mention how hilarious this film is? I won't give away the ending but please do your best to make this the sleeper hit of 2006. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a deeply-satisfying film experience."

There are a few laughs, and lots of sight gags repeated over and over again, but there is really nothing about this movie that feels real."
"nintendovi","4","5","10","27 March 2008"," ""Typical"" Independent Movie
","I want to start by saying, Little Miss Sunshine is not an entirely bad movie - it's just not my kind of movie. Everything comes down to a dysfunctional family putting aside their personal problems to help support the little girl, Olive, in her trip to the beauty pageant. On the way drama and awkwardness ensues, and while everyone starts out a little unhappy at the beginning of the ride, at the end of the day they're all in a good mood despite the crappy events that occurred. I guess the key theme in this movie is ""Optimism"", or something of that nature.<br/><br/>The acting is alright, but nothing that you would necessarily call 'remarkable'. Steve Carell made a very believable suicide-attempter (though I don't know why they made him gay, to be honest his sexual orientation didn't really matter) and you could sense his uneasiness with the group early on, Alan Arkin did nice work portraying the perverse, drug-addicted grandpa, and even Greg Kinnear had a notable role as the father who was really into his job but failed to realize that the reason he wasn't doing well selling the program was because he was a nobody.<br/><br/>I did not, however, care for the acting of Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano. I had a hard time believing that this little girl was as charming as everyone said she was, and the teen kid was just very fake. I liked the girl's scene with the grandpa where it showed his softer side and that he really cared about his granddaughter, and I liked Carell's scene with the teen because he had someone he could finally talk to in the family without seeming weird around. When Olive finally did her pageant act it was funny, but that kind of ties into her grandfather's influence on her.<br/><br/>There's a couple of funny moments here and there, but it's mostly drama, and drama emphasized through action over words much of the time. I don't want to listen to people swear their heads off at each other and then get quiet and hug for two minutes. A lot of it just came off as being forced, it's like this movie tried too hard to be a regular independent movie. I can't see myself watching this a second time, and definitely not a third. It's pretty much overrated."

"sddavis63","3","5","10","3 November 2007"," Welcome To Hell
","I was totally unfamiliar with this movie, but based on the title I was expecting it to be either an expose or a parody of the whole child beauty contest concept. It accomplishes that, but only in the last twenty minutes or so, after the Hoover family arrives at the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant so that Olive (Abigail Breslin) could compete. To be honest, I found the whole portrayal of the pageant a bit creepy, watching these young girls dressed up like adults and marching around in bathing suits, covered in makeup. I've never actually been to any contest like that, but from pictures I've seen in the media I would imagine that this wasn't far off the mark. Frankly it's sad that such contests exist; sadder still that there are parents who actually let their daughters compete in them.<br/><br/>OK. Enough of the sermon. On to the movie itself. My expectations notwithstanding, this movie wasn't actually about the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. It was really the story of a completely dysfunctional family struggling to somehow come together during a journey from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach to make Olive's dream come true. And this family was dysfunctional. There's the brother (Paul Dano) who refuses to talk, the gay uncle (Steve Carell) who tried to kill himself, the grandpa (Alan Arkin) who's obsessed with sex and drugs, the father (Greg Kinnear) who's obsessed with success at all costs and the mother (Toni Collette) who - well, I never actually did quite figure her out.The problem as far as I was concerned was that, while they may have been dysfunctional, I didn't find any of these people to be fun, and some of them were downright unlikeable. Brother Dwayne's message to Uncle Frank as he took up residence with the family (""Welcome to Hell"") struck me as a totally accurate portrayal of life in that home, and not a bad description of the movie itself.<br/><br/>There were a few good scenes. Smuggling grandpa's body out of the hospital was mildly amusing, and the final moments of the trip to Redondo Beach as the family struggles to figure out how to get to the hotel was a pretty good ride. Grandpa also offered what I thought was a pretty good definition of a loser - ""someone who's so afraid of not winning that they don't even try."" I can buy that. The final moments of the movie, however - revolving around Olive's dance number at the competition - turned me off completely. It might have succeeded in bringing the family together, but that they would come together around such a grotesque performance for a child that age was pathetic. In general terms, I found very little here that I liked. 3/10"

"Asa_Nisi_Masa2","8","5","10","6 October 2006"," When dreaming the wrong dream
","I hadn't seen my grandmother in a little while and decided to take her out to the cinema yesterday afternoon. She normally doesn't enjoy dramas, so we both opted for this comedy, Little Miss Sunshine. What a delightfully cynical, yet ultimately big-hearted movie this was! Perhaps not hugely original in all its aspects (for example, Greg Kinnear's was a bit of a stock character...), though still very fresh, very funny and unexpectedly in the end, heart-warming without the least bit of schmaltz or manipulative slyness. It got better and better, culminating in some classic sequences by the last quarter.<br/><br/>I left the cinema smiling at its ultimate message, a modern and more sensible twist on the usual ""American dream"" message (one of success as a means of measuring one's ultimate worth as a human being). As the suicidal, Proust-scholar uncle and his Nietzsche-loving nephew tell each other at one point, this movie believes that what ultimately really matters is that one should end up doing the things in life that really make one feel happy. A simple, but valuable message - one that could avoid so many neuroses if it were truly grasped by the vast majority of the world's population. Also, many of the movie's characters learnt that if it turns out you're not good enough for something - say, something you've been dreaming of achieving all your life - it usually means that that thing isn't actually good enough for YOU, and that you should hanker after something that's right and worthy of you. Basically, you can't fit a star-shaped peg into a heart-shaped hole. We can all be misled by the wrong dream, and it's all just a part of living this life to learn this, and move on - seeking out something that's more right for us, for the individual that WE are.<br/><br/>The little girl actress who played Olive was adorable and never in a precocious brat kind of way - this is saying something, as I often have a problem with child-actors for this very reason. The characters were generally all great - and oh, the grand-dad! He did crack me up, as well as my grandmother! And the final scene in the last 10 minutes, with the whole family dancing to Olive's tune at that grotesque beauty pageant was good enough to give you a natural high, like visual cocaine. Here in Rome where I watched the movie, it had the whole cinema in stitches - and I went to the mid-afternoon showing with my grandmother, so it was mainly other grannies who were there! But even to them, that scene was exhilarating. An intelligent, fluffy yet non-superficial feel-good movie with a core of unexpected wisdom."

","I had been yearning to see Little Miss Sunshine for quite a while and was thrilled when it came to the theater at which I work. They usually send us mainstream blockbuster crapola, and snub their noses to independent films, but succumbed to the rave reviews and high demand for this one.<br/><br/>Those rave reviews are well earned, as Little Miss Sunshine towers above nearly every other film I've seen this year, across all genre boundaries. It manages to be dark, hilarious, and touching and uplifting, and surprisingly, none of these moods conflict or step on the other's toes. It shifts gears (pun intended) quite well among themes.<br/><br/>If you know absolutely nothing of the plot and wish to, stop at the end of this paragraph. Everything said below is revealed in the first couple of minutes of film, if not in trailers and TV spots.<br/><br/>The basic plot follows a somewhat dysfunctional family. Greg Kinnear plays Richard Hoover, a father of two and struggling motivational speaker. His wife, Sheryl (Toni Collette) takes in her brother, Frank, a top Proust scholar after his failed suicide attempt. Dwayne is 15, and a mute by choice, and Olive is 7 and finds out that due to a beauty pageant scandal, she has been crowned the winner of the Little Miss Chili Pepper Pageant in Alberquerque, and is eligible to go to California to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. Her grandfather (Alan Arkin), a loud, somewhat crass and oddly insightful old man helps her craft her routine. The bulk of the film takes place on the ensuing road trip taken by the six family members in their old, broken down, yellow VW Hippie Bus.<br/><br/>This film is really nothing short of spectacular. It takes a good hard look at a family so different from each other, but so strongly united by both blood and events. That look also happens to be hilarious, but the film would have probably worked if they worked the screenplay as a drama as well. It is amazingly well written, clever and original. It works a lot of pretty deep themes with some cheaper gags. One of the best revolves around the clutch of the VW Bus. Alan Arkin provides some of the films funniest moments. His character is great.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line: Go see this film, now. Everything about it clicks, and I doubt there will be a better dark comedy this year. You can thank me later for recommending it.<br/><br/>Seriously, I expect written thanks."

""Everybody loves it!"" I was beginning to resent humanity at this point. I was shaking so badly by the end of this last viewing that I wanted to shout at the screen, ""did you really ever read Marcel Proust? Why are you defecating on his name like this?!"" I was flabbergasted. Nobody I was with had even heard of Marcel Proust before this film. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. This film is for most ordinary people. And most ordinary people haven't read Marcel Proust. Yeah, the kid is cute. Did she deserve an Oscar nomination? No. Did Alan Arkin deserve the Oscar?

Over all I would prefer to rate it out of five and if I could you would be looking at something around three out of five."
"mOVIemAN56","9","4","8","22 February 2007"," One of the best dark comedies around
","Little Miss Sunshine is a little drop of sunshine of 2006. With a year that saw some of the best films to be released in awhile (Snakes on a Plane, The Wicker Man, and Bloodrayne just to name a few) Little Miss Sunshine stands helplessly against these awesome films. Little Miss Sunshine is a smart, delicately crafted, dark comedy about the common dysfunctional family of America. <br/><br/>Olive is the only normal one of her family. Her brother has taken a vow of silence, her father is constantly obsessed with succeeding, her grandpa is a heroine addict, her uncle is suicidal, and her mother just tries to live through it all. All their personalities are thrown together when they must reach Los Angeles to get Olive to a beauty pageant.<br/><br/>The story is very strong when presented with the right characters and actors. For an independent film, the strong cast brought together of no names and big stars a like is surprising. The story, which is predominantly inside the VW bus the re driving cross country in. There are no dull points however even with the characters restricted to their seats. There are some hilarious moments of awkwardness and just flat out funny scenes between Alan Arkan and the rest of the cast along with one particular classic moment between a cop and Greg Kinnear on the highway.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell gives, in my opinion, his best performance to date as the laid back suicidal uncle. Everyone thinks of Carrell as a no-talent actor who just does comedy. It's a bad trend going on these days thinking comedy actors can not act. He proves with his role as Frank that he can act and still be funny.<br/><br/>Alan Arkan is not an actor well known to me, I remember him from And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself but that was about it. Alan Arkan's character is the best of the film. He is dirty, he is strange, and he is hilarious. I wouldn't mind seeing Arkan in a lot more roles in the future.<br/><br/>All the actors deliver great performances along with Carrell and Arkan. The little girl, Abigail Breslin, gives a great performance that has earned her an Osar nod. A lot of adults and teenagers a like will enjoy the dialogue between many of the characters and learn a lesson or two about being a family. Warning: this is not a film for families. The word f*ck is present numerous times. Do not show to kids under 14.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine. 4.5/5 Stars"

","And now all the commercials with the Best Pix tag line will be harassing the airwaves until the Oscars.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to watching ""Little Miss Sunshine"" because there's nothing like a great movie. Kinda like when you're sucked into a great book. And from all the hype I was confident this flick would deliver. Yet I was wrong.<br/><br/>It's one of those movies that starts strong but loses a lot of air after the first half hour. Much of the humor was contrived. Many times to the level of a TV sitcom. ""Three's Company"" comes to mind. You know, like when Jack's helping Janet change a light bulb and Chrissy's in the other room listening to their conversation and thinking all sorts of things. Story elements were predictable where a couple of situations were inspired by other films and outright lifted from them as well. Not necessarily bad, but contrived. <br/><br/>I know, I used that word about thirty words ago. Yet that's how I felt watching ""Little Miss Sunshine."" And this surprised me because of the word of mouth this movie was receiving. After viewing it and observing all the praise it's getting on TV, I feel like I live in another country."

There are no special effects, no grand set designs or extravagant costumes. Acting by the whole cast is excellent. The script shows one dysfunctional argument after another. The arguments are interesting and non-superficial. The events that happen are bizarre and comical, such as the car breaking down and subsequent pushes for the car to start, or the removal of a dead body.

","God, I am so glad I let my guard down for this movie, when I saw the poster for Little Miss Sunshine at the movie theater, it seemed like a lame movie and when I saw the excellent rating here on IMDb, I figured it was one of those movies that only the artsy people got because I hadn't seen any of the trailers for Little Miss Sunshine, so I didn't want to bother. But when I was renting movies I guess I could just give the movie a chance, like I said, it was such a good rating on IMDb, for the most part, some of the movies on the top 250 are pretty good.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is about this family who has just brought their suicidal relative to live with them and when the little girl, Olive, wins by default to be in the Little Miss Sunshine contest in California, the 9-step obsessed father, the nice and honest mom, the silent son, the perverted grandpa, the hard working little girl, and the suicidal man all take a bus cross country to get to this pageant. But of course there are always... well... little bumps along the way.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine was such a terrific movie because it wasn't just the acting, but it seemed like the real American family that everyone could relate to in one way or another. I remember going on vacation with my family when we would go to visit my grandpa, who was also a pervert, and the craziness that would ensue on the way there. But Steve said it all ""The suffering years turn out to be the best years of your life, because they make you who you are"".<br/><br/>10/10"
"Minkwan","9","4","8","16 October 2006"," A Little Gem.
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is the perfect antidote for all the homogenized films flooding the multiplexes at the moment. Directed by first-timers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and written by Michael Arndt, the film is constructed around Hollywood clich√©s, such as the underdog, road-movie, dysfunctional family, but remains fresh, honest and genuinely funny and touching. This is due, in no small part, to the fact happy endings and overt feel good statements are brushed aside for truth and awkwardness.<br/><br/>Toni Collette is perfect, as one would expect, but it is Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear who show acting talent beyond expectations. Alan Arkin provides another solid performance as the wise, hippie grandfather, but it is the new guard of actors Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano who shine in my opinion. Breslin brings raw emotional honesty to her role of Olive and one never forgets she is a child, unlike if Dakota Fanning had tackled this role.<br/><br/>'Little Miss Sunshine' is about family, identity, the search for meaning and purpose and how these fit into and relate to contemporary life. This is a film full of small detail which remembers to deal with the larger stuff. Unsentimental, but extremely moving, You'll leave the cinema feeling a little bit better."
"grandenchilada","9","4","8","16 October 2006"," Delightful
","Because it got such good reviews, I thought I'd be disappointed, but actually I really enjoyed it and strongly recommend it. Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet, subversive little movie. It's about a family of heroic ""losers"" on their way to a mini-Miss America pageant. That the grandfather in the film is played by the inimitable Alan Arkin, who should delight us forever with his adorable crankiness, is a good indication that the heart of the movie is in the right place. Little Miss Sunshine is a road movie with a VW van that barely works, a father, wonderfully played in all his optimistic, pathetic obtuseness by Greg Kinnear, his long-suffering wife, Toni Collette, excellent as usual, the ever surprising Steve Carell as the suicidal world's number one Proust scholar, Paul Dano as a Nietzsche teen freak on a vow of silence and the lovely, talented child actor Abigail Breslin as the Little Miss Sunshine contender. The movie builds up to a magnificent finale of American grotesquerie that is biting and true and gleefully perverse. It is a conventional comedy about highly individual, unconventional people who triumph in all their flawed, vulnerable, weird glory. Very well written, wonderfully directed, very delightful and one of the best American movies I have seen this year (which is not saying much, but there you have it)."
"tiggerhead","7","4","8","11 October 2006"," Highlight of an enjoyable evening
","I enjoyed this movie very much last night. Today I came to IMDb to read what others thought. A wide range of comments! I think it boils down to this: The movie leaves you feeling good. All of the acting performances are really good. I cared about what was happening. I laughed hard several times, smiled most of the time, felt sad a few times. It is worth the price of admission. I'm glad I saw it.<br/><br/>The little girl actor (Abigail Beslin, I think) surprised me. She is perfect. Without spoiling anything, she embodies the theme: sunshine, dreams, and hope. It is echoed, in moments, through all of the characters.<br/><br/>In a way, this is a movie through a child's eyes. An example, when Olive puts her arm around Dwayne and, without saying a word, changes his mind. She never doubts the outcome in this scene (and probably doesn't even understand it). It just happens and it makes sense, even while the adults are doubting.<br/><br/>I've read several cynical reviews of this movie, mainly mentioning clich√©s, particularly of the movie National Lampoon's Vacation. I think the intent is there in this movie and it is pretty obvious the writers of ""Sunshine"" are in on this joke, perhaps the way writers for the Simpsons, Hedwig, and Family Guy are in on their jokes. They expect you to ""get it"", not criticize it in the name of realism.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

"LeonieBahri","7","4","8","12 September 2006"," A Winner of a movie about Losers
","A dysfunctional family takes a road trip in a run down VW van so that the 7 year old daughter can participate in the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and along the way they learn about themselves, each other, and change their perceptions on life in general. Sounds about as good as Hope Floats or National Lampoon's European Vacation, right? But this is dysfunction taken to extremes and dealt with with just the right balance of humour and sensitivity, and so a movie that could veer dangerously close to schmaltz and sentimentality instead reins itself in, becoming as deeply funny as it is moving.<br/><br/>The family that squeeze themselves into that van comprises of Sheryl (Tonie Collette), working mother and sole breadwinner; Richard (Greg Kinnear), her husband and wannabe motivational speaker; Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carrel), a gay, pre-eminent Proust scholar who's just failed in a suicide attempt; Sheryl's son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), who, inspired by Nietszche, has taken a vow of silence until he's accepted to train as an fighter pilot; Richard's father (Alan Arkin), an oversexed pensioner experimenting with heroin; and Sheryl and Richard's daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), a beauty queen obsessed 7 year old with a truly idiosyncratic fashion sense.<br/><br/>These descriptions may sound like a ragbag collection of depressed caricatures, but the performances by the cast prevent it from lapsing into emotional parody, and truly a star is born in the form of Abigail Breslin to whom this movie entirely belongs. Surrounded by veteran scene stealers like Collette, Carrel and Arkin, she effortlessly transcends the film in possibly the most honest performance a child actor has ever delivered on screen. Her bemusement at her despicable father's sneering dietary insinuations when she orders ice cream for breakfast and subsequent lack of appetite almost made me cry.<br/><br/>This movie is painfully truthful and yet shockingly funny, and just when it seems it couldn't get any bleaker, it suddenly swings round and turns out to be the ultimate feel good movie."

It was so real it was relateable and even though I in know way was like any of the characters I could still relate to them. There were points in the movie that were so funny that I was crying but as funny as it was there were just as many times were is was crying out of sadness for the characters. While I was watching the movie I kept recognizing people. I would be like hey there's Hodges(the character) from C.S.I., and Mary Lynn Rajskub from 24.

"kevin86","10","4","8","30 August 2006"," Easily the best of the first half of 2006.
","So far this year has definitely started on a weak note with films coming out. Sure there have been plenty of entertaining popcorn flicks like Talladega Nights, Superman, and Pirates Of The Caribbean 2. And the horror film genre has made leaps and bounds with releasing Hostel, The Hills Have Eyes, Slither, and The Descent which are all a major step forward from the recent crap in horror films that have come out over the previous 3 years (and yes the Descent doesn't really count cause it was released in Britain last year). But then comes along Little Miss Sunshine and completely renews hope in a better last half to the year.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed plenty of the theatrical releases so far this year but Little Miss Sunshine is definitely in a league of its own compared to the others. The basic story follows a very dysfunctional family on an eye opening journey across the country to enter young Olive into a pageant contest.<br/><br/>What I found most impressive was that the movie not only managed to be extremely funny regardless of its sometimes very dark themes, but the performances were phenomenal. Especially those of Steve Carrel, Greg Kinnear and Paul Dano. Carrel has without a doubt proved his potential as an actor with this one. When you first see him in the film its utterly shocking as he is sitting in a hospital chair after just having attempted to commit suicide. As the movie unfolds he obviously unleashes his humor but it is very sophisticated, natural, and professional. His oddball characters of Brick Tambland from Anchorman and Andy Stitzer from 40 Year Old Virgin pale in comparison to what he's created with Frank. Of course his other roles have been hilarious and great but in Little Miss Sunshine he really outdoes himself. Greg Kinnear was also very surprising. At first you hate the guy as he present himself as a very egotistic, mean, and somewhat uncaring man but as the story unfolds he takes this character and makes him something great. Then there's Paul Dano, the son of the family and textbook depressed teen. Yet again a character that is funny but seems very typical and kind of boring until about the midway point when he unleashes an amazing performance in quite possibly one of the most emotional sequences in the film.<br/><br/>So make time for Little Miss Sunshine. If you've seen all the big releases for the summer or even if your just looking for something dynamic and interesting, a change from the popcorn flicks, then make this the movie you see for the evening. Simply put its great and shouldn't be missed."

"Okonh0wp","10","4","8","29 August 2006"," You'll laugh, cry, and jump for joy
","This might be one of the few movies in which the phrase ""you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll jump for joy"" is a true statement, because at the very least, I know I did all three of those things over the course of the movie.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine centers on a dysfunctional family and their misguided hopes to redeem their problems through the potential success of their youngest member Olive (Abigail Breslin). Olive has won a spot in a California beauty pageant and with brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), her uncle (Carrell), her grandfather (Alan Arkin), and her parents (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collete from The Sixth Sense), goes on a road trip to the pageant from her Albuquerque, New Mexico home. Within an all-star cast, Steve Carrell and Greg Kinnear prove themselves versatile character actors and Alan Arkin's comic shtick compliments their turns nicely as adults who have taken different paths to failure. Carrell's uncle Frank is an accomplished scholar who has just attempted suicide because his boyfriend has left him and he's been fired. Kinnear plays Richard, a self-help motivational speaker who could desperately use a dose of his own medicine while Arkin is the perfect antidote to Richard as his dad who isn't so much unhappy as he is careless with regards to his life. Toni Collette as the family matriarch is the glue that holds all of them together with her level-headed attempts to cope with one problem at a time, but even she is starting to have her problems as she resorts to smoking again. The family's dysfunction is already starting to rub off on older son Dwayne, who has taken a vow of silence and proclaims he hates everyone, so there is a certain desperation within the family that unspoiled at the age of 8, Olive might be the only one left in the family who has a chance at normalcy.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine comes to movie screens nationwide from the Sundance film festival where the filmmakers benefited from being able to have the creative freedom to find their own voice. In this case, it allowed Michael Arndt to write a particularly poignant script that was able to fearlessly go to dark places in finding its moments of joy. The film's R rating, therefore is not just because of the number of bad words, but because the film goes to incredibly dark places touching on failed dreams, suicide, coping with death, a son cussing out his mother for being a failure. Every bit of it is necessary because without hitting such lows, the film's uplifting moments become all the more sweeter. Little Miss Sunshine is a richly told story that brings about a feeling that few movies can offer."

The movie, for me, was fast paced from beginning to end and there was not one dry moment. It's one of those films that you cannot dislike because it is to darn cute. I do see this movie getting nominated for some academy awards and possibly winning some. Abigail Breslin was breathtaking as little Olive and she might be the youngest actress to win an academy award. Everyone else was just as good. Do yourselves a favor and watch ""Little Miss Sunshine"", you will not be disappointed."
"onthecrack","9","4","8","27 August 2006"," New spin on clich√© characters
","Please go see Little Miss Sunshine. That is all. Oh? You want more info? OK. Umm. It's really good. Is that enough? It has Steve Carell in it. Will that compel you to see it? Oh, alright, I see you need more convincing.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a movie that could easily fall into clich√©, but surprisingly does not. At first glance, we've seen families like this before. There's the sullen, detached teenager. There's the crotchety grandfather, with a soft spot only for his granddaughter, Olive. There's the uptight, overly critical dad and finally, there is the frazzled mom trying to hold the family together. But what's so fresh about this movie is that it takes these (on the surface) clich√© characters and throws them into very non-clich√© situations.<br/><br/>The title of the movie refers to the name of a little girls beauty pageant in which Olive is competing. Whether or not Olive wins the pageant, she is Little Miss Sunshine; let's be clear on that. She is full of light and hope and totally without guile. She is quite lovable, but in fact, by the end of the movie, you will most likely have fallen in love with the entire family. Not one of them is without fault, but not one is without redeeming quality.<br/><br/>Running parallel with the beauty pageant storyline is the addition of a house guest. Uncle Frank attempted suicide and needs a place to stay while he recuperates. Frank (wonderfully played by Carell) is a preeminent Proust scholar (as he reminds everyone throughout the movie) who was dumped by his grad assistant/boyfriend for the second-most renowned Proust scholar. Frank also loses his job and his apartment resulting from a series of murky events. When the family must travel from Albuquerque to Southern California for the pageant, Frank tags along for the road trip from hell.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away, so I'll stop here. But will say this¬óI laughed a lot, I cried a little, and yes, I learned something too. In my book, it can't get much better than that."

Little Miss Sunshine did not conform to any of the traditional twists of many movies. Alan Arkin is a MUST for an Oscar nomination. Steve Carrell shows a side of himself that was not seen in either Anchorman or the 40 Year Old Virgin.<br/><br/>This movie has instantly moved to my top 5 movies of all time and I am finding myself quoting lines from the movie like I do from ""Animal House"", Run, don't walk to see this great movie. Surprisingly, Little Miss Sunshine is a movie about a family that has so many problems, but leaves you feeling so good in the end!"
"jonesa3","10","4","8","23 August 2006"," Touching
","This movie was incredibly well balanced in terms of comedy and drama. If you are a normal person who doesn't typically fit the Hollywood mold, you will definitely identify with the characters in this film to some extent. Perhaps it is the believable, damaged characters, or the imperfect circumstances, but this film touched me. The broken father figure is such an important one for this day and age. In a world where you can't bring home money with your bare hands, fathers increasingly feel powerless in the fulfillment of their and their family's desires. In this film, all the father could control in the end, was getting his daughter to the beauty pageant. Dwayne is also interesting as he represents the increasingly typical high school student trying to figure out who he is. However, instead of portraying him as a typical emo kid, the film shows inner strength, and tremendous resolve to attain personal goals. Although all the other characters are very complex, I thought the suicidal uncle impressed me the most. Unlike the 40 year old virgin, ""Frank"" has nothing to live for, until he realizes the joys only a child can see. I think that's all I should say without giving too much away. THis movie is simply incredible. There is no corny part, and there is no cop out. Go and see Little Miss Sunshine. If you have an ounce of humanity in you, you will enjoy this."
"cadmandu","9","4","8","22 August 2006"," Deeper Than It Looks
","This is basically the story of a pre-teen girl who is competing in a talent contest, and her dysfuntional family.<br/><br/>But like some simple films and books, this one runs pretty deep. It's a comedy that runs from hilarious to bittersweet to outright bitter. Some of it is very funny, some of it is just plain painful to watch, because this is really a film about losing and what that means in this country, the US of A, where winning is everything. It could have been a feel good movie, with whatever ending, and it is actually very close to a formula movie, but what sets it apart is that everyone in this film REALLY is a loser, and coming to terms with that is shown to be both a relief and upsetting. It's possible to make peace with losing on the one hand, because as Dwayne and Frank say of the pageant judges ""We don't want those people judging Olive!"" and on the other hand, there might not be a game out there that's worth winning.<br/><br/>As for the literal deeper philosophical implications, regarding Nietzche and Proust, having read neither, I have no idea, and the filmmakers don't give us much of a clue. It did prompt me to think of checking them out, and that's a real achievement for a movie. I haven't had a movie stimulate my curiosity like that since the Matrix trilogy.<br/><br/>So I highly recommend this flick if you want a new take on an old genre, and you like to think some about what you've seen. Everyone in the theatre enjoyed this film the day I saw it, and in fact it got a round of applause at the end. (I saw it in Berkeley, so actual results may vary.)"

One minute I was laughing at the dysfunctional scenarios and the next minute I was sympathizing with the characters as they each struggled to keep themselves intact so that they could get Olive to the beauty pageant on time.<br/><br/>Also, as someone else stated, although Steve Carrel did an amazing job, this is not his movie.

","Each summer has a breakout film. With the exception of the inspired absurdity of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", as well as the delicious charm of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", I have loathed most of them. ""March of the Penguins?"" Dull. ""Bend It Like Beckham?"" Duller. But this is an indie I can truly stand behind, a dark comedy with wit and energy to spare. A cluster of semi-stars (Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin), bring the cardboard characters to breathing, believable life. ""Sunshine"" takes a look at the lives of the Hoovers-a sex-obsessed grandpa (Alan Arkin), a calm and reasonable mother (Toni Collette), a suicidal Proust scholar (Steve Carrell), a snobby motivational speaker dad (Greg Kinnear), a silent teen (Paul Dano), and a giggly child (Abigal Breslin), who is competing to be the Little Miss Sunshine of the title. So they all set off in a microbus to reach California. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris give the movie pizazz, but Michael Arndt's script is the real success here. The running gags (the microbus's fault engine) work well, as does the dialogue. The actor's really are enjoying themselves here, especially Carrell and Dano, and the poppy score by Devotchka is excellent. Little Miss Sunshine is a surreal (and frighteningly realistic) comedy, and the most refreshing movie of the summer."
"acehle","9","4","8","10 August 2006"," Fully Engaging, start to finish, a Lovely Short Story
","I just saw Little Miss Sunshine at a premier showing. I had heard bits and pieces about the movie and saw that Steve Carell was in it, so we decided to wait in line to see it. And we were not in the least disappointed. This fantastic little movie is a complete short story, picking up at the addition of Steve Carell's character to the crazy family headed by his sister (played by Collette) and her husband (played perfectly by Kinnear as a frustrated self-help presenter). The family includes the quirky and somewhat overweight 8 year old, a by-choice speechless and frustrated 15 year old, and a drug sniffing angry grandpa (Arkin). Arkin steals every scene he's in. The movie plays out like a typical ""odd-group-thrown-into-a-small-area-and-must-overcome-together"" situation, with a dilapidated VW bus as the key obstacle. But it's the little moments of subtle humor that bring out the smiles in the audience at every step of the line. Carell has a 5 minute sarcasm bit, and you will never forget his style of running. The humor is never forced, the dialog seems very realistic, the sentimentality is never over the top nor yawn producing, and the finish was not only unexpected, but the most hilarious thing I've seen all year. Everything about this film seemed to fit together; from the music choice, to the pacing, to the subtle placement of scenery and odd cinematography shots; the acting; the dialog; to the storyline, with its set up, pitfalls, and timely finish. To conclude, I would say this film is perfect movie-going entertainment without trying to say too much and be anything more than it is. This movie fits no standard profile, probably won't be up for any Oscars, and won't make a star of anyone, and yet it will not disappoint any viewer from age 8 to 80."

","Who would've thought that a movie where a family throws a dead body out a window, crash-dances a little miss beauty pageant and routinely stops for various member's emotional break down (all in a couple days no less)would be believable??<br/><br/>Well it was! This was accomplished by not only realistic acting on ALL characters parts but also the genius script and incorporation's of everyone's view point in each scene.<br/><br/>This movie had me laughing, crying and even clapping (and trust me I wasn't the only one). I can't even remember the last time when people clapped during the ending credits.<br/><br/>Everyone in the cast was phenomenal! The script was quirky and witty (but not in a gilmour girls way) but also contained subtle emotional lines that jerked on my heart strings.<br/><br/>Definitely a 10 out of 10!"

","This movie could simply not get any better. I am not going to try and sound like a film snob by saying big words. This movie is real in the midst of it's ridiculousness, it is hilarious, and it is emotional on a level that I have never seen before in a movie. I didn't know whether to sob or fall on the floor laughing as it ended, as I was sort of doing a combination of both at the film's culmination. I have honestly not laughed so hard at a movie since I saw 'Home Alone' as a third grader. It makes many insightful, funny, wise and at times 'sickens you as you ponder what your country values' comments, but it's the overall statement that will stay with you. Don't mistake it for a movie promoting mediocrity. On the contrary, it is a life affirming movie that reminds us that in spite of all the darkness of life we have to just keep dancing through, or it's all for nothing. Best movie this year, and in my opinion, ever."
"DonFishies","9","5","11","27 August 2006"," A great family dramedy with excellent performances all around
","I saw the trailer months ago, but it never clicked in my head that Little Miss Sunshine was the big film from the Sundance Film Festival. It looked like an Indie, but not to the point that the usual batch of Sundance films do. But I waited anyway to see it anyway, and after opening wider within the past few weeks, I finally got the chance.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is basically a road movie revolving around a completely dysfunctional family on their way to a beauty pageant in California. The family includes the father Richard (Greg Kinnear), a motivational speaker who is always pumping his 9 step program while waiting for the book deal to come in; mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), who is unsure of what to do with herself as the family faces financial ruin; Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carrell), a gay Proust scholar who just happens to be suicidal; Grandpa (Alan Arkin), who is obsessed with porn and snorting heroin; Dwayne (Paul Dano), the son who is taking a vow of silence; and Olive (Abigail Breslin), the daughter who is getting ready to act in the titular pageant.<br/><br/>The characters may sound like they were tailor made for a sitcom, but they work brilliantly on screen. There is an electric presence between these six actors, and it only gets more intense as the film goes on. Their chemistry together is absolutely awestriking and is exactly what every film studio hopes and prays for from their actors. And they deliver here in masses. It is a totally dialogue driven film, and every actor pulls their weight here to make it as enjoyable as they can. While they handle the comedic elements of the script with the most perfect finesse, they handle the dramatic elements all the better. This is a family dramedy in the truest sense.<br/><br/>While each of the actors are great, Carrell and Dano stand out as the best of the bunch. Their performances are put together and acted to the point of being so smooth, that it becomes fascinating to watch. While Carrell's career is only going to continue to soar from here on, Dano's looks to be headed in the right direction. He is definitely going to be one to watch in the coming years. However, if he was given more screen time, I think Arkin would have been the best of the bunch. He steals scenes from everyone in the cast, and proves his worth as a veteran actor. More time on the screen could have only helped his performance become so much better than it already is.<br/><br/>While the characters are great, the plot really does not deviate too much. It stays fairly straight forward right until the end, and mostly allows for character interactions and not much else. There are a few supporting turns, but most of them are basically cameos, as each has less than five minutes of screen time a piece. While it sticks to realism (and really gets heavy and satirical when the pageant comes closer), there were more than a handful of completely ridiculous and absurd sequences, and a few that felt like they belonged in another film entirely. It does not take away from the film for the most part, but felt a little strange in context with the rest.<br/><br/>If you like dialogue driven comedy, then this is a definite must-see. It is hilarious and dramatic all at once, and the main six actors are just fabulous in their roles. Do not be surprised by a Best Original Screenplay nod and possibly more come Oscar time.<br/><br/>9/10."

Basic enough. Except that this is a rare road trip movie where the characters are actually interesting, the family dynamic is actually believable (and therefore not always pretty), and the road trip itself actually serves a purpose and helps the characters evolve, both individually and as a family unit.<br/><br/>An then there is the funny.

","Funniest, and most ""they can't go there"" film I've seen since American Beauty. Realistic drug references and profanity unfortunately mean I can't recommend it to as many friends as I'd like, but that's also part of what makes this a standout story. It's easy to skewer little girl beauty pageants -- done here perfectly -- but who would think an old VW bus could be the object of both affection and derision? Trapped in a dysfunctional family? So is half of America. A washed-up Proust scholar? Okay, that's a stretch but also a wicked jab at pretentious scholarship. A old geezer who lets it all hang out? Just visit the nearest senior citizen center. A middle-age man hung up on possibility thinking? Actually, that's a perennial theme going back to Sinclair Lewis' Babbitt. A sullen teen who doesn't talk? Look at the house next door. A vulnerable little girl who just might survive the madness? One hopes so. And the most delicious off-handed comment is at the end.

","I don't usually write reviews, but felt this warranted one.<br/><br/>I just attended a screening in Indianapolis and, wow, this movie exceeded every expectation I had.<br/><br/>For one, the cast is amazing - so dynamic in their roles and as a dysfunctional whole. It's hard to single out individual performances, as they all mesh so well. Each character is disillusioned or caught up in their own ways, only finding solace and togetherness in the innocence and beauty of their daughter Olive.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the first act starts out a bit slow. But watch out, because like the family car, once this movie gets rolling it isn't stopping with the laughs! A good deal of the comedy in this movie revolves around the parallel between the family and their VW Bus they're driving the Redondo Beach, which provides many of the memorable gags throughout. Surprisingly enough, none of these gags ever seem to wear thin and, if anything, become better as they become more absurd. The film builds up to a great third act, where Olive provides an impromptu quote that seems so fitting for the film.<br/><br/>It's funny, pointed, twisted, clever and confident, a film driven by the strength of its characters...literally at times."
"BigMitch","10","5","11","19 July 2006"," The best blend of comedy and drama I've seen in a long time.
","I recently had a chance to see this movie at an advance promotional screening, and I was absolutely blown away. My friend who joined me said it was the funniest independent film she had ever seen, and I completely agree with her. By focusing on real situations, and finding the idiosyncrasies within real life and it's strangeness, the movie creates a hilarious atmosphere that often put everyone in the theater into hysterics. What is most appealing about the movie is the extremely diverse and utterly hilarious family. To break them down into their stereotypical roles (the potty-mouthed grandfather, the suicidal professor uncle, etc) does not do the writers justice. Some of the comedy based on mere conversations between these differing characters offers more laughs than any of the recent slew of bad comedy.<br/><br/>But where the movie pulled itself apart from the pack is the dramatic scenes. While the comedy offers major laughs, some of the moments in the movie caused audible gasps, and definitely some tears -- such as the guy next to me bawling his eyes out. Each of the characters are hilarious, but also well fleshed out, and amazingly acted, so when they're serious, it resonates, rather than any part of it sounding cheesy. They're the realest fake family I've ever seen, which just makes the beauty pageant all the more hilarious.<br/><br/>An amazing movie, I applaud all involved. 10/10"

There is simply nothing new here, every thing here was done to death a very long time ago. The acting of one or two characters is good but you need more than that, surely. Steve Carell is amusing but can't carry the film. Paul Dano is pleasant but nothing more. Alan Arkin should be ashamed of himself, he can't need a check that bad.

Dwayne is in the midst of a self-induced vow of silence in partial preparation for his goal of getting into the Air Force Academy.<br/><br/>The rest of the household consists of Richard's incorrigible father, Alan Arkin‚Äîwho has been kicked out of Sunset Manor--and Sheryl and Richard's seven-year-old daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin).<br/><br/>With the dream of someday becoming a beauty contestant. Olive has been working on her talent routine with grandpa.

As the trip progresses, everyone becomes increasingly committed to getting Olive to the contest on time. The mishaps along the way are unexpected and interesting. But, this is no National Lampoon-like vacation-type movie.<br/><br/>The movie gives us an irreverent jab at child beauty contests and presents us with grandpa's sage advice to his dysfunctional family--- concisely shouted to his grandson, Dwayne while on the trip‚Äî'Screw every woman you can get your hands on!!' (But, he didn't use the word, 'screw.') (Olive has her music headset on so she is the only one in the bus that isn't within earshot of grandpa's advice.)

But, I found it to be entertaining and fun. Much of its humor is irreverent or gallows humor, and I found myself laughing out loud many times.

","I'm just thrilled with this movie; this is definitely one of the most pleasant surprises I've experienced by a movie. This movie is fantastic in all aspects, one complete masterly done performance and thoroughly well performed characters that lead us to a more than interesting and bizarre adventure. The key to this movie lies definitely in a very detailed and realistic implementation of its characters. We are here to meet with a dysfunctional family, which includes characters that are completely different and strange. As a reflection of the quality of writing, in a few minutes we get to know this diverse troupe, their characteristics, dreams, ambitions, weaknesses and tendencies, every little detail so that we get attached to this charming little group in a matter of minutes and through the whole movie we are trying to stay on their side. What really makes this film special is the message we have, and the way it is presented. The message of this film is fantastic summed up in a sentence the character played by Alan Arkin: ""A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning that he does not even try."""
"cleary-joshua","9","2","3","26 October 2013"," Not just a razor-sharp script, but also a fantastic set of performances...
","It's surprising how much the success of an ensemble comedy depends on each individual member's contribution to the film. It's all about actors working together and riffing off each other, and one weak link can spoil an otherwise good premise for a film. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" not only benefits greatly from its razor-sharp script, but also a fantastic set of characters and performances, which complement each other perfectly. The production side of the film is made up of newcomers, director team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and first-time writer Michael Arndt (who later wrote ""Toy Story 3‚Ä≥).<br/><br/>The film never feels like a first-time effort, though, and this again is down to the cast, made up of experienced actors like Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette. Even Abigail Breslin had been acting for 4 years when she made this film. Steve Carrell delivers the funniest performance of the film, and also manages to bring a great deal of drama to his role. Paul Dano manages to make his appearances in the first half deep, despite his complete silence throughout. This silence does build up to one of the film's best moments, when we finally hear is character, Dwayne, speak in a loud, sweary outburst.<br/><br/>The film follows the path of a basic road-trip movie. A family are trying to get from A to B (which here takes the form of a beauty pageant), while they drift apart and reconnect with each other. It's a film more about character relationships than a formal story at times. The humour of the film comes from running jokes and set pieces, which are frequent and constantly funny. It's very cleverly done, and no scene is unimportant, as most add to a joke found later on in the film. The best scene in the film comes from a great ensemble at the hospital, just after Alan Arkin's character has died. The family need to smuggle his body out of the hospital so that they can get to the pageant on time. This scene in particular, which begins very seriously and dramatically, shows how well written the film is, as it manages to go from deeply emotional to laugh-out-loud funny in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>The end to the film is extremely satisfying, a tough feat to pull off in a comedy, where many can feel unfulfilled or abrupt, and Olive's appearance at the beauty pageant, which the whole movie has built up to, is extremely well done and really funny. Altogether, it's a heart-warming and hilarious movie, making you care for the characters just as much as it makes you laugh."
"manendra-lodhi","8","2","3","13 February 2013"," ""Funny and motivational""
","The portrayal of an average family's life and playing a focus on the question of what is important in life and how we live it is the motto of this film. In my opinion it is more than what it looks like if we truly go deep inside it. The film starts with the focus on a little girl about how she is very much excited about a miss sunshine competition. The family decides to go to the venue on their vehicle. The portrayal of the family shows us that they are not poor but a little below the average family and their entire hope lies on a deal which the husband is to make. Than we have a son whose entire aim is to become an air force pilot. There is an old man in the family who is always foul mouthed and has experiences from his war which makes him see life in a different way. There is another man, newly inducted in the family who is the brother of the wife and has suicidal tendencies. And finally we have the husband who always thinks of some rules to follow in life in order to be successful. The stories of all of them are initially unlinked but by the end they leave us thinking about life in general because all of them merge at one particular point. Although every time the focus seems to be on the little girl and all others are actually doing everything for that girl. But inside they all are also struggling with themselves and by the end it becomes clear what they all had been fighting within.<br/><br/>The film teaches us a lot on the behalf of life. Every other aspect of filmmaking helps properly to tell this great story which is funny and inspirational at same times.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""Life has many fruits.""<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""Highly recommended."""

The twist with upcoming pilot made me sad, but the twist also gave the family more character as a sense of unification which I found was really well presented. The ending wasn't cheesy at all and showed that you can be whoever you want to be even when you're put in an environment that whats you to be someone else.

This is a story about a group of the most diverse and often dysfunctional characters ever put on a screen. The point of the story is to get to a beauty/talent pageant across country. The positive energy put forth by little Abigail Breslin is astonishing. We know from the start that the little waif with her big glasses isn't going to outshine all those little beauty queens with their overbearing mothers and thousands of dollars for dental work and hair styling. But the movie is about the journey and the love that develops along the way. When push comes to shove it is the ""weird"" who seem the most normal and the Normal who seem ""weird.""

","Hollywood comedies are usually boring, predictable (by the numbers) and mediocre. ""Little Miss Sunshine"", 2006, is a notable exception. Contrary to the title, there's not much happiness in the story, instead, there's a lot of originality, honesty, insight, charm, sly humor and a little darkness contained in the story of the film. Overall, the film is genuine, charming, spirited and funny. In one unusual scene, about two-thirds in, the film takes a sudden, bold and surprising leap with it's comedy, which is to be applauded. The screenplay itself is worthy of praise and applause.<br/><br/>First time screenwriter Michael Arndt delivers something rarely seen in Hollywood: a very original and honest story. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is about the dysfunctional relationships of an American middle class family and their road trip to a girl's beauty pageant. Yes, it's a simple premise and the road trip sub-genre of movies has been done many times before. Going through the conventions of the sub-genre of road movies, the movie loses some of it's power for brief periods of time, notable in one specific and unnecessary scene. <br/><br/>Writing and acting make the big difference in this film, to set it above and beyond most other comedies. It's a film not afraid to go beyond the usual boundaries of comedies and be honest and realistic about human nature and human relationships. Actually, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is more accurately described as a ""dramedy"" (comedy/drama). Writer Arndt based the screenplay on personal real life experiences and relationships. Arndt has created an interesting and wide variety of family member characters, which their own clearly defined problems, anxieties and goals.We're quickly introduced to all the characters of the ensemble cast at the beginning of the film. The family dinner scene works well to introduce the dynamics of the family and their relationships to each other. In other words, good exposition to open the film.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin (just 10 years old) and Alan Arkin both deliver realistic and charming acting performances. There are two directors in this film, which is odd, considering it's a small scale, low budget film. I think having two directors did not really cancel each other out for a possible Academy Award nomination. This is clearly a writing and acting dominated film. Both directors are relatively unknown newcomers to film directing. Direction is good, nothing special.The film ends with an accurate statement about the absurdity and ridicules nature of girl beauty pageants."

Very good, funny script, but I think it tries too hard at times. Even with some cheesy plot points in the script, the direction makes it realistic (in the present). The acting is terrific from the entire ensemble. Steve Carrell steals the show here. He's used to the obnoxious comedy we see on The Office, but he dials down here and turns in a fantastic performance that should have been nominated at the Oscars instead of Arkin. Arkin does a fine job, but I feel like he is victim to a one-note role. Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are also quite good here as well.

","Little Miss Sunshine is a brilliantly crafted film that goes outside of the box and mixes genres together to appeal to a variety of the viewer's emotions and create an enriching viewing experience. The sarcastic, witty humor of this movie is a change of pace from typical comedies which rely on sexual innuendos and slap-stick humor. Although the family portrayed in the film was portrayed as extremely dysfunctional, the characters were simply exaggerations of everyday Americans, which made it possible for viewers to relate to them, as opposed to characters in typical romantic comedies or fairy tales. Little Miss Sunshine was refreshingly different than most movies today. Along with representing the importance of family (in a very different and unique way), Little Miss Sunshine also reflected on America's obsession with materialism and beauty, and its impact on all generations."

They can't afford to fly, nor can they leave Uncle Frank (Carell), the gay, suicidal brother of Sheryl Hoover (Collette) alone; they certainly can't leave him with Dwayne, Olive's brother, who hasn't talked in 9 months; Sheryl can't drive a stick shift; profane, porn-loving, heroin-snorting Grandpa (Arkin) has to go because he's coached Olive in her routine. So the whole family piles into the van to drive the 700 miles with dad (Kinnear), who pushes and preaches a program called 9 Steps to Winning, at the wheel.<br/><br/>With an absolutely absurd, hilarious, and wonderful original script by Michael Arndt, this small film (costing $8 million) proved to be a mega-hit, and deservedly so, as the Hoovers realize that through all the dysfunction and disappointment, there's love, loyalty, and a sense of togetherness. The performances are fantastic. Toni Collette, as the mother who tries to keep it all together, again proves she should be up there with Meryl Streep. Greg Kinnear, as a frustrated, broke loser trying to sell his 9 steps to a publisher, gives a poignant performance, conveying the impression of being down - but never defeated. Arkin is hilarious. As the two odd men out, Paul Dano and Steve Carell are great, both realizing that despite abject misery and heartbreak, they're not as alone as they thought.<br/><br/>As Olive, a normal-looking little girl with a paunchy stomach who wants to be a beauty queen amidst a sea of what looks like miniature hookers, Abigail Breslin gives an honest, sweet, and natural performance.

It isn't self-indulgent, badly acted crap nor is isn't entirely predictable. Arkin is finally once again cast to play what he does best: a grumpy un-PC a**hole. It's just a pity that he is killed off half-way. Collette is almost invisible, her character being the least colourful, but it's always nice to have her in any movie. The others are good, too - even Kinnear doesn't annoy as much as he's able to; that, though, may have a lot to do with the fact that he plays someone much like himself: a slimy little vermin.<br/><br/>But the biggest surprise was the little girl. Normally, I can't stand kids in movies; either they're dull, unfunny, can't act or annoying wise-a**es with an IQ of 188. It was refreshing to see a kid character who is completely normal for her age, behaving in a natural way - and very funny, especially in the finale when she shocks everyone with Grandpa Arkin's choreography.<br/><br/>A wise choice was the soundtrack; not your typical chart-driven bubble-gum pop and (c)rap songs, but a proper movie soundtrack.<br/><br/>Not everything works in LMS, but overall it's quite an entertaining affair.

"lukechong","7","1","1","13 June 2018"," A road comedy that's a celebration of all that is quirky and looney in America
","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a luv-it or hate-it film. A charming road comedy that builds its premises out of the pain of its characters, and over the fact that they can eventually outlive this pain and eventually laugh at it, it also celebrates all that is quirky and looney about the place where it's made and set: America. Porn, drugs, striptease, a dead body being carried in a minibus, a gay character who tries to kill himself--all these do not make a family friendly movie or one which anyone under the age of twelve should watch. There are plenty of explicit sexual references, a grandpa who sniffs dope and advises one to bed as many women as possible. But if you can stomach such chaos, you will be treated to a well put together, excellently cast road comedy.<br/><br/>The plot is quite simple. A family of eccentrics, recently joined by the mum's brother who tried to kill himself over an unrequited gay affair, decides to hit the road to L.A. for the sake of their seven-year-old daughter who qualifies for the Little Miss Sunshine contest. In the ensuing ride, mishaps happen, one member dies, and despite all their initial misgivings and unhappiness they bond. The script upends stereotypes (although it never really builds up the character to a depth dramas do), but manages to do so in an endearingly madcap manner, so the movie treads a very thin line without making it darker or more uncomfortable that it might be. The direction and screenplay ensure the film's flicker of pain and momentary darkness never overshadow the lively performances from all six ensemble actors, including the adorable daughter (Abigail Breslin), the taciturn 15-year-old son who worships Nietzsche and vows not to talk (Paul Dano), or the 70-year-old granddad who takes heroin and reads porn (Alan Arkin).<br/><br/>With hindsight the movie might seem superficial, making light of its dark edginess, but thanks to an excellent cast never seem syrupy, soppy and heavy-handed, celebrating the madness of the dysfunctional in America. It's not really a film for everyone, but in this age of cliched scripts the movie is well worth a watch--if you can stomach its raucous explicitness."

"classicsoncall","7","1","1","16 October 2017"," ""Okay, everybody just pretend to be normal, okay?""
","Any other year and I don't think this film gets nominated for a Best Picture award. Heck, a couple that were bypassed by ""Little Miss Sunshine"" at the 2007 Academy Awards were ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""Blood Diamond"". So right there I have to reassess my first comment and say that I don't know how this picture got nominated in any case. The idea stunned me a decade ago and still stuns me today.<br/><br/>That's not to say the picture isn't entertaining. I liked it well enough, although making it a lot more family friendly would have required Alan Arkin's Grandpa to clean things up in the language department. I know what the film makers were trying to do with his character but it seemed off-putting to me. At least Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) got to wear the headphones for part of his routine to take some of the edge off, at least for her.<br/><br/>So whether it was intended or not, the picture did make a pretty good point of how vapid these beauty contests are for pre-teenage girls. Every one of them besides Olive looked like they were made from plastic with the phony smiles and strutting mannerisms to go with the outfits and the hair-dos. The spray-on tan kid was a bonus. That's why it was so great when Olive went into her dance routine to blow away any pretense of professionalism for the hideous parents who preen their kids at such an early age to be Miss Perfect. I guess you can tell I'm not a fan of the whole concept.<br/><br/>Good work here by a nice ensemble cast headed by Greg Kinnear, the motivational speaker who can't land a gig, and his dysfunctional family that actually gets things right every once in a while. The scene of Olive getting her brother (Paul Dano) to come out of his self imposed shell was particularly touching. And there were some good life lessons and revealing insights along the way that one might take heed of. Like sarcasm is the refuge of losers, high school makes for one's prime suffering years, and if you wanna fly, you'll find a way to fly. Some of those don't even require all nine steps."

","Sheryl Hoover's house is full. Her husband is trying to break out in a new career, her son from a previous marriage has elected not to speak, her brother became suicidal over a breakup, her father-in-law got kicked out of a nursing home and her daughter Olive has entered a beauty contest.<br/><br/>When Olive becomes a contestant, more problems occur. They can't afford the flight and no way can her son Dwayne, brother Frank, or Grandpa be left at home. Problem solved, they all cram into a VW Bus and head to the beauty contest in California some 800 miles away.<br/><br/>If you think your family is on the edge, check this one out, you'll feel much better. Not for young viewers, adult topics."
"neil-476","10","1","1","31 October 2016"," A quirk of genius
","The Hoover family is having problems, and the word ""dysfunctional"" is woefully inadequate. Mom Sheryl is trying to hold it together, but her brother has just been released into her care following a depression- suicide attempt, son Dwayne hasn't spoken to anyone for a year as part of some teenage nonsense, Grandpa Edwin is an irascible old devil who is a poor example to his grandchildren, and Dad Richard delivers poorly-attended self-improvement seminars (which he then also inflicts on his family) for a company which is just about to fire him. And youngest daughter Olive has, unlikely as it may seem (because she is not especially talented or beautiful), obtained a place in the final of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. So, obviously, a road trip is on the cards. What could possibly go wrong? <br/><br/>The set-up hardly seems ripe for comedy development, yet this character-driven drama is often very funny. It is also frequently very moving (sometimes to the extent that you're in tears) and delivers a very clear message - just because you're dysfunctional doesn't mean you don't love one another.<br/><br/>The first-rate cast are all excellent in this well-written, well-acted ensemble piece. It frequently goes in unexpected directions, and is perhaps a little swearier than it needs to be but, ultimately, it leaves you uplifted and with a sense of hope."
"paulmartin-2","5","9","25","30 October 2006"," Charming enough, but very contrived and derivative
","This is yet another one of those try-hard 'quirky comedies' depicting the antics of a dysfunctional family. It is highly derivative from truly good films like Donnie Darkie and lesser films, but doesn't even start to come close. The film tries to be different, but somehow feels like it's been done many times before.<br/><br/>The film underestimates your intelligence with no subtlety - everything is spelt out clearly in an exaggerated and contrived manner to make sure you 'get it'. The grandfather is not just foul-mouthed, but foul-mouthed to the extreme. The young girl is not just pudgier than the other contestants, she's twice their size. And so on and on and on. It all gets rather boring after a while.<br/><br/>For most of the film it is charming enough, and sure to please many cinema-goers. It never really soars, though. At times it becomes quite tedious and you find yourself wondering what the point of the film is.<br/><br/>For me, it was a 6/10 film for most of it, but the ending was a real embarrassing downward spiral full of weak contrivances. OK as a time-filler, and nowhere near Toni Collette's or Greg Kinnear's best work."

Sheryl's husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) is unsuccessfully trying to sell his self-help and self-improvement technique using nine steps to reach success, but he is actually a complete loser. Her son Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence as a follower of Nietzsche and aims to be a jet pilot. Dwayne's grandfather Edwin (Alan Arkin) was sent away from the institution for elders Sunset Manor and is addicted in heroin. When her seven years old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) has a chance to dispute the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach, California, the whole family travels together in their old Volkswagen Type 2 (Kombi), in a funny journey of hope of winning the talent contest and make a dream come true.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a delightful comedy, supported by an original story about losers in the essence of the word, and alternating hilarious and dramatic situations. Greg Kinnear is amazing in the role of a man that does not walk the way he talks and ironically tries to sell a procedure to become what he is not able to reach: successful. His lines are simply excellent (I loved ""- Sarcasm is the refugee of the losers, trying to put the winners down.""). There are great scenes provoked by the situation of their van with a broken clutch in this entertaining film.

","Little Miss Sunshine is a good-natured comedy with some decent laughs. I don't see any dark side to it, unlike some other reviewers; it never really develops true seriousness. Yet it does manage to avoid cheap laughs and stock gags. The film it most reminded me of was National Lampoon's Vacation. Not exactly Keaton or Tati, but on the other hand, if you want to make a funny family comedy you can do a lot worse than to channel Vacation. Notable performances by Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin, who are good individually and develop a lovely rapport. Also very good in the film is the running Proust-scholar business, which is exactly preposterous enough to be hilarious. Watch carefully for the vanity plates in the scene at the convenience store for an example."

From Andy Hardy to Beaver Cleaver, the family was once the cornerstone of society as reflected in the media. Nowadays, one is hard pressed to find a movie family that isn't preceded by the word ""dysfunctional."" I suspect this is a reflection of the new Hollywood system, where serial polygamy is the norm. Why would such people make movies about folks for whom ""'Till death do us part"" actually meant something? Instead, Miss Sunshine gives us the standard shtick of homosexual pseudo-intellectuals and nihilistic teens, along with a foul-mouthed, heroin-snorting (and Oscar-winning) grampa who lived through the era when values meant something but apparently chose to reject them.<br/><br/>Sorry, but what many have called an ""hilarious"" comedy should have made me laugh during the first 40 minutes.

","""When the sea was calm, all ships alike showed mastership in floating."" -William Shakespeare<br/><br/>The summary was what I said, verbatim, after leaving a theatre in Portland with some dorm friends. Choosing to do so at such an early point in my college friendship career, (everybody else loved it and I therefore was outcasting myself) was an unfortunate decision I still can't come to terms with. The movie was embarrassing because it was aiming for some Todd Solondz lugubriousness while maintaining a pop cadence. I didn't feel any of the visceral depression and longing for suicide while being intellectually provided enough to realize that it would all be for the attention that Solondz gives me. I just thought it was cute. Welcome to the Dollhouse and Happiness, and really whatever film Solondz makes is worth the severity, this film seems to me to be complacently on the fence between authentic experiential loss and the let's go dancing and then get the car washed type facade that I respond to in such vivid disgust. Valerie Dayton and Jonathan Faris are good filmmakers, I think the video for the Smashing Pumpkins' 1979 is the best of its genre. But what we have here is some imitatively dysfunctional, yellow-colored Sufjan Stevens sounding celluloid bilge. Could be for you, though.

Several performances are quite good, but overall this movie is a waste of time, talent, and resources. It is philosophically bankrupt. It is exactly the sort of film one would expect would wow them at the Sundance Film Festival. I would not by any stretch consider myself a prude, but really, is it necessary to drop the f--k bomb time and time and time again; or to discuss teen age sexual intercourse while a small girl sits in the scene. Does anyone really think that young actress couldn't hear the dialog? What are these people thinking. 1939 is generally considered one of the truly great years for movie making, and yet they turned out classic films without anything more obscene than Rhett telling Miss Scarlet that he really didn't give a damn.<br/><br/>I'd suggest that you spend your time with some of the other Best Picture nominees -- or perhaps rent United 93.

It reminds me some Russian comedies but it is just a silly attempt to reproduce them. For those who found the movie to be original I would recommend to watch a couple of Russian-Soviet classical comedies-you would definitely like them more than. Kin-Dza-Dza by Danelia is one of them. I think the main reason why The Little Miss Sunshine became so popular is that it is just different from typical sweet American comedies. It has a more ""realistic content"". However, it was hard to understand why the heroes of the movie had no idea what is the beauty competition and how a 15 years old guy could not know that he was colorblind.

","For some reason, these kind of low-budget, indie comedies always remind me of Australian cinema. I had a similar feeling about 'Transamerica'. Maybe it's the suburban location shooting, or the broad slapstick comedy, or the idiosyncratic tackiness of the characters, or the dysfunctional family dynamic being played for laughs, or the feel-good 'heart of gold' ending, but all these films seem to be built around a comedy template established by 'Muriel's Wedding' over ten years ago. The presence of Toni Collette only reinforces the impression. It's not a bad thing, just something I'm reminded of every time I see the latest Sundance indie comedy.<br/><br/>'Little Miss Sunshine' doesn't really offer anything new to the 'Muriel' template, but it is funny, often laugh-out-loud funny, which is no small feat. Beneath the often downright crude belly laughs is a social commentary of sorts reflecting on America's obsession with turning every aspect of life into a competition that by its very nature will have more losers than winners. It is this insight, and the genuine warmth and humanity with which it is delivered, that manages to make the sight of a seven year old girl doing a sleazy Superfreaky striptease hilarious, rather than disturbing.<br/><br/>There have been several more powerful contenders for award recognition this year, but 'Little Miss Sunshine' represents the kind of feel-good, warm-hearted ensemble piece that the Academy often responds to, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if a few of those involved are reading their acceptance speeches in a few weeks time."

As simple a task that may seem, the trip proves to be a difficult, yet enriching one. On their journey the family must deal with heartbreak, shattered dreams, & even death, all the while learning to support and trust one another no matter what life throws their way.<br/><br/>First time directors, Faris and Dayton, have created a remarkably and genuinely excellent film. From the amazing cast and their splendid performances to the hilarious screenplay written by Michael Arndt, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is hands down one best films of the year.<br/><br/>The great thing about each character that is apart of the Hoover family and featured in the movie, is that they're all so very realistic.

As the film advances, we learn he is actually just your average teenager that's simply misunderstood and not ""emo"" at all. Then there's Grandpa; wisecracking, heroin snorting, kicked out of the retirement home for sleeping around Grandpa. Arkin does a terrific job with this role. He brings not only the character's written personality to life, but adds his own flare as well with his great facial expressions that only fuels the entertaining hoopla presented in 'Little Miss Sunshine'.<br/><br/>The hilarity doesn't seem to stop even when death tries to darken the movie's comedic stance. Grandpa's rantings alone make the movie worth seeing. The irony that Olive's dad, Richard, is a motivational speaker who day in, day out informs people about how to achieve their goals, yet he himself can't accomplish anything is just of the several added bonuses.<br/><br/>After changing my mind three times; first deciding to see 'The Illusionist', then again to 'The Black Dahlia', and finally agreeing upon 'Little Miss Sunshine' I'm really glad I did. There's not a funnier or better cast film out right now. The bottom line is 'Little Miss Sunshine' is an absolute winner and one of the few must-see films of the year. The only reason not to see it would be because it's no longer playing at your theater. In which case you then find another theater in your area that is."

","Honestly, I was dragged kicking and screaming to see this. I don't know that I've ever been as surprised with a film as I was with Little Miss Sunshine. I am not a big laugh out loud type of person - it's just not me. However, I found myself laughing out loud not once, or twice but all through this movie. It felt good to leave a theater feeling like I got my ten bucks worth - plus a whole lot more. Belly laughter is good for you they say, maybe that's why I am feeling so good this week! Little Miss Sunshine was a surprise from start to finish. Great cast, great script, just a great little film that left me feeling good about movies again."
"supertom-3","10","4","9","5 October 2006"," Absolutely brilliant.
","Very rarely are we treated to a film so brilliantly scripted, directed and acted. It's a sad, sad fact nowadays. We can enjoy the odd Hollywood movie that makes the grade in some way, but inevitably it's some sequel, or remake of something that in the end, lacks any real sort of magic. In the last few years, Fox Searchlight have delivered three shining beacon's of simplistic, original, challenging, and insightful little comedy dramas. Those being Lost in Translation, The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, and now of course, Little Miss Sunshine. Three great movies, devoid of any of that formulaic, saccharine, Hollywood taste, that in large doses soon becomes inedible. This film marks a great antithesis to the blockbuster, and the lazily produced.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine follows a dysfunctional (that's the polite way to put it) family, as the go on a cross country road trip, to take younger member Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine convention to compete. The family is an eclectic and completely diverse mix, with polar opposites including a heroin addicted, highly opinionated grandfather, to a wannabe pilot son, whose taken a vow of silence, right over to the homosexual and recently outed uncle, a teacher, who failed in a suicide attempt following the spurned love of a male student. Relationships are at breaking point, and require repair, and a cross country road trip, may or may not be the medicine to heal the rifts.<br/><br/>This really is a sharp, satirical, poignant, and witty movie, that is aided by a superb cast. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette play mum and dad superbly, with Kinnear excellent as the self help guru, unable to help anyone because his nine steps programme is yet to be distributed to the masses, and Collette equally good as the work horse mother, trying to hold everything together in the face of manic depressive relatives, and a lack of income. Of great importance was the casting of Olive. She's the centrepiece of the film, as the sweet young Olive, un-hindered by the adult, or adolescent affliction's affecting her family. She is in fact the normality, and the one who stops everything falling apart, the one that all the family would do anything for. When a young person is so prevalent in a film, it is essential to cast a child who can handle the role, with roles this challenging very hard to cast. However Abigail Breslin (who impressed immensely in Signs, at only six years old) is fantastic. She's being hyped up now as the new Dakota Fanning (as if Fanning is now somehow on the scrapheap or past it!?) and in terms of talent rightly so. She's adorable here and gives a fantastically genuine performance. Paul Dano too is excellent as the Nietzsche inspired Dwayne, the troubled teen. Highly impressive as well is Steve Carell. Known thus far for his comical turns in more the Ferrell, Carrey, kind of mugging genre, Carell proves a great crossover actor (like Jim Carrey). Carell's performance is superb, and his choice of roles beyond this will suddenly expand from those that simply require him to gurn for the camera. And finally as the grandfather, is the always classy, Alan Arkin, who has been off the Academy radar for far too long. He is fantastic here, and must, simply must, be a shoe-in for a best supporting actor nomination. Arkin adds a 40+ years of experience and Gravitas to the role.<br/><br/>Directing duo Jonathon Dayton, and Valerie Farris, both do a brilliant job. Things are kept simple. It's all about capturing an atmosphere, a mood, and the performances. It's an 8 million dollar movie, that is infinitely more captivating than anything this year, or last year, that is simply about performance and material. There's no hindrance of CGI, of spectacle. It's crisply and simply shot, focusing on the actors. Hollywood I hope is learning that a price cannot be put on directing, acting and scriptwriting of the highest order, now that big hollow blockbusters are starting to disappoint with their box office return.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is quite simply a fantastic achievement in the aspects that really matter in film-making. It's at this current time, the film to beat this year. *****"

","Wow! This movie better get an Oscar for best screen writing! What a creative, well written movie. The acting was also superb. Every detail was attended to! What a magnificent, fun ride...I am still thinking about it and smiling with every thought! If I tried to tell someone what happens in this movie, it would sound far-fetched. Yet, it was done so well that every part of this movie flowed into the next part and was totally believable. As a viewer, you get ""sucked in"" and just join in on the ride and thoroughly enjoy every mile of it. I just saw it for the third time because I have three friends who wanted to see it and had no one to go with. When I saw it the last time over the past weekend, the theater broke into applause at the end of the movie. I laughed and enjoyed it just as much as the first time I saw it."
"ekeby","9","4","9","13 September 2006"," A Word or Two About Paul Dano's Oscar-Worthy Performance
","After 230 plus reviews here, you get the idea: it's a really good movie. I'm one of those people that's very wary of hyped-movies actually delivering what's been promised. This one does.<br/><br/>This very funny ensemble piece is a delight from start to finish. I have the impression that when I see it again on DVD, I'll find layers of subtler humor that I missed on first viewing. In the initial dinner scene, for example, there's a lot more going on than just sharp dialog. It could easily go unnoticed.<br/><br/>I want to say a word or two about Paul Dano's performance. Even though reviewers have praised him, in the context of this ensemble of extremely accomplished actors in showy roles, his work is a tad under-appreciated. If anyone ever deserved to get nominated for a supporting actor award, it's Paul Dano for his interpretation of Dwayne Hoover's teen angst. <br/><br/>Dano does more with one simple sly look from under his dyed-black bangs then de Niro, Pacino, et al, do with an entire monologue. Even though you can barely see his eyes, they communicate meaning by the boatload.<br/><br/>In a group scene your eyes are drawn to him, partly because his non-speaking role compels you to watch him to see what he's ""saying."" A storm of dialog can be going on around him and he's fully participatory without uttering one little syllable. You watch him because you want to hear every word he's NOT saying. It's an absolutely mind-blowing performance. <br/><br/>Toward the end of the film, when he finally explodes into vocalization, it's letter perfect and utterly real. Afterwards, when he succumbs to his sister's simple gesture of love, he returns to the family fold with exactly the right exhausted tone of someone who's just unleashed months of suppressed rage. It's a five-minute arc of emotion that is astonishing. <br/><br/>All the performances are top tier, but Dano is mesmerizing. Toni Collette again rolls out her superb comic timing. You laugh just hearing her interject her husband or brother's name in a hopeless effort to curb their inane and inflammatory remarks. She does it in a dozen different ways, and it's funny every time. For me, Allan Arkin was the weak link. It was a good performance, but no different than the cranky roles he's played before. His character would have resonated more if it had been cast against type. Think about Bob Newhart or any nice-guy actor in the part and you'll realize how much funnier it could have been. <br/><br/>Above all, what I admired most about the movie was its dagger to the heart of child beauty pageant pedophilia. Absolutely brilliant."
"xylish","10","4","9","11 September 2006"," A Modern Shakespeare
","Going into the theater i was expecting something extremely sarcastic and cynical because, anything called ""Little Miss Sunshine"" couldn't possibly be serious.<br/><br/>If you liked ""The Dinner Game"" or ""The Importance of Being Ernest"" you'll love this film. I don't understand how people can complain about extremely-stereotyped characters and situational comedy. If what you're looking for is an CGI-action packed spree of unrealistic plots and pretty faces that say pretty nothings, do not watch this. you will be severely disappointed. Otherwise it's a quirky, humorous comedy about a dysfunctional family coming together for the sake of 7 year old Olive's dream. The humor is mostly based on the interaction between incompatible personalities.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes are predictable, but the anticipation of something extremely ridiculous about to happen is probably the best part. The entire audience is just waiting for the plans to explode with horrific laughter. Last night there were less than 30 people in the theater designed to seat 200 but their laughter flooded the room and could be heard from the hallway.<br/><br/>I hope you will go see this film and enjoy the characters as much as I did."
"qgillian","9","4","9","20 August 2006"," Great Heart-warming movie
","Although containing profanity, portraying family dysfunction and surfacing symptoms of fallen human nature, love comes through in the midst of harsh realities. My laughters at Olive's dancing moves turned into sobs until the movie ended. There is nothing more precious than a pure trusting heart of a seven-year old girl. She performed her ""routines"" with such dedication to ""my grandfather who taught me the moves"", completely unaware of the meanings interpreted by the audience. The love that may have been hidden but strongly weaves underneath all dysfunction carried Olive through the performance.<br/><br/>The irony was that displays of sexuality by other contestants, which are much more explicit because those girls know what they were doing, were deemed acceptable by the beauty pageant.<br/><br/>I greatly recommend this movie as a must see!"
"hipster17","9","4","9","19 August 2006"," The unlikeliest, funniest crowd pleaser ever...

And a little girl who looks up to them.<br/><br/>Sound like a formula for a feel good comedy? Amazingly, it is. In fact, I laughed out loud so many times that by the end I was wiping tears from my eyes.<br/><br/>But this movie surpasses other situational road trip flicks - it gives you lots of twists and fiascos to laugh at, AND offers three-dimensional characters you can relate to and identify with. You end up feeling a part of the clan.<br/><br/>A true achievement of independent film making."
"bulletproofclod","10","4","9","19 August 2006"," A hysterical satire on beauty competitions and family
","Well worth the nine dollars it took to get in to see this under-appreciated gem. I saw it yesterday and found that it was already in the small theater with a small audience opposed to the large, crowded one it deserved! The entire story was interesting and cleverly plotted, but it was the last twenty minutes that made the whole film for me, I swore that I burst a blood vessel and I could barely breathe properly. Steve Carell is brilliant as usual as uncle Frank who had just attempted suicide and father Greg Kinnear makes you wish you could hit him square in the jaw. Though I am usually opposed to any goth-like character, Dwayne made the film fresh and was a definitely a highlight in the story. The cast was sparkling and brilliantly acted, including Olive, the young daughter who aspires to eventually become Little Miss Sunshine. If this movie does not win any Academy Awards I will be sorely disappointed."
"mr. ham","7","4","9","19 August 2006"," Dark, with Steve shining
","Sometimes it is worth watching a movie to experience aspects of its construction, even if the final product leaves one wanting at the end. This movie delivers on many counts, led by the acting by each of those cast in key roles in this dark comedy. Cast as one who recently attempted suicide, Steve Carell may surprise those who have come to expect him in over-the-top roles in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty and 40 Year Old Virgin. His portrayal of one who has hit the skids if fabulous. Little Abigail Breslin as Olive also holds her own alongside a cast of veteran actors.<br/><br/>There's a kind of Napoleon Dynamite quality to this film, in the sense that it captures well the tedium (and humor) of everyday life for those who on the verge of falling through the cracks. The movie suggests that through all their faults, these family members stick together and continue to move forward. But their cohesiveness is required to be taken more on faith, than truly demonstrated in the story.<br/><br/>By the end, one doesn't necessarily have the feeling that the characters have emerged entirely victorious over their demons, although they might have scored a few points in the battle.<br/><br/>Back to the original point, this film strives for a level of complexity that few will. And it scores well in both the goal and most of that execution."

","This is possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen. I laughed so hard there were tears and my stomach hurt. It was hilarious, the performances were exquisite, and it was fascinating. Even the parts you could kinda tell were coming were fantastic. The little girl, Olive, does an absolutely perfect job of being the endearing little girl who is probably the last kid you'd expect to see winning beauty pageants, but you just love her. Her brother also does an incredible job with what must have been a really tough part for a young actor. There really isn't a weak link in the whole cast, and the plot is also very well done. Hilariously funny, but with enough drama to pull it together. Must see movie,definitely."

Ask the rest of the movie theater! What a joy. I am still feeling all tingly. The only thing wrong with it is that it ended. Go see it. I will not tell you it was well acted because if I loved it so much it obviously was. I won't tell you casting was perfect because if I love the characters and miss them already, it obviously was. It was sly and delicate at the same time. It was poetic - a description of life that reminds you of your life- your day- today! is my day. We are alive, no? It reminds you of that.

"MaxBorg89","9","4","9","17 August 2006"," Welcome to America's funniest family!
","Little Miss Sunshine is a rarity among US comedies (Alexander Payne and Wes Anderson not included). Because of all the hype surrounding it (enthusiastic reviews at the Sundance festival), you expect something really good. For once (and that's the rare thing), the actual film might even exceed expectations. This is one of the funniest, most original movies I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The film gets it title from a beauty contest for five or six-year old girls. One of the participants is Olive Hoover (Abigail Preslin), the archetypal sweet little kid who just wants to fulfill her dreams. Unfortunately, she has to go to California (where the competition takes place) with her highly dysfunctional family: her father, Richard (Greg Kinnear), has invented a nine-step program to succeed in life, only no one listens to him (think Tom Cruise in Magnolia minus the charisma); brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) has recently discovered Nietzsche and made a silence vow, which will be broken once he gets to join the Air Force; uncle Frank (Steve Carell) is Proust-obsessed, gay and suicidal (and he's the most normal family member); Grandpa (the scene-stealing Alan Arkin) is infatuated with the F-word (""Again with the f**cking chicken!"") and has been thrown out of a retirement home for snorting heroin; and finally, mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), who has to take care of all these people. Thought the Simpsons were a weird family? Not anymore...<br/><br/>The film's charm lies in its straightforwardness: first-time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris bring Michael Arndt's superb screenplay to life without any hidden messages or subtexts. They don't judge their protagonists, but use them to make us understand what doesn't work in America (okay, so there is a small subtext after all). During the last half hour, Little Miss Sunshine is a poignant critique against US show business, particularly its need to exploit children for ratings' sake. The Hoovers are a perfect tool to cruelly hit that target, thanks to an amazing ensemble: Kinnear and Collette are on top form (the last time the former was so funny was in 1997's As Good as It Gets), while Arkin and Carell (playing a more ""mature"" character after the likes of Bruce Almighty and The 40-Year Old Virgin) provide most of the movie's best moments (the scene where Frank exposes his quirky situation to the rest of the family is priceless).<br/><br/>Those looking for good laughs just have to see Little Miss Sunshine. I can't recall ever laughing so much while watching a recent comedy, and that's really saying something."
"msemra","10","4","9","16 August 2006"," You must see this one!
","It is probably one of the best in years. You will be laughing and crying all at once and will be a part of an experience you will remember for a very long time. The characters in the film is portrayed in a way that makes you feel amazed by how real they are. The dark humor in the movie is so unexpected, I would have never guessed to laugh so hard in a movie that looks strictly like a drama. If you enjoy movies that impress you with simplicity, reality, dialog there is a good chance you will like this one. The movie shows you a lot about family relations, passions and disappointments in life, most of all it is about courage and love.... It is definitely well worth every second you spend in the theater. Highly recommend it!"
"fwomp","10","4","9","15 August 2006"," Shines Brighter Than I Ever Expected
","The Screen Actors Guild have an ""Outstanding Performance by a Cast"" award they give out annually, and this year LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE must be among the nominees (if not the recipient).<br/><br/>Never before has a story been so well told and equally acted. Moving the audience to tears one moment and making us burst with laughter the next, this script was absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>And the story goes...<br/><br/>Young Abigail Breslin (SIGNS, 2002) plays Olive, a six-year-old whom the entire cast orbits around. The first place contestant in a local New Mexico beauty pageant got eliminated and Olive, who'd came in second, is the default winner. She's going to California for the Little Miss Sunshine finals. But due to financial limitations, the family can't fly her, so all of them pack into a VW bus and head west. With Abigail comes her barely functioning dysfunctional family. Her father is played by the estimable Greg Kinnear (THE MATADOR, 2005). Richard (Kinnear) is the only one who can drive a stick, so he has to go. But with him comes his ""are you a winner or loser"" motivational comments that irk everyone around him. Also with them comes Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano, THE KING). The 15-year-old has taken a vow of silence until he's passed a test that allows him to fly jets for the Air Force; he writes his caustic comments on paper for all to read. Then we have Frank (Steve Carrell, THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN) who was recently released from the hospital after slitting his wrists and is on suicide watch by the family. A renowned Proust scholar, Frank found himself fired from his teaching job after falling in love with a student; one of his male students. Next we have Olive's grandfather played pitch perfect by Alan Arkin (THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING, 2001). He's a smack-sniffing, perverted old man with a misplaced heart of gold. He's also Abigail's instructor for her dance sequence in the upcoming competition. And finally there's Sheryl (Toni Collette, IN HER SHOES), Olive's mother who is the glue that holds the family together.<br/><br/>Road trip movies are practically a dime a dozen, but many miss the mark or become ludicrous. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has no such problems. Bouncing off ¬ó or sometimes smashing against ¬ó each family members' personality, Olive (Breslin) is the unifying good-natured persona that makes this entire flick so very watchable. Olive is a bit overweight, wears thick eye-glasses, and has little talent. But her family loves her without restraint and when they stuff themselves into the dilapidated VW, it is her unflagging perkiness and smiling that drives them onward toward California, even when confronting a failed father, a difficult brother, a faulty clutch, or death.<br/><br/>The dance sequence at the end of the film is something of movie legend. If you think about who Olive's grandfather was, the dance she chose to do was outstandingly accurate (what other kind of dance could a drug-addled, porn-watching old man teach?) Needless to say I cringed and laughed at the choreographer's choice. It also made me ask ""if"" I should be laughing at this, as it was completely deranged and inappropriate! I'm going to risk a lot here and say that I haven't seen a film this enjoyable in about two years. And the audience that watched it with me seemed to agree; they all stood and applauded when the credits started rolling. That says a lot, I think."

","Finally, a movie that is rewarding on every level.<br/><br/>I walked out of the theater with light tears in my eyes, while laughing, and I told my friend that ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is quite possibly one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Definitely better than any movie I have seen in the last year.<br/><br/>The acting was stellar from each of the main characters, especially Paul Dano, I believe. He had the hardest role in which to portray real emotion.<br/><br/>What I liked about this film is that it explores the range of emotions -- happiness, sadness, loss, disappointment, insecurity, judgment -- but none of it is blatant. It is merely suggested and the viewer makes up his or her own mind about the message they are to perceive.<br/><br/>It's not a dark comedy, but it's definitely not your standard comedy. There are no obvious jokes and punchlines, and each laugh comes with a twinge of realness as if you can feel what each character is going through when he or she speaks. It's comedic introspection at its finest.<br/><br/>Brilliant. I am definitely going to buy this when it comes out on DVD."

","This film in its frequently anarchic spirit resembles in a good way some of the signal endeavors of the 60's, namely ""The Graduate"" and ""5 Easy Pieces."" Business as usual in America, whether in social space or as it pervades the domestic sphere, is here given a freshly felt, genuinely contemporary, non-ideological, sharp-eyed scrutiny. Family life, when everyone ""pursues his own bliss,"" is shown to become less personally liberating than a ground for finding others in one's way, and frequently annoying, if not in fact hateful. In career choices, it may lead to wildly unsuitable decisions, given one's actual talents or disabilities. In romance, it may encourage betrayal should a better option appear. In drug use, it may lead to death. There must be more to life, the film implies, than these attempts at bankrupt Nietzschean choice and then consistency in efforts at having one's foolish way or at all costs ""winning."" Greg Kinnear voices his impatience with those around him first at the dinner table and then towards non-customer friendly service people of varied ethnicity, both at a hospital and at an absurd beauty pageant for children. This same subversive spirit bubbles out of almost every line the wonderful Alan Arkin utters as Grandpa. All in all a marvelous comedy of ideas."
"TinTin-6","10","4","9","12 August 2006"," The best movie of the year ... so far!
","I just saw this movie last night and I'm still enjoying it! I had no idea what 'Little Miss Sunshine' was about. I had only seen one trailer, which basically consisted of one of the early scenes from the movie, when Steve Carell's character explains to Olive, why he tried to commit suicide. That scene was so funny that I didn't care what the movie was about, I just had to see it. Everything about this simple story of a little girl that dreams to be in a beauty pageant, and therefor drags her whole family on a road-trip from Alburquerque, New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California, is perfect. The writing was incredible, the dialog was clever and every character was so well defined that there really wasn't one single main character. The acting was amazing! I was so impressed with every single one of these actors, but the one that really blew me away was Abigail Breslin. Dakota Fanning watch your back! This little girl acted so natural that you never ever felt she was acting. One good example is the scene in which Olive (Abigail) asks her grandfather (Alan Arkin) if he thinks she is ugly. This scene was so moving that it could have easily ended-up being a very sappy and cheesy one. But the acting chemistry between Breslin and Arkin was so amazing that this is one of the best scenes in the movie. Wow, I loved this movie so much. Can't wait for the DVD to come out. I have to have this film in my collection."

Arkin is, as some of my younger clients say, ""off the chain."" Surprisingly enough, Abigail Breslin (who plays Olive)is up to the task and the scenes with these two are priceless. Both could easily be nominated as supporting actors and in a just world they would! While there many moments of hilarity, the movie is also a look into the culture of narcissism, where everyone involved is too busy with the ""me, me, me"" mindset of our hyper individualistic world to actually see what's going on in the present moment. This situation leads to both high comedy and moments of poignancy. Highly recommended."

","I went to see this movie being a fan of each and every one of the actors for years. My growing obsession with Steve Carell was going to be gratified with this performance and I knew he had to nail it to be the next big thing. Before I say anything about the rest of the movie, HE NAILED IT. But he wasn't the biggest highlight within this amazing ensemble of highlights. I'll start with Alan Arkin.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin's Oscar worthy performance as the herion-addicted grandfather was one of the funniest and most incomparable characters in years. This role could have been performed by any other actor but it is Arkin's voice, looks, and complete dry delivery that took the character to amazing heights.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin has more talent than Dakota Fanning will ever hope to achieve in her entire lifetime as an actress. She basically has the lead role in the movie and come awards season, she should be up for every actress nod she gain get. She was adorable and delivered her lines perfectly.<br/><br/>Steve Carell was amazing. I knew he could do this. I was very anxious about this role only because of the ignorant moviegoers of our time. He has had a good two years and his fanbase is still pretty juvenile and I was worried that the press would be disappointed along with the population of Steve fans. He didn't disappoint me and luckily the press didn't do what I thought they would do. Anyways, the performance was amazing. I'd love to see him with a nod or even a win, he carried this movie.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, and Paul Dano all redeemed themselves in this film. All three belong in films like these. Greg Kinnear wasn't annoying for the first time, in a long time. He plays the perfect sincere, good intentioned jerk. Toni Collette handed in an Oscar worthy performance as the Michael Bluth-esquire mother who is just trying to keep things together. Paul Dano freaked the hell out of me in The Ballad of Jack and Rose, and I was absolutely and pleasantly surprised by the job he did.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the critics and every one else is right. This is a crowd pleaser. This movie is very easy to fall in love with and is one of the first real movies of the year to be both touching and hilarious at the same time. This was a perfect film."

I confess that up front.<br/><br/>We discussed how when good life moral lessons are distilled down to bullet point that are overly general, they lose their meaning. Greg Kinnear's character has distilled his life to trite bullet points that miss their mark.<br/><br/>This movie focuses on how to look at not what is a winner and what is a loser, but how do you find success that is meaningful to you. I was so glad that didn't get lost.<br/><br/>One thing my husband pointed out that I totally missed was that the VW Bus was a metaphor for the Family. When they were falling apart, so was it. When they had pulled together after the pageant, by gosh, they had put together the bus enough to where they could deal with it. No family is perfect. What matters is if it runs well enough that you can deal with its idiosyncrasies.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin is a consummate scene stealer. We were so glad he was there. He made us laugh and yet he pulled our hearts out in the scene in the motel with Olive where he reassures her that she *is* beautiful, when he tells Dwayne to get engaged in life, when he tells Richard that he loves him. My face got a workout laughing and crying with everything about him. Yes, I knew he probably had a different path then the rest of the characters intellectually. But i cried hard when I realized what was going to happen. Thank you, Mr. Arkin.<br/><br/>Thank you Ms. Collette. Muriel's wedding was the same kind of movie in that it engaged me fully to become a part of the setting. And like Muriel's wedding, everything worked. I didn't dread when Olive was in the pageant. Every part was handled well. And everything moved the story forward. I didn't anticipate every awkward situation in this movie like Meet the Parents, and Planes, Trains & Automobiles. I was delighted by this film.<br/><br/>We loved how Frank became the voice of Dwayne. And then Dwayne found his own voice. After a number of losses in my life, I realize that it's only when we say ""I hate you"" that we can begin to say ""I love you"" and truly understand what that means. We loved how they didn't hammer home the mothers of ""pageant girls.:"" It was what it was. And it wasn't the Hoovers.<br/><br/>Our only regret was that there was no closure by Olive herself at the end of the pageant. Was it good for her? What did she learn?<br/><br/>What was our takeaway? Well, in 7 Habits, Dr. Covey talks about one of his sons who doesn't seem to be at the ""right"" age level. And it was only through painful discovery that they realized that it was their expectations that were hampering him, and that once they accepted & loved him & treated him like he was perfectly fine, he did fine. Once the family accepted Olive as perfectly fine, and let her do her thing, and even engaged in being her thing, the car worked better, the family worked better, and I suspect Richard would self-publish his book and become a true success. (well, I hope so). We went out to dinner tonight, and treated our daughter much better and much more full of love and acceptance then usual. I hope we continue to do that."

","Watched this over-rated dud last night. It's ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" as if directed by Wes Anderson's dumber brother.<br/><br/>It's a lame family roadtrip comedy dressed in a thin veneer of phony indie quirkiness. It's dumb and glib with pretensions of intelligence and depth, flattering gullible audiences into liking it. The characters are one-dimensional sitcom stereotypes who don't act or re-act remotely like real people. The writers directly cribbed the Aunt Edna scene from ""Vacation"", for God's sake, and the directors cynically cribbed the vaguely-'70s-looking-but-it's-not production design from any random indie comedy of the last ten years. Worst of all, the ending of the movie completely missed the point. The only reason it succeeded at all was a very good cast who made a little bit of chicken salad out of... well, you know.<br/><br/>There are some genuinely funny scenes and dialog, but I was so offended by its naked and unwarranted pretensions that it irritated me into hating it more than I would have if it had just presented itself as the minor cut-above-a-sitcom flick that it is. It's as edgy, clever and fresh as ""Sister Act."""
"b-hodgkiss","9","3","6","10 July 2011"," Little Ray of Sunshine
","This film made me smile, laugh and cry, filling a satisfying gap between a flamboyant feel good comedy and a gritty family drama. For fans of comedy/adventure, this film is the one for you and is a must-see if you enjoyed 'Millions' or 'Son of Rambow' as it blends the different shades of genre into a beautiful sunny yellow film. It will brighten up your view of the world and let in a ray of much needed happiness into your life.<br/><br/>The Hoover family is a cleverly created, dysfunctional family by Michael Arndt, Jonathon Dayton and Valerie Faris, who intrepidly go on a seven hundred mile road trip in desperation to take their daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) to a beauty pageant. The family, combined with Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) a brilliantly played suicidal businessman who's Sheryl Hoover's brother and Dwayne Hoover, portrayed amazingly by Paul Dano, Sheryl's son, who has a burning hatred for all his family and refuses to speak, battle their way through an army of problems, all for one goal. But will they get there in time? 'Little Miss Sunshine' combines a variety of non-diagetic, instrumental music throughout the film to successfully shine a picture of carefree optimism onto the storyline, often being used in place of dialogue to create a refreshing atmosphere. This technique is used especially well right at the beginning of the film when the characters are introduced through a series of close ups and expert extreme close ups, to make the audience instantly aware of them. Introducing the characters without having them talking makes the beginning very effective.<br/><br/>The realism of the film's narrative also burns interest: many of the problems the family encounter boldly reflect the lives of you and me, enabling people aged between fifteen and forty five to relate some of their experiences to those of the characters. But what makes this film really stand out from the usual crowd of perfectly packaged productions, is the fact that none of the characters have their acting talents crushed under a mountain of disguise. They are portrayed as ordinary human beings and the actors represent them as naturally as they live, unlike most films which constantly churn out polished plastic dolls.<br/><br/>Without the characters, the film would fall flat on its face. Each one seems to be amazingly crafted to fit together into a captivating film. Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) is portrayed as a young girl whose dreams are to win beauty pageants. Her colourful costume combined with her blissful sanguinity of the world around her, complete the narrative of the film and gives it a purpose and something to revolve around. Her character makes the film a must-see for reformers as she offers a different view on the world that not every adult can see; lighting up otherwise dark situations.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, you are plunged right into the centre of the storyline, which completely disorientates you. But this problem is ingeniously solved by the introduction of the character Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) who, like the audience, acts as an observer of the family who adds a subtle blend of comedy as he goes along.<br/><br/>The happy rays of light that the film casts are quite often punctured by the bad language which tumbles out of the characters' mouths, which slightly damages the feel-good, happy genre the film creates, but it does show that not everything in life is perfect; the film included!"

","What a wasted opportunity. Little Miss Sunshine deservedly earns heaps of praise for the directing, acting, and pacing of the film. This low budget feature was first handedly pieced together by cast and crew who must have had a blast producing it. And the acting really is top notch all the way through. BUT WHAT A HORRIBLE STORY!<br/><br/>This movie was billed as a comedy, and, while it portends to that, the story is so depressing and inappropriate that it made me squirm uncomfortably the whole time. I started the DVD expecting to have a laugh fest, but realized in a few minutes that the mood was somber, dark, and disturbing. No problemo! I shifted gears and opened my mind to look at the film as a drama. Nope, failed again. And the culprit is the story. Seeing people in anguish and under stress can be very funny if done right. Seeing realism can be funny if handled with a light touch. But nothing can redeem the excesses of this road trip. The grandfather character (expertly acted) is so vulgar and crass especially around the little girl that it was uncomfortable to watch, not funny. The beauty pageant dance he teaches her is an inexcusable act of an old man's lecherous fantasies remembered by using his granddaughter as a go between. The end dance scene is supposed to be a satire on the flaky child modeling business and is supposed to represent the dysfunctional family's uniting event. But it was all in bad taste. I didn't buy it. I found it offensive. It was the final straw that ruined a movie with such great potential. If you are into seeing pseudo child pornography, then dig in. Otherwise, rent something that really is funny. This is a road trip movie to avoid because it seems like it could be funny and profound, and ends up being sad, depressing, and offensive."

","The first time I watched this, it became my favorite movie. But when it ended, I remember saying that either the movie was suppose to teach some big lesson, or it had no point to it. I thought the ending was really weird, but after a while I was able to see all of the little things that were really meaningful. I watched it for a second time last summer, and I picked up on a lot more (not all big lessons, but little touches that made me smile). I just finished watching it again today, and I really took in all of the little ways that this movie comes together to make you laugh, cry, and find more happiness in life. I'm not going to say anything about the plot, or the actual life lessons, because I really think people should watch it for themselves.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it will be for everyone, and I can see some people getting offended by all of the language. However, I've noticed that it's been on TV before (never watched it on there though) and I'm guessing they edit a lot of the r rated content out. So really, I think anyone should watch it (at least on TV).<br/><br/>I'm disappointed to see it getting close to the top of the top 250 movies. I really think this deserves to be in there. So here's my ten stars for a great movie that everyone should give a chance (or two)!!"
"bbelle-lee","10","3","6","30 May 2009"," Watch the movie to rate it yourself :)
","To be honest, when this movie came out in 2006, I did everything I could to avoid watching it, either later on HBO, DVD or the movies. Please I gotta go do something else. Then I was really bored and awake when the regular TV in my hometown showed it so I watched it to pass time. Either I hate a movie or love a movie, usually I am such a critic most movies pass me by being picked down to the bone. But this one actually rendered me to login and write a comment! I seriously did not expect this change of opinion from such a hard nut like me. Kudos to Greg and Paul and Toni and Steve Carrell. Love the part when Paul apologized, made my heart all warm knowing he is not just a 16 year old jerk, but a 16 year old with a heart. I began the story hating all the characters except Olive. But as the story progresses, I began to love all of them! I hated Paul for being a jerk but then changed when he apologized for his screaming fit at his color blindness discovery. Then I hated Greg for his strange uptight ways, then I began to love him and Paul altogether at the same time when Paul ran in to stop Olive from continuing the talent segment. They both wanted to protect Olive. The highlight was when Greg was asked to stop his daughter from continuing the dance and that part actually made me laugh out loud! He unexpectedly joined in to dance! And then Steve and Paul ran up and I clapped!! It was awesome! Their love for Olive was portrayed in the best way a family can. Especically an on screen portrayal. This was unusual, without the regular ""fight-cry-hug-happy ever after"" family endings. And it took me by surprise that Olive did a strip dance. LOL (lighten up it wasn't child porn, it was still done with innocence and all good clean essence.) I know my comments are jumbled and not in proper chronological order, but I love the part when Olive dedicated the dance to her granddad, and answered, ""he is in the back of our trunk"" I gotta high five the tattoo guy who stood up and shouted his ""yeah!"" approval. Overall, yes, deserve a 10 and all cast should be nominated for Oscars for this movie. (Or were they already? Sorry I don't follow these stuff) If the cast were all reading this, bravo, encore, and standing ovation, all of you are quality stars. Indeed. Great movie!!!"

","Having seen many advertisements on T.V. about ""Little Miss Sunshine"" I didn't think much of it, didn't seem like my kind of movie. But now, I like to think I have matured in my taste, and today I proved myself astronomically wrong. This is first and foremost in my opinion not a comedy, yes it has a multiple amount of laughs, but the structure of the film is drama based, so don't watch it with the expectation of leaving laughing.<br/><br/>Lets get to it then, what caught my attention was the impeccable casting, who'd of thunk Steve Carell could pull off serious or that a character who doesn't even utter a sound until the end of the film could captivate you so. The oblivious, self involved father is played tremendously by Greg Kinnear, I mean that scene in the hospital, just hilarious and kudos on Abigail Breslin, who had a personality that could rival the whole cast and she showed that just because you are a child, does not mean you can't act like the best.<br/><br/>I've got to say, it's so refreshing to see a film like this, a film that isn't cheesy or just plain embarrassing, it's no surprise it won best screenplay.

"Stampsfightclub","9","3","6","30 January 2009"," Unashamedly honest
","A family sets off on a journey to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant with many difficulties and challenges affecting their personal lives along the way.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is one fine drama. The real life issues, the hard characters and some established direction make this cult film a classic and a worthy Oscar winner.<br/><br/>The film starts with the tragic scene of Steve Carell living with his sister after trying to kill himself. The drama consists with Toni' Collette's struggle to raise the family, Alan Arkin's drug problems and Paul Dano's attitude towards life, in particular his family. The combination of issues including drugs, life and religion reflects many views continually debated in current media and society and not only does this film preach but it entertains on a consistent basis with fine twists and performances.<br/><br/>The inclusion of Abigail Breslin as Olive was a master class of casting. Oscar nominated Breslin plays an ordinary girl who has that rare upbeat personality and a fine connection with the world and its issues. The fact that this young character questions what to eat, how to dress and how to act, begs the question of the message models and celebrities are sending out with the ending a debate amongst many.<br/><br/>Breslin shines but it is Paul Dano and Alan Arkin who are the stand outs. Dano's ability to hold his tongue and convey that emotion of hate makes you believe he has you on his target list. Arkin's factual and honest Granddad is a worthy Oscar winner in any book with that smart ruefulness and cunning edge.<br/><br/>The comedy side of this 2006 picture is interesting. Very articulate and accurate in its approach, it flows from the situations the family find themselves in, such as when the van breaks down and Olive's spirited questioning of situations. Though the descriptions describe it as hilarious, it is more dramatic and black comedy with the real life issues taking centre stage. This is what independent films should be.<br/><br/>The story flows on the personal situations each character finds themselves in and whereas Dano's is the most intriguing, Greg Kinnear's depiction of the positive steps towards winning is interesting. His character can be almost as annoying as Patrick Swayze's in Donnie Darko but there is no question of the topic's importance.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a film to be loved for its unashamed approach to real life, including some black comedy for good measure, rounded off by fine acting"

","Little Miss Sunshine is better than I expected it to be. Even though this movie was nominated for Best Picture, I did not think that this movie would reach my expectations. Boy, I was wrong.

It's about a girl who wants to win the beauty pageant in California. Her family then decides to drive to California. Of course, the family is dysfunctional. The grandpa is a foul-mouthed drug user, the uncle is gay and suicidal, the mother is pro-honesty, the dad is all about being a winner or a loser, and the brother won't speak a word at all.<br/><br/>The cast did a great job. Alan Arkin deserves the Oscar for his performance. Steve Carell has a nice career blossoming. In short, everyone did a great job. The thing that amazes me is that this movie took three million dollars to make. The box office gross is almost 20 times larger. Overall, this is one of the best comedies made recently.

","I went to watch this film with high hopes after it was strongly recommended by a friend. And no i was definitely not let down. This film was one of few that had a strong heart and all actors especially the youngsters roles gleamed onto our screens. The film was quite deep the story being about a little girl who rehearsed and dreamed of going to this pageant and the whole family get in for it to be a very revealing ride. This might have only been my reaction but at the end of the film i was left with tears in my eyes and the ending can be seen at in many different ways. The film wasn't just sad it displayed some very comical aspects especially scenes with the van although mixing with some very delicate scenes the comedy was quite dark. The story was well written and can appeal to many age groups it involves family inspirations and a good heart . I will pass on my support to this film as i highly enjoyed it and found it a sad warm hearted film."

It is mildly amusing in parts, but no more than watching mad people walk by your window. The ingredients are all there - great cast, nice camera work, interesting characters ... but they've all been thoroughly over-produced. The film is bland, almost sleep-inducing. The only edge to this comes from the VW camper.<br/><br/>I can see the quality behind it, but the end result just doesn't deliver. I was very disappointed, but I can understand why some people would love it. It's just not for me."

"Paddy-49","8","3","6","3 March 2007"," Winning isn't everything -
","Amongst other things Little Miss Sunshine is a delicious satire on the Western (and especially American) cultural obsession with winning at all costs. The American dream says that you can be born in a log cabin with nothing and through your efforts become rich and famous ¬ñ especially famous. The culture of celebrity and success is so powerful that it has created a complex tiered hierarchy of achievement and at every level there is competition. There have to be winners and losers. So at the beginning of the movie we have Richard's banal and cringe-making seminar on the ""Nine steps to winning"" and we learn that for him the world is divided between winners and losers. Ghastly though this over-simplistic and shallow pitch is, those of us who have worked in the business world know that it isn't very far removed from the reality of much management training. There is always another snake oil salesman around the corner! A quick Google search finds ""Nine steps to building a winning sales organisation"", ""Nine steps to better Telecoms service"", ""Nine steps to managing change"" and many more such magic solution guides! The trouble with Richard's programme is not that it is vacuous, but that he can't sell it ¬ñ the book deal is elusive and he is on the point of bankruptcy. The teacher on ""winning"" is about to become a loser.<br/><br/>I have always thought that one of the reasons that soccer has never really taken off in the United Sates (unlike the rest of the world) is that soccer games can end in a draw (a tie) and that unless an artificial tie-breaker is introduced there does not have to be a winner in a soccer match. In all American sports winning is everything ¬ñ as American Football Coach Vince Lombardi said ""If winning isn't everything why do they keep the score?"" Well if you keep the score for the Hoover family then they don't come out too well. Richard is a business failure, Sheryl a divorc√©e, Dwayne hasn't spoken for nine months and is lost in Nietzsche, Grandpa is a foul-mouthed drug user, Frank a failed suicide ¬ñ only seven-year-old Olive is an achiever. Victorious in the New Mexico ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest she now wants to go to the national final in California and the family decide to go together in their clapped out camper van. The events that take place on the road eventually bond this dysfunctional group of no hopers into a team ¬ñ they work together at first because they have to, and then because they want to.<br/><br/>When we eventually get to California and the full horror of the talent contest begins to be seen we view that horror through the eyes of the family. For the contestants' parents, the audience and (above all) the organisers they see is nothing wrong in dressing up little girls in adult clothes so that they all look like Barbie dolls each of who has a barely disguised, and wholly inappropriate, ersatz sexuality. That Olive is different and that, despite her family, she is a refreshingly normal child serves to show up the amoral hideousness of the ""winning is all"" society ¬ñ especially when it is applied to young children.<br/><br/>The dichotomy between those like Richard who thinks that winning is everything and his father who is older and wiser is shown in their different approaches to Olive's wish to go to the contest. Richard says to her ""There is no sense in entering the contest if you don't think that you are going to win"" but Grandpa says ""A real loser isn't someone who doesn't win¬Öit is someone so afraid of not winning they don't even try"". But the true winners in the story are not the individuals but the family unit. Their individual values, priorities and behaviour may be questionable but in the end they triumph in spite of this. As co-director Valerie Faris says the film is ""¬Ö not about family values, but about the value of family""."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","3","6","2 March 2007"," Portrait of an American Family
","For about the first three quarters of Little Miss Sunshine I expected that it was going to be another highly overrated sleeper like Almost Famous or The Royal Tenenbaums, but by the time the movie ended I was about ready to stand up and cheer. Steve Carell has a highly subdued role as a suicidal intellectual, and Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette take on roles of a highly dysfunctional married couple with a couple of kooky kids.<br/><br/>(spoilers ahead) Kinnear's character is struggling to sell a 9-step self help book, which may have failed partly because he can't even help himself, let alone his family, and at the last minute their daughter is granted a place in the Little Miss Sunshine competition in beautiful Hermosa Beach, California. It's clear that she could never win such a superfluous and superficial competition, but her excitement is infectious so the family drops everything and piles into their old, beat-up VW bus (really, is there any other kind of VW bus other than old and beat up?) to drive in close quarters across a few states together. The ultimate dysfunctional road trip.<br/><br/>Along the way they suffer every hardship imaginable, some hilarious and some just disturbing (although even those ultimately hilarious), but the movie really gets going once the family gets to the beauty competition. I am reminded of David Guest's outstanding film Best in Show, which brilliantly lampoons dog grooming competitions, or whatever they're called, and the nutty people that participate in them. <br/><br/>Remember Shirley Temple in her 1934 short film War Babies? Well, probably not since you haven't seen it, but it is a parody of the stereotypical romantic war film, in which 4-year-old Shirley plays a bar girl of some sort, cavorting around the bar set in a diaper and shaking her hips in ways that would make the grandpa in Little Miss Sunshine blush. Most of the girls participating in the beauty competition in this movie give performances that are at least as disturbingly sexual as Shirley did 70 years earlier, and it is no less sad now that their parents are sitting in the crowd cheering them on, and those are exactly the people that are so brilliantly lambasted by the film.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I have never been to any kind of beauty competition, human or otherwise, but I do know that there are people that completely devote themselves to these high-superficiality contests, putting external appearance on a pedestal and either unaware or completely indifferent to the very existence of personality or intellect, so I really think it's great to see such a cleverly made film whose main purpose is to point out how nutty these people are! Whether you are interested in beauty contests at all, I should think that this movie should make you feel that they should be made illegal, at least the ones for kids, and will keep you entertained all along as well."

Before you ask, yes, I'm the control freak father, OK? But all the members of my family are here and I hope they see this film because when the characters in this film say they love each other you can tell it's true - doesn't matter how stuffed up they are or how much they've fought or argued. The little girl in this is simply divine. I still can't work out how someone who's seven in the movie (so, what? a young-looking nine-year-old?) can act so well.

"ManOWar003","5","3","6","25 February 2007"," I really wanted to like this movie...
","...but I could not bring myself to get past certain plot elements in order to do so.<br/><br/>The performances were great; the ensemble work was the best thing about this film. Greg Kinnear as a manic self-help guru wanna-be heads the household filled with misfits. Alan Arkin plays Grandpa with no filter on his mouth, but he makes an endearing old man addicted to sniffing heroin. Oddly enough, he is the best friend to his granddaughter (Abigail Breslin's Olive). Their relationship is a special one, and he is her only real voice of reason, as well as her ""pageant-coach"".<br/><br/>This is really where the appeal stops for me. I appreciate plot devices that really tear a family apart and put them back together, but this time it felt very contrived.<br/><br/>**SPOLIER** I felt taken out of the film after Grandpa overdoses and dies, specifically the ""body-snatching scene"" at the hospital. This absolutely did not work for me. As an obstacle to the family's journey, this felt more akin to something along the lines of a National Lampoon device. The movie felt cheapened because of the stupidity and mania of the family tossing Grampa's body in the back of the VW van and taking off in order to get to the pageant in California that day. Even worse, the family gets stopped by a patrolman on the highway- again, stupidity is the order of the day. The cop is very serious about checking out rear of the van, but melts when some porno magazines (bought the previous day by Steve Carrell's Frank) fall out. Forgetting all about his probable-cause search, the cop let's the family go in a bout of cheerful lechery, despite the big white sheet covering the form of a human figure. Again, a cheap way and useless scene to try and infuse some tension. It didn't fit, and it wasn't the least bit funny. I expected better; much better. The pageant itself was mildly entertaining, but not enough to save this film from the strange mediocrity that it puts itself into.<br/><br/>All in all, this film, in my opinion, should not have been nominated for Best Picture in the first place. What carries it are the performances (these nominations I don't dispute at all- Abigail and Alan do nicely); the only redeeming factors of ""Little Miss Sunshine"". I am all for weird plot twists and horribly uncomfortable situations in films, but the writing of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" leaves little room and balance for anything worth being considered redeeming.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"

I cannot stand it when people start comparing two things that certainly do not fit into the same category. <br/><br/>Anyway, this was a good movie in my opinion. It was very entertaining, and it is an exaggeration of something most people can relate to. It is cute and witty, and it won't kill you to give it a try. Litttle Miss Sunshine is one of these movies about a dysfunctional family, and it contains a funny clich√© cast of characters, each with their own unique and identifiable symbolic qualities. There is the gay guy, the chubby little girl, the emo kid, the dad who tries to live through his children, etc.. The comedy in this film is not aimless and idiotic. It all revolves around a clear storyline with a simple start to finish plot that is easy to follow while you sit back and enjoy the comedy.<br/><br/>When you watch this, if the first comparative movie that comes to your mind is Napoleon Dynamite, then you are probably thinking about Napoleon Dynamite while you eat your breakfast and go to work as well.

","This movie restored my faith in Hollywood. Almost immediately, you care about the characters and as the movie progresses, the characters become even more endearing.

The contestants are truly frightening and the movie definitely shines a light on the bizarre world of child beauty pageants.

Is it a message movie that ""family is everything?"" <br/><br/>The family is super-dysfunctional. Alan Arkin is a cranky, foul-mouthed Grandpa who's been kicked out of a nursing home, snorts cocaine, and when he dies the family takes his body out of the hospital and drives it in the back of the station wagon until they decide what to do with it. Paul Dano is the troubled son who hates everyone and has taken a vow of silence until he gets admitted into the Air Force Academy. Steve Carell is the brother who has botched an attempted suicide. Toni Collette is the mother and Greg Kinnear is the motivational speaker who heads this severely dysfunctional family. Abigail Breslin is the pot bellied little kid who wants to win a beauty pageant. The beauty pageant scenes are the most effective with extremely gross mothers and their even worse young daughters made up Jon Benet Ramsey style parading around in adult makeup and costumes. But these are only a small part of the movie.<br/><br/>The directors' credentials are only MTV videos. Big deal. I don't know what all the fuss is about this film. If you want a real black comedy with some teeth see ""The Loved One"" or ""Dr. Strangelove."""

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is ostensibly built around a road-trip to a junior-miss pageant, yet the character-oriented film, at its core, is about dreamers--specifically dreamers who aren't successful, but who have enough drive and delusion to convince themselves otherwise. An unconventional family in New Mexico valiantly attempts to get their little girl to a pageant in Southern California, with each member of the group struggling against his or her own insecurities. Both an edgy comedy (with its foundation in manic-depressive humor) and a sentimental drama with hard-shelled pathos, it walks a fine line between exhilarating and excruciating--but the remarkable cast usually keeps it on the winning side. That said, I didn't quite buy the ending; I'm glad the film doesn't resort to clich√© and turn young Abigail Breslin into a pint-sized Barbie doll, but perhaps a little more heart might have been worked in. Otherwise, a finely-tuned valentine to family neurosis, and the love inherent in pulling together as a familial unit. *** from ****"

","Oh, come on! Funny, at times. Ensemble acting very good. But ""Best Picture"" nomination for 2006? No way! It is a passable comedy, nowhere in the league of such great comedies as ""Some Like It Hot,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" etc. Of course, comedy is a matter of taste, and yes this film is funny, but a best picture of the year???? Wow! They're certainly scrapping the bottom of the barrel. I can see Arkin being nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but that's about it. His low-key performance is brilliant. I wasn't impressed by Abigail Breslin, though, and given the other contenders in her category, it'll be a miracle if she wins."

"corasaar","10","3","6","11 January 2007"," As perfect as a movie can be...
","Little Miss Sunshne is the best film I have ever seen. I laughed my head off and I cried my heart out. This film is not only splendidly written, but it is also superbly acted. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the father who comes of as a rude, uncaring jerk, when he is really just a man trying to accomplish his goal. Toni Collete as the ""pro-honesty"" mom is wonderful and has such charisma with everyone in the cast. I never thought that Steve Carrell would be able to pull off such an offbeat role, but sure as I am standing here I was wrong. He pulled off his suicidal Proust scholar with such delicacy, and I applaud him. Paul Dano's character inspired me and stole my heart with his stunning amount of truth and depth. I became infatuated with his character because I honestly never knew what he would do next. Alan Arkin was magnanimous in this role of the heroin-snorting, foul-mouthed grandpa. He added the perfect amount of pizazz to this already obscure family and did it wonderfully. And last but certainly, certainly not least is Abigail Breslin, the seven-year-old daughter who dreams of becoming a beauty queen. She reminded me of a friend I might of had when I was seven, and it thrilled me to see the honesty and concern in her face that was true not only to her character, but also seven-year-olds around the world. The acting, as I have just assessed, was phenomenal, but it could not have been done without such an incredible touching and hilarious script.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a film about a family who seems absolutely crazy, but when looked at deeper, is really just an average family with its little quirks trying to unite."
"denn_2003","10","3","6","8 January 2007"," Different Comedy with great performance
","I read other comments about how people hate this movie. Some people said its made by someone who's made at the world, or mad at US, some people said its not realistic, some people said its not funny, some people said that the humor was that these people are worse than us.<br/><br/>The movie had a rhythm to it, it was not very long, and held an interesting theme until the end. It is basically about a dysfunctional family, and if people think it wasn't real, they must look in people's life in US, it was very real. You won't find every other family with so many issues, but they are out there, they exist. And if it was made as a serious movie, about a family with such problems, then no one would laugh at the misery of such a family, but then again, no one would watch this movie if it wasn't funny. People watch reality shows everyday, reality shows are mostly about some jerks judging some victims, sometimes the judges are us viewers. This movie takes a shot at that in the beauty pageant in the end.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 10, even though I would give a 10 to movies like Lord of the Rings, or Apocalypto, this movie may not have had a big budget, but it outdid itself. Excellent work."

","From first-time screenwriter Michael Arndt and former music video directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris comes the thoroughly enjoyable and wonderfully refreshing ""Little Miss Sunshine"". This unexpected gem tells the story of a dysfunctional family that reluctantly load up in their VW Bus for an 800 mile road trip to watch seven-year-old Olive compete in the children's beauty pageant that gives the film it's title. Along the way they encounter many unexpected hurdles, but they never lose sight of their goal. This is character-driven bittersweet comedy at its brightest and sharpest with a brilliant cast of characters that hit humorous high notes without losing their genuine realism."
"iheart_ny","10","3","6","7 January 2007"," The best comedy of 2006!
","When telling a friend to go see Little Miss Sunshine, it is really hard to convince them to see it simply because of the plot, because it is kind of contrived and has that done-before feeling. What makes the movie is it's wonderfully flawed, colorful characters, and the tremendous writing, and the ability to keep humor in a potentially tragic moment.<br/><br/>In the first five minutes of the movie, we meet all of the characters. We first meet Olive (adorable little Abigail Breslin) glaring at the audience. We soon find out that she's watching old beauty pageant videos, and practicing her reaction to when she finally wins the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Next, we meet her father, Richard, played by Greg Kinnear, who's done some of his best work in 2006. His character, Richard is an inspirational speaker, whose ""Nine Steps To Success"" have brought him very little success. Then we meet Olive's teenage brother Dwayne, played by Paul Dano, whose performance might be the best one in the movie. His character reminds me of myself in my teenage years, and the way he plays it is just to die for. Dwayne hasn't spoken a word in nine months because he's taken a vow of silence until he becomes a test pilot in the Air Force Academy.<br/><br/>Then we meet the grandpa, played by Alan Arkin. In his first scene, he is showed snorting heroin, and we soon find out that he got kicked out of his retirement home for his outrageous behavior. Arkin is very, very funny in this movie, and his performance is not to be missed. And then we meet Sheryl, played by Toni Collette. She is terrific in the part, although there isn't enough of her in the movie. She plays Olive and Dwayne's frazzled mom who is just trying to do the best for her children. That's pretty much all there is to her character. And last we meet Sheryl's gay suicidal brother Frank, who tried to off himself after being dumped by his lover. <br/><br/>In a nearly 20-minute scene at a dinner table where the family eats fast-food fried chicken, we learn everything about the Hoover family dynamic. And then we listen to a message from Sheryl's sister, telling Olive that there's a place for her in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and after some initial hesitation...road trip! <br/><br/>I really can't tell you about all of the priceless comedy that goes down on the way from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach, because I couldn't possibly ruin the wonderful and twisted laughs in this movie. In conclusion, it's the funniest movie I've seen in years, and possibly the funniest movie I'll see in a long time. So, you shouldn't make the mistake to rent this wonderful piece of cinema, you should go buy this movie right away."

","Grandpa's been thrown out of the retiree home for snorting heroin. Uncle Frank is fresh out of a psych ward after attempting suicide. Dad is a semi-sickening (he takes some warming up to) motivational speaker miserably failing at selling his latest self help plan. I'm sold alone on these male characters, never mind the cute story.<br/><br/>The funny parts had me laughing near tears. Then there were these unexpected (to me, at least) touching parts-one in particular was semi powerful- but I was so ""touched"" or ""warmed"" that I remember sitting there with my mouth hanging open. I was really startled by how swept I was...it was a beautiful moment. A pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Firmly in the black comedy department, this is still sweet and heartwarming though just enough to not sicken you.

","My wife has a great sense of humor and she can laugh with the best of them, but never before have I worried about her busting a gut like I did during Little Miss Sunshine. I seriously worried that she was going to have a heart attack when Olive's family got up on stage to dance. It was a wonderful movie that showed once again that you don't have to be ""perfect"" to be special. When the movie began each and every member of Olive's family clearly had their own individual idiosyncrasies and by some standards might be considered losers; but the wild, hilarious, and zany adventures they experienced on their road trip to California healed them all- except for Grand Pa."

Its a story of life, change, understanding and dealing with sh*t. Its my family on a road trip basically. Its very slick and it deserves respect. Everyone in the movie is a spectacular actor, from Toni Colette who's good in everything to the little girl who plays Olive. The writing is amazing and everything flows so well. I can understand why people who aren't necessarily in tune with talent and understanding of movies like this don't like it, but they are fools. those of us who do get it, will love it.

","The dictionary describes a sunshine like a bit of a joy in a hopeless life. Well this definition fits perfectly this movie. Little Miss Sunshine is a kind of a film that you can enjoy whatever you do. This film gives a little ray of hope to all independent directors that aspire to win an award (this film MUST be nominated to an Oscar or at least to a Golden Globe). This film shows us all that you don't need publicity to get the acclamation of a public. This film made us live a multi-faceting experience. It made us laugh when they forgot Olive at the gas station. It made us cry when the grandpa died. And it was all a surprise when we found out that Dwayne is daltonic.

","When I heard about this movie, I knew I had to go see it. The story about a dysfunctional family on a road trip, just to get their daughter into a beauty pageant was the first laugh I had. And I had not even seen the movie yet.<br/><br/>When I placed the DVD into the machine and the menu pulled up, I already knew this was going to be hilarious. I pick up the remote and press play. And then I'm off.<br/><br/>The first scene wasn't really funny, but a drama about the troubles the family is going through. The daughter (Breslin) is in desperate need for a win in a beauty pageant, the grandfather (Arkin) is taking crack, the mother (Collete) is smokes, and is divorced, the father (Kinnear) is facing bankruptcy and is failing to propose a program he has invented, the brother (Dano) has taken an oath of silence and remains mute, and not to mention hates the family, and the uncle (Carrel) is gay, heartbroken, without a job, and suicidal.<br/><br/>After a very funny and memorable dinner scene the family is already off to California for the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. This is where most of the laughs begin. The bus they are in breaks down in many ways, they leave Olive behind, and face a lot of numerous troubles along the way.<br/><br/>It doesn't stop there. Once they get to the pageant, they still face troubles, and laughs and dramatic points continue. By the end of the pageant the family rides out home. This is the point where you realize how much you really like this movie.<br/><br/>After watching the movie I already knew that the script was excellent, it was well directed, and most of all, well acted. I must say that every actor deserves an Oscar. Especially for Steve Carrel who is in the best performance of his life ever.<br/><br/>You'll love this movie which brings out every emotion in yourself. You will also learn something from the movie. Many of them, one that many would agree. That the little girls in the pageant that win are $!^(#es. Watch this movie. Then Smell, Kiss, and hug the box.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine 10/10"
"iapain","10","3","6","3 January 2007"," A good movie
","In the beginning, this movie seems to be *unreal* like who's grand pa uses such a filthy slang in front of his grand kids. Second, this guy put on silence for 9 month with the color blind, and he was completely unaware of it. But as movie progressed it started to become more touchy, I enjoyed most of the part of this movie and of course the best part of the movie is its ending you can learn something for your life too. The little girl Oliva has performed outstanding in this movie. In my opinion it worth 10 stars because of nice storyline, I didn't count some of flaws while voting because they were too small for such great effort."
"carmmm4","10","3","6","2 January 2007"," Excellent film
","Little Miss Sunshine was refreshing and different. This film definitely is not for everyone. If you prefer laugh-out-loud Will Farrell type humor this movie probably is not for you. However the movie was surprisingly original among the slew of Hollywood remakes that came out last year. I am an avid Law and Order SVU fan, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how well Abigail Breslin adapted to the much less serious role of Olive in this film. She was charming and heartwarming, and even though her talents were a little less than conventional and pretty inappropriate, I found myself rooting for her at the end of the film. Also excellent in the film was Alan Arkin as the grandfather. Though his language and personality is abrasive, I found myself connecting to him as well, because of his self-fulfilling outlook on life. I felt myself relating to some characters in the family and I was repulsed by others. At the end of the film I felt uplifted because of the love that inevitably bound the family together. This is a must see film for anyone looking for originality and good fun."

","After a year of over-hyped, blockbuster rehashes, there are very few films in 2006 that rose above all of this and were true gems. This is one of them. I hadn't any expectations regarding Little Miss Sunshine - basically because it didn't have the big marketing, big names or big number theater release behind it, but this is a black comedy (really black!) that is just a delight - and darned good.<br/><br/>Many here have written about the plot so I wont get into it, but its basically about a little girl who wants to enter a beauty pageant. You see those around her, eccentric, mean and very fallible family members and friends. This is also a film about family. No Hollywood ending here, actually pretty real as real can get on film. Also what's real is the little girl, I just loved her because she WAS a little girl and when you see this film that's one of the main things that stuck in my head, especially after she gets to the beauty pageant.<br/><br/>Warm, remarkable, slice of Americana and the illusions of wishes, fame, and trying with all of your heart for a positive outcome in a negative, every man for themselves world. A must see film."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","6","18 December 2006"," Abigail Breslin is among the best
","LMS is a marriage of the story of dysfunctional family and road movie. It is predictable at times, but not always; the characters you would have generally seen before, but not all of them; part of the movie is realistic, and part of it somewhat offbeat. <br/><br/>Most amazing is Abigail Breslin's portrayal of Olive, a little chubby girl from a simple grass-root family aspiring to be a beauty pageant one day. Among the assemblage of sometimes eccentric adult (or at least adolescent) characters, Olive turns out to be the most sensible and, in a way, most ""mature"". The greatest challenge is in making this character believable and not going overboard. Little Miss Breslin was pitch perfect, and her performance here deserves to be considered among the best child star performance ever seen on a movie screen.<br/><br/>As the movie rolls along the cross-country journey of this somewhat eccentric but by no means uncommon family in support of Olive's unexpected opportunity for the final Little Miss Sunshine contest, the pace is not all even. There are highs, and not-so-highs (it wouldn't be fair to say ""lows""). Toni Collette is consistently excellent as a well meaning, down-to-earth mother who has been putting up with a husband who preaches his 9 steps to success like a Evangelist, with lot of sound and fury but little economic result to show. Said husband is adequately played by Greg Kinnear. Veteran Alan Arkin is one big show-stealer, as the grandfather still obsessed with sex, the idea of it, I mean, and losses no opportunity to offer his advice on the subject so long as his little granddaughter is not within earshot. Steve Carell has a bit of a enigmatic character, the love-sick and suicidal uncle, whose calm and sensible disposition does not appear to project that disturbed soul. Finally, Paul Dano is the typical adolescent youth, Olive's brother.<br/><br/>At various times, the movie can be hilariously funny or soberly through-provoking. In addition to the main characters, it also takes care to show some stereotypes along the way, such as the human beings who seem to be programmed robots, at the hospital as well as at the pageant. Fortunately, not all these incidental characters are ugly. The waitress at a road side restaurant is really nice, totally unlike the one serving Jack Nicholson in ""Five easy pieces""."

","i saw the movie last week in cologne, Germany and loved it. before i entered, i was awaiting some family comedy in the wes-anderson-way. but even it was quite different, more deep and realistic, it captured the surreal touch of royal tenenbaums or life aquatic. the first thing i have to mention is the wonderful acting (especially the kids, paul dano as dwayne and abigail breslin as olive), it keeps it all moving. the story works quite good as a family drama and comedy with some slapstick elements (here we go the surreal way). its funny and sad but always authentic and last but not least a quite dark satire on the American way of life with an absolutely exciting final. after the film ended, the audience applauded spontaneously and i thought by myself, how long it's been since this happened to me the last time. go see it, i will do so once again!"

","The six members of the Hoover family, Sheryl (the over-worked, stressed mother), Richard (the failed motivational speaker obsessed with winning, and Sheryl's husband), Dwayne (the avowedly mute Nietzsche-reading son with aspirations to be a pilot), Frank (Sheryl's homosexual, suicidal Proust scholar sibling), Grandpa (the heroin-snorting grandparent) and Olive (the beauty queen wannabe who is a contestant in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant) must travel from Albuquerque to California in a struggling canary yellow mini-bus.<br/><br/>As you can see, the characters are an elaborate set up for the most dysfunctional road-movie family ever, and a chance to milk some hefty laughs from the audience. The characters are played respectively by Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin. Now, there are some reasonably well-known faces in that list, which, initially, makes the family less believable as a collective. As the film progresses, the family becomes more believable as a unit.<br/><br/>Now, I thought I would lay out the main criticisms of the film for you, to help you make your decision on viewing this film:<br/><br/>The set ups - The ridiculous situations the characters get themselves into. The film's classification as dramedy (drama/comedy) allows for film to switch between hysterical situations and poignant moments at a second's notice. I've read comments on IMDb that say the film was desperately trying to pack two years worth of drama and belief-suspending comedy into two days, which is how the film feels, with its emotional state fluctuating constantly.<br/><br/>Grandpa's habit - Grandpa has been kicked out of his old folk's home because of his habit, and that's why he is along for the ride in the film. Little does the Hoover family know, Grandpa has brought his habit with him. Some people aren't aware when they watch the film that the rest of the family *doesn't know* that Grandpa has heroin with him. Now, Grandpa is very close to Olive, his granddaughter, after all - he taught her the moves for her dance piece at the pageant.<br/><br/>I've read many complaints here that Grandpa is the most irresponsible and sick grandfather, because of his addiction and why didn't the family confiscate his heroin? Well, they didn't know for a start. Next question? What kind of parent lets their heroin-addicted father share a hotel room with their daughter? Well if you don't know that he is still using heroin, then it seems okay to let them stay together - especially if the grandfather is her coach and closest family member.<br/><br/>I think this film was so over-hyped that people find fun in its flaws, even if the flaws can be accurately explained. The same thing happened to 'Titanic' - people hate it when a film gets too popular, because somehow increased popularity equals decreased credibility?<br/><br/>Anyway, the message of the film in the end is life-affirming, and if you've relaxed during the film, you'll walk out with a smile. The film is not a masterpiece, that's why I rated it 8/10, but it certainly isn't bad and 'Little Miss Sunshine' deserves all its critical praise, simply for being a quality movie."

","This wry, subversive and amusing take on the American family and child beauty contests is 100 minutes of sheer enjoyment. It's also proof of the saying that good art does not come from nowhere. The directors, husband and wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, have never made a feature movie before, yet have had 20 years experience making commercials and MTV programs. There is no really big-name star but the actors are mostly very experienced (and well chosen) - even 9 year old Abigail Breslin as Olive is an experienced child actor. The production history was convoluted and the picture came very close to not being made on several occasions. The result is an almost perfectly realized comedy with hardly a surplus line which leaves a warm afterglow in audiences.<br/><br/>There were dysfunctional fictional American families before the Hoovers and the Hoovers themselves are not particularly freaky. It's actually seven-year old Olive who wants to be a beauty queen. Mum (Tony Collette) is pre-occupied with the welfare of her brother Frank (Steve Carell) a Proust scholar who recently attempted suicide after losing his lover and his job. Dad (Greg Kinnear), a struggling motivational counseller, doesn't spot Olive on his emotional radar until he sees her as a way of proving the effectiveness of his nine-points to success program. Crude old Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is supportive, and does some coaching, in between snorting heroin. Teenage brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), aspiring USAF pilot immersed in a Nietzschean silence, is an unwilling passenger on the VW Microbus to the grand contest at Redondo Beach, California. So we have a family comedy, a road movie, and a sharp dig at the American obsessions with youth and success, not to mention the authoritarian bureaucracies that infest the land of the free.<br/><br/>Despite the fun in getting there, via the interstates, gas stations and highway patrols, the climax of the movie is undoubtedly the pre-teen beauty pageant. Here the directors managed to persuade real contestants in real such contests to do their stuff, and some of it is frighteningly professional ¬ñ at least one gymnastic act by an 8 year old would qualify for the Olympics. Olive's act is not in the same class, but she brings the house down nonetheless, to the great discomfort of officialdom. Needless to say she doesn't win, but the family walks (or rather runs) away together, more united than before.<br/><br/>Pre-teen beauty contests are an ugly business and the murder case of Jo-Benet Ramsay was a reminder of the unwholesomeness of it all, but the film-makers here play it straight ¬ñ what you see is what the fans get - and you can form your own view about what these contests tell you about American popular culture and mores. But you needn't worry about the message ¬ñ there are enough pure laughs here to justify the price of admission."
"tachfine","10","3","6","21 November 2006"," A piece of advice : don't miss the little sunshine
","Why don't you talk?...Is that Nietzsche [ in that poster on the wall ]? ... You don't talk because of Frederich Nietzsche?"" --Frank (Steve Carell), Little Miss Sunshine<br/><br/>It's been a while since I've seen Little Miss Sunshine, the latest amazing Sundance Crowd Pleaser ready to take the movie-going-public by storm, and I've been reciting the above quotation to everyone I know who hasn't heard of the film. To say the least, I haven't been successful in making them laugh at the line, let alone motivating them to go see the movie. And, as I stubbornly typed it at the heading of this review, I discovered why. It's because Steve Carrell's delivery of the line makes it the biting piece of hilarity that it is and, because of its unique brilliance, this delivery is impossible to imitate. In fact, the same could be said for the whole of Little Miss Sunshine; its carefully crafted plot and dialog could have, in the hands of less-skilled actors, seemed conventional and nonchalant. But because there is not a single weak-link to be found in film-making husband-and-wife Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' cast, their picture comes together in a way that is magical, true-to-life, and beautifully uplifting.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine follows the dysfunctional Hoover family as they drive in their broken-down VW-Microbus Van from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California to attend a beauty pageant that their youngest member, Olive, will be competing in. Olive is a hopeful dreamer who brings out the positive in each member of her family, even if they're constantly at war with each other. Anything but the typical superficial children's beauty-pageant participant, Olive is lovably dorky, quirky, and curious. While the film does have a lot to say about the type of contest that she competes in, it's more about the coming together of her somewhat clueless family. Olive's dad, Richard (Greg Kinnear), is a motivational speaker trying to sell his Five-Step Plan in a book deal, losing sight of what really matters to him. Her mother, Sheryl (Toni Collete), is too concerned with working, keeping her marriage together, and and putting Drive-Thru Fried Chicken and Iceburg-Lettuce Salad on the table for dinner that she doesn't have time for much else. Also along for the ride across the Southwestern portion of the United States are Grandpa (Alan Arkin), who is addicted to cocaine but shows Olive the kind of compassion that she deserves; Brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), who has taken a vow of silence until he becomes a Fighter Pilot; and Uncle Frank (Steve Carell), a gay college-professor who is the family's ""care"" after attempting suicide.<br/><br/>Unlike in many other character-driven works, no one personality takes the spotlight here. The Hoovers are viewed as a family-unit throughout the duration of Little Miss Sunshine; this is more of a movie about characters' relationships and how they are affected by internal-conflict, rather than solely the later. Each performance stands out in its own way, accentuating the authenticity of the given Hoover while still maintaining the script's satiric edge. Viewers will be able to objectively (and comically) look at the characters' faults, but also deeply identify with their normal qualities, developing both sympathetic and empathetic feelings for them. The movie is both hysterical and heartfelt, both dreamy and realistic. I loved every moment of it, and I hope that it finds a huge audience as it rolls out into theaters across the country. Little Miss Sunshine is one of the best movies of the year."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","3","6","19 November 2006"," Sometimes the simplest stories make the best films
","Music video directors Jonathan Dayton's and Valerie Faris' film debut is fun family fluff at its best ¬ñ albeit hardly top 250 list material. I was going to give Little Miss Sunshine a ""7"" when I returned from the theatre, but then I saw that it had departed from its position on the prestigious list and I therefore feels it deserves an ""8"". That is hardly a very balanced way of rating a film, but just this once I hope you see where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>Certainly the simple plot outline should be cemented in everyone's mind by now from seeing so many trailers of a swooshing yellow van that is literally unable to slow down because of a manual shifting problem that there's neither time nor money to fix. In the front seat is the eternal optimist dad and the responsible mom. Cut to the backseat where the cynical suicide-attempter and Proust-scholar uncle sits, along with the 'difficult' teenage son. Then there's a sex-crazed old grandpa who has been kicked out of his retirement home for using drugs. Oh, and then there's Olive. Their goal? Reach the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California. <br/><br/>It seems as though the vast majority of mainstream moviegoers have crowned 'Little Miss Sunshine' their top movie of the year. Although I would not go that far, it needs to be said that it is often viciously funny, sweet, touching and quirky. Dayton and Faris blend kooky indie and mainstream entertainment with deft strokes. It is owing to this fresh mix of highlights that the film is able to channel considerable warmth in the midst of tragedy and for that I applaud it. Paul Dano in particular cater to the emotional part, and he does it better than anyone else. By contrast, for comedy, there is the ever-reliable and hysterically funny Steve Carell. No description will do his deadpan humour justice. He is the film's comedic goldmine.<br/><br/>If you want to nitpick, Little Miss Sunshine occasionally falls prey to predictability, arguably owing to its simple template plot. Never does it stray from the latter; there are no twists, turns, detours or diversions that truly jump out and grab you, aside from perhaps the grandfather storyline. My theatre audience was also highly unresponsive and the subconscious bandwagon effect resulted in many jokes to fall flat. This would not have been an issue with a flawless film. But alas, these minor shortcomings do not detract much from an otherwise solid and fun little film that, best of all, makes no pretense about its status.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","This is the kind of movie I wish I could write. Yeah, not only is it hilarious, but there's a sweet streak to it about-- let's see-- 800 miles long. <br/><br/>The movie introduces you to a crazy family-- in the beginning, the only one people seem to get along with mutually is little Olive. You might have seen the previews-- she gets a call that ultimately results in the entire family driving across New Mexico, Arizona and California in their beat-up VW bus, which can only start in 3rd gear. I must say I was expecting more laughs than I got, but this movie was so touching it didn't matter--besides, the parts I laughed at, I CRIED laughing at. Steve Carell was perfect as Frank- those who are used to seeing him play Michael Scott might be a bit surprised. He is hilarious and fatherly and wise in this movie... in fact, I think the casting is just about perfect.<br/><br/>I must say that even though I usually don't see the point in seeing comedies in a theater, it's interesting with this movie just to see at what point people laugh. This movie is similar to the twisted comedy in movies like The Royal Tenenbaums and The Squid and the Whale, which both feature hilariously dysfunctional families that screw themselves over really badly, but somehow come out okay in the end. The difference in this movie, though, are the mixed emotions, especially at the end-- in one of the final scenes I was laughing so hard I cried, but then started to cry out of sadness or who knows what-- the first time that has ever happened to me in a movie.<br/><br/>There are a couple scenes that seem forced or awkward for extra laughs, and some places where the script is less than perfect, but I give this film a huge cheer for its heart. I absolutely loved it."

","It's rare for me to see a movie and feel like I know the characters as friends or relatives, that I live among them. Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rarities. I was particularly impressed by the reality portrayed by Toni Collette as Sheryl, the mother who keeps the dysfunctional family from total destruction. She's an archetype we all know and love: a mother earth without whom families would not exist. Everyone else is along for the wonderfully-scripted, screwball comic ride: the desperate, fumbling father seeking to lead, the tormented son, the fantasizing daughter, the zany-cum-senile grandfather, and the chronically depressed uncle. We learn to love each of them as the family finds coherence and truth."

Whether you consider your family dysfunctional or not, everyone can relate to some aspect of this wonderful film. One complaint is that the depth of each character is not explored completely, yet this gives an air of mystery that allows for more complexities within the familial relationships. The script is superb and filled with one-liners that are sure to have the audience rolling in their seats.

","Running gags that work, self-involved characters that work with each other, and a near-perfect blend of drama and comedy. All of these things make for a movie-going experience like no other. Say what you will about these characters: the parents are too lenient, the grandfather too raunchy, the kids left to their own devices are not developing as kids should. This is what American families are, folks. If this does not sound like your family, go to any diner in America and look for the first family unit you see. Sit close to them and listen to their conversation. Guaranteed you will hear something like the conversation the screen family has at the diner. People's concerns lie in strange places, and this film is doing nothing if not drawing them out and forcing us to look at them. Dysfunctional for a purpose. <br/><br/>True, if you look at it from a certain perpsective, the characters can be seen strictly as caricatures. However, even with this treatment, the filmmakers are not trying to disguise this fact like most films made in our country about Americans. We are all like Olive in some way, naive but somehow strong. We are like the uncle, sad but solid in his beliefs. We are like the father, struggling to hold onto the American dream, discovering the dream will turn out the way you imagine. Like the mother, not considering what can happen when we think we are doing the right thing by allowing others to make mistakes. Like the son, determined to do what he wants at any cost. Like grandpa, throwing all cares to the wind and just letting things come as they will. We know, see and have been these people. This is what it is to live in this country. Don't knock it until you admit you've tried it. Most importantly, through the whole journey, you will come to a conclusion about what you have seen before you that makes all this somehow okay, and in the end, the true American spirit shines through.<br/><br/>And you really will laugh so hard it will hurt!"

","The trouble with this movie is there's barely a likable character in it. The only one who comes close to being slightly likable is the little girl. I particularly despised the teenager who doesn't speak; in fact I've rarely been irritated by a character so much. With his ghastly swollen face and I'm-so-superior attitude (he's not, he's just a stupid, horrible little teenager) he's enough to make you walk out the movie house. None of the other characters are sympathetic in the slightest, just a bunch of yelling and dysfunctional people. The story is simplistic and while there are some laughs, they're few and far between and come from a dark, bitter source. The ending isn't funny in a conventional sense, it's funny peculiar, and rather excruciating. Of course it's a 'well made' film, but then it's also anti-establishment, anti-American and anti-family. But what would you expect from a modern American independent production?"

After the first 15 minutes, I knew I was going to love this movie. The characters are very well written, which is a rarity in movies these days. Almost all movies these days star one-dimensional characters, each one the same as the next. When chemistry like this happens, it's magic, even if not all the characters are likable (Pageant Official Jenkins, anyone?) It's been years since I laughed so hard during a movie, and Little Miss Sunshine proved itself to be one of only a few films that made me roll in hysterics and cry at the same time.

","Throw a bunch of characters together, each with one characteristic amplified to the point of grotesqueness and you have most of the middling movies from the faux-indieville of the last decade. Distilling them all down into one bewilderingly crowd-pleasing debacle, we have Best Picture nominee ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Never mind that the actual best picture of the year ""Children of Men"" was only nominated for one thing, the Oscars are a crock, but let me let some of the air out of your VW bandwagon tires, ye of too much misplaced faith: Paul Dano: Why doesn't Paul Dano talk? Because of Nietzsche. Man, that's hilarious. Wait. Did Nietzsche say anything about not talking that makes this funny? No? Oh, I get it, it's shorthand for pretentious existentialism that the audience can laugh at and feel superior to.<br/><br/>Why would someone that reads Nietzsche want to join the US Military? I'm not saying it's impossible, just unlikely, but we at least could have an explanation.<br/><br/>How would he never have been tested for color-blindness? Impossible.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell: Have you ever noticed that in order to make a general audience understand that someone is smart they always use shorthand? If you're a scientist, you can't just be a great and respected scientist, you have to have won a Nobel. Writers have to have the Pulitzer. And Carrell's character has to be the top Proust scholar in the world. And those repeated gay jokes? Just a way for the writer to try to get away with them. And they weren't funny.<br/><br/>They happen to run into the second top Proust scholar in the world at a gas station. Right.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear: They seem to have forgotten to equally distribute the dysfunction. The Kinnear character is the only one that really causes strife in the family. His character is abusive, grating, repetitive, unbelievably and not funny. Most of this isn't Kinnear's fault. But a lot of it is. They would all be happy if they got rid of him at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Toni Collette: She is supposed to be the anchor of the family and she does a good job. But she doesn't convey to us why she is married to this guy, and she isn't playing anything most of the time, they forgot to give her a character. Her trait is ""level headed"" and that's it.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin: I'm not sure why it's funny or endearing that we find out a grandfather has had his granddaughter dancing for him like a stripper for months.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin: How exactly did she win runner-up at the previous competition? I really can only think of two moments in this whole movie where I actually laughed, one was in response to Carrell's droll delivery of one of the many sub-par lines he rose above; the other was when Olive screamed upon finding out she made the competition. And by the way SHE WAS WEARING A FAT SUIT!!!<br/><br/>I stress that I did not walk into this film with preconceived notions, except what it says about a film these days when it has been a hit at Sundance. It was simply not fair that a middling, terribly written movie like this cynically manipulating the format of indie-lite was so highly and undeservedly praised."

","Little Miss Sunshine opens with Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) watching, ad nauseam, the crowning of Miss America on television. Olive dreamily mimics Miss Wherever's pageant-perfect motions as we see the cathode rays reflecting in her coke bottle glasses. And thank God for those glasses because they are the only thing protecting sweet little Olive from the horrors of the outside world. As if her glasses were a catcher in the rye, the filter keeping her ideals. Who else would she count on for protection? Her family? Richard (Greg Kinnear) the motivational speaker that can't seem to get past his own insecurities? Dwayne ( Paul Dano) her Nietzsche inspired brother, who has taken a ""God is dead,"" en vogue, vow of silence until he becomes a fighter pilot? Or maybe her uncle Frank (Steve Carell) a Proust scholar who, due to a public embarrassment involving a gay grad student, is recovering from a suicide attempt? Clearly things look bleak for Olive. But then we find out that she is a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Meaning, the family must find a way to get from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach in a day. The trip is delightfully dysfunctional; from shattered dreams to family quarrels this movie is as tragic as it is funny. It is comparable to having the girl of your dreams on a long anticipated date only you're stricken with crippling diarrhea. But for some reason you try to fight through it despite the sweat beading up your forehead and the pressure on your sphincter. What can you do but laugh? Sure your fantasies are gone and your dreams of romance are dashed but, boy, what a story.<br/><br/>And that is the issue of Little Miss Sunshine. Olive is the only member of the Hoover family that still believes that dreams can come true. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is the only one that recognizes it. Grandpa has presumably led a lifetime of missed opportunities and regret so he is making up for it now. Snorting heroin in the old folks home, buying the dirtiest porn he can find and telling his grandson that he only does one thing he should sleep with a lot of women.<br/><br/>The laugh-out-loud moments (yeah yeah, omg! Lol! Rofl!!!) are everywhere but the best, far and away revolve around the broken down VW Bus. Due to a mechanical error beyond my comprehension the bus cannot switch from first to second gear. Meaning each time the van stops it has to roll down a hill or be pushed to a start. This provides for several hysterical moments: the misfits establishing pecking order of pushers, Olive leaping in after being forgotten at a gas station or Frank running exactly as you would imagine a homosexual Proust scholar to run.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie gets little bit cheesy and sophomoric but it works. The family finally makes it to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Viewers and characters alike revel in the haunting aura of the child beauty pageant. The scenes are captivating and chilling in a way that makes you want to grab Olive yourself and save her from this horror. But like a true underdog dreamer Olive perseveres and after all, that is how she would have liked it."

","Hollywood needs to wake up. It has been generally decided that this summer film season has been predominantly disappointing, but I am going to have to disagree. Not because I think that any major studio has pumped out anything remotely respectable, with the possible exception of the beautifully photographed Miami Vice, but because I saw some of my favorite films of the year this summer, it just took some looking.<br/><br/>That said, I have added Little Miss Sunshine to my list of films released this summer that not only should have made more money than every major studio release, but should also have been played in every theatre in the country.<br/><br/>I have waited months to see this comedic gem. Released on July 26, following the Best Feature award from the 2006 Sydney Film Festival and a standing ovation at the renowned Sundance Film Festival, it has been one of the most talked about and critically acclaimed films of the year.<br/><br/>The Hoovers are a deranged family that, because of personal issues, can barely handle spending dinner together. Their tolerance for each other is tested when Olive (Abigail Breslin), the younger of the two siblings, qualifies for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in Redondo Beach, California. Because of financial and personal complications, the entire family is forced to embark on a two-day road trip in their clunky yellow VW bus so that Olive can follow her dream of winning the pageant.<br/><br/>While this may sound like the beginning of your ho-hum family adventure flick, the foul- mouthed drug-addicted grandfather (Alan Arkin) alone is enough to make Clark Griswold blush.<br/><br/>That is where the film succeeds. Because of its unrestrained vulgarity and general absurdity, it is not only personally relatable but also satirical towards the films that it calls to mind.<br/><br/>Any time that the film is tempted to get overly touchy-feely, it restrains itself gracefully and reminds the viewer of its ludicrous bearing.<br/><br/>Especially notable is the way the family is forced to work together every time that its bus needs to start moving. Because of some complications with the gears, the bus must be pushed until it is moving fast enough to be put into third gear, whereupon said pushers must sequentially run ahead and jump into the opened side door.<br/><br/>A superb cast could only have pulled off such acts of both physical and emotional comedy. As the strongpoint of the film, its spot-on cast carries it above and beyond an otherwise failed attempt at a wonderful script.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear perfectly portrays Richard Hoover's capricious personality as he fights back his shortening nerves with the advice of his own nine-step program on how to be a winner. Steve Carell delivers his most touching and subtly hilarious performance of his career as Toni Collette's post-suicidal relationship-troubled homosexual brother.<br/><br/>Every scene of Little Miss Sunshine humbly and hysterically leads to the incredible final sequence, which will no doubt be remembered as a classic moment in film.<br/><br/>It's about time that a truly great film this summer is starting to get national recognition and distribution. Sadly, generally dismissed achievements like A Scanner Darkly and Scoop will probably get lost in the shuffle, and we can only hope for the best for the unlikely success of the wildly funny Strangers With Candy. Hopefully, Little Miss Sunshine can act as a wake up call to the film industry to recognize the ever-present superiority of independent films."

I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh, or can just relate the typical dysfunctional family. Well worth the money, you WILL laugh out loud!"

","I have to say that this is just about the funniest thing I have ever seen. It's so amazing to watch this family of goof-balls interact with each other--very real and very touching in some parts. You will literally want to reach out and hug this little girl. <br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the title--this is by no means a family movie. I went to see this movie with extremely high expectations and they were by far exceeded. I left in tears (from laughter) and my side still hurts. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh hysterically and still find a way to care deeply about the characters. Just leave the kids at home for this one."

","**** Steve Carrel, Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, Abigail Bresling. Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris<br/><br/>We've seen this concept before there's no doubt about that, but we have not seen this take on it. Newcomers Dayton and Faris prove to be a great talent when packing an ensemble cast that just bursts with comic genius, kudos to Oscar worthy Carrell. Not to leave anyone else out, including Collette and maybe a nod for Kinnear who just plays it off like he is so smart and wonderful, a true jackass<br/><br/>After a low on life Uncle (Carrell) commits suicide and fails, he moves back in with his sister (Collette) and her husband (Kinnear). Along with their son (Dano) who's committed to a vow of silence, Grandpa (Arkin) who's up on heroin and their sweet daughter (Breslin, another talent to watch). When the good news about her getting into a beauty contest arrives, it brings the bad news as well. This out of touch family has to bond while treading the states in a broken down VW bus. <br/><br/>This screenplay is original, and does not depend on swearing the laughs off. Instead it uses shear joy and the simplicity of this family as the tool. They may be unbelievably stupid and moronic but they are a family nonetheless. ""Sunshine"" is perfect in every single way, I laughed, I grew with these characters. I think it should get a few Oscar nods, and am very happy that my theater picked up this Sundance film. Hands down, the one film you must see all year long"

","I loved this movie.<br/><br/>I know it is odd for someone to put their opinion in the first sentence of their review, but why wait? Why go through the history of how the film was made, what actors are playing what roles, how it was cast and all the neat tidbits that might have gone on behind the scenes. Why go through all of that just to get to the one line that reveals the overall impression by the writer of the viewing.<br/><br/>So, I loved this movie.<br/><br/>Premiering at January's Sundance Film Festival, Little Miss Sunshine picked up incredible buzz and critical praise. By the time the week was over Fox Searchlight bought up the distribution rights for the film for $10.5 million ¬ñ the highest price ever paid for a film premiering at the festival.<br/><br/>From there, it was a game to see if it would take longer to get the film released than it did to get it made (it took five years for various reasons to get the product on celluloid).<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine brings to the big screen one of the most dysfunctional families you are bound to see in a movie that doesn't star Robin Williams. There is Richard (Greg Kinnear) who is trying to become the poor man's Tony Robbins, Olive (Abigail Breslin) the 7-year old daughter, Grandpa (Alan Arkin) who has an affinity towards porn and heroin, Dwayne (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence for the past nine months, Frank (Steve Carrell) who is a gay, depressed Proust scholar who is on suicide watch after breaking up with his boyfriend and Sheryl (Toni Collette) the mother who's flaws are so overshadowed by the dominating indiscretions of the others that her sanity is the glue that holds the family together.<br/><br/>Together, they set out on a road trip adventure to California where Olive has been given the opportunity to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant due to a disqualification of another contestant. Along the way, their obstacles will include a death, a vehicle that won't work unless started n third gear, a disappointing revelation that will crush someone's dreams and an encounter with an ex that would suck the oxygen right out of the sails.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is directed by Jonathon Dayton and Valarie Faris who's previous resume was stationed in music videos and television commercials. But their lack of experience sure didn't show as they put together a road movie that is touching, funny and downright fun to watch.<br/><br/>Just how hard is it to put a road movie together? Well, Harold Ramis had some moments of success with Vacation, Jim Jarmusch tried it last year with Broken Flowers and Robin Williams comes to DVD with his road movie RV this week. In fact, for every Lost In America, there are ten Brown Bunny's. So the feat was a major undertaking with the chips stacked against them.<br/><br/>But the cast and characters they portray separate this film from the others and even if you can't relate each character to someone in your own family, you are engrossed in the struggles of an ordinary family just trying to survive.<br/><br/>Even the ending which you could figure might result in the family coming together in some weird and awkward way was done with brilliance. When Olive takes the stage to perform her dance routine that she had been taught by her Grandpa, we hold our breathe in hopes the young lass is not laughed off the stage, but ten seconds into the routine, it is the audience that is laughing off their seats as the scene plays out.<br/><br/>This won't be the last time you read about Little Miss Sunshine. Steve Carrell's career is sizzling thanks to the NBC show The Office and his theatrical vehicle The 40-Year Old Virgin that put him on the map. His turn as the serious, suicidal brother Frank shows his dramatic range. Abigail Breslin who was also brilliant in 2004's Keane shows that Dakota Fanning is not the only young talent in Hollywood. Little Miss Sunshine will be referred to going forward as the launching pad for these two remarkable talents and we will talk about them and the movie more when it appears on critics Best of Lists at the end of the year.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"
"samseescinema","10","3","7","10 August 2006"," This year, Sundance's morsel of independent goodness is Little Miss Sunshine
","Little Miss Sunshine reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>rating: 4 out of 4<br/><br/>The Sundance Film Festival has always been a kind of clunky ordeal. I've never attended, granted, but the films that are swept up by the thirsty studios and brought to mainstream audiences are so unreliable that buying a ticket is more like placing a bet. The level of quality control for the festival is a damned roller coaster. On the other hand, since 2004 I've annually handed out a four star review to a film birthed at Sundance (Garden State, Brick). This year, Sundance's morsel of independent goodness is Little Miss Sunshine.<br/><br/>The film doesn't smell of the rawness that often lingers behind the ears of other Sundance hits. Little Miss Sunshine runs on quirk and maturity, often revealing itself to contain an honest sense of experience and a deep understanding of the mechanics of middle-class family life.<br/><br/>In its most basic form, Little Miss Sunshine is an awkward travelogue, documenting the zany cross-country road trip a family makes to put their daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin), into the annual Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. But the travelogue mold is malleable and shifts to fit the stories of each family member as they all slowly crumble. Greg Kinnear plays Richard, a champion of his own nine step self-help program who's struggling to find an audience. He's obsessed with winners and disgusted by losers, the only two types of people in his world, and forces his family to endure endless diatribes on the everyday applications of his nine steps. Sheryl (Toni Collette), his wife, seems weary of the infamous nine steps, but endures it if it'll put food on her table. The seats at her table have recently increased, though, with the induction of Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell) who's arrived back from the hospital after an attempted suicide. Frank was the former leading Marcel Proust scholar until a vicious love triangle with two other men resulted in his romantic betrayer becoming the leading Proust scholar and Frank finding himself unemployed. He mixes well with Dwayne, the fifteen year-old son who's decided to take a vow of silence because of Nietzsche. Dwayne writes on a piece of paper to Frank, ""I hate everyone,"" and, looking back at him, Frank seems to understand. Functioning as the bright and bubbly center of the whole debacle is the seven year-old daughter, Olive, who's beautifully naive to the failures of her family, innocently bouncing along to her own lovely rhythm. Her talent at the beauty pageant will be dancing, and her crude, absurd Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is always helping with her mysterious rehearsal.<br/><br/>Things start bad at home, but only get worse on the road. And the farther they get, the more dreary the family's situation becomes. Soon their very foundation has fallen out from beneath them and all they have is what's in front of them and what's in front of them, for better or worse, is the Little Miss Sunshine contest. And as the family loses more and falls further away from Richard's central theme of ""winning"", the more the Little Miss Sunshine contest becomes the family's very livelihood.<br/><br/>But amongst all the sadness and turmoil, the screenplay holds tight to its sense of humor. Even while dissecting emotions of the most harrowing sort: depression, sorrow, suicidal anger, hate--it never once fails to find quirk in the normal and delight in the ordinary. Other family portraits that delve into dysfunction and honesty leave us phoning a shrink and asking for samples of Prozac. Little Miss Sunshine wants nothing to do with lulling us into a depressed stupor.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin, the little girl who plays Olive, is unexplainably wonderful. Her type of strange is so cute that it could be bottled up and sold for billions. She could very well be the elixir of youth because only one look at her dancing to her headphones and wearing a sweatband and cowboy boots, closing her eyes to better feel the music behind huge, round glasses, and it's enough to let us forget all the complexities and intricate annoyances of adulthood. I don't mean to go on about Miss Breslin, as the other actors are nearly as strong and all deserve special mention, but Olive really does steal the show.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine strikes on many of the sad, ornery notes of realism in middle-class family life. Things break down and so too, it seems, that life breaks down with it. For this family, life seems to be escaping them and all they've left to do is to not let it escape their Olive. It's a mad dash of a picture; one with a pulse and great humor that muffles the heartbreak of the world. And pain like that can only be muffled by sunshine.<br/><br/>Copyright ¬©2006 Sam Osborn.

","hilarious; i laughed so much more at this flick than Talladega Nights, and i love Will Ferrell. i usually reserve this type of movie for rentals, as there are no visuals that must be seen on a big screen. but i'm very glad i went to see it. Kinnear, Collette, Carrell, Arkin and the kids are all awesome. the movie has a lot of heart, and it's all about the cast and the directing. the only distraction for me was the substitution of Santa Barbara for what was supposed to be Redondo Beach, but if you haven't lived in Cali all your life, who cares.<br/><br/>the plot builds to an ending that is very endearing; it makes you love all the characters even more. i was cheering and clapping and laughing like a little girl. with that much emotion and tension going on between multiple characters, it could easily gone astray at so many different times. but it stays on course and weaves deftly around all the pitfalls that befuddle most production teams. kudos to the directors and the writer."
"toddy-8","10","3","7","7 August 2006"," Best comedy of 2006
","The theater I went to in Pasadena, CA tonight was laughing uncontrollably. I have very few criticism's of this movie and the cast is overall sensational. It's hard to find one weak character. Possibly the grandfather was the most one dimensional, but this was a very intelligent script, well directed, well paced, and very well acted.<br/><br/>From the beginning of this piece the characters all have there own issues. We are introduced to one after another, each with their own problems or dilemmas. As the film progresses, the filmmakers have done a very good job expanding on each individual, without any one character taking over the movie, nor any one character being left out. The dialog, for the most part is very real, and you can see this family actually functioning this way. While this movie can easily be described as quirky, hopefully it finds a larger audience with a wider release. This is when independents (fox searchlight) really show they're worth doing. Enough summer blockbusters already, time for some fun, exploratory film-making. <br/><br/>This is by far the best comedy (dark or otherwise) that I've seen in a while, and easily the best one of 2006."
"besttom","9","3","7","4 August 2006"," The funniest movie I've seen this year....by far
","When I saw the previews for this movie, with its strong cast, I had high hopes. I read a good review in the Wash. Post & my expectations were even higher - which I hate going into a movie, 'cause it's always a letdown, right? Not this time - this movie was funny from go, both a dark comedy and just hilarious. It hits / scores on so many levels. Alan Arkin is such a strong old man for such a loser H fiend. Kinnear is such a loser for someone who sells a system for winning. I can go on and on - and I'm horrible at writing these, so deal. It's a great story of a young girl who I think it's safe to say you wouldn't imagine in the world of pre-teen beauty queen competition. She's gotta go be in a show so the whole family goes along. To say that hilarity ensues would be unoriginal, lacking any imagination & honest effort at reviewing this film. Hilarity ensues. From 1 dysfunctional, chaotic, ""ROFLOL"" scene after another, the family (minus 1) finally makes it to the show. <br/><br/>Now, I think one of the best parts of this movie is how it skewers the world of young girl beauty pageants. All this poor little Jen-Benet's running around - it's appalling & (honestly) hard to watch. They look like little midgets, certainly not like little girls. It's sad...So just as you're thinking it, Dad & Bro tell Mom to get Olive (the contestant) the HELL out of there. Olive goes and and guess what? More hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this movie is touching, it's real, it's sensitive, it's at times dramatic and depressing - hey, it's like a slice of real life. But through it all, this move is absolutely hysterical. You must see it and you will not be disappointed."

","This was an excellent movie, the cast was excellent, the script was excellent, everything was just about perfect. Though I was not really prepared for the downs that accompanied the ups in this, they were worthwhile and meaningful. This movie pretty much takes place on a road trip over near a thousand miles. You get to know the characters pretty well. Dano the teenage brother, I hope we will see a lot more from him. He is quite the actor. The little girl Olive, also really excellent. Of course who could go wrong with Arkin, Kinnear, Colette and Carrell. Carrell really shows he is more than just a comedy guy in this. <br/><br/>The one other thing about this movie, I didn't find myself thinking 'yeah, right' at any unbelievable scenes. This was truly believable, therefore not in the same category as say ""40 Old Year Virgin"" which was funny but outrageous. <br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a meaningful comedy. If you are just looking for something for big laughs, go see something else, this will surely make you laugh, the theater roared at times. But, there was some painful moments, if you are capable of empathy at all. This is a testament to all the great acting."

"MyersDonihoo","9","3","7","2 August 2006"," One of the best of 2006
","Little Miss Sunshine, starring Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Steve Carrell, and the absolutely amazing Abigail Breslin is a true gem of a movie. Its funny, witty, intelligent, even has slapstick, pathos, drama and some very touching scenes. Just when you think that the script will divert into National Lampoon territory or the characters become caricatures it pulls back from the precipice and delivers a scene so touching and real and full of heart and soul. <br/><br/>The story involves a family where everyone has some eccentric quirk and they go on a road trip in a beat up 1972 VW bus to a beauty pageant in California. Could be so contrived, so ""RV"" and yet these people really care about one another and have depth and that's what saves this film.<br/><br/>I'm gushing because it seems like forever since I've enjoyed a movie in the theater so much. I would love for this to become the Sideways of 2006, the little indie that could. I hope that Abigail Breslin receives the accolades she most richly deserves. And Greg Kinnear, fresh from Matador (a wonderfully funny film that's a must see) is great as the motivational dad. And Steve Carrell, who plays this straight, is wonderful as the depressed uncle."

","We're all in it for the long, dysfunctional haul is the tone and message sent throughout the movie. The acting is wonderful, the meaning well done, and purpose clear. It is a refreshing movie that, although somewhat dark in tone, left me feeling restored as I left the theater. Steve Carell successfully makes the jump from the comedy of The 40 Year Old Virgin and The Office to the suicidal, almost defeated character in this film. Alan Arkin does beautifully as the gruff, hardened grandfather with a special connection with his granddaughter. And it's very nice to see a young girl being played by someone other than Dakota Fanning (finally). The directing is done beautifully and the script leaves room for humor in even the darkest of moments in the plot. Bravo."

","Finally a movie that truly lives up to it's trailer. Saw a preview for LMS about a month ago and have been thinking about it ever since. And then I finally got to see it.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this movie. Fantastic ensemble acting. Beautifully crafted moments. I am in love with Alan Arkin and Steve Carell. Big fabulous crushes. It is so nice to see two actors who began at the Second City and in the comedy world do such nuanced, truthful performance. Carell can absolutely do something like Eternal Sunshine -- now we know. Comedians make the best actors! They have the ability to be TRUE...thats one of the most important things in comedy...and if you're great at that often you can do the flip side: move the crap out of an audience. And Carell and Arkin are both genius in this film.<br/><br/>OK, but I should also stress that the entire cast is bloody brilliant. This little girl is astonishing. Not showy and all actor-y.

","""Love comforteth like sunshine after rain."" Shakespeare, Lear <br/><br/>So you think any one of these summer comedies could be called the best of the year: Scoop, Clerks II, You, Me and Dupree, Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest. Not so when you see Little Miss Sunshine, a certifiable winner for the year with a fraction of their budgets and more wit than even the Woodman can employ.<br/><br/>Think National Lampoon's Vacation with moments of important social conscience. The Hoover family is traveling by VW bus from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach for the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker whose 9 step program has no real effect on an essentially slacking family, including potty-mouthed, tell-it-all-like-it-is grandpa (Alan Arkin) as hilariously out of place here as he is in the world. Brother-in-law Frank has tried suicide more than once, in part because his closest academic rival may have proved to be the best living Proust scholar rather than Frank.<br/><br/>My bus broke down as does theirs. They always do on long trips. As with the Hoovers, however, lessons can be learned and humanity tapped on such disastrous outings. Sunshine strips the pretense from the whole family, threatening to make them normal and loving, and certifying after they see the pageant, that they will never enter little sister is such an American tragedy again.<br/><br/>I guess all American long trips are a metaphor for the growth of our country and the flowering of character. This film shows more character development than most of the films this summer combined. Dad's self-help program's mantra is ""Refuse to lose,"" as apt a chant for this family as could be. Along the way the Hoover family faces its darkest secrets, confirms the salutary nature of love, and keeps a sense of humor.<br/><br/>You'll laugh, too."
"mkane5","10","3","7","28 July 2006"," Laughed so hard my belly hurt
","Toward the end of this movie there were a couple of moments when I couldn't stop laughing. It was great entertainment, especially if you need a laugh and a break from violence and gore. I loved it! <br/><br/>The characters were a little weird, but the teen boy (Paul Dano) reminded me of my ex's son and he's probably more typical of teenagers than not. There was a little contrivance in the plot at one point (it just felt a little overdone but not that big a deal in the big scheme of things). The dad (Greg Kinnear) was a great character, William H. Macy could have played him, too, if that helps you picture him. Toni Collette did a super job and handled a tough part really well. Of all the cast she gets the least to do, really. Steve Carrell was good, probably developed most of all the characters. <br/><br/>But the real stars are listed as ""with"" on the playbill: Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin. Wow. Abigail plays a 7-year-old regular kid. What a contrast to the dolls in the pageant--it creeped me out how they looked like miniature adults. You can't help but think of JonBenet when you see those scenes. Alan Arkin had such great lines, he was really the instigator of everything that happened in that movie. Emmett Walsh as the highway patrol cop did a great job, too. <br/><br/>I guess the real stars are the writers who thought up the relationships and development of characters, the directors who coached the performances out of these folks, and the producers who sank money into it even though it doesn't feature any huge stars, sex scenes, or violence. To all of them, THANK YOU--I HOPE YOU MAKE BUCKETS OF MONEY. I haven't felt so happy after leaving a theater since The Full Monty. Except I was a little sad the movie was over."

","I saw this film in a movie theatre in Times Square...hardly my first choice for viewing movies. But I will say that Little Miss Sunshine is so excellent, that you could screen the movie in Siberia or in a Wal Mart parking lot in Missouri... and the audience will be transfixed and fall in love.<br/><br/>So many indie movies are so quirky that they mean little to anyone other than the actual filmmaker. And other indie movies fall too much into the ""it was a dramatic road trip but we are all so much happier now that we made it"" category. Little Miss Sunshine, while quirky and dramatic, never treads these lines. Instead, what you find is a brilliant movie that makes you laugh, that makes your eyes tear, that makes you cringe and reminds you of your family in some shape or form.<br/><br/>If anything, it is a story about who we are, and who we often end stuck with."

","I saw this movie at the LA Film Festival a few weeks ago, and boy was I surprised. This film is so beautifully put together. The writing was great, managing to bring all the senses and feelings together and make it work. There are parts that you laugh your butt off, parts that make you angry, and parts that make you cry... WHILE laughing. There are several scenes that have just never been done before, which is what made this movie so unique. While the dysfunctional family thing has been done many times, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" manages to give the story it's own gentle, yet abrasive spin. This is a nice glimpse into the many intriguing parts of people and society as a whole. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes great films, not just blockbuster stuff.

I needn't have worried, the good nature of this film embraces you early, and never lets you go. The characters all ring true and the actors are faithful to that truth. Some people might complain about the films sentimentality and that it is somewhat manipulative...but what the hey, when you're having this much fun, who cares? I do wonder though about the people who rate films, here is a warm, funny story about a family which, though dysfunctional, is caring and loving and it's rated R for language, and some drug use, while films featuring maiming, murder and a buffet of bloodletting slips by with a PG 13...go figure. The writer's take on the road picture is refreshing, the action stems from the cast's reaction to the vagaries of travel, rather than relying on chance encounters with unusual people."

"KnightsofNi11","9","2","4","15 August 2011"," A virtually flawless triumph of character development
","Pleasant, charming, witty, fantastic, emotional. These words don't even begin to describe how great of a film Little Miss Sunshine is. It's the best picture nominated winner of two academy awards (Best supporting actor and best original screenplay) that follows a quirky and strange family across the country in their VW bus as they head for California with dogged determination to enter their daughter into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. The oddball family includes Olive (Abigail Breslin) the youngest of the family and who is entering the pageant. Her parents are Sheryl and Richard (Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear), Olive's suicidal uncle Frank (Steve Carell), Olive's silent brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), and her jaded yet loving grandfather Edwin, played by Alan Arkin in an academy award winning role. Together, this family provides us with some of the most charming laughs and some of the most tear jerking, heart wrenching moments of true human emotion that will bring a tear or a smile to your face.<br/><br/>This is a film that is all about the characters and their relationships that develop over the course of the film, and they are, each and every one of them, fantastically written characters. They are so incredibly human that you believe every word and every action that occurs on the screen. When the film begins all of the characters are drastically flawed people. In fact, none of the characters are even all that likable. Richard is full of himself and tries to force his ideas on everybody around him. Sheryl is under constant stress and can't get her life together. Dwayne comes across as nothing but a whiny punk teenager who hates the world. Uncle Frank is a pretty pathetic loser who seems to have given up on himself. And Grandpa Edwin has nothing but love for his granddaughter, but resents everyone else. He constantly complains about his past and at first seems like nothing but an angry old man with nothing to live for.<br/><br/>But the character we immediately fall in love with is the adorable Olive. Her heart is full of nothing but innocence and sweetness and she is in fact what brings this family together to share this love and compassion. And through her we are able to fall in love with all of these characters by the end of the film. It is character development magic at work, and it works perfectly. The more we learn about these characters the more we enjoy them, and the more they learn about themselves the more they love each other. It is incredibly moving to see a family that begins the film so detached from each other come so far and so close together that by the end of the film they are all new people. Their perceptions of each other change so much for the better, as does the viewers perceptions of these characters. It is a practically flawless developmental arc.<br/><br/>There's something about this film where even if something happens that doesn't seem realistic or seems a little too over-the-top you just don't care. The film makes any and all of its absurdities work and there just wasn't a moment of this film that I didn't enjoy. In fact I adored almost every moment of the film. Everything that this film tried to accomplish worked stunningly well. It is such a touching story that provides an excellent balance of clever laughs and tears that aren't forced upon you by an easy script. This isn't a film that tells us how to feel. It is just done with such wondrous talent and pure emotional integrity that we can't help but fall in love with it."

","Little Miss Sunshine is just an amazing and original film.<br/><br/>It is about what it means to be a family, how things don't usually work out the way we might hope and how that can be exactly what brings people together. It's a Comedy Drama and is extremely funny. However it is also emotional, honest and deeply moving. The characters all seem very real and believable; the young actress Abigail Breslin who played Olive was particularly good and really made the character something special.<br/><br/>In places the humour seems quite dark and the tone bleak but ultimately the film is hopeful and uplifting."

","Its about winning and loosing, families and relationships. A disgruntled teenager, a dad whose career is a wreck, a daughter who wants to get into a beauty pageant, a suicidal uncle, a heroine addicted grandfather and a mom just trying to keep it together. This movie portrays a typical family that anyone can relate to. It begs the question of what family means to us anymore. The concept of a family used to hold a lot more meaning but today its just a group of individuals living under one roof. It may be four, it may be more, but the fact remains that our families are not a big part of our life anymore. This is the running theme of the movie.<br/><br/>The directing is just amazing, acting is top of the line even the little girl Olive, played by Abigail Breslin. She is easily the best character in the movie and although the youngest seems to be the most grounded. All in all this is a brilliant movie."
"pomeroy-nick","10","2","4","5 July 2011"," Any film that has managed to keep my attention through numerous viewings and still entertains in such a way deserves a 10.
","Three things can basically sum up Little Miss Sunshine: hilarious, inappropriate, beautiful. Little Miss Sunshine, directed by Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris, is a genuinely brilliant movie that manages to be indecorous while never being truly out of line.<br/><br/>The story follows the Hoover family travelling to California so their little girl can enter a beauty pageant. The running joke throughout is that Olive isn't especially ""beautiful,"" at least in the pageant-queen perspective. Accompanied by the uncle, grandfather, and brother of Olive, she and her parents drive their yellow camper van across the southwest with bizarre occurrences following them all the way. From the hospital and the motel to the pageant itself, Little Miss Sunshine is a non-stop journey of laughter and emotion.<br/><br/>Every member of the family from Grandpa to Olive is superbly acted, making it impossible to not get sucked into their lives. The relationship between Grandpa and Olive is particularly interesting, while Grandpa is crass and unapologetic when in the company of the rest of the family, if Olive is there, he is kind and sweet. He clearly has a lot of love for the young girl and doesn't want her to become aware of and burdened by the family's various issues.<br/><br/>Every member of the family has their problems, from the heroin addiction of Grandpa, the career problems of the father, the depression of Frank and Dwayne's dream to be a pilot. Each of these is dealt with throughout the film and add extra dimensions and explanations for their actions. Their goals are all seemingly crushed due to different reasons although all the events bring the family closer together. The father is trying to enhance his career by promoting his ""9 Steps to Success"", however, it fails to materialise, threatening the family's finances. This irony is wonderfully exposed using a few key scenes and the money issues of the family are shown throughout.<br/><br/>As the film climaxes, the underlying event has been the beauty pageant, and the dance Olive is to perform. The Grandpa has been coaching her and we have small hints throughout as to what it will entail yet when it finally gets round to showing the performance, you will be in fits of uncomfortable laughter. I can't do the dance justice in words, but take it from me, it is well worth the wait and personifies the film entirely. All I have to do is mention the dance routine to a friend and we are in hysterics.<br/><br/>""What is your daughter doing?"" ""She's kicking ass, that's what she's doing.""<br/><br/>Lastly, the soundtrack, oh my word the soundtrack, Little Miss Sunshine has without doubt, my favourite audio backing of any film. The tempo of the songs rises and falls at the perfect moments and echoes the mood of the characters. Performed mostly by DeVotchka, it is soothing and melodic, precisely what is needed in such a film.<br/><br/>Any film that has managed to keep my attention through numerous viewings and still entertains in such a way deserves an A+."

","Every time I see this, and I've seen it many times, I feel fantastic both during the film and after it. It is an amazing movie about family and about accepting yourself and feeling good about who you are. This film forces all characters to make the best of the situation they're in. Individuality is the most important thing in this film, followed by accepting your family and following your dreams. It is a film worth watching and buying. In addition to the feelings it creates, the film is very funny, shows perspectives on life and have characters that evolves.

"johnnyboyz","6","2","4","6 May 2010"," Cute without ever really committing itself to anything, the film enjoys its diverting road movie approach and its quaint laughs but is difficult to get too excited about.
","Six people in a bright yellow VW camping van, each of them as wildly different to the next, travelling and therefore forced into being thrust together as they journey to California for something. One's a suicidal academic; one's a disgruntled elderly man; one's a rebellious, frizzy haired adolescent who's refusing to speak; one's a middle of the road housewife; one's an easy-going, likable husband and father who's just trying to do the best for those he loves and one's a girl of about ten whom thinks the world is her oyster. There you go, there's your pitch and such a wildly uneven premise to a film is only fitting given how sporadic and only mildly diverting Little Miss Sunshine really is. The idea is you pick the character you see most representative of you, and map onto them as they all plough on together.<br/><br/>The film is good natured but it's ultimately a little flat and uninvolved, relying on comedic content that I didn't find so comedic and a rich amount of symbolism representing what these people are thinking and feeling, the kind of which we are all able to figure out anyway. Take the instance early on, for example, in which Frank (Carell), housewife Sheryl's (Collette) suicidal brother, sits deathly alone in a hospital area after a recent bout of suicidal ideation; the camera situated so as to capture how it is he feels and where he is in life; or later on, in which, whilst meeting a business cohort by a swimming pool somewhere, father and husband Richard (Kinnear) talks of how he's struggling but really trying to wade through all the issues and problems his life skills company has hit as a completely unrelated person swims by, or wades by, in the water, systematically representational of his own plight. The film likes the idea of linking commonplace places and events onto a wider spectrum of struggle, manifested within its lead characters.<br/><br/>I think I was supposed to feel surprised; be humoured; feel angered and then rather pleased at most of what happens in Little Miss Sunshine, throughout. The film sees young Olive (Breslin), youngest of the Hoover family based in New Mexico, pine to be an entrant into a beauty contest in California; something that everyone eventually all agrees in heading off to. Being a road movie of sorts, the film is given all kinds of reasons to have all manner of wacky items crop up to bulk out the runtime and deliver a few feint laughs along the way. Yes, they get partially lost; yes, they're pulled over by the police and yes, the van does indeed break down, that then resulting in a rather annoying reoccurring gag that sees them have to keep it in a consistent state of motion so as to avoid having to kill the ignition. Once you've mapped yourself onto either the screwy, oddball, Nietzsche reading son Dwayne (Dano) if you're of that ilk; or the toothy, smiley, beaming Sheryl if you're of that ilk; or the disgruntled elderly gentleman Edwin (Arkin) if you're of that ilk, then there's no limit in the manner of fun you may or may not have in watching these wacky misadventures unfold.<br/><br/>Despite it having its characters roll along toward their destination, the film is almost certainly circular in its structure; allowing a number of the characters to progress from various states to otherwise different. One character is alive and well prior to the trip, but dead by the time it's concluded; the same with another character of whom remains mute for most of the duration, but undergoes a discovery and we observe how that changes him whereas someone else has a definitive dream at the start but realises they were well out of their depth when the time comes to live it. The respective arcs are sweet enough, harmless in their basic establishing; evolving and then placing into a newer order but it's little more than mildly engaging. The writer, a certain Michael Arndt, is, I think, a little worried that all the wavy, messy content will bury what it is he wants to say and that's highlighted in a scene between two characters whom share the piece's moment of pure exposition: a sequence in which, standing on a pier with the wide open ocean behind them, they speak of life and life being what you make it and that one needs to suffer in order to journey or learn. The seemingly endless ocean behind them acting as a clear representation of the great unknown, a link to what unknown delights await you within the vast mass of everything.<br/><br/>The film is a wavy and sporadic effort; desperately wanting the quirky fact they're all travelling to where they're going in a bright yellow VW van to attain a sort of instantly recognisable, if not 'cult', status. Along the way, the film will provide a range of wacky scenes which ought to feel more heartfelt than they actually are when Edwin, the eldest character, who it's established is a drug addict, passes on advice to the youngest in Olive and takes on a kind of mentor role but it just comes off as a little creepy more than anything. The film tackles death as an issue and how it affects families when a certain character is removed from the text but does so with a pinch of salt rather than with a full blooded exploration of any kind. In short, it's a mildly diverting road picture hybrid which is a little off colour in tone but with a few laughs; certain instances contained within demonstrate directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' eye for film-making and this was clearly a project that they were really up for, but the film does too much if anything; wildly chopping from one locale to another and cramming too many characters doing and experiencing too much, all of which mysteriously combines into something rather underwhelming."

","I didn't get what I was expecting out of this film but what I got was a enjoyable road movie. It's basically about trying to take Olive Hoover played by Abigail Breslin to a Little Miss Sunshine pageant and the scenes to get there was very fun with it's smart jokes and witty dialogue. The actors that stood out the most was Steve Carell who was great in his role and fit perfectly and Paul Dano who usually just comes off as being depressing was actually quite entertaining to watch, even though he was throwing a lot of hissy fit. There is no big plot twist but what you do get is some stuff you won't expect and will have a lot of fun with it. At first when the film started I thought I was just in for another indie comedy, but it was so much more than that with elaborate ways the characters get closer with one another and the comedy is also a bit dark which works just fine and never turns from it message. It was like a excellent comedy about the little engine that could.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"NutzieFagin","9","2","4","12 September 2009"," A must see movie, very entertaining!
","Little Miss Sunshine is a very entertaining Comedy that explores dreams, family relationships and the disappointments that we face in life trying to find our dreams.<br/><br/>First, we are introduced to Olive, a eight year old girl who dreams of being a beauty queen. By luck, she gets in the Little Miss Sunshine finals. When she and her family travel to the pageant, they encounter disaster after disaster....the bus breaks down, Cheryl's brother encounters an old flame, and a family death. Regardless, they brave the elements and forge on.<br/><br/>The characters in this family are very much like oddballs. But they have a couple of similarities. They each have a dream or goal--whether it's winning a pageant, living with the one you love, becoming a pilot or landing a big business deal. The other common thing is despite the fights and bickering, they really stick together despite all disappointments.<br/><br/>The movie in this context somewhat portrays a message. We all have dreams. To quit trying to get your dreams is dishonorable. Even if you have no hope--like Olive and her brother, it doesn't look like they'll get their labors rewarded, but the main thing is that they have each other. This film also kinda offers a look into the ""scary"" world of child beauty contests--how doll like and perfect (and yet they are not perfect) itis. But brave little Olive shows them what the forge ahead spirit is!<br/><br/>The only thing I can't understand in the movie...when Olive does her talent show performance (which her grandpa showed her how to ""dance"") Didn't the parents or the rest of the family ever see this ""performance"" (which is funny but uncomfortable in an adult point of view) Well, no matter...a must see movie!"

","I saw these movie almost 3 years ago and I'm under impression even now. I can gallantly say, the best comedy film of XXI century is 'Little Miss Sunshine'.<br/><br/>Start with the characters. The full cast is amazing, parents, Dwayne. But the main stars really are Alen Arkink and Abigail Breslin. This little girl made one of the most memorable faces in the film history. She's full of talent and energy, she definitely has know-how of acting well. I think she was worth of winning Oscar in 2007. Alen Arkink, he played a short but special role in this film. He is a real face of common old grandfather, who does everything on his taste. (Episode of dinner).<br/><br/>The script is wonderful, funny and interesting. Seems you never get bored watching it. (So am I). The funniest moment in film is running after the VW, when it damages. When I first saw it, I couldn't help myself laughing, I was lying on the floor and crying (with laughter). I will never forget it. And also, the moment in caf√É¬©, when Olive eats her ice cream, she has so cute mimicry and expression.<br/><br/>So, I think I wrote most of what I feel about 'Little Miss Sunshine'. No I have to go and see it on my PC. :)"

","The little indie that defied the odds, 2006 may become known as the year of Little Miss Sunshine. A film that took 5 years to make, lost and gained finance and studio backing, but went on to make millions at the box office, and even win an academy award. Travelling cross country in a battered old VW van, a dysfunctional family is brought together by daughter Olive's determination to compete in a beauty pageant, the Little Miss Sunshine of the title. Greg Kinnear is the father, a motivational speaker whose motto's and talk of winners brings groans to the other family members. Toni Collete is the mother, over-worked and exasperated, trying to keep everyone together. A brilliant Alan Arkin (academy award winning performance) is the foul-mouthed, heroin-snorting granddad. Steve Carell is the uncle, pre-eminent Proust scholar, fresh from a failed suicide attempt. Paul Dano is the son, obsessed with Nietzsche and refusing to talk. Abigail Breslin is Olive, the chubby, bespectacled, wannabe beauty queen. Their road trip inevitably hits some hilarious pitfalls. Debut directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris keep the pace sprightly and the comedy flowing. The more sentimental scenes are a delight, never feeling forced or soppy. The final scene, where Olive finally gets to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, is a contender for funniest scene of the year. It exposes child beauty pageants for the paedophillic pantomime that they are and it really needs to be seen to be believed. This film was a treat from start to finish."
"Dr_Kruger","5","2","4","23 April 2008"," The ending saved it
","Let me get this in straight from the off. I don't like this film. I don't like to use the word pretentious too often, it's one of those overused FG words but I think it applies here. It really is nothing more than a bunch of misfits and underachievers who finally, at the end, realise they don't care how the world perceives them. There, one simple sentence which encompasses this 'full of itself' film perfectly.<br/><br/>The whole ""funniest laugh out loud comedy of the year"" is also way off the mark and had me going into it expecting something different from what I got.<br/><br/>I also didn't like some of the ridiculous situations that happen in this, what I now realise was meant to be a mostly serious piece. One particular scene involving grandad in hospital was completely out of context and inexplicably ridiculous.<br/><br/>All that said, I actually liked some of the characters, in particular the young boy and the grandad. The scene between them in the back of the Campervan raised a smile and the ending even raised a titter.<br/><br/>So onto the ending.....I guess after the hour and a half of relative uneventfulness that went before, at least the main issue of the film, as explained in that simple sentence earlier, was brought to the fore in entertaining fashion and at least the film didn't peter out which is what looked like was going to happen."

","From the previews I saw, Little Miss Sunshine did not look like a film that would have the ability to grasp my attention. I never planned on seeing the film. Tonight, I was looking around at movies to rent, and it caught my eye. I had seen it's high markings on IMDb and decided to go against my original gut instinct and go for it! Thank God I did. This film is a rare gem. With such extraordinary characters, it's no wonder this film is in the Top 250. Upon rare occasion am I comfortable granting a 10 rating to any film. It has to be earned! This film simply took hold of my attention and refused to let go. I was captivated by the plot, the characters, and the outstanding risks this film took, using a story centered around a dysfunctional family. I am beyond thrilled I took a chance tonight, and I urge those who have any hesitation about this film to do the same. Would I recommend this movie to people? There is no question. Absolutely. Thank you to all those involved with the film for putting together a masterpiece of brilliant direction combined with the FLAWLESS (not a common word for me) cast.<br/><br/>Film rating: 9.6/10 - A+ <br/><br/>Recommended: Yes"

","Melodramatic comedy has developed a new subgenre - the dysfunctional family film. Sure, there have been precursors to The Royal Tannenbaums, the Turnblads of Hairspray, The Addams Family and the Hoovers of Little Miss Sunshine, but with the advent of the euphemism ""independant film"" film-makers can now at least pretend to deal more openly, intelligently and humorously with taboo subjects that you'll never see on The Brady Bunch. Even if it now seems necessary to make a film with an 8 million dollar budget appear to be independent.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a really nice little film. It follows the misadventures of a family on the brink of bankruptcy, divorce, suicide, death and general angst as they journey from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach to enter their little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) into a beauty contest. There are several very funny moments, but the film reaches deeper levels than most comedies and thankfully avoids insulting its audience's intelligence like most contemporary comedies do.<br/><br/>The script is exceptionally good. The directing and editing are fine and the cinematography is excellent.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is terrific and each character is very carefully written. Although the characters are very consistent they are anything but shallow and one-dimensional. You will probably feel as if you've met them - and this feeling is one of the keys to enjoying this film.<br/><br/>About 28 years ago, a friend of mine said to me that ""everybody's problems are the biggest problems in the world to them."" Taken in its proper context, this simple truth has helped me understand the structure of personal tragedy - which is the philosophical core of this film - nicely summarized by Steve Carrell's character in his discussion of Marcel Proust near the end of the film. And I don't just mean that what does not kill you makes you stronger. This film packs a better, simpler, and more profound message than this clich√© can express.<br/><br/>Recommended - especially for people who sometimes forget to enjoy their lives."

","I spent more than a few minutes reading the ""hated it"" reviews by folks here. The criticisms seem to suggest that this is a tasteless film that promotes drug abuse and child molestation. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a quirky comedy filled with interesting characters - and despite the common themes it has with other road films (most notably ""Vacation"") it manages to do what the best satire usually does; make you think and laugh.<br/><br/>The family on the fringe consists of a porno-loving, horse-sniffing grandpa, an emo teen who wants to be a USAF pilot, a Dad who is a failure in business, a stressed-out Mom, and her gay, jilted, suicidal brother. Holding this diverse family together is a chubby little girl who dreams of winning a beauty contest. The road trip that they take to get to the pageant reveals the characters flaws and insecurities. The only one who seems to have some sort of inner peace is Olive, the girl who has her eyes on the prize despite the wacky goings-on during the trip.<br/><br/>Stop right there. Does the synopsis of this film seem believable to you? Of course not. These characters only inhabit Hollywood films. I haven't seen many John McClain's at the Dunkin Donuts while patrolling the streets but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy ""Die Hard."" Any road film in this day and age is going to be derivative of earlier efforts. What distinguishes this film is the accurate representation of the role that family plays in our competitive society today. How many thousands of miles do today's soccer parents log taking their kids to games? Dance recitals? Music lessons? Did anyone even consider for one second what the parents did for Olive was excessively indulgent? I know I didn't. She was a sweet girl who had a dream. I would have done the same for my kid. My Mussolini-serving, fascist-loving Dad (and he is indeed a real character) would have given up his other trigger finger to get his grandkids what they wanted. This is America today. Win at any cost and make sure you look good doing it.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the amazing final scene. Many found Olive's risqu√© dance to ""Superfreak"" disturbing and highly sexualized. As a parent who has attended many dance recitals, I can tell you that there was nothing even remotely sexual in this routine when compared to real performances I have seen from little girls the same age as Olive. Olive's dance is a REJECTION of the the beauty pageant, it's over-made-up little tarts, their usually fat mothers, and the tacky Vegas-style revue that it resembles. The little girl is having fun - she is shaking and grinding it because she likes to dance. Her infectious spinning around during the dance, and her family joining her to support her amidst outraged Stepford parents, is a strong an affirmation on family-values as I have seen in a while. ""Sanford Babbit?"" Would you want to be his kid for even one second?"" asked Tom Cruise in ""Rain Man."" That was another road film with an unlikely cast of characters that evolved into a touching tale of family love. Contrived? Maybe. But at least it wasn't misunderstood as this fine film was, despite the same message."

","I really didn't know what this movie was about beyond that it had something to do with child beauty pageants. Very quickly the movie with its unusual characters grew on me and I was anxious to see where it would end up.<br/><br/>The movie is basically about a family driving their daughter to a regional kiddie beauty contest - it's a real long drive and the family members (grandfather and uncle included) are all dysfunctional. It's anything but smooth driving! <br/><br/>This movie is more drama than comedy. There are lots of amusing moments throughout the movie, but they are all against the backdrop of disconcerting family situations and pent-up emotions. The mix of the two is very well done. The movie is both funny and intense.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, this is a character-driven movie and the characters are all interesting and very well acted. In fact, they are very unusual characters, but that made them all the more over-the top and interesting. Within the first 20 minutes, I realized that I was really interested in all the characters and wanted to see what would happen to them next.

","I bought the DVD of Little Miss Sunshine- and alas, I wasn't disappointed. it was fantastically funny and the performances by Arkin, Carell, Collette, young Abigail Breslin, Dano and Kinnear were just top notch stuff. The Hoovers like any other family have their own problems: father Richard is a unsuccessful motivational speaker trying to instill confidence and to be able to fully motivate his family, mother Sheryl is a chain smoking wife and mother to Olive, who at times is at loggerheads with her husband in the film, grandpa J Edgar Hoover is a foul mouthed, heroin snorting junkie, uncle Frank is gay and on the verge of committing suicide after his partner left him for another guy, whilst Dwayne is a Frederich Nietzsche addict, who takes up a vow of silence, in his attempts to one day become a fighter pilot. As for Olive, she seems to be one without the problems and unaware of the problems plaguing her dysfunctional family. The family all set off in a mini yellow Volkswagen on a road trip to Redondo beach, California and to the Little miss sunshine beauty pageant that olive is taking part in. However, during their journey numerous events unravel within the plot: grandpa dies in his sleep, the family sneak his dead body from the hospital bed and attempt to load it in the van, Frank comes into contact with his former lover at a local gas station, Dwayne breaks his vow of silence after Frank tells him he is colour blind and towards the end,there is a small encore scene where the Hoovers get on stage and lark about to Rick James' 'Superfreak', which is one of the main highlights of this film. <br/><br/>It is amusing, tragic and light-hearted all rolled into one, Little Miss Sunshine is a fab film which often tugs at the heart strings but also highlights that the beauty myth, can be so flawed due to the existence of beauty pageant shows that seek to sexualise that myth, as well as to disseminate and rob the innocence of young girls. Both Kinnear and Collette are great character actors, who seem to perform well, either as supporting characters to the main leads in a good established mainstream film, or as leads in a well written independent flick, such as Little Miss Sunshine.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a fantastic movie that rightly deserved its plaudits"
"chets808","8","2","4","13 June 2007"," What child acting can achieve when its right.
","Spoilers ahead, drive carefully.<br/><br/>LMS sports a superb cast playing misfits of suburbia. Kinnear, always good, is insufferable as the wanna-be Tony Robbins; Steve Carell is, well, Steve Carell, no one possesses better comic instincts these days, but his role here clearly points the way towards a successful future in semi-comic dramatic roles or maybe semi-dramatic comic roles (see Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, et. al.); Alan Arkin is successfully dusted off and reminds everyone why The Russians Are Coming was so damn funny in the first place. But its the two women in the film, Collette and the fresh, seemingly uncoached Abigail Breslen who center the film. They are the glue that holds these freaks (including the abyss staring son, Dwayne) together. The underlying ties that bind are obviously Collette's to pull, yet among this definite A-list of stars, portraying a B-list family, Abigail's Olive steals every scene she's in. There is absolute beauty and pureness to her focus and straight forward approach. You can tell her awkwardness, the way she stands, when she's busting with energy, her walk, are not products of endless child acting classes; her portrayal of Olive is spot on and never forced. Maybe its noticeable to fathers of daughters; but there are moments, faint sparkles of awkward innocence that can melt the surliest grouches. And, its funny. very funny. I absolutely love the irony at the pageant dance, with everyone appalled by the racy (read: too slutty) Superfreak dance, while the rest of them are engaging in thinly veiled (if at all) whore-training. Just put a pole on that stage, and the whole thing takes on a totally different connotation. LMS is focused. Tight. They don't veer too far of course. Its a ""small"" film, and good things come in ""small"" packages (even if the package is a fat suit): recommended."

","I saw this movie two days ago and could not believe the level of stupidity of the family. Those people/their characters are just not ''normal'', not ''plain real'' and definitely not ''simply so connected to the characters''. What we are is shuddered at the parents who would take their little child to a competition like Little Miss Sunshine where you can just feel the pedophilia and deformity of the society, their tremendous narrow-mindedness, to the point that it hurts. The movie itself is made in a more European way than the American which is laudatory, the actors are very good but the message which movie carries is not ""A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try."" It's not ''inspiring''. It's not about ''determination and devotion despite all the obstacles in their way''. Its message is that the world has gone mad, the values have disappeared from the society and this world needs some serious mending."
"Eclipse_manifest","9","2","4","6 February 2007"," A Wee Piece of the Sun
","Little Miss Sunshine is a film that shines in every facet of the word. Opening with a little bit of introduction to characters you presumably do not know, Sunshine seems to draw you in with a bit of wonder. This is the story of a girl who wants to compete in a massive beauty contest in California, and is given that chance by the sheer luck of coming in second at a previous contest. The winner of the former contest is forced to drop out, and Olive, the little girl, gets her chance to be Little Miss Sunshine. Olive's seemingly dysfunctional family sets out on a road trip in an iconic yellow 'VW Minibus.' Each of the family members has some unique story, and state of mind, that makes each one very interesting to watch as the film progresses. A homosexual uncle who's on suicide watch, an overachieving father, the estranged mother who's desperately trying to stop the seams from snapping, the silent brother, and of course, the heroin addicted grandfather. The trials that each member of this family goes through during the course of this flick is. on paper, very tacky. With that being said, this movie is far from tacky, and that is credited to the great writing, and the absolutely perfect cast. Steve Carell is the biggest star, and pulls off his role with the utmost class, and his quirkiness completely sells the believability of the character. There was no bad performances, however, at least two more must be noted. Paul Dano is as good, if not better than his more experienced counterparts, as the aphonic Dwayne... and considering he doesn't speak for a majority of the film, that's quite the achievement. The best actress in this film is undoubtedly Abigail Breslin. This girl outplays every single one of her co-stars, because she brings such a natural and sheer believability to her character Olive.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, this movie is so fantastic, because it doesn't rely on big names, special effects, or huge budgets to communicate a heartwarming, yet sad, believable, realistic story and sacrifices nothing. The sheer genuine feeling that flows through your body at the end of this awesome flick is reason enough to see it. You won't be disappointed."

If you liked 40-year-old Virgin, you'll like the similar sense of humor in this movie, but LMS is an even better all around movie. Not only is it funny, but it's deep at parts with how families can relate these days and different issues seldom talked about in movies. Little Miss Sunshine has an overall lesson of family acceptance, regardless of differences.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed in this movie that is rare is a LOT of bright colors. Also, I love that most of the actors are not ""pefect"" looking, like most these days. The characters of very realistic and relatable.<br/><br/>I understand why the young actor is up for an award!

"mr-siyi-deng","9","2","4","5 February 2007"," A spicy comedy-drama teemed with sunshine
","I wasn't so impressed right after I watched this movie. But next day I kept thinking about what its seemingly anti-climax ending truly means. One thing is sure: this is definitely not an ordinary comedy. It distinguished itself from ""cheap"" laughter-invokers in that you know things are not that simple while you were laughing. Neither should it be labeled as a ""dark"" comedy. It is ... a spicy comedy-drama teemed with sunshine.<br/><br/>But on a second thought, is it really sun rays everywhere? Shortly after the opening scene we realized that our main characters, the Hoover family, is besieged by so many troubles that the only reason it didn't fall apart is due to inertia. Oh, and our little miss sunshine, of course. The best part of this insecure family is that it is almost a typical specimen of the prevailing social problems: divorce, poverty, indifference, drug-abuse, suicide, homosexuality, pride & prejudice, etc. With the development of the story, we tend to be more and more anxious about the outcome of Olive's trip to the child beauty pageant and put all these ailment off. In the middle I was tricked to believe that this is a Shirley-Temple Clone. It offers more than that. Surprisingly, after the Hoovers left the scene in the yellow VW bus, nothing seemed to be solved yet everything is now sunshine.<br/><br/>My favorite quotes from the movie: Frank: ""You know Marcel Proust? ... Yeah. French writer. Total loser. Never had a real job. Unrequited love affairs. Gay. Spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads. But he's also probably the greatest writer since Shakespeare. Anyway, he uh- he gets down to the end of his life... and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered- Those were the best years of his life, 'cause they made him who he was. All those years he was happy? You know, total waste. Didn't learn a thing. So, if you sleep until you're 18... Ah, think of the suffering you're gonna miss. I mean high school? High school- Those are your prime suffering years. You don't get better suffering than that.""<br/><br/>And, of course this: Grandpa: ""Listen to me, I got no reason to lie to you, don't make the same mistakes I made when I was young. F**k a lotta women kid, not just one woman, a Lotta women.""<br/><br/>4 Oscars nominated. How many will it win? Let's see."

","Olive (Abigail Breslin), Richard (Greg Kinnear), Sheryl (Toni Collette), Dwayne (Paul Dano), Frank (Steve Carell), & someone simply known as Grandpa (Alan Arkin) all make up the Hoover family. Together they are traveling in a run-down yellow VW bus from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach in order to get 7-year-old Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, where she will hopefully be crowned the winner. As simple a task that may seem, the trip proves to be a difficult, yet enriching one. On their journey the family must deal with heartbreak, shattered dreams, & even death, all the while learning to support and trust one another no matter what life throws their way.<br/><br/>First time directors, Faris and Dayton, have created a remarkably and genuinely excellent film. From the amazing cast and their splendid performances to the hilarious screenplay written by Michael Arndt, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is hands down one best films of the year.<br/><br/>The great thing about each character that is apart of the Hoover family and featured in the movie, is that they're all so very realistic. The most distinctive and memorable members of the family would have to be Olive's older brother, Dwayne and Grandpa. Dwayne presents the characteristics of what many kids today consider themselves today as ""emo"". As the film advances, we learn he is actually just your average teenager that's simply misunderstood and not ""emo"" at all. Then there's Grandpa; wisecracking, heroin snorting, kicked out of the retirement home for sleeping around Grandpa. Arkin does a terrific job with this role. He brings not only the character's written personality to life, but adds his own flare as well with his great facial expressions that only fuels the entertaining hoopla presented in 'Little Miss Sunshine'.<br/><br/>The hilarity doesn't seem to stop even when death tries to darken the movie's comedic stance. Grandpa's rantings alone make the movie worth seeing. The irony that Olive's dad, Richard, is a motivational speaker who day in, day out informs people about how to achieve their goals, yet he himself can't accomplish anything is just of the several added bonuses.<br/><br/>After changing my mind three times; first deciding to see 'The Illusionist', then again to 'The Black Dahlia', and finally agreeing upon 'Little Miss Sunshine' I'm really glad I did. There's not a funnier or better cast film out right now. The bottom line is 'Little Miss Sunshine' is an absolute winner and one of the few must-see films of the year. The only reason not to see it would be because it's no longer playing at your theater. In which case you then find another theater in your area that is."

","Little Miss Sunshine is a movie that only functions because of its characters. The plot is simple, the setting is simple, and there are no camera tricks--but the characters are real. From the first scene, the film already influences the viewer into forming conceptions about each character, judging them. But then, the movie is about a girl whose family travels from afar for the sole purpose of having her judged. As the movie progresses, it becomes apparent that each character has both serious flaws and valuable social qualities; save for Olive, who is very young and has not yet been corrupted by her peers. The viewer should feel somewhat mixed feelings for many of the characters as he/she reexamines the preconceived judgments from the beginning. The final parts of the movie brilliantly display Olive's innocence and how her family attempts to preserve it. Because Olive's situation is known to the viewer, the viewer can empathize with the family at the end of the movie and realize the arrogance of the judges, as well as the lost innocence of the other ""Little Miss Sunshine"" participants."
"GoddessofDorkness","10","2","4","28 January 2007"," Better than my first impression.
","When I first saw the previews to this film, I thought it was going to be a pain by the way the family was bickering in the beginning. However when I saw this film, it exceeded my expectations by far.<br/><br/>Here come the spoilers, watch out.<br/><br/>Dwayne's philosophical point that life is a beauty pageant surfaces toward the end. This changes the tone of the film, considering after seeing everything the family went through and seeing their quirks that make them different from society.<br/><br/>The rest of the family was depressed and angry, while Olive was still pure to the world around her. Dwayne, like any good brother, tries to stop Olive from competing, thinking the pageant will ruin her healthy psyche. However Olive proceeds and beats the system of the beauty pageant. All the other girls looked like little Stepford wives. Instead of sheepishly trying to be the same as them, she remained pure to her natural self.<br/><br/>A professor once told me a good quote - ""There is a thin swimsuit between a porn star and a beauty queen."" In a way, these pageants make the little girls sleazy in the sense that they are trying to mature too quickly sexually. Olive brings out this point in her dance, whether she realized it or not. It's as if the grandfather's spirit was saying, ""Is this what you want? This is what a beauty contest truly is. There!"" In her strip dance, she was more bodily covered than the other girls.<br/><br/>The end was so important, because it brought the family together. Olive won without winning. The song Super Freak, although it is a sex related song, holds a different meaning in this scene. It was a way of saying she is a freak and she is proud of it. The family jumps onto stage, one by one. Frank, the one who was clinically depressed in the beginning, is now jumping around happily. Dwayne realizes realizes there is a way to beat the contests of life and joins. Everyone is dancing in a circle, proud of who they are, and proud of their daughter. They are a family of superfreaks, and they accepted themselves and each other."
"mswatsoninc","7","2","4","27 January 2007"," Little Miss Sunshine, Best Picture?
","I was very surprised that ""Little Miss Sunshine"" was able to garner as many nominations as it did for the Acadamey Awards. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film very much, but, I'm shocked--that's all.<br/><br/>It's the story of Olive (Abigail Breslin), the ten-year-old pageant obsessed 2nd runner up to a Little Miss Sunshine title, who gets her big shot to compete in the National Pageant when the original winner has some sort of ""diet pill complications."" So she jumps in the yellow VW van with dysfunctional family in tow for a trek from Albequerque, New Mexico to Redando Beach, CA to take a shot at the crown. The trip proves to be as dysfunctional as the family, which includes her mother--trying to keep everyone together (Toni Collete), her positive thinking unemployed self help guru father (Greg Kinnear), her gay suicidal Uncle Frank (Steve Carell), her Nitzche studying vow of silence taking brother, who has dreams of being a military pilot (Paul Dano), and her brash, heroine snorting, old coot of a grandfather (Alan Arkin).<br/><br/>Along the way, the family is forced to endure car trouble, former exes, mental meltdowns, job opportunities that go nowhere, and death. All the while, Olive's dream becomes their own and keeps them going to a finish that, while no one could probably predict it, isn't too far fetched to the average moviegoer.<br/><br/>I have to say, it was a ""cute"" little movie. I by no means wouldn't recommend it, but, Oscar worthy? I don't know. It makes me wonder if it was strategically placed to give competition to pre-Oscar hopefuls. Breslin, who, as far as child actors go, is very charming, may give Jennifer Hudson's Effie White (""Dreamgirls"") a vote split--pushing through a dramatic performance upset in the Best Supporting Actress category (Hudson's award fell under Musical/Comedy at the Golden Globes). The same could be said for Arkin in the Best Supporting Actor category against Eddie Murphy (""Dreamgirls""), although, I think Arkin does a superior job, having seen both films. I also find it very telling that ""LMS"" got the Best Picture nomination over ""Dreamgirls."" Though many might question ""Dreamgirls"" ever getting nominated for the award in the first place, it certainly had the hype on its side. Maybe its a sign of the hype running out of steam, giving Breslin and Arkin a slight advantage to set ""Dreamgirls"" as a whole up for a snub.<br/><br/>Who knows? But, its a cute little indie film that might end up being the little engine that could."

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is easily the most light-hearted dark comedy ever made and one of the best movies of 2006. Not only is it painfully funny, but it has an unexpected moral about the real difference between winners and losers. <br/><br/>The Hoover brood certainly appears to be the biggest bunch of losers you ever saw. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a pathetic, wannabe motivational speaker who has squandered the family's money on his idiotic program (""9 Steps to Success!""). Mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) tries to be the levelheaded voice of reason, but gets easily frazzled by all the chaos surrounding her. Son Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a teen aged misanthrope who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into a flight academy. Uncle Frank (Steve Carell) is a gay Proust scholar who has recently survived a suicide attempt. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is a heroin addict with a heart of gold. Then there's little Olive (Abigail Breslin¬Ö yay! A Hollywood child star who's NOT Dakota Fanning!), a sweet, bubbly ball of energy who has recently been chosen for the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant, thanks to dance training by good ol' Grandpa. This a triumph for Olive that spells financial hope for the Hoovers, so they load up their dilapidated, mustard yellow VW bus and head for Los Angeles. <br/><br/>Along the way they encounter all sorts of mishaps: the bus breaks down and has to pushed in order to start, the family quarrels, each family member is forced to face a cruel revelation about themselves, and tragedy even strikes. Yet Olive remains a positive presence, and being the glue that holds her family together falls on her little shoulders. <br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" addresses a widely ignored fact: that there are two types of optimism. Richard represents the desperate, blind, phony optimism that infests the self-help section in any bookstore, where winning is the only representation of success, not the fact that you were bold enough to try in the first place. Richard also has a habit of speaking in a series of buzzwords and platitudes, such as ""sarcasm is losers trying to bring winners down to their level"". Here is a man who refuses to admit that he has any faults or insecurities, so he lashes out at people who are up front with their human frailties. In one of the most painful scenes in the movie, Olive innocently orders ""waffles a la mode"" at a diner, and Richard, thinking he's being helpful but in fact is being a jerk, lectures Olive on how ""ice cream turns to fat"", much to poor Olive and Sheryl's chagrin. <br/><br/>Olive, on the other hand, is real optimism personified. She believes in herself, keeps those bespectacled eyes on the prize, and dares to have faith when others seem doubtful. The Hoovers do indeed make it to the pageant, but I will NOT, under any circumstance, spoil the movie by revealing whether Olive wins or not. What I will say is this: win or lose, Olive is truly the most beautiful of her pint-size competitors. <br/><br/>The entire cast is just about perfect. Breslin is simply adorable, and she's the least annoying child actor to come along in ages. Collette is glorious as the world-weary but fiercely devoted Sheryl, who through even the most trying times stands by her family with a mother bear's ferocity. She also looks like a real, lower middle-class mom with her K-Mart wardrobe, love handles and boring hair. Carell was unfairly overlooked at Oscar time¬Ö he nearly steals the movie as Frank, who slowly develops an ""I'm a loser, but I'm okay"" attitude. Frank is a passive, yet sardonic observer to all that's going on, and he becomes a surprising confidante to antisocial Dwayne. Carell also demonstrates his knack for physical comedy, creating Frank's ridiculous run that indicates someone who never got picked first for teams in gym class growing up. Arkin, Kinnear, and Dano are also good, making each of their characters sympathetic and all too real. <br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" is really a beauty of a comedy. Don't miss it!"

","It's very hard to try and make a comedy that also has some morals to it without it being to cornball. Little Miss Sunshine proves that it can be done.<br/><br/>An excellent ensemble cast of Toni Collette, Steve Carell, Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, and Little Miss Abigail Breslin. A colorful cast of characters makes up a family that decides to travel cross-country in a crappy VW bus to enter little Olive(Breslin) into a beauty pageant. Every character has their own demons. The Uncle (Carell) is just out of hospital after attempting suicide. The father (Kinnear) is a motivational speaker who is obsessed with ""winning"" at life. The mother (Collette) is caught in the middle, trying to keep everything together. The grandfather (Arkin) is a druggie, foul-mouthed talent coach for Olive. There's also the speechless son (Paul Dano) who has decided not to speak at all until he gets into the air force. Then there's little Olive, determined to get to her beauty pageant but caught in the middle of deciding whether she wants to be a model and follow her father's obsessive winning attitude or just be a normal kid. <br/><br/>What Little Miss Sunshine does so well is that it is able to give us humor in the predicament all these characters are in, because of the extreme opposites some of them are but yet its able to spread a positive message on the importance of family and being a good person. Sometimes its good to take a step back and not take ourselves so seriously. And yet, the film doesn't go out of its way to give you a good morale at the expense of taking away from the hilarious story line. <br/><br/>Definitely one of the most enjoyable films I have seen this past movie year."

","I love this movie! This rag tag family, beyond dysfunctional, is about an annoying group of people as one can ever hope to meet, let alone have to spend an hour and a half with them in a darkened movie theatre. But little by little they grow on you. Little by little you start to laugh at them, accept them, and then ultimately take them to your heart. Why? Beyond their quirkiness, beyond their ridiculous personalities, beyond the comic book situations they find themselves in is a tale of love and decency. And family! People who need people! (Sorry for the clich√© - somehow it doesn't feel out of place in describing this movie!) During the roller coaster journey in that gradually deteriorating yellow bus, they fight, they bicker, they get on each other's nerves, but ultimately they embrace each other, with a knowing understanding that is deep and enduring. That yellow bus keeps trucking along, and that family with their deep, deep underlying bonds of love and genuine affection outwits all those people and life events gnawing at their lives, trying to crush them every step of the way. Gnaw away! It doesn't matter. They'll endure with those heads held high in defiance and pride. Between the almost vaudevillian moments that abound are scenes of such tenderness and real emotions, scenes which are really profound: the grandfather's hotel room bedtime chat with his beloved granddaughter, the way in which the uncle and brother get the young girl to eat her chocolate ice cream in the diner, the wordless hug the girl gives her devastated brother on the side of the road. Priceless moments, all! Annnnnnnd.....talk about funny! The final scene beats out Borat for the funniest scene of the year.

But anyway, when the mom tries to console her, I think she misses the point completely; she basically tells Olive that she could be fat or skinny, whichever she chooses, as long as she's happy. She doesn't even mention anything about ice cream. But I think it would have been more appropriate to make it clear that having ice cream sometimes does not result in obesity or even necessarily fat.

"brodie_kashmir","9","2","4","31 December 2006"," Equal Parts Heartwarming and Heartbreaking
","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is billed primarily as a comedic film, which does a disservice to the more dramatic aspects of Michael Arndt's brilliant script. And it takes the combined acting talents of Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, Steve Carell and young actors Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin to make this film one of the funniest and most heart breaking films of the year.<br/><br/>After the standing beauty queen has to step down and not compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, seven year old runner-up Olive Hoover (Breslin) is asked to take her place. She has to get from Albuquerque, NM to Redondo, Calif. in order to compete. Her struggling self-proclaimed self-help guru father (Kinnear) drives their broken down VW bus with his wife (Collette), heroin snorting father (Arkin), suicidal, gay brother-in-law (Carell) and voluntarily silent step-son (Dano) in tow to get Olive to the pageant.<br/><br/>It really says something when the most powerful and engaging performance in a film littered with such highly respected actors came from the 23 year old unknown Dano. And he had no lines till the last half hour. Dano's Dwayne Hoover embarked on a vow of silence till he was accepted into the Air Force flight training program, and at the time of the movie, he's been going for nine months. He's able to emote so much with just his facial and body expressions, and his little notebook. And then he just breaks your heart. It's so incredibly moving. I almost cried.<br/><br/>But beyond the praise due to Dano, the whole cast worked together to construct a family that is forced to grow together during the 800 mile trip. And they all do. Kinnear shows us his tremendous range as an actor in one of his finest performances of his career, and the tremendously underrated Collette gets to showcase the talent that few of us have known for the past few years. But Carell, above them all, is worthy of praise. His career is following the same path of Jim Carrey, and I can only hope he's more lucky with the Oscar voters than Carrey has been.<br/><br/>Arndt was able to resurrect a dying sub-genre of comedy, throw in some drama and score a hit with his first script. He constructed his script in a way that it was equal parts emotionally moving, uproariously funny and adorably heartwarming. It can do all of that in a span of 20 minutes. And luckily, he was able to pull that off, where as several before him failed.<br/><br/>It's one of those films that is like a jigsaw puzzle. It only works because every aspect fits together. The writing works because of the fusion of drama and comedy, the acting works because the characters were the right ones for the actors to portray, and vice versa, the directing works because they had so much to work with. To have this film done any other way, but any other person or group of people just wouldn't have worked. The coming together of all the pieces is what made this great.<br/><br/>From the actors to the writer, the film is littered with impressive rookie performances. But none more impressive than the feature film debut of Grammy winning husband-wife directing team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. They cut their teeth on music videos back in the early 90's when it actually meant something, and have patterned their transformation into the cinematic world after such new wave auteurs as Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry. If they don't fall into the Academy's good graces with ""Little Miss Sunshine"", they will eventually, I'm sure of it.<br/><br/>I must fault production designer Kalina Ivanov for perpetuating the annoying trend of making the time setting ambiguous by mixing modern technology and culture with archaic and anachronistic set dressings and costumes. It was funny in ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (barely) and two years later it's just sad."
"cnewf","10","2","4","30 December 2006"," Great, subtle story of liberation from the middle-class
","I finally saw Little Miss Sunshine last night and liked is as much as everyone else did. I had a special fondness for what happens to the family, where things start bad and get much better. The father, Richard, is trying to make it as a self-improvement guru by selling his 9 -steps to winning formula. His only idea is that the world has two kinds of people, winners and losers, and the most important thing in life is that you not be a loser. Losing is signified by the other people in the picture: the nation's foremost Proust scholar (with the beard) who has just tried to kill himself over a grad-student love gone wrong, the son who reads Nietzsche, refuses to speak, and wants to fly fighter jets, and above all the grandfather in the background, who snorts heroin, loves porn and sex equally, and swears like the blue-collar stalwart that he is. The mom holds it all together of course, and the 7-year-old daughter, who dreams of being crowned Little Miss Sunshine (not pictured), has unwittingly inherited her dad's desire to leave struggling working-classdom and enter the middle-class of sexpot-princess little Barbie girls.<br/><br/>I will try not to spoil the plot while still saying why this movie came as a huge relief to me. Richard is a schmuck whose desire to be a rich guru make his family angry and miserable and make him powerless himself. But as it turns out he doesn't have to be that way. OK, I'm about to spoil the plot a little bit: Richard turns out to be more like his badass dad than he wants to believe, and so does the Proust scholar, and so does the weirdly mixed Air Force- intellectual son, and this is certainly true of Olive, the true Little Miss Sunshine. There's a lot of comedy extracted from the car troubles of people who can't afford new ones, and the film winds up as a study of class conflict in which, for once in Hollywood, going back to your unselfconscious and impulsive working-class self makes you ""win.""<br/><br/>I don't mean they win as the solid middle-class defines it, but as soon as Richard - without consciously deciding to - stops trying to rise and just throws himself into the mission of getting Olive to her contest, everything gets better. The movie rejects the classically stupid middle-class assumption that solidarity means reduced efficiency and self-fulfillment. The movie rejects the bourgeois failure to fight: things bump along once Richard and the rest of them just go with the screwed-up van, their lateness, their loser-ness, once they start bending and breaking the middle-class rules. Heroics aren't necessary, just a certain non- intimate acceptance of each other, that things will never be normal, that as people they aren't normal, that they don't have to be normal, and than in non-normalcy there is strength.<br/><br/>This makes Little Miss Sunshine a great parable of the middle-class ceasing to hate itself, embracing its blue-collarness (you'll know what I mean when you see Olive's actual contest dance), and being way way better off. Liberation from middle-class aspiration looks like people pushing a busted van. They have lost first-gear but have finally - to their enormous benefit - they have learned not to miss it.<br/><br/>Plus it's pretty hilarious, with great performances from absolutely everybody. And for why Little Miss Sunshine is so much more illuminating, see my explanation at Middle Class Death-Trips (toodumbtolive.blogspot.com)"

","I am putting this very lightly. I LOVED LOVED LOVED this film. The performances were great (especially from Abigail Breslin), the screenplay was excellent (I think it deserves to win the Oscar) and the directing was superb (Music Video veterans Dayton/Faris' first movie).<br/><br/>What surprised me the most is how sincere the characters are. They're not one-note, and although you might kinda have a feeling what they'll do next, they still manage to surprise and delight you. And there are some truly touching moments in this film that don't come across as schmaltzy (as most movies tend to be) and also has one of the most satisfying endings in recent movie history (and I see a LOT of movies) In summary, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a wonderful surprise. A black comedy/road movie/""family"" film that tugs at your heartstrings without jamming any message down your throat and , most importantly, tickles your funny bone to the point of losing consciousness. The best comedy of 2006.<br/><br/>Grade:A"

","When i first heard about this movie i was a little skeptical, It all seemed too unreasonable. From what i heard, every single terrible thing that could happen to this family happened and that seemed to much like a ""are we there yet""/""Johnson family vacation"" type movie. I also thought that the son who chose not to speak because of niche was a bit clich√©. I couldn't have been more wrong. This move turned out to be one of the first movies i have watched in a long time and been fully entertained the whole time through. The cinematography in the movie is beautiful and the costumes that Olive wear are my favorite components of this film. Even though i thought, before seeing it, that Dwayne was going to be a terrible character, I came to realize that Paul Dano pulled this part off better than i could have ever imagined and became one of my favorite characters in the movie. Also, I have always been a huge fan of Steve Carell, so him being in it made ""little miss sunshine"" so much better than i could ever imagined."

","This movie was not what I expected before I watched it. However, this was not a bad thing. This movie was not only what I didn't expect but it actually delivered in a stronger and more satisfying way then I had expected. I absolutely loved this movie and it seemed to immerse me in an emotional roller-coaster. One moment I was laughing and the next I was sad and near crying. Steve Carrell played a role that I did not expect to see from him and he delivered 100%! This movie seems very simple, but in its simplistic appearance is much beauty, just like with the little girl Olive. The setup of some scenes are very nice and very pleasingto the eye. This movie delivers on every level. Everyone needs to watch this movie."
"dnlcmch","8","2","4","22 December 2006"," Darkly quirky sunshine
","It's become a sort of tradition now. Every year, there comes a small independent movie that's so well received by audiences, it becomes as popular as any mainstream Hollywood film, a ""little movie that could"", if you will. Previous examples of this sort of film include 2004's ""Garden State"", and 2005's ""Hustle and Flow"" and ""The March of the Penguins"". This year, there's no doubt in mind that ""Little Miss Sunshine"" perfectly establishes that mantle.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons behind Little Miss Sunshine's success is its ability to be quirky, dark, and ultimately relatable all at the same time. The screenplay follows a sort of formula of meticulously blending dark, dysfunctional family issues with subsequent emotional and comedic payoffs. It's a rather ""Royal Tenenbaums-esquire"" tactic, and nevertheless, a hard one to pull off. Yet, the screenplay proves to carry out this style with great ease. An ease that pushes the film thorough its first two acts, and then lets it flout on its own two legs for its finale.<br/><br/>The film focuses on an average American family, and a dysfunctional one at most. From its opening scenes, we are introduced to each of the character's main goals and inner demons. First, there's Olive, a youthfully innocent little girl who dreams of winning a beauty pageant, even though, at first glance, you'd think she'd more likely be the bispectacled winner of a spelling bee, instead. Then there's Olive's brother, Dwayne, a teenager who longs to escape from his family's dysfunction with hopes of getting accepted to an Air Force Academy and prepares by constantly exercising and taking a vow of silence. The father of the two, Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a devoted winner and business overachiever who can either be the peacemaker of his family or the over-commanding chief. The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collette) is, of course, the warm heart that everyone leans upon. This position places Sheryl in a rather stressful state, as she's always trying to communicate in order to help her and her family make their way out of the work-case scenarios. Then there's Frank (Steve Carell), brother of Sheryl and uncle of Dwayne and Olive. A highly intelligent scholar, Frank is recovering from his suicidal case of depression, after learning that the man he loves is, in fact, in love with another man. And last, but not least, there's Grandpa, an aged hippie who follows a rather adventurous and eccentric philosophy for his lifestyle, fueled with sexual innuendo and heroin. For Grandpa, every moment of life should be worth living.<br/><br/>Everyone argues because of his or her various differences and inner-demons. Grandpa offers bad advice to his grandchildren, Richard stresses his family over the egotistic concept of winning and losing, and Sheryl just wants her family to be free of its mess. So, once Olive is accepted to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, the road trip that the Hoovers embark upon shall lead to their discovery of the true meaning of ""family"" and how they should learn to accept who they are, for better or for worse. This may sound like a sappy little movie with a crystal clear message; yet, it's far from it. Although it can indeed be heartwarming, the film doesn't touch those elements until it emerges out of the dark shadow of its character's issues. Everyone has personal obstacles to face and it's only a matter of time before they learn to overcome them. This is the secret behind Little Miss Sunshine's success, it's its ability to communicate exuberantly with its intended audience. And, it does so by presenting us with characters that are so real and somewhat disturbing in nature, we can't help but realize their quirkiness because of the fact that we've seen them before in our every day lives. In other words, it's the nature of the story and the characters that leads to the quirkiness.<br/><br/>The script is a work of beauty, as it presents each character with subtle ease. No one is too dysfunctional or too dark, but, contains just the right amount of realism to connect with the viewer. The situations and predicaments that we witness all help bring out the best of these daunted human beings. For instance, when her brother is in his worst state, Olive is always there to put her head on his shoulder, ready to cheer him up. It's scenes and situations like these that form the quintessential of the human heart, the true key behind the film's success.<br/><br/>The performances given by the ensemble cast are equally real and unique. Although everyone delivers a raw amount of realism, Paul Dano is the true standout. When he plays his quiet character, he allows the audience to feel his emotions through his daunted facial expressions and various nuances, which is then multiplied by ten when he actually does talk.<br/><br/>I also cannot conclude this review without giving praise to the directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who capture every single aspect of the film's beauty. Considering that Little Miss Sunshine is indeed a road movie, it succeeds in presenting us with the gorgeous landscapes of the California cross-country, indulging in the vast sunshine. Yet, visuals aside, Dayton and Faris also accomplish in capturing the realism of the film by utilizing in a sort of ""documentary"" feel, using hand-held camera techniques that benefit to the overall believability of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, Little Miss Sunshine is one of the year's best, and it wholeheartedly deserves its wide range of acclaim. In a year that's been full of lukewarm efforts, Little Miss Sunshine carries the biggest, and most refreshing of hearts."

","What little girl hasn't dreamed of becoming a beauty queen one day? This story of young pageant dreamer Olive and her seemingly functionally dysfunctional family is both heartwarming and hilarious. From an old-school VW bug that only shifts into 3rd and 4th gear, a angst teenager's vow of silence, a suicidal homosexual uncle, a cocaine addicted grandfather, a workaholic father and a mother just trying to keep it all together, there is so much character depth and variation. The actors play their parts BEAUTIFULLY and the directing is just amazing to say the least. This is definitely a film well worth seeing again and again.. and maybe a few times more.

How better to expose the horror of judging little girls on superficial and 'way too adult values' than to have a pervert in the audience and a striptease performance! <br/><br/>And for all that, this 'moral' and the ""loser"" commentary weren't drilled into the audience, nor were they holier than thou in perspective.<br/><br/>It was a funny slice of life with a wonderful point of view.<br/><br/>:) Alma"
"Rick_Bman","9","2","4","2 December 2006"," An all around wonderful film.
","This is one of those films that I loved so much I really just don't know what to say about it. The cast was absolutely perfect. Steve Carell was great in a role that seems a bit more subdued than what he as normally done. It was a bit more dramatic and less comedic than his other roles. Don't get me wrong, he was still funny as hell but he played the dramatic part of the role perfectly. Greg Kinear, Alan Arkin and Toni Collette all also played there roles wonderfully.<br/><br/>However, special mention has to go to little Abigail Breslin as Olive. She delivers a wonderful performance, and possibly one of the best performances from a child actor I have seen in awhile. She manages to be this sweet innocent child without being so sweet that it makes us sick, like the performances we see so often in Hollywood movies. She was one of the many wonderful things about the film.<br/><br/>The film is also very emotional all around, it will make you laugh and cry; sometimes both at the same time. And it never feels like the emotional impact is being shoved down your throat like many Hollywood movies do these days. The emotional connection you feel with this movies seem to flow very naturally. I honestly cared about the characters in this film, which is something that I don't see very often these days.<br/><br/>I do have to say that Olive's dance routine was simply great commentary on the whole idea of beauty pageants for children. If you have never seen one of these things, they are just as creepy in real life as the movie makes them out to be, little girls getting spray on tans and running around in bikinis. Olive's dance routine where she almost strips was just so hilarious because here she is doing what is obviously a stripper routine and she was still being less provocative than the other little girls (I feel so creepy just using a word like ""Provocative"" when talking about young girls like that).<br/><br/>I also loved the irony of the father that is supposed to be this wonderful motivational speaker but he is really a complete failure at everything. He just can't seem to realize that if his little motivational plan actually worked, he would be able to find something else to do with his life other than selling his motivational plan."

","I was blown away by this picture. I went to the theater hoping to see one of the blockbusters but I had to see this one, I got so much more that what I was bargaining for. This is a family that rides together, most families don't, actually so few do, but this is a beautiful example of family integration. They go to all kinds of problems, deep problem, not only as a family but as individuals, they all went to hell and back in that trip and they still pulled together. These are the best parts on my opinion. They all travel over 1000 miles just to see the little girl's contest. When the father says ""No, we are going to California"" and they steal the body, that's a unit doing it, not a man. When Franks says ""I learned so much more in the bad years"", that's what the movie is all about. And of course when they all go on stage, the uptight father, the more uptight and depresive uncle and brother who was so against it and they all dance together with the girl, that's a family.<br/><br/>Everyone involved in this project should be proud, this is how you make a movie about fratello love."
"moviefreakgirl","Null","2","4","4 November 2006"," Simply Amazing
","This is a very original, enjoyable movie. It's typical indie cinema, with its flawed, realistic characters, the dark humor, the way it includes a lot of drama, it's a critic to our society and is unpredictable. The screenplay is simply amazing.The characters are all so well written, you easily rot for them and can identify with at least one. The dialogs are brilliant; you can perfectly see real people saying that, but at the same way it's so satirical and funny. The storyline has been seen many times, but the twists and the characters make it different from anything you've seen before. The introduction of the characters is so fascinating and beautiful that you immediately like them, despise all their flaws. The pace makes you be so hugely entertaining that it will seem that the movie took 5 minutes. The ending is just amazing, one of the best I've ever seen; so funny and dark.<br/><br/>The direction is great, too. The wide shots on the highway are beautiful and full of life and energy. The close shots are really cute and some perfectly brilliant (Olive's introduction), and others very touching (Olive comforting Dwayne) and others satirical. The cinematography is full of light, but dirty too, which makes it look real. The music is perfect, as is its use.<br/><br/>Now, we get to the acting. Abigail Breslin is the best. She has a screen presence, comic and dramatic timing, delivery of lines and an ability to touch you that are really unusual in a child actress. Besides, she looks like a real person, and that makes her character believable. Steve Carrel is very enjoyable, and even if his character is not really nice he makes you like him. His comic timing is brilliant, and you can feel his emotions in a really touching way. The third best was Alan Arkin. so funny, with such an original character stretched to the limits. You can only like him. Greg Kinnear is really funny, Toni Collette is realistic and equilibrates the movie, and Paul Dano has a perfect way of expressing emotions without barely speaking. This one is recommended."

"filipemanuelneto","9","0","0","3 June 2020"," Fun, absolutely entertaining, has a lot of delightfully strange characters.
","It is rare to find a comedy as well done and interesting as this one. Generally, horror and comedy are the poor relatives of cinema, as they are usually low-cost productions of questionable quality. In this case, the film breathes quality. The script is extremely simple and based on an interstate trip that a very crazy family has to make so that Olive, the youngest of the clan, can participate in a child beauty contest that she loves.<br/><br/>Comedy mostly depends on the unusual situations that the characters go through on their journey, which looks like an odyssey. And everything happens here, from problems with the van to a death. The movie may not even make us laugh out loud and it certainly won't, most of the time... but it will make us laugh. As important as the good construction of the comic scenes is the way the characters were thought and developed. And here the script was great: the family man is a motivational therapist who is terrible at what he does; the mother is honest, sincere, dedicated, but she is completely lost and desperate. Then there is the gay uncle who is a Proust fanatic and attempted suicide after being abandoned by his boyfriend, the older brother who is a enraged teen who hates everything and everyone, the brazen and perverse grandfather that no nursing home accepts and finally the sweet and gentle Olive. Oh, and we still have the yellow and white VW Type 2 van, which causes so many problems throughout the trip that it almost ends up becoming an addition to the cast.<br/><br/>The actors were excellent and everyone put in a lot of effort. From the cast, where I immediately notice notable names, I would particularly highlight the excellent work of Steve Carell, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Toni Collette and Alan Arkin. Abigail Breslin, for me, is on another level. The film is truly hers. She is the protagonist, and she has done such a good job for a child actress that it is difficult to imagine that she will not have an excellent career in cinema if she continues to strive. Something that deserves some attention in this film are the dialogues and the lines. Despite the regular use of heavy words, the dialogues have real pearls, worthy of quote.<br/><br/>The film won two Oscars (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor, for Alan Arkin), but was still nominated in the categories of Best Film and Best Supporting Actress (for Abigail Breslin, although she is the main actress in this film, I think ). It is a film that, in addition to everything I have mentioned, has very regular sets and costumes and also a decent cinematography, despite not being, notoriously, a film that draws attention by the production values."

","Little Miss Sunshine manages to balance comedy, drama and satire in an incredible way, all that balance gives rise to a high-level dark comedy, which manages to talk about many themes that define american culture, it is a film with uncomfortable comic situations, is a sharp and dangerous comedy, but incredibly smart.<br/><br/>This movie plays with the premise of the dysfunctional family, a premise that has been exploited to the point of exhaustion in Hollywood, but let's remember that what matters is the way you tell the story, Little Miss Sunshine is original and raw, unlike other movies about dysfunctional families this movie gives a different portrait of what we already know as the basic american family, each of its members is at the same level of depth and personal conflict, they face suicide, obsession, failure, to despair, frustration and death, throughout the film each of them deals with their own fights but by the end of the story, they are fighting as a family, it doesn't matter if you don't have a good relationship with your family this movie is probably not going to fix it but it is a lovely portrait of family ties.<br/><br/>Like any good satire, you can notice the social comment that the film makes on different topics, whether it is from the hypocrisy of society and the bad education that is given to children in a quite stressful scene in which little Olive is shown Under the pressure of deciding between her beauty or enjoying his ice cream, this enters a different context when we analyze that Olive is a 6-year-old girl in full development of learning.<br/><br/>This movie feels like a real journey, a journey through American culture and finds a way to satirize it all, beneath the laughter hides a charming depth."

","Little Miss Sunshine is an absolutely wonderful film, and far better than it has any right to be. The performances from everyone are incredible, but the real standouts are Steve Carell and Abigail Breslin. Carell shines in everything he's a part of, but Breslin surprised me with how talented she was for a very young actress.<br/><br/>I was also amazed by Paul Dano in the film. He is a phenomenal actor nowadays, but Little Miss Sunshine proves that he was talented years before he became a household name and I always look forward to seeing what projects he will tackle next.<br/><br/>The script for Little Miss Sunshine is expertly written, as it fleshes out all of the characters to a surprising level, making us care for each and every one of them. It's also very comedic when it needs to be, and I couldn't get enough of watching what was happening on-screen. There is an event which happens part way through the film that I don't think is handled very well, as the characters didn't seem to be affected as much as they should be and this meant that it didn't hit me as hard as it probably should have done. That one section aside, I loved everything else about the screenplay.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the locations that we visited during the film, and I was constantly immersed in the story. It does get slightly too silly for my liking at the end, but I still got a kick out of it and was entertained.<br/><br/>Overall, Little Miss Sunshine is a wonderful film, packed with charm, wit, fleshed-out characters, and a story which I loved being immersed in.<br/><br/>SCORE: 90%"

","Abigail Breslin was Fantastic in this Film. So was the Entire Cast. To too often you get a Film with a outstanding full cast. Her Father was Awesome, her Brother, her Mom, her Uncle, my favorite was THE GRANDFATHER LOL. That MAN loved his Grandchild with all of his HEART. My Favorite parts in this Film was the little glasses, and the fashion she had why????
Because she was JUST being herself. To many KIDS Today try to be someone that they are NOT.
That's what made her a SUNSHINE. I remember when this Film came out. Me and my daughter went out to Dinner that night. And made it a Daddy and Daughter date night. Then after that we went out for Icecream at the GOOD PLACE. We both Loved that Film together. It's Awesome I am now 47 and my daughter is 24. And we still once or twice a year. Have a Daddy and Daughter date together. Just so we can keep in touch. Just me and her. Daddy's little ""BABY CAKE'S"" I still call my daughter.
Message to ALL MEN OUT THERE.
ALWAYS HAVE A SPECIAL DAY WITH YOUR DAUGHTER. YOU WILL BE √∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø PERCENT SURPRISED. ON HOW HONEST SHE WILL BE WITH YOU.
Start that at the age of 1 years old. Just a special Daddy and Daughter days. Going out for Lunch, to the Park, to a Movie, to a Concert, or just for a Walk, a Car ride, never judge her on what you talk about why?
Because we were YOUNG BEFORE.
Me and my daughter are Awesome Together. The Trust in our relationship is Totally Awesome.

"jaredpahl","10","0","0","10 November 2019"," A Ray of Sunshine in a Dreary Genre.
","Every kind of movie genre has potential for greatness. I have to remind myself of this from time to time. The is a certain hopelessness you feel when you watch dozens of trashy horror movies or pretentious art house films without finding a great one. But it's films like Little Miss Sunshine that convince you to keep searching. This movie plays like a lot of would be ""feel good"" indie pictures. A happy little goofball of a film complete with an offbeat sense of humor and an eclectic group of quirky characters. Those are dangerous waters. Way too often does ""quirky"" give way to cloying. Except these characters are quirky like real people are, not like overwritten movie characters. And this movie is real and affecting, not tongue in cheek or sarcastic. Little Miss Sunshine is a winner.<br/><br/>The film could be classified as a road movie (another dangerously corny genre), following the extended Hoover family on a road trip to a child's beauty pageant in California, where Abigail Breslin's Olive dreams of competing to be Little Miss Sunshine. The group escorting Breslin there are mom Sheryl (Toni Collette), dad Richard (Gregg Kinnear), sweet gay uncle Frank (Steve Carrell), aspiring Air Force pilot brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), and wise-cracking grandpa Edwin (Alan Arkin). What follows is a delightful series of gags, many of them featuring a beaten up yellow VW van, that slowly build to something emotionally impactful.<br/><br/>The acting from all six of the main players is brilliant. A case could be made for any of them to be nominated for Oscars. Alan Arkin won an Oscar for his prickly grandpa Edwin and Abigail Breslin received deserved acclaim for her winning turn, but the best performance of the film comes from Gregg Kinnear. His character has the widest emotional range, and Kinnear has a deft touch at every step. It's a classically restrained acting job. I have to also mention Toni Collette, who delivers a particularly stirring monologue at a crucial point in the film.<br/><br/>The gags and one-liners could all end up so precious, so self-consciously offbeat. That is death for indie movies. I can't stand it when it's done wrong. So what a surprise it was for me to find myself caught up in this particular group's story. It's because supporting all those fine performances is direction that is restrained and natural. Never once do directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris push for laughs. There is a humble quality to the humor. A ""we hope you'll enjoy it, but that's up to you"" attitude. And underneath the comedy is sincerity. Faris and Dayton treat these characters as people. People who are susceptible to grief, anger, and sadness, just like the rest of us. They aren't sock puppets speaking the writer's stand up material.<br/><br/>I don't like road pictures or indie movies or quirky comedies. I sometimes find it hard to believe there could be a truly great example of any of the three. But Little Miss Sunshine is special; a great example of all those genres. It's a wonderful movie about family and the special connection they have to all of us. It's hilarious and touching and quirky, yes, in the right way. Little Miss Sunshine may look like other cutesy darlings, but give it a chance and you'll find it a genuine delight.<br/><br/>94/100"

It's a great look at a dysfunctional family and how through all their setbacks and traumas learn to come together in the end. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll cheer. It's heartwarming and engaging.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning you can just feel the tension within the family and all their struggles, heartbreak. They are family divided and broken.

","30 August 2006. This dynamite of an R-Rated family movie with plenty of swearing (like real life) has a powerful bang of both drama and comedy in such a short space of time, it's a fun balance between laughter and crying. Surprisingly, the stereotypical characters are well-suited to each other and never really overused. The storyline is solid, the acting entertaining and meaningful. The characters are symbolic of many of us. The only weaknesses would be the height of riotness of the action sometimes takes one aback, the lack of consequences at times, and the perhaps unrealistic final sequence (even though it had a nice consistent and involving twist). Silence is golden is well portrayed in one scene. Death is handled well in another. This is a delicious little bit of sunshine even in the worst of times. Nine out of Ten Stars."

","Fox Searchlight's 2006 surprise indie hit 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a film that accomplished one thing more than anything else - it got audiences to feel better about their own families. Set in the American southwest, we follow the Hoover family as they race to Redondo Beach in their VW van to have 7-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) take part in the stereotypically scary ""Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant. Cue the crazy.<br/><br/>Between the heroin-addicted patriarch (Alan Arkin), the suicidal uncle/brother (a 'The Office'-era Steve Carrell), a purposely mute nihilistic teen (Paul Dano) and a hopeless, wannabe motivational speaker (Greg Kinnear), it's a lot for the arguably only sane person in the family - Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) - to handle. There are so many ridiculous antics that unfold during the 800-mile trek, from their beaten down VW suffering mechanical troubles to an awkward roadside diner breakfast that every family can relate to.<br/><br/>What really makes 'Sunshine' work is the writing. Written by Michael Arndt, the quirkiness comes through in every line in the script, without feeling forced or gimmicky. There's also a lot of emphasis on character development - something that's crucial for a film that relies so heavily on an ensemble cast - and the dysfunction almost seems like an art form. It's no surprise the writing resulted in an Oscar for best original screenplay.<br/><br/>It may not be the best comedy ever, but 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a fun, zany ride through the challenges of family life and a commentary on the fact that beauty really is skin-deep."

Sadly, its really, really not the case.

I'm not saying that it's an awful film, but there's nothing different or poignant about a film that is clearly supposed to stir some emotions. <br/><br/>If you want an uplifting film - watch the intouchables, forrest gump, remember the titans, life is beautiful; you know something different.

","Little Olive Hoover wants to be a beauty queen and it looks like she may get a chance when she is invited to participate in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' pageant in Redondo Beach, California. There are a couple of problems though; she is almost a thousand miles away in Albuquerque and for one reason or another her entire family must come with her. These include her suicidal uncle; her brother, who has taken a vow of silence; her foulmouthed grandfather; her father, an unsuccessful motivational speaker; and her relatively normal mother.<br/><br/>They take the journey in a clapped out VW Camper van and along the way things don't go according to plan. They didn't exactly get on well before they were cooped up in the van and it isn't surprising that tempers fray somewhat as they travel along¬Ö not helped when the clutch fails and they have to push it every time they want to get started. They do eventually get to the competition but nobody will be surprised that things don't go quite as expected.<br/><br/>Initially I wasn't quite sure what to make of this film; many of the main characters are hard to like at first and they are all a bit odd. However as time passes we see that they aren't entirely bad and the various adversities ultimately bring them together to give a feel good ending. Along the way there are plenty of comical moments, as well as a tragedy. When they get to the pageant it delightfully showed us the creepiness of children's beauty pageants before Olive's jaw-dropping performance that was genuinely shocking as well as very funny!

It's this quasi-perfect balance between genuine comedic material, with some actually hilarious parts, and true script-work and story. The funny occurs within the many well constructed events of the plot, and there isn't ever anything that strays away from the point, like some forced humor on the side; all the while making for an absolute blast of a ride, and more literally of a road trip. The acting is particularly good, on all accounts. The casting is superb, spot-on. And the criticism and morality, as in the crux of the film, are never given away, or easy. Everything works for the greater scheme that is the film as a whole; there is a great coherence and smoothness about this, and overall one could say it is as fun as it is ultimately human, and in that it's a beautiful comedy, to be watched by anyone from all ages.

","An amazing film full of emotions, filled with everything it needs to be a touching movie. The cinematography of the it's amazing as well as the direction, that seems so natural. We can see that directors don't need tons of money to make a masterpiece. With this movie we can travel with this family in their way to persuade little Olive's dream, and when they get there it'z an amazing contrast showing that perfection is horrible and that those little things that we are not perfect at make us who we are as humans, something beautiful. Alan Arkin who won the Oscar for best supporting role, makes hes Oscar look deserved with the movie, hes acting it's simply great, an old man who it's already done with life addicted to cocaine but giving all his love to little Olive. Teaching her a routine for her dance which at the end shows us it was truly obscene for her age but amazingly funny. Everyone makes an amazing acting, the film is full of emotions not only sad ones but really funny ones, showing us at the end that happiness it's in the things that occur naturally. 8/10 for me, i hope everyone enjoys this amazing journey of emotions.

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a movie in which we watch a family that try really hard to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant. In this family we have a father who wants to succeed but he can not, a mother who works to feed them all, a crazy grandpa, an uncle, a son who wants to be a pilot and of course a daughter who wants to participate in this contest.<br/><br/>I liked this movie not only because of the plot which I found really great but also for the messages that we can take from this movie. Another fact that I liked in this movie were the interpretations of Alan Arkin who played as Grandpa Edwin Hoover and he was a nice entry which gave a different feeling in this movie. Another interpretation which I think that it had to be mentioned is the interpretation of Steve Carell who played as the uncle Frank and he was really good at it.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a great movie from which we can gain many things and we can think many of those after we watch it. It gives us plenty of things and topics to talk about and combines really good comedy with drama."

","Yes ""All we need is a little hope"" that's exactly what my point is no matter what the circumstances are you just keep trying. I truly love this movie story was quite simple a family goes on a road trip in their VW bus for their young daughter to participate in a beauty concert, the movie focuses on characters who are busy in their lives and are just desperate for something that can change their life. <br/><br/>As the movie is motivational it is also very hilarious every character in the movie is somehow different and all are struggling hard with their issues. The most funny scene is when a police stopped them and they had a dead body in their trunk, hilarious. <br/><br/>The character I liked the most is without any doubt was of Olive Hoover played by Abigail Breslin, and I was really amazed that how she is always into the character and never break it once. <br/><br/>This is a complete family movie and I'd recommend that you should see this with your family."

","My mother had been raving about this movie for the longest time. She kept telling me ""oh you have to watch it, it's so funny!"" Naturally, this made my expectations rise quite a bit. Did the film deliver? Yeah, I think it did. The cast plays their roles perfectly, from Alan Arkin as the cocaine snorting grandfather to Steve Carrell as the gay, suicidal uncle. The script manages to be consistently funny and be very touching. I always welcome that in a comedy. It's themes of family and giving it your all are evident while being subtle, thankfully (I hate it when they beat you over the head with messages). Only problem I had was a nitpick. Their car breaks down and the mechanic tells them they get get the thing running by getting the car to go at least 20 MPH. Okay, fine. How do they achieve this? By pushing it¬Ö wait that's stupid, but nonetheless it works. That's my only complaint and when everything worked as well as it did, I can forgive that."

","Some people forget that a good movie doesn't need to have spectacular visual effects or an extremely original story line. Little Miss Sunshine is a perfect example. The story is about a dysfunctional family that is forced to travel all the way to California in order for Olive, the daughter, to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. While the plot doesn't seem to offer much on the surface, the film itself does a great job in many aspects. <br/><br/>The first is the characters. The family has six members, all of which have extremely distinct and interesting personalities. Despite there being six main characters, each of them are developed fantastically. Through the journey to California in a cramped bus, the audience/viewer(s) develop a compassion for each of the family members and genuinely cares for all of them. <br/><br/>Second is the casting and acting. Each of the actors chosen for their position fits their role extremely well as shown by their performance. Most impressive to me was Abigail Breslin who at such a young age assumes the role of Olive, a little girl with a determined, sensitive, and passionate mindset. Steve Carell's performance was also surprising as it proves that he can be a talented dramatic actor when he wants to be in this film. In general, the acting in this movie is first-class.<br/><br/>Third, what Little Miss Sunshine does greatest is teach an extremely important lesson subtly but effectively: that family, friendship, and love can be all you need to really be happy. This is probably why the film makes you so genuinely happy despite all the crap that constantly seems to happen to them. <br/><br/>The film, while extremely straightforward, keeps you hooked and never diverts your attention. The comedy is extremely clever and the dialogue is extremely well-written. The story is extremely realistic,believable, and satisfying. The only reason I give it an 8 and not a 9 is that I reserve a 9 for the movies that really stand out in style and I almost never give 10's to movies. But that is not to say that this movie isn't great."

","Little Miss Sunshine focuses on a dysfunctional family who undertake a journey to Redondo beach in California so that their 7 year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin)can compete in a beauty pageant.<br/><br/>Predictably, this being a 'road trip' film, essentially many things go wrong along the way; some things that occur on this journey were funny and some things weren't and that was a big problem with this film; it's essentially a 'comedy drama', but due to wildly uneven writing it's not really entirely successful as either a comedy or a drama. Many of the characters are quite thin cardboard cut out types (particularly the mother and father) who were very clich√©d and annoying. Alan Arkin was funny as Grandpa Hoover and he does get some of the best lines, but I must admit that even his character started to wear thin after a while - his character's demise was sad, but smuggling his corpse out of the hospital and carting it around in their people carrier was probably one of the funnier moments in the film. Steve Carrell's character was also a bit of a disappointment; we're told that he's attempted suicide because the man he loved went off with someone else, but aside from the early scenes at the family home he just seemed to be a normal guy - it's almost like his suicidal nature has been forgotten. Even when he meets the man he loved in a service station (he randomly meets him in an area that he doesn't live anywhere near), he still doesn't really show as much emotion as I was expecting. Considering he was hospitalised for his suicidal tendencies I thought that he may have got a bit more upset.<br/><br/>Far and away, the most interesting character in the film was Dwayne (played by the excellent Paul Dano). His character is by far the most interesting and although he's singled out as being a bit odd, he's probably the most sane person in the family. The scene where it's revealed that he's colour blind and therefore can't join the air force really hit home with me and this scene really shows how much joining the air force meant to Dwayne. Not only was this scene well acted by Dano, but it was also a good bit of writing. It's just a shame that as a whole the film was so inconsistent.<br/><br/>LMS as a whole is an uneven and inconsistent film and I found that when it got things right it was really good, but unfortunately I didn't find a lot of the gags to be funny and I also felt that it didn't entirely work as a drama, mainly because some of the characters were either thinly written or unlikeable which meant I couldn't emotionally invest in some of the characters (the only characters I actually liked were Dwayne and Frank). It's not bad, but it's hardly 'award winning' either."

","When i first heard about this film i thought to myself ""how come a comedy movie get nominated for the academy award for best picture and won the academy award for best original screenplay beating critically acclaimed film Pan's labyrinth "". Well i was mistaken. I saw the film and it blew me away. It's one of the best movies i have ever seen. Especially the acting by everyone ,breathtaking. Greg Kinnear as a father who is struggling to sell his program about the nine steps of success is wonderful. Toni Collete as the wife of Greg Kinnear who thinks family is more important than everything is simply awesome. Paul Dano as the elder son them has taken a vow of silence till he reaches his goal of becoming an pilot. Steve Carrell as the brother of Toni Collete who is a suicidal since someone he loved didn't reciprocate to his feelings. Abigail Breslin as the family's younger daughter who wants to be the next Miss America has won the entry to go to the Little miss sunshine competition and her grandpa who is played by Alan Arkin in his academy award for best supporting actor performance teaches her the moves for the competition. Everyone in this film acts perfectly starting as a dis functional family and getting together as they embark on the journey of entering their daughter in that competition facing many ridiculous obstacles is simply awesome. Steve Carrell though comedic at times tells us by his acting that he can do serious stuff too. He deserved an Oscar nomination for his performance in the film. But the award went to Alan Arkin for his performance as Grandpa Edwin Hoover. I recommend this film to all. Please don't miss this film. It's one of a heck of a movie. I give the film a full 10 stars. You don't want to miss this film and you will regret it forever. Give it a try."

","This is just a fabulous film! I think a large part of its strength is the cast. Without these performances it could have lost its poignancy but poignant it is. And touching and warm. Every actor carries their weight with depth and charm, though I have to say Paul Dano is a force to be reckoned with. He is wonderful and has become, in a very short time, one of my favorite performers. And Alan Arkin is HOT! I am more than twenty years his junior but would go out with him in a second. I first saw him in ""Wait Until Dark"" when I was eleven and have never forgotten that performance and each and every one since then has been extraordinary. And Toni Collet! She is such a varied and nuanced actor. She is never the same but always perfect. Why is it that American actors are so often embarrassingly awful with accents while British, Australian and Welch actors do ""American"" including the regional dialects with such ease? And then toss in Steve Carrel and Abigail Breshnin. I'm embarrassed that I am not mentioning each performance because every one, right down to the ""one line"" supporting cast is excellent, I just don't know all the names.<br/><br/>This is a touching, compassionate film that honors family, humanity and the differences that both separate and bind us. After watching it I felt compelled to check out ""child beauty pageants"", something I knew very little about, and I found myself horrified by something that is now a multibillion dollar industry.<br/><br/>But the politics of pageants is not the point of this film. This film is about love and compassion and the ability to see richness and beauty in that which is not obvious. I really enjoyed this film and if you enjoy the offbeat and prefer humor that doesn't beat you over the head while still allowing you to laugh out loud in parts and cry in others, CHECK IT OUT! You'll be happy and sad that you did."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","0","5 July 2014"," 'Little Miss Sunshine"" is an outwardly original work of art with a brilliant and sweet message about finding the strength in everyone, and how everyone is a winner.
","When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? Michael Arndt, the writer of 'Little Miss Sunshine"" would say a winner. The whole theme of 'Little Miss Sunshine"" is how every person is full of strength and is truly a person of triumphant talent. This original masterpiece is about a lower middle-class family in New Mexico, who's youngest daughter Olive ( Abigail Breslin) competes in little girl modeling pageants and has a dream of becoming a supermodel. She is a very quirky child who has a very odd family. Her uptight dad with a failing business (Greg Kinear), her boring mom (Toni Collete), her suicidal homosexual uncle (Steve Carrell), her miserable brother who doesn't speak (Paul Dano), and her raw, cynical, loud Grandpa (Alan Arkin) who trains her to model. When Olive gets a call stating she can compete in a Little Miss Sunshine model competition, her family takes an old vehicle and takes a road trip out to California! Much conflict erupts due to the trip, but more victory is achieved as each character finds out who they really are and how to become happy. Each character has goals they are fighting for that give them something to strive for. Each actor is delightful and portrays each character to the point where it's almost impossible to picture anybody else playing these characters. The humor that this unique family brings to the screen in more humorous than you'll find in any Ben Stiller movie. To top of the natural humor, you'll get sometimes sad, powerful scenes as well as deep messages that can indeed be life- changing. Everyone is triumphant, everyone matters. If you struggle with those topics in yourself, see this film. This delightful masterpiece is a gem that reminds us the true power of independent cinema."

","OK so I have seen this particular film multiple of times and each time I fall in love with it. I have heard a lot people saying ""what's the big deal? This is boring! A family travel all the way to this competition that they don't even win.."" and hearing this breaks my heart because they have missed the entire point of the film... and if this is all that you get out of the movie then you have to get out of this obstinate state of mind!<br/><br/>This film portrays a completely dysfunctional family and does a hell damn well of a job. The characters are so beautifully real and legitimate. Each character illustrates such great depth and although all heavily brought to life with their own individual flaws, they're all utterly believable. The script is insanely well done and all the actors and actresses were perfect for their roles. <br/><br/>I especially identified with Dwayne's character (the older brother played by Paul Dano) in relation to the agonizing frustration of being a teenager in an environment where you cannot remotely identify with anyone under the same roof as you. <br/><br/>The soundtrack to the movie is amazing. There are no cheesy ""unfitting"" tracks at any time, everything just flows together naturally which I find to be essential with films.<br/><br/>Lastly, the message of the film. The whole family went through so many unbelievably terrible events. They persevered together despite their ""screwed up"" relationship as a family and they got there, they got there together. Despite the fact of Olive not being the number one winner they leave that place still screwed up as a family, but with a little more acceptance of one another, with an uplifting attitude of ""Hey! it's alright and we tried. No you know what? it's great!"". It's filled with moments that make you laugh, and moments that are incredibly heart warming that definitely have ""tear jerking"" potential. This film is so much more that just a crappy cheese filled comedy. By the end of the film I am over whelmed with a wave of emotion that can be summed up in a slightly high pitched sigh that is my heart releasing a sensation of ""oh gosh that was amazing. I must now engulf myself in a thick blanket to sit in the dark and think for a while"" - meant in a positive light. It shall always have a place in my heart and is one of my few highly recommended films."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","3 April 2014"," Comedy drama about a horribly dysfunctional family
","Little Miss Sunshine is one of those comedies where most of the time you feel like you shouldn't be laughing at it. It creates this unclean feeling in you yet it's clearly supposed to be entertainment.<br/><br/>It all starts with the characters. You have the father (Greg Kinnear), an unsuccessful motivational speaker. The brother (Paul Dano), who has taken up a vow of silence, following the teachings of Nietzsche. The uncle (Steve Carell), a suicidal gay man, who used to be an appreciated professor. The grandfather (Alan Arkin), who cares little about anything but porn. And lastly the eponymous Little Miss Sunshine (Abigail Breslin), a pudgy nerdy beauty pageant applicant. Only the mother (Toni Collette) is in any way normal, which is good, because she provides much needed balance to this mix of weird and unsettling characters.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine works because and despite of its crazy character largely because it has such great actors capable of pulling it off. Steve Carell and Alan Arkin especially shine in their roles and manage to provide many of the best jokes. But because the characters are so brutally broken, it'd be hard to call Little Miss Sunshine just a comedy. It is that, don't get me wrong, there are laughs to be had, but there are also really dark and depressing scenes... which are then played for laughs. The end result is something of a mix between the two genres and it adds an additional layer of depth to otherwise relatively normal road trip comedy.<br/><br/>I'd also dare to guess that the humour is not for everyone. Most of the jokes are somewhat mean-spirited in nature or they laugh at things that in a drama would be easy tear-jerkers. Olive's performance at the beauty pageant near the end especially exemplifies this idea. It's sort of a train wreck of comedy scenes. It's so horrible, so wrong, but you can't look away. And the more you look at it, the funnier it becomes. And that perfectly sums up Little Miss Sunshine."

","Have you ever heard of those ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contests? The ones that glosses, fantasize and pamper girls between 6-9 years old and put them to compete to see which one is the most beautiful (in other words beauty contest for spoiled children)?! And it always ends up with the winner flattering herself and the losers crying?! Well don't worry, this film is not about that, at least not 80% of it. And actually makes you crack-yourself laughing, and teaches you a lot about family relationship.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" begins with the Hoover family. A really problematic family, with: the father Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear), an advertising manager that tries to sell his campaign about the 9 steps to achieve success, but the poor guy just don't want to admit that he is a poor loser; the mother Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) trying to put peace in the house but it always fails miserably. Even more when she brings her problematic-homosexual brother Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) from the hospital after trying to kill himself by depression (his boyfriend cheated on him with a teacher that end up being super rich and famous); the older son Dwayne (Paul Dano), a teenager who hates everyone and made a vow of silence to his parents let him be an airplane pilot; the grandpa Edwin Hoover (Alan Arkin) who was expelled from his retirement house and now he swears and smokes weed every day, every hour. The family day-to-day changes when Olive (Abigail Breslin) the youngest daughter (and probably the most normal member of the family) gets a call saying that she was approved and can participate in the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest in Redondo Beach, which had always been her dream. The family ""couldn't resist"" her cuteness and decided to travel to Redondo Beach in their old Volkswagen Type 2 to take Olive to the pageant. But crazy drawbacks will appear on the road.<br/><br/>For the synopsis you can imagine that it is a road trip movie and in the end she wins the contest and the whole family ends up happy. But thanks to Michael Arndt screenplay things go through the crooked and not only makes the family happy but also we. With this I mean that this film, that is considered a family drama, expect many die-laughing moments. Of course the film doesn't lose its dramatic side (which is quite heavy in the film) showing family and life situations with a beautiful narrative. But Michael Arndt with a really smart humor can make all the really sad situations, really really funny.<br/><br/>Even the directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris help spice up the humor and drama of the film. It has moments that seem to be Wes Anderson making the film (drama and comedy together with a funny vision of the world sounds his style), but the directors put very well the situation of the film in our world. Especially at a emotional time in the trip, and on the arrival in the contest, but it never loses his sense of humor making us laugh by every minute.<br/><br/>But for everything to work out, a really great cast would have to be up the height of the movie, something that doesn't lack in this film. Yes, Alan Arkin took the Oscar in the film, and it wasn't for nothing thanks to his funny swears and his pure human side, but in the cast doesn't lack out great performance. Since: the little Abigail Breslin (superb); the troubled teenager Paul Dano (excellent as always) that it doesn't say one word till half of the film in the most emotional and funny scene; and Steve Carell surprises with a hilarious and superb performance (and proved to be perhaps the most important character in the film).<br/><br/>A gripping drama that teaches us a lot about family and life, but thanks to a superb cast and amazing script, makes us laugh after laughs and get fun by every minute that passes. And after the end, this little masterpiece makes us open a huge smile on our face! 9/10"

He has created this dysfunctional family filled with personalities that clearly don't mesh with one another and they have to be together in order to bring Olive, the daughter, to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The film focuses on this family who are clearly not very successful in either their career, family, or even their life their burdens have caused dysfunction within the family. This is something that I can easily empathise as everyone, at least, at some point has had dysfunction in their homes. The film itself is kind of a message in telling us to keep trying in achieving our ambitions, and don't give up just because the journey is hard.<br/><br/>This is directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and this is their first feature film. A fantastic way to start their career in feature films, before they were doing music videos and documentaries. The film has a small budget and maybe that is one reason this film couldn't do more spectacular moments, aside from the pageant but with what they did, they did great. Dayton and Faris has created a film that is very cramped to emphasise on the family and their personality and struggles. Most of the film is shot inside the VW bus and because we see the bus in a lot of the film, it becomes a character of it's own. This film does look like a lot of low budget films that are commonly found at festivals like Sundance but it's strong script and simple direction makes this film a gem.<br/><br/>Like I said before, the film feels like a low budget film and looks like what a dramedy should look. It looks engaging and accessible while at the same time feeling very intimate and simple. The DP of this film is Time Suhrstedt who commonly do a lot of romantic comedies, comedies and dramedies like ""Office Space"" and ""The Wedding Singer""; he also did the photography of a personal favorites of mine ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and ""Fantasia 2000"". The film doesn't try to look amazing but there are moments, like the first 5 minutes of the film, where shots look beautiful though only a handful.<br/><br/>When I come into a film like this, I expect a fantastic soundtrack that dominates the film rather than the composer's score. Little Miss Sunshine has a great soundtrack, just not as abundant as I thought it would be but I think that it's a good thing as it would have distracted me from the little things in scenes. Though the track that plays in the climax is unexpected and hilarious. The score though in this film is great, it fits well with the tone and feels very hopeful and positive.<br/><br/>This film has an amazing ensemble cast which work well together and looks very convincing in their role. Steve Carrell took me by surprise in particular as I generally see him as an over top actor but he convinced me here that he can play something serious. Paul Dano was another actor which I liked in this film a lot as most of his acting is played through facial expressions, and that particular scene where he breaks is just phenomenal. Kinnear, Collette, Arkin and Breslin were also great in this film. The cast feels like a real dysfunctional family, and each one feels realistic and none feel cheesy or over the top.<br/><br/>The film feels very heartwarming and is easy to digest. It's a fantastic dramedy about a family that makes you think about your own and how similar it may seem. The film shows us the importance in trying and not giving up, because only losers give up."

","I know I am an outlier on this one. I though the movie was tender and had a few good parts. I liked it when the grandpa suddenly gave props to the dad, and said he was proud of him for starting something on his own. I liked when the little girl went over to the depressed brother, and just her touching his shoulder cheered him up. Finally, I liked the end when they all were dancing together. But I realize I liked these parts because they were the only happy parts in the movie. The rest of the movie was kind of stressful to watch. Bad things happen, they are being rude and hateful to each other, funny carefree grandpa dies of a heroin overdose, and in the end everyone failed at everything they were trying to achieve. I guess they did achieve at one thing, which was finally coming together and getting along. But geez. That was a lot of yelling and serious topics of suicide and drug abuse to get through. I dunno. The little girl was a great actress, and all the characters and acting were really well done. It did leave a kind of happy feeling with the dance at the end, but overall not my favorite movie. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, it's just that I get more stressed then enjoyment with the dysfunctional family story. Don't listen to me though, if you haven't seen this, you probably should (judgegina.com)."

In the trip they will go through some hardships, mostly personal to each person, and in the trip they learn a little something about themselves, family and life itself.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine was a very well done movie. No time was wasted, and every scene was important in some way. It develops it's characters and story in a smooth pace without anything feeling too forceful or out of place. Sure there are strange moments, but it works well because the family itself is strange.<br/><br/>The characters are all interesting, and fun to be with. The acting is very good, everybody looking natural and feeling very real. My favorite character being The heroin using grandfather played by Alan Arkin mostly cause he made me laugh so much.<br/><br/>The only real issue that i think people might find is that by the end of the film, whatever problems they might have had or gotten into during the trip, whether they are personal or physical ones are still there. There is no resolution to many things and the end of the film might feel like it doesn't have a proper ending.<br/><br/>I mention this was the only thing stopping me from giving it a 10 out of 10, but as i thought about it i realized that the movie never meant to resolve these issues. that is not the goal of the film. This movie was more about the trip than the destination. It was about finding happiness or comfort in the small things, and pushing forward even when things seem bad. And that even if pushing forward doesn't fix or resolve the problem, it doesn't matter, because you learn by experiencing, enjoying the small things on the way and just moving on, not giving up."

","A deeply human, and emotional comedy about a dysfunctional family determined to get seven-year-old daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin, the sweetest girl I have ever seen) across the interstate to make sure she get's a shot at realizing her dreams of being a beauty pageant queen.<br/><br/>Right from the start you realize that Olive is not the typical beauty queen, she's quirky, a little bit pudgy and has one of the best personalities I have ever seen. Surprisingly so considering her father Richard (Greg Kinnear), is a shallow, motivational speaker and wanna-be best selling offer who truly despises his own existence. Grandpa is a badass, drug user who was thrown out of retirement home for bad behavior. Olive's brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), has temporarily chosen to be a ""mute"" because of teen angst. Olive's Uncle Frank (Steve Carell), is a brilliant scholar who recently tried to commit suicide and is stuck with his family because of it. Last, but certainly not least is the only close to sane person in this movie: the mom Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette).<br/><br/>The movie has a deliciously funny, and real plot that takes you on a ridiculous journey which will have you laughing you butt of one second, and trying really hard not to cry the next. It touched me in so many ways, to see this family react and change every step of the way. So many hurdles came their way¬Öbut they refused not to let Olive down no matter what life threw at them. No matter what the consequences.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie for me would have had to been the end beauty pageant scene, when Olive dances. It's oh so wrong because her grandfather taught her these raunchy moves, but it is oh so right because it is a subtle insult to beauty pageants everywhere. Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris's directing debut is a touching film that speaks to what it really means to be part of a family, good and band.<br/><br/>This inspirational, daring film will having you questioning everyone's sanity, but wishing you had the balls to be like them.<br/><br/>http://www.screensyndrome.com/review-little-miss-sunshine/"

"Floated2","7","0","0","15 September 2010"," More of a drama than comedy
","I recently watched Little Miss Sunshine a while ago and remembered it being getting many critical reviews and success. The film is billed and titled a comedy but its really not. Its much more of a drama. Their may be some comedic moments where people are supposed to laugh at but I didn't. Especially since it dealt with some more serious issues (drugs, suicide attempt, beauty, etc.) Though the story was very well written and the characters were developed. Also this film is very much about a great message which is one of the reasons why its rating is high and it got many positive reviews. There were many strange moments many including the grandma. Some were him telling some ""advice"" to the son- Dwayne. Also there's a real dramatic and awkward scene. SPOILERS! It happens when they figure out that the grandpa passed away so they go to the hospital. Later they get more problems and they sneak the grandpa's body out the hospital bed and put him in the trunk of the VW.<br/><br/>I found many things to be somewhat unnecessary in this film like some of the issues. Some things like learning that Frank (Steve Carell) attempted to kill himself because of his gay lover. I felt like they didn't need to make his character gay at all. No real point, just for interest of the audience I guess. Also they made the father- Richard (Greg Linnear) obsessed with winning and forcing it on his daughter- Olive (Abigail Breslin). The mother- Sheryl was more crazy and bizarre, also a smoker and somewhat disrespectful to her daughter. The son- Dwyane (Paul Dano) was at first creepy but pleading not to speak then he has an outburst toward the end of the film. Also they said he was colourblind. That also was something that was just added for audience pleasure (wasn't very necessary). But thats what made the story more interesting and gave more sympathy for the characters. They made the characters all come together and really appreciate one another. So in general the film is very well written but could have done better had it been more comedic and less dramatic."

All the characters are very unique. The son that purposely hasn't said a word in nine months, Alan Arkin as the foul mouthed grandpa is an absolute gem of a performance (he won the Oscar for this), and Greg Kinnear, Steve Carrell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, and of course, especially Abigail Breslin all deliver good performances.

In fact more than just applause. <br/><br/>Starting of with the head of the family, Alan.. Outspoken, Funny & brilliant in the portrayal of the Done it All Dad.. Apart from his brilliant scene of advice to the Teen, I liked the most when he just pats his Sons back for trying something different.. It means a lot when you know you have someone with you. <br/><br/>Greg Kinnear, I would say his best performance after As good as it gets.. The frustrated soul with failures in his personnel life but still has that energy to be positive for his Daughter.. <br/><br/>Tina is good.. really good.. perhaps with the powerhouse performances around her, its very easy to pass her performance over.. But she is the glue who keeps this family intact..<br/><br/>Paul Dano, not a name which i had heard before but a very good choice for the rebellious teen.. I remember my days when i had kept quiet.. :) Again, he is just too perfect in his one scene of Disappointment, Anger, Fear & then to end it.. compassion to his younger sibling..<br/><br/>Steve Carell ... I thought he was funny in his earlier roles, but this has a quiet charm to it.. He has stayed with the character & not let his antics take away that beautiful portrayal of a failed gay lover but still a proud proust scholar...<br/><br/>Last but no means the least.. our Little Miss Sunshine... Abigail.. It was a treat to watch her on screen.. Innocence pours right from the first scene at the dinner table. Then the movie is just a magical ride with various twists of fate..

","THE PLOT A very dysfunctional family goes in a VW van from Albuquerque to Los Angeles in order to allow their young daughter to fulfill her dream of being a contestant in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' contest.<br/><br/>THE NEGATIVE: The dysfunctional family thing going on a road trip is getting to be a bit of a tiresome formula. Just about everyone of the family members fit into a dysfunctional stereotype from the father that is too preoccupied with his career, to the alienated teenage son, and the foulmouthed grandfather. Only the two female characters seem to rise above it. The broken down VW van is an overused and much to obvious comic device. Does anybody, even the poorest of families, still drive one? Also having the elderly Arkin character pass away halfway through the film is a real letdown. Arkin's edition to the otherwise young cast gives the film a real balance. It seems like the only reason films these days have elderly characters anymore is just to get some cheap laughs by having them say uncharacteristically vulgar things and then when that wears out they kill them off just to get some forced sentiment. What is even worse is that they take the old man's body and stick it into the back of the van and continue on with their trip, which seems much to imitative to what the traveling Griswold family did to the elderly Imogene Coco character in VACATION. Also seeing girls under age 10 trying to look like mature beauty queens, like they do in the film's climactic beauty queen contest, is pretty creepy looking. Of course the film is trying to make a point with this, but it ends up not quite working because it may remind viewers too much of the Jon Benet Ramsey case.<br/><br/>THE POSITIVE: Abigail Breslin, who plays the young girl, is terrific. She gives an amazingly cute performance without it being too forced or her character becoming to precocious. Having her go through a mock striptease act during the contest's talent segment is absolutely hilarious and the high point of the whole film. For a change Kinnear plays a character that is actually somewhat interesting and not completely benign as usual. You almost wished that the film had fleshed him out even more and continued on with it. Colette is solid as usual and the desert scenery that is captured during their trip is gorgeous.<br/><br/>THE LOWDOWN: The film still delivers on the laughs and amusement despite borrowing too heavily from an overused formula. It will also make one feel much better about dealing with their own flaws and dysfunctional families after seeing this one.<br/><br/>THE RATING: 6 out of 10."
"tnrcooper","7","0","0","8 March 2008"," Nice but a bit by the numbers
","Having read a lot of comments here, I didn't realize the similarity between this film and a National Lampoon's film (Summer Vacation?). I've seen part of that film but I'm not versed in its popularity and certainly didn't know it well enough to identify the similarities shared by ""Little Miss Sunshine"". This is a decent film. The acting is really top-flight. Greg Kinnear is astonishingly underrated. He is great in ""The Matador"", ""As Good As It Gets"", and certainly in this. Alan Arkin is at his acidic, grouchy best. As another commenter noted, he could have done this in his sleep-but it doesn't make his performance any the worse. Toni Collette is brilliant. She is as consistent as Kinnear-check out ""About a Boy"" for a fabulous performance and of course ""The Sixth Sense"". Also, she was really really good in ""Priscilla's Queen of the Desert"". Abigail Breslin-well, as children's performances go, I think this is an excellent one. She does not attempt to play up her cuteness-and this just makes her all the more lovable. I'm not an expert on actors, but it would seem she has some great acting instincts. Paul Dano is very very good if a bit underused. Steve Carell I knew was very very talented from the range he showed in doing fake news reports on ""The Daily Show"" and also the realistic undercurrent to ""The Forty-Year-Old Virgin"". He is very good here too although to me his character seemed a little stereotyped. I would say the same thing for Kinnear's. C'mon-a motivational speaker who...surprise surprise....isn't as good as he thinks. Wow. I'm shocked. Shocked. The encounter of Carell's character with the man who had been favored by his crush, and whose rejection had prompted Carell's character's suicide attempt seems unlikely to the extreme. I think we, if we live long enough and have fairly eventful lives, might meet someone we know a little, perhaps in an unlikely place, but, in the middle of nowhere to meet the person who was with the man who had something to do with your suicide attempt? Really really really pushing the grounds of credibility. <br/><br/>I must say that I wanted to dislike this movie. However, the acting is so good that if you can tolerate the cardboard thin stereotypical ""indie"" characters I've mentioned and some other rote situations, the quality of the acting and the conviction which the actors bring to their performances should at least win over some of your good will by the end of the film."

","Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' quirky feature debut, is about a screwball family who take to the road and wondrously finds themselves in this crowd-pleaser.<br/><br/>A brainy blend of farce and heart, this is one of those movies that should leave a permeant smile on your face.<br/><br/>Despite early career success as an outspoken motivational speaker, family patriarch Richard (Greg Kinnear) continues to cling to his ""Refuse to lose"" philosophy, much to the chagrin of his increasingly annoyed spouse, Sheryl (Toni Collette). Add into the mix a Nietzsche-reading teenage son (Paul Dano) who has taken up a vow of silence until he finds his fate as a fighter pilot; the seven year old, would-be beauty queen Olive ( Abigail Breslin); a horny, heroin-happy grandfather (Alan Arkin) with a penchant for creative profanity; and Frank (Steve Carell) a suicidal genius and Proust scholar still reeling about losing both his male lover and his MacArthur Foundation genius grant -- and the stage is set for a road trip in which sanity is sure to take the back seat.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the entire film packs an emotional wallop that sure as hell took me by surprise. It also happens to be the funniest movie of the entire year.<br/><br/>I really think Abigail Breslin deserves an Oscar's for her role - there wasn't a scene in the film that wasn't made better by her presence. Olive was really the Little Miss Sunshine, she is the one where all the moving scenes are. She is the one that cheered everyone up, or pulled everyone together. ( For instance, that scene after Dwayne has broken down, and she pulls him back.)<br/><br/>There are so many winning scenes from this film, the dancing scene at the end (they had really overcome all of their problems against each other, and that they stood up for Olive and one another at the end), being pulled over by the cop with the dead body in the trunk, Dwayne's breakdown. <br/><br/>But my favorite is that scene at the diner, where Grandpa and Frank and then Sheryl and Dwayne start taking Olive's ice cream to make her want it again after her father had made her feel so bad for ordering it."

","We are introduced to the Hoover family: the mother (Toni Collette), the achievement-obsessed father (Greg Kinnear), the vulgar grandfather (Alan Arkin), the depressed teen-aged son suffering from elective mutism (Paul Dano), the scholarly, gay uncle who is recovering from a suicide attempt (Steve Carrell), and the cutely plain little girl who wants to be a candidate for Little Miss Sunshine (Abigail Breslin).<br/><br/>""A family of losers,"" someone calls them. (Well, they are, after all, the Hoovers.) Actually, once we get the introductions over with, it isn't a promising picture. This is the way TV situation comedies are planned -- throw together a group of dissimilar nuts into one house and have them stumble all over each other while making wisecracks. If you try to stretch it out to feature length you're liable to wind up with Chevy Chase in a Griswold family vacation movie, with a dead body strapped to the roof. (This one has a dead body in the back of the VW microbus.) The little girl, Olive, wins a crack at the title of Little Miss Sunshine in Redondo Beach, California, an apt location, but the whole family must pile into the VW and drive the 800 miles from Albuquerque and must arrive the day after tomorrow by 3PM to register. All sorts of things go wrong that cause delays -- surprise! Not only does gramps die in his sleep, but the local hospital's ""bereavement counselor,"" after offering them her condolences in a practiced voice, begins handing them thousands of pages of forms that have to be filled out. What's more, they can't just transport gramp's remains across the state line because that involves the personal endorsement of the Federal Trade Commission and would be a violation of the Mann Act. I just made that up, but I want to suggest that if the Hoover family follows the rules, Olive's entry in the contest is forfeit. So, the Little Miss Sunshine contest being of paramount importance, they don't follow the rules. Instead, they smuggle the remains out of a hospital window and stuff it into the back of the bus in a scene that lacks the laughs that the smuggling of a dead body ought to have.<br/><br/>Actually, there aren't many laughs in the film, although it is replete with incidents that generate smiles. As in any successful sitcom, the characters' quirks are milked for all the laughs that can be gotten from them. At breakfast in a caf√©, for instance, Olive orders waffles a la mode. Kinnear, his eye ever on the game, explains to her that ice cream is made from cream and that it has a lot of fat and that beauty contest winners are -- well, would you call them fat or skinny? Olive replies doubtfully, ""Skinny?"" Kinnear smiles down at her. Smart kid.<br/><br/>The beauty contest must have provided the writers with a challenge. The other contestants look like porcelain dolls. They are of various races but share bulbous foreheads, bouffant hair styles, lots of make up, great big false lashes, pasted-on smiles full of capped teeth, flashy outfits of sequins and bangles, and a way of prancing around on stage while shaking their little tushies, to the delight of a burly, bearded guy smothered in tattoos who appears to represent the pedophiles in our midst. Well, Olive is a nice kid, but she's no beauty and her talent is modest compared to the yodelers and the gymnasts.<br/><br/>Does Olive win? It would defy our suspension of disbelief. Does she lose? What kind of happy ending would that be? So the writers plump for having her get on the stage in front of these professional stage mothers and do a kind of raucous strip tease, using some lascivious steps taught to her by her degraded grandfather. Some members of the audience get up and leave in disgust. They prefer a more disguised pornography. The bailiffs, or the guards, or the corrections officers, or the civilian contractors rush to remove Olive from the stage. BUT -- the whole family runs on the stage, beats off the agents of social control, and JOINS IN OLIVE'S DANCE! Not only do the concepts of ""winning"" and ""losing"" become irrelevant, but Olive has brought the whole family together again! Let's hear it for Olive! The movie has its moments of desperation. At one point, the horn of the VW begins bleating by itself. But on the whole there are enough laughs to keep a family entertained. The kids aren't likely to get the mostly unsuccessful gags about homosexuality (or maybe they will) and they'll surely miss the references to Proust and Nietzsche, but they'll appreciate gramp's filthy mouth and the sillier jokes. It ends on a warm, up-lifting note. I wish it had ended with a capper of a comedy caper."

","A girl and her family travel across the country to have her compete in the Little Miss Sunshine competition. The family, with a genetic ability to lose at everything, is determined to see that in the end they're all winners in one way or another.<br/><br/>When this film came out, I didn't know what it was. I saw a preview or two and heard it was good, but I was under the impression it was going to be some pretentious indie film and I wasn't in the mood for that. Some days I am, but I just wasn't feeling it. Somehow I didn't notice it had Greg Kinnear (whom I love) and Steve Carell (although he wouldn't have sold me on it). And so I just let the film pass me by, with plans to see it much later.<br/><br/>Well, ""much later"" finally arrived on Christmas 2007. And i must say I was pleased -- the humor is there, and of a dark, sarcastic nature I can really appreciate. Death, failure, suicide and misery are the punchlines here (or at least the warm-ups) and I couldn't be more pleased. Most of all I was pleased with Carell, the suicidal uncle. Carell has somehow become seen as something of the new Jim Carrey, which I think has hurt him. Following ""Bruce Almighty"" with ""Evan Almighty"" and now appearing together in ""Horton Hears a Who"" are probably mistakes. But in ""Sunshine"", he's not wacky -- he's just honest and plays a good, solid character. It's quite likely he will never have a better role.<br/><br/>And truly, the ensemble cast is pretty cool. I wasn't a big fan of the brother. But the grandfather was hilarious, the father alright and the mother a good matriarch. The daughter really did run the show, and I'm glad they were able to find such a decent young actress. They could have cast Dakota Fanning or her sister, but luckily they avoided that like a Clay Aiken concert.<br/><br/>I also want to say that for having two directors, the film is pretty seamless. Generally, two directors is a bad sign. You have competing visions, or sometimes you have one director simply picking up where the other left off. Here, it worked fine -- a feat that really can only be shared with the Coen Brothers. So, you're in good (and limited) company, gentlemen.<br/><br/>See this movie. The Oscars it won are well-deserved, and you'll appreciate this (and maybe your family) after you see it. It's nice to see a film that isn't just raunchy humor... it may be morbid, but it's intelligently morbid."

","Well, well, what have we got here. Another road trip film. I guess we can just pass it. Wait, what am I saying? This is an excellent film that did not get the attention it needed. Little Miss Sunshine is about a little girl named Olive who is in the finals of a beauty competition. Problem is, they are in New Mexico and the event is held in California. I wonder where this goes? The trailers from the film really just wanted to convince you this was a straight on comedy. Wrong. This movie has its very funny parts, but this is a touching film about a family spending time together. Abigail Breslin was amazing as Olive and should have won Best supporting Actress in the Oscars. Greg Kinnear, Steve Carrell, and Alan Arkin show some of their best performances yet. And come on, who doesn't want to drive that yellow bus? One of the best dance sequences in movie history are held in this film. Long story short, this is one of the best films of 2006. Watch and enjoy."

","A cute little girl wants to win a beauty pageant. She and her family set out on a road trip of many hundred miles on a rickety bus. The challenges and imperfections of life mock on the faces of the characters and they stand by each other as a family. That is pretty much the plot. Does the little girl go on to win the pageant? Find out for yourself.<br/><br/>It is so much a story of everyone of us that we want to see and hear it more eagerly as the film unfolds. As it usually happens, the journey always so much more than the destination itself.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine, of course, falls into the category of 'feel-good' films - films that you think about while driving back from the cinemas, or on waking up the next morning, and the thought leaves a smile on your face. It talks about family, honesty and being yourself - virtues that'll never go out of fashion. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris pull of something that is probably most difficult in film making - tell a simple story about ordinary people.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin is no less a sunshine herself - brilliant and natural. She carries the film the way even veterans struggle to do.<br/><br/>The final stage scene reminded me of my first time on stage. It was an extempore competition at school and I must have looked just as nervous as Olive. Only that when it was my turn to perform, I was not even an inch as confident as her. Obviously, I sucked big time. But Olive, she rocked."

","Spoilers limited to this review's end.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell's presence motivated my watching, and he does his first real acting job here. Every character he played on The Daily Show was ""Constipated Failure-prone Man,"" with the wrinkles for The Office being that he's also ""Overbearing but Needy Boss"" with ""poorly disguised Racist tendencies."" And he performed that character well and I always laughed. But the character he plays here is the nice normal guy you'd want to be friends with, and he plays it well. <br/><br/>Essentially this movie is a character piece on 5 flawed people working for one little girl's dream and becoming slightly better people in the process. I appreciated the fact that no one's problems were instantly solved by the movie's end, the fact that the humor was understated and allowed to happen instead of forced, and the fact that the movie totally avoided toilet humor (that was nice). <br/><br/>Sadly, I saw the movie in a theatre full of idiots who guffawed and laughed and talked at every tiny second of near-whimsicality, even when things weren't that funny. ""She's going to cry now."" Really? Thank you for telling me that, idiot in the seat in front of me, I really couldn't tell from the tears welling up in her eyes, but now you've enhanced the movie for me! But that's just an argument against theatres in general, not Little Mrs. Sunshine itself.<br/><br/>I also liked the two philosophies competing in the movie, Nietszchean Nihilism and retreat from the world and Proustian character-building suffering, and the way they were subtly developed before Carrell's speech at the end. The two characters affiliated with either philosopher were the only two without any severe emotional problems. It's not *that* funny. It's not bad. But I could not abide by the way the filmmaker tried to play both sides of the issue between making fun of a child beauty pageant because it objectifies preteens for their sex appeal, and alternately having the little girl's onstage stripping be considered ""sweet"" because she was mentally innocent. And the use of the genteel ""Well, I NEVER!"" character? I hate that archetype; writers needed to stop using it in 1990.<br/><br/>S**P**O**I**L**E**R**S**!<br/><br/>Grandpa takes a moral stance that at his age, he might as well do heroin because he doesn't have long to live anyway so why not risk life for the drug pleasure? Well and good, but that's a baldfaced argument to make if you're not at least going to acknowledge the more longterm effects of H, like massive personality shifts and the destructive manic search for more money to get your next fix. But what really egged me was the way he OD's on the crank, and then a character goes ""well, it was his time,"" as if Heroin were the same as the natural aging process. If you're going to make the argument for legalization or at least use of H, make it, but the way it was presented skirted the whole issue even when the facts were there. <br/><br/>And furthermore, how stupid did the parents have to be to let their little girl ""practice her routine"" with a known heroin user in a locked door without ever observing a practice or asking the girl to show them what grandpa was teaching her? I'm surprised he wasn't committing sexual abuse. And there's not a better note to end on than that, huh?"

","This film was recommended by family -- our niece and her 14 year old son. I was shocked. Any film whose primary character is a small child should not have such a prevalence of foul language. I do have to give the actors credit. Although I found the story depressing and with very few redeeming features, the cast did a good job with what they had to work with. I suggest anyone planning to see the film not be taken in by the title which gives the impression of a lighthearted story. Even the ending -- which other reviewers seem to value so highly -- did not make the first hour and twenty minutes worth watching. I guess my sense of humor needs an overhaul because I found very little to laugh at."
"ke82","2","5","16","22 December 2006"," Trite and boring
","I wonder if our movie choices are so diminished that we applaud films like Little Miss Sunshine simply because they're supposed to be about ""real people""--as opposed to being about model-gorgeous twenties-somethings falling in love or idiot teenagers being offed by spree killers. Otherwise, I'm at a loss to understand LMS's appeal.<br/><br/>The main characters--I don't even know their names--are complete clich√©s. The harried mother. The clueless father. The irascible grandfather who barks out inappropriate sentiments. These characters could be played by anyone--and they are, on any given sitcom. And the quiet desperation of their lives--the fast-food dinners, the self-help dribble that passes for thought, the tired resignation that stands in for character--this is what Hollywood imagines real people's lives are like. But there's no more truth here than there is in 50s musicals. The fact that this movie has the gloss (or dullness, I suppose) of a faux-indie film doesn't make it truthful. The plot suffers from the same asinine clich√©s as the characters. Could anyone not see, a hundred miles off, that the VW van would break down? And stuffing Grampa in the truck? Yep, that's what everyone would do. Ride around in the desert with the rotting corpse of a relative in your car just so that your kid wouldn't miss a minor beauty pageant. There's quirky and funny, and then there's inane.<br/><br/>The only characters with a spark of ingenuity are the kids. Olive comes as close to being a normal kid as I've seen in any movie in ages. And I even liked the sullen teenager. I understood him--I wouldn't want to talk to these people either. But even in their stories, there are big gaps in logic. Why would a Nietzsche-reading outsider want to join the Air Force? And when Olive arrives at the LMS contest, she's so clearly out of her element that it was painful. It's obvious she has no idea how beauty contests work, but at the beginning of the movie, the mother explains that Olive has been going to contests. In fact, that's how she got into LMS. And what about her routine--seriously, her parents had NO clue what the kid was doing before she got up on stage?<br/><br/>And speaking of the routine, how is teaching your eight-year-old granddaughter to do stripper moves to Rick James better than slapping make-up on her and ratting her hair? If Olive had come out and done a simple kids' dance routine that ended up looking innocent and sweetly dorky next to the polished weirdness of the other little beauty queens, that would've made sense. But to have her pull her pants off to Superfreak was as unsavory as the rest of the pageant. But I guess we weren't supposed to expect much from a man who'd do heroin in the same hotel room as his granddaughter. That would just make us prudes, wouldn't it? <br/><br/>And for those reviewers who think this is somehow a brilliant insight into the dissolution of the American dream, get a grip. This is a sloppy half-gesture from writers who couldn't even be bothered to rise above trite characters and inane plot devices."

If you're not enthralled, don't tough it out waiting for it to get better, because it doesn't.<br/><br/>The premise is classic Hollywood, so full of clich√©s that I was surprised it was an Indy film. Take an adorable but cantankerous vehicle, fill it with lovable eccentrics, and send them off with an implausible excuse for a road trip. Add long peaceful scenes of bonding, a frantic race, and a warm fuzzy scene where everyone realizes it's okay to be who they are...and that's the movie.<br/><br/>Oh, and can anyone explain to me why the door spontaneously fell off the car? I suppose that was meant to be funny, but, well, kinda forced. I got a couple of chuckles out of it, but if you like road trip movies, I recommend Rat Race or Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."

","Fall from the cliff, after raising your expectations sky high ! This is how exactly I felt, after watching this movie ! Hyped as one of the best of 2006, it does not match the viewer's concept of what is in store for him ! Though the topic of a real loser family, on all counts, some how coming together finally, even the son who hates every body, and declares it so, coming closer to it, is a refreshing change from today's mechanical, artificial, and decorative families, often seen on the screen, much remains to be fulfilled, in terms of direction ! Why did that addict, yet adorable grandpa had to die so suddenly ? The reactions of the entire family, towards his death, are absolutely abnormal ! Come on, now, here was a person, live and kicking, talking about the number of girls he flirted with when he was young, and still interested to have a look at those magazines ? And what the whole family could think of , is stuffing his dead body in the rear of that junkie van, and proceed ? This feels like an absolute assault on the humane angle, that the movie boasts to have ! and why the hell all the other characters are shown in such poor light ? Doctors and nurses, and the administrative staff, of a hospital, is always not that bad ? Afterall, they also have some rules and regulations to follow ? Taking out the dead body through the window, is the limit ! Richard, the husband, is played realistically, while the wife is simply annoying ! she can't cook a proper dinner for the family, for God's sake !<br/><br/>the only plus point, is the effort of the script writer, and the director, to indicate, that these extreme odd situations, can attack the negative walls built among them, and they can start on a fresh note, with a much better understanding of each other, their own selves, and build a good rapport ! some how. the little girl , astonishing every one, with that sexy number , not suitable to her age, and the family joining her on the stage, in that chaotic situation, is unwarranted ! so this is what the grandpa taught her ? other girls might have been shown as plastic dolls, but at least were decent ? Do we understand, that such young girls can get away with any thing ? and they should be encouraged for that ? Alan Arkin is good as grandpa, but the question is, how come the dark side of his personality, that is addiction, obscene language, is tolerated by others, and isn't it a bad influence on the little girl in the family ? that annoying wife is all the time troubling and interrupting her poor husband ! this much pent up callousness , how can it be wiped with only some hours of traveling together ? and the reasons for her negativism towards him, are not clear ! Little Miss Sunshine, definitely needed some fine tuning, to be hyped as the family film of the year, which can be liked by every one, and all that stuff ! especially, the sudden death of the grandpa, and the entire turn of events which follow, aren't handled too well, and make a mockery of such a serious thing like death ! Though the film propagates, you have to be the winner, it's a loser on this count, in my opinion ! Viewers are free to decide on their own ! A strange motley of the characters , is this family, or a zoo ?"

The films about a little girl who is taught to act like a stripper..hence why i say its designed to appeal to paedophiles. Anyone who likes it is clearly either a paedophile or has brain damage probably from drinking too much alcohol or illegal drug use. There is nothing good about this film..please also search IMDb for all the hated it reviews that also gave it a score of 1 out of 10 to see just how many people agree with me. Find a better way to spend 2 hours rather than watching crap like this. Rent a good film like Bladerunner or Donnie brasco or a good comedy like The naked gun or Airplane, little miss sunshine is the kind of crap script no big Hollywood studio should ever make, it shouldn't have even been printed out from who ever wrote its computer."

I haven't laughed this hard since the fat woman in that Greek Wedding film walked away with her headphones on and hurt her neck! I had a trouser incident that time, and there were many more brown moments here! Listen to my words: This film is about a family who go for a drive across the world so that they can take their daughter (son?) to a Beautiful Contest. Boring huh? Where are the guns and killings and explodings and head bustings!? Let me finish, idiot. The thing is- the wee girl isn't a pretty one! Yet she enters this competition to win with her beauty! That was a soil. The best bit is, the rest of her family are strangoids two! The granda is an old man. Waiting to die you would think, mumbling on rusks and thinking about the good old days? WRONG! This film changes it by making the granda a sexy pest! He likes the beers, he likes the womans, and he loves the naughty words! You didn't see that coming and no, nor neither didn't I! It is SO clever and SO smart. There is a dad. Business man? WRONG! He is insecure and his wife wears the trousers! There is a mum? Housewife? WRONG! She wears the jeans because her husband likes bras! It is SO funny and SO cleverly. There is a teenage son. You would think he is a rowdy, chasing girls and shouting like a lout, and talking about sports and boobs and drinking bad juice!? WRONG for another time! It is SO clever because it changes it and does the thing that you don't expect by making him not speak. He actually wears black and reads books! What is this!? The family get into many japes as they fly across the planet in their converted school bus (what were they on when they wrote this- cheese!?). They eat in McDonalds and then drive off without paying. They go to a Toga party at a local University and the granda drinks all the wine so the jocks chase them away. The son falls in love with Pamela Anderson and tries to kidnap her at a book signing (he wraps her inside his toga). They keep finding a French cyclist in every town they visit and cause him humusing mishaps like opening the bus door so he cycles into it, or reversing over his skull while he gently rests in the forest. There are too many bits to mention so I'll stop. The bit where the police are looking at the dad and he walks with his head down so they can't see his face, but then he walks into a lamp post! The bit where the dad and granda are sleeping in the same bed and they put each other's hands between two pillows-except it's not pillows! I don't want to spoil anymore so watch it for yourself. The part where the teenage son gets so angry that after 70 minutes of not talking- he actually does actually talk. An amazing shock! The bit where the granda climbs inside a coffin but it is already occupied so he kicks the skeleton in the nuts! Eventually they get to some place that they were trying to get to (how ironic!) and the girl goes on stage. Rather than get all dressed up like the other women this film tricks you again by doing something different! I won't spoil it, but I'll say that it involves a long black wig, Trevor McDonald, a box of matches, and 12. It is just too amazing lee clever and funny, and too SMART for the average brain! The best film since sliced bread! Best Bit: There are too many! The bit when they are driving through the ice and the mum decides to lick the window but her tongue gets stuck, and the granda says 'Stick that tongue on me any day baby!'

","The feeling I had after watching ""Little Miss Sunshine"" was very mixed, although I liked the film very much. Why did Grandpa want the innocent Olive to shock the audience with a routine that would all but assure her losing? The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that the grandfather's back story was really the key to the movie. The advice he gives his grandson (you know, about a LOT of DIFFERENT women) and the pride he conveys to his loser son for at least TRYING to make it on his own, point to one fact: Grandpa was not the free spirit he appeared to be, but a sad individual who had probably been faithfully married to the same woman for 50 years, and had worked slavishly for the same company for decades, too. This is why he devised the outrageous routine for Olive, to thumb his own frustrated nose at society and the phonies he knew would be attending such a lame pageant. There was no triumph for the family except for their individual realizations of how much they needed, and loved, each other. And there was still hope for all of them that they would not lead as quietly desperate lives as poor old Grandpa.<br/><br/>PS: the fact that the producers thought Alan Arkin too virile for the role only bears out their concept of the character being a pathetic, frustrated individual."

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a fabulous feel-good comedy of a different kind - it is terribly dark, and at times depressing, but makes no apology for it, and it doesn't need to either. The film revolves around a more-than-slightly dysfunctional family who, all with their own subplots, travels to the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pagent so that young Olive can enter, and along the way learn a thing or two about each other, and what it means to be part of a family.<br/><br/>The always-excellent Greg Kinnear plays father Richard, a man who means well, but sometimes fails to get across what he means, except of course when it comes to being a winner, as he has a 9-step program so that anyone can find the winner in themselves. However, his attempts to get people to purchase the program have been unsuccessful, causing strain with his wife, Sheryl who is played by the wonderful Toni Collette. Along the way to the Beauty Pagent, they are faced with a marital crisis.<br/><br/>Their marriage is under strain also thanks to Sheryl's suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carrell) who happens to be depressed, and while despite being a genius, cannot sort out his love life, which he practically re-encounters on their journey. Alan Arkin plays Richard's cocaine-addict father, who has been mentoring Olive in her quest to be in the Little Miss Sunshine, which have unexpected results at the pageant itself.<br/><br/>Paul Dano gives a compelling performance as Olive's brother Dwayne who has taken a vow of silence (yes, he is silent for the majority of the film), though he too learns something about himself on their journey and is forced to speak out. Despite fantastic performances from Collette and Kinnear, it is Abigail Breslin who steals the film as Olive. She lightens up the most depressing scenes and is utterly convincing in her innocence.<br/><br/>At times it may feel like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is going nowhere, but it is a brilliant showcase of talent and story, which comes to a grand climax at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, where you can't help but feel sorry for Olive, even though she may not know why anyone would need to feel sorry for her."

","Taking the current crown for dysfunctional family ensemble work, Little Miss Sunshine is the most warped fun you will have with an eccentric clan since Family Stone or The Squid and the Whale. A little more predictable then the latter, slightly less naturally paced then the former, LMS still manages to be morbidly sweet in it's stereotypically indie manner. Following the exploits of the bitter unit, we are invited along for a road trip that will take this extended family 800 miles across the country in order to enroll their youngest daughter into a child beauty contest, essentially portrayed as a final bastion of hope for the ailing camaraderie between the members. Modeled, perhaps a little too closely, after the classic first National Lampoon's Vacation movie, Little Miss does sometimes suffer from these parallels as well as the predictability that all of these fractured personalities bring to the table. To see the fine cast working together to create this completely modern portrait of family though nearly compensates for any of the generic trappings the concluding part of the script might have succumbed to. Anyone in the mood for a dark comedy with it's fair share of heart will be far too entertained to point out the few but obvious flaws that forbid this movie from becoming another true inept family classic; the bus is leaving-get on in."

There is a dark side to this movie - the junkie grandfather and... well, some of the other characters are not what they appear. And that's what makes this movie a little different. The grandfather has some great advice for the teenager in the family (speaking about drugs): ""Stay away from that sh!t. Someone your age is mad to touch it. Someone my age is mad not to."" The acting is uniformly excellent - with the little girl taking the prize. She's wonderful. And the music is good too. My only criticism is that it drags a little in the middle.

It really did ""take me through all the emotions"", well, not all, but it brought laughter and tears, and that's a pretty good combination. As wacky as some things in the movie may seem, it is not too wacky to be unbelievable. The acting is excellent and the only fault I have with it is the abundant use of the ""F"" word, which could have been bleeped in places, and substituted for another word in other places, without losing the ""effect"" I guess they wanted to achieve by having the ""F"" word in the movie. That was the only reason the movie was rated R, so they could have easily made it a PG-13 movie, although it is the kind of movie that may not appeal to many under 18 anyway. The characters are all so good, I hope they figure out a way to make a sequel, without making a sequel just to cash-in on.

","Personally this movie came out of nowhere to me, no ads, and some posters here and there. But I would have never expected it to be one of the best movies of the summer. The beginning of the movie starts out with Miss America,and how Olive (Abigail Breslin)is imitating what the winner does because its her life long dream to be beautiful and famous. But in reality shes cute and brains and couldn't compare to the women in the contest. But she always pushes herself to finding that dream. <br/><br/>The storyline picks up when the family is introduced while they are sitting down having dinner eating fried chicken. Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a struggling father in the verge of bankruptcy who is trying to sell a product that no one wants to buy. Frank (Steve Carrel), the main reason I wanted to see the movie is a suicidal graduate who fell in love at the wrong time. Dwayne (Paul Dano) is on a bow of silence until he reaches his goal of becoming a pilot. And the mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), and grandfather (Alan Arkin) are the balancing pin of the family, who just want to keep it together. <br/><br/>But thats not where the American stereotype comes in, it comes in at the end when they finally get to the LMS contest. And the family is seemingly worried in Olives chances for winning, because other families had ""overreacted"" and created monsters out of 7 year old girls. Yet Olive still wants to do the competition but in despite of her talent of dancing didn't win, but the family joined her in the final dance. And to me that symbolized that no one in the end needs to be happy with the things they don't have. Bankruptsy, Divorce and drugs doesn't mean that a family cant be stable. And making fun of a culture that goes way over boarder and creating a rule that all endings must have the goal that the characters want to reach completed.

The soundtrack was great, especially if you liked that of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". But, the greatest part of Little Miss Sunshine was definitely the screenplay. Little Miss Sunshine was able to pull off comedy, which is very hard to do. Most movies start with dumb jokes and then try to create an odd type of drama, but it doesn't work, because in other movies you don't care about the characters at all, because they haven't been developed well. This movie, though, makes film-making look easy, as it develops the plot and main characters flawlessly, and when it comes time to carry out the drama, it does not have any shortcomings. Little Miss Sunshine is the best movie of the twenty-first century, and I recommend it to all people, especially those who liked such movies as ""Sideways"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", and ""Junebug""."
"the-color-grey","10","3","8","20 August 2006"," Best movie this year - long review
","This just might be the beginning of a great career for first time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. I could be quoted on saying that Clerks II was the best movie I've seen all summer, but after watching Little Miss Sunshine there's no comparison. Miss Sunshine is most certainly the best I've seen all year. The humor is completely different from Clerks. It's much more real and relatable. It's also a surprise do see Steve Carell in such a different role. He's good, though, and it shows that he can play different roles. One would think Carell would be the center of the comedy but the laughs are mostly connected to the family as a whole and each character adds it's own personality into the comedy. The storyline of the movie is a family traveling from New Mexico to California in a Volkswagen van to enter their 8 year old daughter into the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Mother, Father, Son, Daughter, Uncle, Grandfather. Each have personalities different from each other making great conflict and humor. One of the funniest things in the movie is this one thing involving the van that reoccurs through out the movie. Check out the poster for a clue of what that one thing is. Don't like spoilers. It shows great symbolism with the family, representing how a family that hates each other must work together to achieves their goals and solve their problems, and it shows how each character came out a happier person in the end. It might sound clich√© but trust me the messages aren't being shoved down your throat. You also might be thinking this is some stupid family journey movie and they end up learning to love each other in the end. This is not the RV people. I'd liked to tell you more about the characters to help you understand but I hate giving too much information that will spoil the experience.<br/><br/>There's comedy in the van as they travel to California, and comedy in the unusual circumstances the family gets into. It's an enjoyable film that never gets boring. They're even some scenes that are pretty long compared to your average movie, but it's still entertaining because of the dialogue. An example is one of the first scenes when the family is getting ready to eat dinner. This scene is where the audience learns of all the characters and their personalities. It's a great introduction to the life of this family. It might be a long scene but you won't notice it.<br/><br/>The characters are memorable, the comedy, the whole movie is memorable. Your going to walk out of the theater and know you didn't waist your money. You're going to want to watch it again. You wouldn't have minded if the movie lasted a while longer just to see the lovable characters. You might even decide to buy it when it comes out on DVD. Little Miss Sunshine is a movie that will appeal to a wide audience because of the variety of the characters and relatable comedy. Trust me it'll be one your favorite movies that you've seen all year, if not your #1."

","I was not really expecting this movie to be as great as it was. I knew it was going to be a comedy/drama about family relationships, but I did not expect the characters to be so real, nor did I expect to fall in love with each of them. The comedy is quite funny, with some scenes being downright hysterical - and that kind of laughter is so wonderful to experience.<br/><br/>But the message of the movie - that as long as you have your family, nothing else really matters - came across so strongly but never felt forced. It made me want to be a part of this make-believe family, because despite all their faults, their love for each other gets them through everything."

","I went to see this movie with no actual interest in seeing it, but I was shocked to find this movie was one of the best I've seen in a very long time. From beginning to the end Little Miss Sunshine offers plenty of laughs, but that's not all. Surprisingly there is quite a few sad moments that really shows who the family really is and shows how close they really are. Yet even after the sad moments the movie is brilliantly set back on track with something so odd it's hilarious.<br/><br/>The actors themselves are all fantastic in this movie and do a great job being a family.

"dglink","9","3","8","18 August 2006"," Let the Sunshine In on a Dismal Movie Season
","A dysfunctional family in a dysfunctional vehicle en route to a dysfunctional event makes for a fine comedy, thanks to a good script and a gifted cast. Take a failed inspirational speaker who spouts the wisdom of his nine points to success, a young man who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy, a gay professor who has just blown a suicide attempt, an old man who is into snorting cocaine and reading porn and throw them together in an old mini-van with a broken clutch and you have ""Little Miss Sunshine."" The film's title refers to a pre-teen beauty pageant in which the only seemingly normal member of the family, young Olive, has been entered.<br/><br/>A road movie at its core, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" offers enough laughs to coast through the few slow parts. Unfortunately, with the resurfacing of the Jon Benet Ramsey murder case, the scenes at the beauty pageant have an unsavory aspect as the young girls cavort in grown-up outfits and pose provocatively for the audience. For this viewer, young Olive, refreshingly dressed as a little girl, outshines the other overly made-up and overly rehearsed contestants. Greg Kinnear is fine as the father, although his drop-dead-handsome looks are at odds with those of the rest of his screen family. Toni Collette as Kinnear's wife is always good, and Steve Carell leaves ""The Office"" behind and gives an underplayed performance as the gay uncle. Alan Arkin makes a welcome return to the screen as Kinnear's father, who offers his own advice on life, which largely centers on drugs and sex.<br/><br/>Not since ""Happy, Texas"" a few years back has a small, low-budget comedy come out of nowhere to brighten an otherwise dull movie season. With snakes, super heroes, and gross-out comedies filling the screens, discerning viewers can find relief and some intelligence in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Two hours with this odd ball family as they lurch towards California is time well spent. Despite deep-seated differences and outward disdain, these six people show that family ties are deep and pull members together in times of crisis."

LMS exceeded all of the great expectations I had. It's funny, touching, dramatic -- everything you want in a movie. All the actors did a phenomenal job and the script is wonderful. At the end of the movie, the sold-out audience applauded. Do yourself a favor and have a fun time at the theater. RUN, RUN, RUN to see LMS!!! It is the best movie of the year so far. It will be very hard to beat! While it is unusual for comedies to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, LMS should be nominated and should win. It's that good."

","Perhaps because of the hype that has been surrounding this movie, I had set expectations that no film could live up to. If that is not the case, then Little Miss Sunshine is in fact the horribly generic ""independant"" film that I believe it is. <br/><br/>Filled with the condescending ""so simple but so beautiful"" scene angles that would only stimulate pompous filmmakers like Gus Van Sant, the whole feel of the movie condescends more than it does evoke. Each little snippet of ironic humor (the unsuccessful motivational speaker or a Nietzsche obsessed teenager whose only dream is to be an air force pilot) is worth nothing more than a light chuckle. Although the subtle joke that all Proust scholars are gay was an example of although the film is not the gem that it has been made out to be, its still not bad. For example, making a living off caricature roles, Steve Carrell proves that he is in fact an actor. Abigail Breslin is the child actress that Dakota Fanning wishes she was. Alan Arkin is brilliant as the grandfather. If the film flies in one area, it's the acting.<br/><br/>It's not that I hate the film. As I said, perhaps my judgment is based more in disappointment. However, from the beginning of the film, each quirk in every single character plays out in the most predictable and, for me, unexciting way. I do say that you see it, because as I left the theater, I heard most people singing praises. As for myself, I will continue searching for the perfect movie of the summer; the one that will fill the void that Little Miss Sunshine should have."
"orwhell","5","4","13","23 December 2006"," Not impressed
","I'm a little confused as to why this movie has created so much praise amongst critic circles and has actually been able to make a birth on the top 250. Steve Carrell is a brilliant actor and I loved him on the Daily Show, The Office and in the 40 year-old virgin. Alan Arkin is dead on and I have no complaints with him. Greg Kinnear is an under-appreciated actor as is Toni Collette but none of those facts save this film. Carrell was underused in this movie and even when he was utilized, it wasn't very funny or emotionally gripping. This is a film that tries to engage us with it's imperfect yet human characters. The problem with that is, movies that attempt to do this have to have a firm foot set in reality. This movie employs too many farcical tactics that are neither funny nor believable (ex. the pervert cop, stealing the corpse, no one bothers to arrest or ticket the van that destroyed the parking lot swing arm to name a few). Furthermore, child pageantry is fairly uniform throughout the nation and how Albequerque is somehow out of the norm in the regard that a ""clueless"" contestant such as Olive could succeed is as ridiculous as her talent performance at the end of the movie. Why didn't her mother have any idea as to what's going on, she didn't see her perform in previous pageants or once see her rehearse at home? I'm not totally cold hearted and did enjoy some of the scenes where the family came together, like when they debated whether or not to let Olive perform, but those types of scenes were too far and few between. I really had high hopes going into this movie, I had heard that it was the feel good movie of the year. I guess it made me feel good to pick apart the incongruities of the script but that's not why I watch movies. Not impressed at all."

There was nothing in this 'road movie' that hasn't already been done in thousands of other 'road movies' The acting was average, although the little girl playing 'Olive' was very good.

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" attempts to tread on ground that has been firmly furrowed by such films as ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Sideways"", ""Broken Flowers"", ""Rushmore"", ""Wonder Boys"", and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" - a pointed black comedy that uses relationship in dichotomy within an evolving framework. In this case, it's a road trip to a pageant in which Olive Hoover will compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine.<br/><br/>Unlike the other films mentioned earlier, this is a complete disappointment. Its message is blithe and unremarkable and is completely sublimated by its simplistic and crude bearings. Worse, I found the characters to be predictable and completely unlikeable - a presentation that inept writers/directors seem to mistake for the gist of good black comedy. The script is as devoid of depth as a wading pool.<br/><br/>While not having much with which to work, the cast mails in their performances. Alan Arkin has been the author of many great comedic and dramatic characterizations, including ""The Russians are Coming..."" and ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" to name a few. This Oscar-winning nod is a throwaway. Toni Collette, one of the most versatile of current actors, stoops not to conquer, but to rake in the cash - she has absolutely nothing to do here. I found her character to be innocuous at best. Steve Carell does his best to put a wet blanket over the one potentially complex character in the mix - his monolithic performance falls particularly flat, and serves as a poster child for lack of inspiration.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a black comedy in the sense that it insults its audience by taking them for fools with a maudlin ""message"" and ""quirky"" characters. And based upon the number of awards and glowing accolades that this fraud has received, fools have been rushing in by the truckload.<br/><br/>This is one of the very few films that I've seen recently that I would call ""repellent"".

"bob the moo","Null","3","9","14 October 2007"," Imperfect but sweetly quirky and enjoyable (spoilers)
","Olive's family is kindly described as dysfunctional. Her father Richard aspires to be an inspiration speaker and writer with his ""nine steps to success"" programme. Her brother Dwayne has taken a vow of silence until he achieves his goal of being a pilot. Her uncle Frank is staying with them because he has tried to kill himself after personal and professional issues. Her grandfather has been kicked out of his nursing home for heroin use and now lives with them. Olive herself has the ambition to succeed in beauty contests and her ambition appears to be close to fulfilment when the winner of a contest is dethroned, making Olive the winner and the entrant into a regional competition happening this weekend. With few options, the whole family board their VW camper van and head out on the road.<br/><br/>Regardless of the hype the basic plot summary made it sound like a car crash waiting to happen. I wonder, will lessons be learnt and family barriers broken down during the road trip? Of course this occurs but the quirky sweetness is both the making of it and the breaking of it. On one level the film works so well because it manages to avoid the emotional traps of the clich√©s in the script by being so very different in its approach. This is true of the characters, the plot and the conclusion, all of them having a semblance of the clich√© but yet developing along some sort of quirky parallel path. The downside of this is that at times it goes too far. Personally for me this was the actions immediately following the death of the grandfather ¬ñ I found them too extreme and unlikely and the quirk factor was pushed too high.<br/><br/>As it was though, the sweet quirkiness turned this around after a short time and we were back on level ground. It isn't a perfect film by any means but this approach did help make it so much more that it could have been (imagine the exact same plot delivered as a daytime melodrama to see what I mean about the importance of the tone and approach). The direction is good, again feeding the quirky indie feel with the music and framing of shots. The cast work well because mostly they manage to fit with the quirky approach but not totally lose their characters in there. Breslin is a wonderful little girl, effortlessly real and sweet but not in the sickly, precocious way that some can be. In terms of performances, the adult cast do dominate her though as they deliver more. I enjoyed the way that Kinnear and Collette worked off one another as the couple and they, rather than Olive, provided a lot of the heart of the film. Carell was not a total revelation but he wasn't far off ¬ñ it is the first serious role I have seen him do and he did it very well. Dano is moody for the most but delivers when it is asked of him, while Arkin is a terrific character that brought a lot of humour to the film.<br/><br/>Overall it is perhaps too quirky for its own good and it does really skate a fine line. Mostly though it works and the quirky sweetness (assuming you are into it) does carry it though the moments where it pushes the boundary of quirky and threatens to become silly or quirky for its own sake. Not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination and I do feel it has been hyped more than it deserves but regardless it is charming and enjoyably disarming."

To put it mildly, I was dumbstruck to hear that this film received any positive attention from any quarter.<br/><br/>This film is about a dysfunctional family who's DAD is trying to make his idea into a reality. His idea is basically.. stupid. He fails, the family fails, the rent is due and you get all the angst that goes with it. At the same time you get the angst of the pre teen daughter wanting to be accepted as a dancer and all the boo hoo that seems to kibosh that idea because there's not going to be any money.<br/><br/>The pace of this film is like moose crap in a Vermont winter. The acting is phoned in. There's never a hook into the characters that really makes you want to see more. It becomes depressing even though you can see that isn't the intent.<br/><br/>The ONLY good thing about this flick is the last 5 minutes. The little girl gets to be in her dance contest, she comes on stage last, behind all the other girls that do what all little girls do at dance contests, and her dance is that of an obscene stripper. Now that was funny!<br/><br/>To get to the last 5 minutes isn't worth it by any stretch of the imagination!

For the most part the film is uneventful and, aside from Mr. Carell's sarcasm towards Mr. Kinnear, not very comical. Alan Arkin's talent was wasted during this film. His character was dry and inappropriate. Steve Carell did a decent job of playing someone who is suicidal but the script failed to allow him to shine aside from one scene with him and Paul Dano alone discussing life and Proust I believe? Well anyway The movie dragged on and I was bored until the end when the daughter finally makes it to the stage and puts on a wonderful show for the shocked and appalled onlookers. Anyway, the final ten minutes are great and made me laugh and clap and cry and all that good stuff. But to watch an entire movie for the final ten minutes. Not worth it.

Now, that being said:<br/><br/>This was quite possibly one of the most useless films ever put to celluloid this decade. <br/><br/>Easily one of the least enjoyable films I've ever seen. The basic premise of LMS is: family goes on road trip so homely daughter can compete in a beauty pageant which she will probably never win. The fact that Olive (Breslin) isn't beauty pageant material never crosses their minds and no one, but the father suspects as much (and even then, states his opinion so harshly that you can't even sympathize with him). *sigh* Lest we not forget the ridiculous, contrived and unfunny ending.<br/><br/>For months I heard the hype surrounding this movie, people were ranting and raving about this like it was the funniest thing they've seen in decades--some even claimed as much. My own mother told me she ""lmao'd"" (so-to-speak) throughout. Surely this has to be good...right? Yes, of course, that many people can't possibly be wrong. So, finally, after little deliberation, I sat down to watch this.<br/><br/>Disappointed is not the word I'd use because it doesn't properly convey what I felt. I actually almost felt angry, betrayed, lied to even. I don't think in the whole two or so hours I laughed more than once, and even then it was more of a ""Oh..ha, OK, that was kind of funny,"" not the belly-aching, pants-wetting hysterical laughter others say they experienced. It was just plain bad. This movie had not a single redeeming quality or character (except maybe Daniel Plano). And it's not that I didn't ""get"" it (I hate when people use that term), and no I would not like to go watch a Transformer or some other Michael Bay or a Tarantino film OR 27 Dresses instead. I'm not some brainless ""blowy-uppy"" shoot em up or sappy love story type girl.

","The plot revolves around Olive (Abigail Breslin), who is truly a ""little miss sunshine""¬ó the sweetest little girl, full of innocence and inner joy even though she is living within a totally dysfunctional family. She is wise enough to know that a genuine hug can uplift the worst depression and grounded enough not to be upset when her self-absorbed family forgets all about her. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that she is a tad pudgy and simply cute as a button, but not a great beauty, Olive has managed to win a local child beauty contest and has the chance to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine contest in California. For various reasons, the family decides the only way to accomplish getting her there is to all load in the old van and drive for two days. <br/><br/>Just so we are clear on who the players are here, we have: <br/><br/>1. Richard, Olives' father (Greg Kinnear), the failed entrepreneurial creator of a nine-step program called Refuse to Lose, who is happy to let everyone else know why they are a loser but never turns that inspection on himself. <br/><br/>2. Sheryl, Olive's mom (Toni Collette), the sweet but scattered sanest of the bunch, who is so disconnected from her daughter that she does not even know what her costume for the contest looks like. <br/><br/>3. Dwayne, Olive's Nietzsche reading teenage brother (Paul Dano), who has taken a vow of silence. <br/><br/>4. Frank, Olive's genius, homosexual uncle (Steve Carell), who is recovering from a failed suicide attempt over a lost love and a ruined career. <br/><br/>5. Grandpa, Olive's very loving but drug-using, porn-reading, foul-mouthed, paternal grandfather (Alan Arkin), who lives with the family and is Olive's only coach for the Little Miss Sunshine contest. <br/><br/>So they all pile in the van to help Olive achieve her dream. It is during this Murphy's Law laden road trip from hell that the family learns some solid spiritual lessons about themselves and life. <br/><br/>Poor Olive is in a constant pull between her overzealous, somewhat demented father's advice about how to be a winner (and not to eat ice cream so or she'll get fat) and her grandfather's advice that a real loser is someone so afraid of losing that they never try anything (and eat all the ice cream you want). <br/><br/>Jumping in with both feet, confident she can be a winner in either book, Olive certainly goes out on a limb with the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. It is her dream, and no matter how much the van and the family fall apart on the two day trip, Olive keeps her optimism, selfless love, and joy in life. <br/><br/>Drawing everyone's three day experience together eloquently, Dwayne reaches a grand conclusion: Life is one *#^%* beauty contest after another. So do what you love and #*%* the rest. (You can fill in the colorful language, which this movie has in abundance.) <br/><br/>Life often does feel like one string of events where we are being judged by someone else. Is our house big enough? Are our clothes stylish and expensive enough? And, the constant whammy for most women, Am I pretty enough? Not to mention the torture-filled, nightmarish beauty pageant of middle school and high school. How many joys in life do we miss because we are fussing about what others will think? <br/><br/>Fortunately, Olive has not yet gotten the memo that these are the things we have to worry about and is oblivious to it all. With a natural innocence, she is just being Olive and doing what she loves to do. <br/><br/>The most truly beautiful people I know think less of themselves than they do of others. When we can release ourselves from the self-centeredness that is so caught up in what others think of us or what just our own needs and concerns are, then we are free to be a part of something wonderful. <br/><br/>In the end, a pleasing set of facial features does not a beautiful face make, or a beautiful person. I've met many women who appear to be everything lovely and elegant ¬ó until they open their mouth and begin to spew forth with such arrogance or ignorance that I wonder why I was ever so impressed with them. I've also met very plain women who are so filled with eloquence and grace that loveliness just envelopes their presence. <br/><br/>I love the thought: <br/><br/>""Love {God} never loses sight of loveliness. Its halo rests upon its object. One marvels that a friend can ever seem less than beautiful... Beauty, wealth, or fame is incompetent to meet the demands of the affections, and should never weigh against the better claims of intellect, goodness, and virtue...The recipe for beauty is to have less illusion and more Soul..."" (""Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures"" by Mary Baker Eddy) <br/><br/>If life is one big beauty contest, how are the winners and the losers judged? I think the cast of kooks in this movie reach the conclusion that it is being yourself, doing what you love, and sharing it with those you love. <br/><br/>As the saying on life goes: When you get the chance to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance. And, wow, does Olive dance when she is given the opportunity ¬ó even though she is scared and the adults want her to quit ¬ó and with a chutzpah that most of us will never experience in our whole lives. <br/><br/>In this giant beauty contest, we should give it our all, like Olive does, and be who we are instead of trying to measure up to someone else's standard. Have less illusion, and express more soul."
"etsm92","9","2","5","6 February 2007"," A clever dysfunctional family comedy-drama...
","Little Miss Sunshine/2006/***1/2<br/><br/>Main Stars: Greg Kinnear Steve Carell Toni Collette Paul Dano Abigail Breslin<br/><br/>I would have to agree with the Oscar nominations this film received. Abigail Breslin does deserve some type of reward for doing such a good job. Same with Alan Arkin. He played a much different role than he usually does and was very convincing. It may even deserve the Best Motion Picture of the Year! Best Screenplay is what the film deserves the most, however. Movies like this come around a couple times in a lifetime. Rarely do you have an awkward comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family to pick up off the shelves at Blockbuster. These days we see movies filled with insipidity. Such as movies with explosions, predictable moments, and violence, and a couple other things that viewers younger than thirteen would be affronted by. Movies like this that have wit, are awkwardly funny, and have unpredictable moments, TRUE ACTING, and have a story are enjoyable to watch! This is one of those films. It is set around one fractured family trying to travel to California to enter Olive (Abigail Breslin), the eager seven-year-old who wants to be a beauty queen, into the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. However, the quirks of the family somewhat hold them back. First off, there's the dad (Greg Kinnear) who enjoys lecturing people on if they are winners or losers. He doesn't like the fact that people put themselves down and would rather remain losers. He would rather them admit they are winners (ones who mainly TRY). ""You don't have to succeed to be a winner"". The family gets irked by his lectures later on. Then there's the mother (Toni Collette) who seems to be a typical depressed mother trying to raise children (meaning practically everyone except her) and trying to take a trip to California without going insane. Then there's the son (Paul Dano) who's a rebel and will not talk to the family until he gets accepted into the Air Force. However, he seems to be the one that says the most ""F"" words later on. Then there's the uncle (Steve Carell) who's gay and tried to commit suicide when finding out he was. Then there's the grandfather (Alan Arkin) (who had a shorter part than the others) who seems to be an extremely uneducated old man who smokes, takes drugs, etc. He obviously doesn't have the slightest bit of wisdom. However, the last line he said made him special and made who he said it to feel special on the inside and out. Last is Olive whom I already gave a brief description of. Even more detailed is that she is also a rebel just like her brother. She seems kind of naughty on the inside. Or perhaps ""spicy"" is the word I'm looking for. She is a kind and talented kid. The only questions that are hanging are: Will she win the beauty pageant? Will they ever get to California in order to find out? Well, since they are driving a crappy Volkswagen bus, that might delay them right there. But the dad thinks there is an easy way to solve this. Teamwork. No matter what, teamwork always helps (no matter how little the help may be). Instead of one person helping make it to California, why can't all six help? It would make things go a lot smoother. Their VW bus, unfortunately, cannot accelerate very well. So, to get it in gear, all six help in a way and get it to gain speed. That's where the teamwork part comes in. The family, as I said before, is dysfunctional, however. And their quirks may delay things a little, but are the delays that serious where they will completely damage the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant for their sweet little seven-year-old girl who wants to be a beauty queen? Who knows? She is not the most beautiful person on the outside (perhaps a little chunky around the middle), but her face and on the inside she is a beautiful girl longing for the purpose to help her family in the state of depression they're in (like severely in debt). Perhaps the family doesn't feel so well after the excitement that was brought to them. I wouldn't have an answer to that because the movie stopped in an odd spot. Perhaps their teamwork and excitement paid off, and they would have enjoyed taking that ride all the way to California to end up being¬Ö¬Ö Movie directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris."
"natalierosen","1","2","5","28 January 2007"," I really loathed this film
","Perhaps I am unique. I simply do not for the life of me understand what people think is so wonderful about this film or why it is up for any Academy Award. I simply hated it. It was preposterous, ridiculous, inane, certainly profane and obnoxious. Okay, perhaps it said one should be who one is and persevere despite life's setbacks and with a loving family it will be much easier to get through the rough spots. I'll give it that. I suppose it had a message. Still, the way TO the message was insane.<br/><br/>Moreover, something else bothered me. The role of the grandfather made me squirm. The fact that he was disgustingly profane and obnoxiously revolting was compounded by what he said in the company of his granddaughter. There was some kind of, I thought, weird incestuous suggestiveness that I was not at all comfortable with. Would anyone be comfortable with a grandfather who got kicked out of his condo, sniffed cocaine and advised his grandson to bed every woman he can, staying in a hotel room with their female child? The kiddy beauty pageant at the end put the child pornographic icing on the cake for me and it did so by trying to be hilarious about it. There is NOTHING funny about a child being placed in a Jean Benet Ramseyish adult sexual role. NOTHING. This film said and did some uncomfortable things and more than once I was tempted to walk out. I didn't but I wish I had. This film disgusted me."
"olehenry1","5","2","5","26 January 2007"," Mainstream, Ordinary, No Guts, Typical, Lacking
","Just as my summary indicates, this movie is no different than the last 100 cute comedies.<br/><br/>Attempts to develop the characters failed in the usual ways -- adults trying too hard to succeed and lose focus on what's really important to EVERYONE, family. Oh geez, so glad these directors/producers/writers couldn't budge from that cheezy theme AGAIN.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear is still one of my favorites, but not in these types of movies. Gotta go with what sells though...makes me wonder -- does he not see how crappy he was AND how good he could be?! Cute final performance scene -- had me cracking up, but still tame and lame."
"purplehaze367","9","2","5","20 January 2007"," Little Miss Sunshine
","I like this movie for its careful attention to detail. <br/><br/>The father is portrayed very well in the fact that he is a failed motivational speaker. The irony in this one situation could sell a movie alone. The mother obviously wanted a normal life and as seen early on in the movie she hasn't fulfilled that dream quite yet. The grandfather, a heroin addict, was also a nice touch. This is a common situation in house holds because during the Vietnam war many soldiers were introduced to the potent drug and kept their addiction while coming back to the states. The son, played by the talented actor Paul Dano, is seen as an outcast trying to find his own purpose in life. Struggling to maintain sanity while being surrounded by such a dysfunctional family could also make a great movie standing by itself. Olive was a great addition for her obliviousness. She has no idea how her image is presented(the ugly duckling). This is obviously the driving force in the plot and without her the trip to California would never have been made. The suicidal uncle is a great touch. He brings a very cruel but honest sarcastic humor to the table and completes this movie pushing it into what an be considered dark comedy. <br/><br/>Even though this family may seem odd, it portrays many suburban families in the United States (probably why it caught my attention). With even just one of the characters missing it would cut out at least 20 minutes of the story. Each character brings one dilemma to the table making this movie quite depressing. I will not go into details towards the ending for fear of ruining someones movie experience. <br/><br/>The only thing that would make this movie even better (for me personally) is to see Dain have a more philosophical outlook on life. It can be seen that it would be very hard for the director to show this due to Dain's vow of silence. I would have liked to see Dain grow more as a human being and be seen more as someone struggling to maintain sanity rather someone trying to be detached from life itself. <br/><br/>This movie is a must see."

","Take the perfect dysfunctional family and put them on a road trip together from Albuquerque to California. What is the result? All the characters in this outstanding film are beautifully sculpted by the hand of a master artist - and that includes everyone from writer to actor to editor.<br/><br/>In general, the characters have depth and three-dimensions and each undergoes a very clear and definite arc within the film. The family as a whole also undergoes a deeply comical and emotionally satisfying arc.<br/><br/>Michael Arndt is a hugely talented writer, and I expect that we will see more from him in the coming years (at least I hope so). He has the ability to coax story out of the most trivial situation and spellbind the audience in the process.<br/><br/>I also hope to see more from Abigail Breslin (Olive) who plays the charming and highly likable Little Miss Sunshine contestant. But the whole cast deserves credit for exceptional performances all around, from the suicidal Proust scholar (Uncle Frank) played by Steve Carell to the gruff but loving grandfather played by Alan Arkin.<br/><br/>This film should be required viewing for those hoping to enter the business and it easily takes my vote for the best film of 2006."

","What can I say about Little Miss Sunshine? I have not been moved by a movie in so long. Little Miss Sunshine was a full reflection on my life. The movie connected with me in a way that I had thought was no longer possible. After viewing this movie, I started to think about which character I was. Every person in my family was represented somehow in this movie. It connected with me so much, it moved me, it made me re-consider my family. Little Miss Sunshine can very well be one of the greatest movies of the year. It had comedy, but yet the characters were so deep it made you want to be able to meet them and tell them it was going to be OK. In conclusion, Little Miss Sunshine should be viewed by any person that has ever had a family."
"curlyman217","9","2","5","6 January 2007"," Amazing!
","When I first saw this movie, I was expecting it to be good, because Sundance winners always are, but to my surprise, it wasn't good...it was great! I'll admit, at some parts, I was confused whether it was a comedy or drama, because I expected it to be a comedy (how can you blame me? Steve Carell's in it!) but during the movie, I accepted the dramadey aspect of it. At parts, I'd be crying, but I can't tell now if I was crying because of sadness, or if I was crying because my sides hurt so much. Terrific performances are given by everyone in the cast. How could it not be terrifically funny with Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, and newcomer adorable- Abagail Breslin. It is not disgusting, like many comedies are, it is just heartwarming and beautiful and hilarious and terrific and winning! I highly recommend that you see this movie (maybe without the little ones)."
"gradyharp","10","2","5","21 December 2006"," 'Being a Winner is only a state of mind'
","and being a winner of a film based on so many potentially disastrous bits of black comedy works exceedingly well! As opposed to some of the movies of the recent past (Borat, American Pie, Waiting, the National Lampoon endless series, etc) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE starts with a smart script by Michael Arndt that addresses many of the highly dysfunctional family elements present in today's society and allows us to hold a few mirrors up to our own vaguely warped view of good and bad, right and wrong, ambition and self destructive delusion and makes us laugh - at times embarrassed, at times just having fun! Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris direct this odd little story of a family in Albuquerque, NM, a family comprised of a grandfather (Alan Arkin) whose 'elderly status' allows him to speak inappropriately grossly and frankly to his grandchildren while snorting coke in the bathroom; a father (Greg Kinnear, who just gets better and better) with a motivational program scheme that is melting toward failure; a mother (the extraordinary Toni Collette) who attempts to cope with her role as the matriarch of this weird group; the mother's brother (Steve Carell), a gay Proustian scholar who has just lost his job over an affair with a grad student and has survived an unsuccessful suicide attempt; a space-cadet teenage son (Paul Dano) who is in a vow of silence as he pursues Nietzsche and extracting promises for his future from his intimidated parents; and last, but most important, a chubby little sister Olive (Abigail Breslin) who dotes on Miss America pageant reruns on TV and longs to tryout for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty/talent show for little girls in Southern California.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film is a road trip which confines this very strange family in an RUV headed for the only bit of positive hope for change in Olive's ploy to become Little Miss Sunshine. Along the trip we get to know these oddballs personally and in the end the results of the family effort competition seem almost secondary to the fun of getting there. Each of the performers is at peak form in acting and the direction and pacing would be difficult to improve. The film accomplishes what comedy sets as a goal: it entertains us while allowing us to take a second look at our own foibles, and that makes for a fun and healthy outing. Highly recommended.

"isabelle1955","Null","2","5","23 November 2006"," Perfect Friday Night Movie
","I'm going to invent a new category of film. Forget Film Noir, Date Movies, Chick Flix and Romantic Comedy. Think instead Friday Night Movie.<br/><br/>The Friday Night Movie (and I'm talking here about something watched on a public cinema screen, not on the DVD at home.) is a movie which provides good entertainment without actually insulting the intelligence of the viewer. It is worth spending $10 of your hard earned cash on a ticket after a tedious week at work, but won't cause you to spend the drive home interrogating your date on who said what, where, and when, and whether your inability to follow the plot is a function of encroaching middle age. A Friday Night Movie should ¬ñ ideally ¬ñ see you leaving the movie theatre smiling not cringing. It should not be so long that you spend the last third with your legs crossed, and it should set you up for the weekend, not send you diving into the nearest pub to drown your sorrows.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is the perfect example of a classic Friday Night Movie. I loved it. Perfectly written, not a word was out of place, stylishly acted, witty and entertaining, it didn't tax my concentration too much. But I didn't have to make lame excuses for watching it either. I laughed out loud throughout most of it, and smiled wryly in many other places. My sister used to own a Volkswagon mini van very similar to the one featured in Little Miss Sunshine. An ex-German post office van, I took it on many adventures to pop festivals back in the 70's. The automatic choke possessed a mind of its own and used to suddenly stick on ""full"" - usually when you were driving down a narrow one way street in the middle of London - meaning that every so often I had to pull up abruptly on the side of the road, run around the back (rear engine) to adjust the choke, and then leap back into the driving seat before the traffic piled up too much behind me. The horn sounded JUST like the one in this movie! This movie was so well observed. I just know the writers must have owned a Volkswagon of a certain age. Possibly they bought it off my sister¬Ö..<br/><br/>The whole cast were fabulous, the characters were slightly over the top but not so far as to be utterly unbelievable. I especially loved the episode where they are wrestling Grandpa's body out of the hospital window¬Ö.. the final scene on stage at the pageant is maybe slightly too long but that's a very nit picky criticism. Great fun. I hope it makes millions for all concerned.<br/><br/>Other good Friday Night Movies I've seen over the last few months include The Devil Wears Prada (Meryl Streep was fabulous), The Queen (Helen Mirren was fabulous), Look Both Ways (everyone was fabulous) and maybe ¬ñ just maybe ¬ñ Borat, although I think the jury is still out on that one. I definitely was cringing in places during Borat. And I feel vaguely guilty at admitting how much I laughed. Especially in the first 30 minutes. <br/><br/>It's Friday tomorrow. Work will be over for the week. TGIF. I wonder what's showing at my local theatre? Probably nothing as good as Little Miss Sunshine."

","This movie actually had me howling, as I've never done before. Well, perhaps when I first saw The Producers. Alan Arkin is a comedic genius. All I have to do is look at him and I start laughing. I don't know why they don't make more movies like this. The comedy as a genre is in serious trouble in my humble opinion. This one gave me hope. Even though quite a bit of it was predictable, I still enjoyed it tremendously. All the actors did a wonderful job, but Alan Arkin is the greatest movie comedian of all time. I hope he continues to work into his dotage. Or mine, whichever comes first. I also was very impressed by Abigail Breslin's performance. Often children are the weakest link in a picture, but this kid is a natural."
"tri_mj90","9","2","5","15 November 2006"," Hilarious movie filled with depth and emotions
","This is a wonderful movie! It's so funny but still also very serious. The story itself is beautiful. The movie is held in a very normal, sort of everyday-manner, which makes the characters more believable. None of the characters try to be funny, they just are. It is the situations this family is put in that makes the movie so hilarious. Really funny awkward situations. <br/><br/>The members of this family are great. They have so much depth and they all have an emotional background that really shapes them and makes them who they are. The writers have really thought these characters through. <br/><br/>This movie has some gorgeous pictures. It has large wide pictures but the focus still remains on the story and its characters. It never becomes too much and the pictures never become too large. My absolute favorite picture is the one where Olive puts her arm around Dwayne to comfort him and the rest of the family stands in the back next to the car. There are a lot of things in the frame but the focus still remains on Olive comforting Dwayne. <br/><br/>The acting was one of the best things about this movie. There are no huge Blockbuster stars in the movie and there is no need for them either. Steve Carell (playing Frank) shows his characters pain so well. I truly felt sorry for him. Steve should play more of the serious stuff in the future because he does it so well. And Paul Dano (playing Dwayne) does not say a word through half the movie he just uses his face and body to express his feelings. The first scene where he speaks is the scene where he finds out that he cannot fly because he is colorblind. His anger and frustration and sorrow are just excellent acting. Both Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin (playing Olive) are really good at making it look believable when they cry. Amazing actors!<br/><br/>All in all a real funny movie that is also filled with lots of depth and wisdom. A stunningly emotional beautiful movie that makes you laugh and cry."

","I really loved this movie. As a film student it was a great reminder of why one goes through all the hard work to create something that only lasts, at most, a couple hours and which you submit to constant judgment; it's for the chance to create something like this. Nothing is perfect, which is why I didn't give it a 10, but I highly recommend this film. <br/><br/>There's the frustration and tension created by the family and their own failures, but there isn't the usual dragging out of each unhappy moment; just like the family this film is constantly moving. The resolution at the end is realistic (at least for this family) and fitting. I left the theater and smiled all the way home, not because everything was going to be alright in their world, but because there was a feeling of peace at the end of the film. <br/><br/>While this film focuses a lot on the family, the center truly is Olive, Little Miss Sunshine. I am usually disappointed with how children's parts are written and/or acted but I was thoroughly impressed by her work and the part. There's a lot about this film that I'm sure I missed the first time around, and I can't wait to see this film again."

I cared for all the family, no matter how different they were. This was partly due to the terrific performances from everyone, especially Greg Kinnear, Steve Carrell and Abigail Breslin. These actors will definitely be in the run for an Oscar nod. The script is funny, sad and very witty. It was different to most other ""roadtrip/dysfunctional family"" movies, it had heart and a surprising ending (for me anyway).<br/><br/>The story is about the Hoover family who all take a roadtrip cross-country to enter little Olive (Abigail Breslin) into a beauty contest. Along the way they have a few problems that are funny and sad (they may seem clich√©d but they are definitely done well).<br/><br/>I must say this film is my favourite of the year.

"Chris_Docker","8","2","5","29 August 2006"," Outstanding comedy that also asks serious social questions
","No-one talks about the more outrageous side of family life - we pretend it doesn't exist, as if families are somehow just 'naturally happy' together. Yet it is in the strains and stresses of family life, surrounded by a deep notion of tolerance and underlying love even when you can't stand each other, that the closenesses, the true values of family are born.<br/><br/>""Instead of making a movie about family values, we wanted to make a film about the value of family."" Little Miss Sunshine Directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris say they are frustrated by the ""ridiculous notion of the nuclear family,"" which has become so prevalent in the US and the UK.<br/><br/>The family of Little Miss Sunshine (which is the pageant title of the youngest member, Olive) is pulling apart at the seams. Dad / Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a hopelessly optimistic motivational speaker, trying to market his ""Nine Steps to Success"" and also forcing it on his family at every opportunity. His Nietzsche-reading son, Dwayne, has taken a vow of silence until he gets into Air Force Academy. 'Pro-honesty' mother (Toni Collette) is constantly harried by her families eccentricities and secrets, especially after her brother Frank comes to live with them, a Proust scholar straight out of hospital for attempting suicide after being jilted by his gay lover. Into the mix comes Granddad Alan Arkin, a foul-mouthed hedonist, kicked out of retirement home for snorting heroin.<br/><br/>Olive, the speccy, unlikely-looking and eponymous would-be beauty-queen, throws the family into turmoil when suddenly awarded a default place in the competition as someone else drops out. In one of the most unusual road trips ever, the family travel to the pageant through tragedy and comedy and a finale that will change the way they see themselves and make us ask questions about our own values and ideals.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a hilarious comedy with a refreshing honesty and ability for self-examination rarely found in mainstream movies. As it began, I though, ""not my kind of movie - kids? Road trip? Light comedy? No way!"" But soon I laughed till I cried, in spite of myself, and I also felt quite moved. Little Miss Sunshine works very well as a comedy, a side-splitting celebration of human eccentricities, but there are also deeper issues that can be explored through the film. The pacing is excellent (I waited many a scene to see the end of the slogan on Dwaye's T-shirt that begins, ""Jesus was . . . ""). How are the ideas of Nietzsche (Man and Superman) going to coalesce with those of Proust (a loser that spent 20 years writing a book hardly anyone wanted to read, but is regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language?) So many puzzles, so many excellently honed laughs.<br/><br/>Director Valerie Faris helps me make sense of it: ""I have to credit the writer for putting all those things together. His (Michael Arndt's) brother is a literary scholar; so much of that character (Frank) came from him. But the thing I love about all these characters is that they all have a dream, a universe they've built, and it makes them bigger than the clich√©d characters. Frank has a life you can imagine reading Proust, he was very much in his head, it was an intellectual life, and his challenge is a family where there isn't much intellectual discussion going on. He's brought right down to earth, so it's that distance that he has to travel that is the major thing.<br/><br/>""Nietzsche's idea of transcending, for the teenager, who feels trapped in the mundane existence of suburban family life - it just shows that he's longing for something more. All these characters, they were passionate, full of longing. Just that they are reading Nietzsche or Proust tells you something."" The individual aspirations of the characters - and how they are so far apart - are one of the charismatic things about the film. Co-director, Jonathan Dayton adds: ""It's their passion, their aspiration. That's what we loved about them. Whether you have an innate interest in Nietzsche or Proust, what's most important is the fact that you're engaged; you're seeking greater answers and reaching to understand life in a new way: then to see their hopes dashed in so many ways, and to understand what endures after failure or disappointment. They have a world that is bigger than the immediate story."" I asked if it helped that all the family were pretty intelligent people, quite articulate. ""These are all smart people, but I think it's that notion of emotional intelligence. They are all passionate, and in that passion they recognise fellow travellers, even though Frank and Richard are as far from one another as you could ever be, but they are both passionate about their pursuits."" Whether you see Little Miss Sunshine just with the adults in your family or group, or watch it on DVD with younger family, it is a valuable and hugely entertaining film that has some beautiful emotions under the shouting. Don't be put off by the trailer, which is not very well made and doesn't give an idea of the film.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine took five years to make and will be delighting audiences for much longer than that into the future. It may help America reconsider the slightly worrying practice of beauty pageants for tiny tots, but it is an awesome social comment on the value of families while we are being laughing uncontrollably into our popcorn."
"barret-newman","10","2","5","28 August 2006"," A ""Modest winner""
","In an age of Wedding Crashers, 40 Year Old Virgins, and Talledega Nights, it's refreshing to see an intelligent comedy from which we get the sense that the players didn't have more fun making it than we do watching it.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a ""Modest Winner"" (the New Yorker) that takes the paradigm of a dysfunctional family to it's limit. Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) is the Dad who's too wrapped up in the world of his own 9 step program to realize that family problems do extend beyond the reach of his self-help pyramid. Alan Arkin plays Richard's dad, the Heroin addict recently kicked out of his assisted living community, and dance coach to 7 year old Olive (Abigail Breslin), the family's pageant-winning daughter. Olive's brother, Dwayne, is a 15 year old Nietzche disciple who has taken a vow of silence until he is admitted to the Air Force academy (is it just me, or does the combination of Nietzche and the Air Force not seem to match?) Holding the family together, or at least trying to, is the wife/mother/realist (Toni Collette) who will stop at nothing to at least put a bucket of chicken on the table. Her brother Frank (Steve Carell), is a suicidal academic and the nation's leading Proust scholar recently taken in by the family.<br/><br/>While all this might seem like a cinematic recipe for disaster (a la most other road trip movies), the script works, and the actors, particularly Arkin and Carell, deliver. The family piles into the old VW Microbus (of course) and heads off for the Little Miss Sunshine competition in California, and the movie gets rolling. Kinnear is the epitome of the self-involved Dad, and even the physical humor of the movie is not crass, but remains fairly creative. The movie is beset by some heavier emotional content at times, but these moments are not cheap, and do a nice job of adding to the films sincerity. It's nice to see a comedy the doesn't rely on Vince Vaughan or the Wilson brothers for laughs, and that targets an audience other than hormone-rich high-schoolers. Little Miss Sunshine, a refreshing independent comedy, is for sure a ""Modest Winner."""

"ClaytonDavis","10","2","5","6 August 2006"," Little Miss Sunshine
","Little Miss Sunshine The funniest film of the year is here with its dark humor and subtle undertones, first time writer Michael Arndt has created six people that in some way, you can find a bit of yourself in. The film is so crowd pleasing and hilariously funny that you can't help but want to be a part of this dysfunctional and at times inappropriate family. Each character is carrying their own baggage and personal flaws that make you sympathize and empathize with them. The head of the family, Richard, played by Greg Kinnear is a failed motivational speaker and invests a large sum of money into his ""Nine Step Program"" to being a winner. He is at many times unlikable and completely uprooting. His ball and chain is the never disappointing Toni Collette who plays Sheryl, the backbone of the family who supports her children in every decision and dream they have. She is the true heart and soul of the family and empathetic in her thoughts and words. Next in the lineup is Grandpa rendered brilliantly by Alan Arkin. Grandpa is a rebellious older man who has developed a drug habit and gives many words of ""wisdom"" to the family. We also meet the infamous and mysterious Dwayne whom has taken a vow of silence in order to achieve his next goal. He has dreams of joining the Air Force and flying a jet and gets many laughs through facial expressions and mannerisms. And lastly is the angelic and innocent, Olive; she's precious, guiltless, na√Øve, curious and exciting. She is one of the most notoriously beautiful characters in cinematic history. You fall in love with her and not only because of her ""cute as a button"" persona but for her genuine love for life, dreams and most importantly her family.<br/><br/>The true beauty of the film is in its simplicity because in that, you find all the vulnerability in each character and find an immaculate motion picture. The depth of the film can't be explained in words but in its experience and emotions that follow. Each aspect of the film is effortlessly practical but initially multifarious. This film is living proof that two minds are better than one because the two directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris engaged themselves in each personality and technical quality. The cinematography is always soothing and utterly attractive. The time spent in the VW bus never feels like motion sickness and you feel like a passenger yourself just observing the lives unfold. The score of the film helps bring certain scenes to life and makes the movie that much more touching. The editing also goes with soft transitions and smooth operating.<br/><br/>From the opening scene of dinner at the table you are locked up and don't dare to blink thanks to these actors. The performances are picture perfect and each actor offers something remarkable to their role respectively. Greg Kinnear's 'father-role' is definitely the least liked throughout the film but his character's transformation into a loose, loving father and wife is portrayed ideally thanks to Kinnear. He is without a doubt a lead and should be pushed in that category but unfortunately he doesn't have enough emotional depth to find his way to a top five. Globe consideration is needed and undeniably inevitable with the laughs he brings. The great and underrated Toni Collette is the backbone of the family and adds on another car to her train of terrific performances. She is also a co-lead and should also be pushed in that category. The Best Actress category has been weak for a few years running and this year seems no different except for Kate Winslet and maybe Ashley Judd and she can make her way into the finale and come back to a ceremony that she's been missed at for 7 years. Academy Award nominee Alan Arkin is hands down funniest player of the cast. Unfortunately his screen time is minimal but he is a veteran and if the Academy feels compelled to bring one to the ceremony he can be it. Grandpa is vulgar, comedic and completely smitten by his beautiful granddaughter Olive. He coaches Olive for the pageant and gives her pep talks that could bring the coldest heart to room temperature. Steve Carrel is the gay brother of Sheryl, Frank whom recently attempted to commit suicide because of job-loss, broken heart and social status deterioration. With his career going as greatly as it has he could find himself as the Thomas Haden Church of the year but with a better name. I could foresee both Carrel and Arkin both making it. Paul Dano is the most simple of the group and fortunately this will be the stepping stone for him to step off of into serious and thought-provoking roles. Dwayne is tortured, complex and witty and Dano shows it easily. The best in show honors is awarded to the beautiful and lovely Abigail Breslin can be this year's Freddie Highmore. She deserves many accolades but the Academy is extremely flakey with rewarding young child performers. Olive has all the things going for her to go to the Oscars. She has her scene of brilliance, her lovable persona, a pretty good resume of films and the best thing, she's adorable. The fact that she sticks out among these brilliant veteran, Oscar nominated performers is miraculous.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" could very well be the ""Sideways"" of the year plowing its way into a best picture nomination along with realistic nominations for Arkin, Carrel and Breslin. I feel this film will be battling Guillermo Arriaga from ""Babel"" and Emilio Estevez for ""Bobby"" for the Original Screenplay award at the 2007 ceremony. I can't choose and I don't even want to think about it yet. ""Sunshine"" brings much light into your heart and is without a doubt the most uplifting, feel-good movie of the year.<br/><br/>Grade: ****/****"
"polar24","5","3","10","22 January 2007"," Ridiculously laughable characters on a flimsy plot
","With so much buzz surrounding this film at the moment, I thought that I might be worthwhile to write my review which I had initially put off my review because my first impressions of the film were not favourable. However in light of the escalating buzz and recent PGA win, I thought it may prove valuable in hindsight before the Oscars next month.<br/><br/>The independent American film has grown prodigiously in the last 10 years and more so gaining popularity at the box office and critical acclaim. Most recently, we saw Sideways and Lost in Translation both being nominated for Picture in 2004 and at last year's surprising outcome, the films nominated for the major awards were mainly independent films.<br/><br/>This heavily character driven (and thin and flimsy plotted) film follows one quirky estranged family, cross the country in a mini-bus to get their idealistic young daughter (the antithesis of a Barbie doll) to a beauty pageant. The 5 principals in this story each have great character flaws: one is an egotistical self-help coach blind-sighted by his idea of the perfect family; the troubled outcast teen who hates his parents, the cranky and bitter war veteran, the aforementioned innocent ambitious daughter who dares to dream; and the wife who is the bread and butter (failing) to keep it all together.<br/><br/>The film is set-up primarily as a comedy with these quirky characters finding themselves in ridiculous situations all stuck together in one eclectic yellow mini-van, but there are (apparently) moments of comedy including the nauseating screaming vulgar grandfather, the whines of the depressing misunderstood teenager and several encounters with implausible policemen, service-stations and motorway drivers.<br/><br/>The story fails for me because (for any film) we should at least identify with he characters and given what develops in the story, we should feel enough to care for them by the film's climax. I found each of the characters one-dimensional, clich√©d and a such a parody of themselves that I just didn't care.<br/><br/>Plus the fact that they spend most of the film moping about themselves, screaming and acting only aggressive towards one another. By the film's end, nothing really changed for them; sure it might have a have had a happy note but I wondering what was the point? Did they learn anything? They will probably wake up the next day crawling around the house lamenting their existence.<br/><br/>The script and direction by this husband and wife team was nothing particularly special, it tells the story adequately but brings nothing unique to the genre which has been told many times. Insert quirky kooky music and you have a film that attempts to tell a touching story on the unpredictability life and it's lighter side yet fails because the glaring implausibilities and plot-holes ultimately sink the ship.<br/><br/>This film is trying to be funny and important but only ends up being an embarrassing joke about the absurd and laughably inane characters. Despite the puzzling buzz, I dearly and audaciously hope this will not make an appearance at the forthcoming Oscars ¬ñ with stupid story lines and pitiful characters, it's clearly out of it's depth among the more thoughtful refined films of this season.<br/><br/>EDIT: After considering the Oscar noms I'm not surprised at the acclaim it's received. However it will be difficult to make it without a director nom. The film sticks out in a crowd of distinguished films like a bright boisterous yellow mini-van. Despite my rant, I glad I caught the film that many months ago to see what the fuss is all about. I hope I won't be disappointed again come Feb."
"howard.schumann","7","3","10","21 January 2007"," Comedy is forced and the plot implausible
","In real life dysfunctional families can cause immense pain to their children which may last a lifetime. In the movies, however, dysfunctional families are just eccentric rogues who, beneath their harsh exterior, can be as lovable as puppy dogs. No matter how dysfunctional they appear at the beginning, we sense that by the end of the movie, they will be dancing in a circle. Case in point ¬ñ Little Miss Sunshine, a heartwarming Indie comedy by first time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris which has received much critical acclaim. The film is a funny and entertaining romp which tackles America's obsession with winning and, in the process, targets crass pre-teen beauty pageants, motivational speakers, moody teenagers, emotionally unstable professors, and cantankerous old men.<br/><br/>While its heart is in the right place, its bullets are mostly scatter-shot, only occasionally hitting their targets and the film does not develop its ideas to the point where they have a hard edge. The dysfunctional family in question is the Hoovers (a Kentucky Fried Chicken in every pot?) whose home is in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The family all strive for something beyond their reach in pursuit of happiness in a society that bestows no garlands for second place. Like any good television sitcom, each character is molded to type and fits neatly into the film's message. Richard, the father (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker without anyone to motivate.<br/><br/>The opening of the film shows him giving his lecture that he calls ""Nine Steps to Success"" to a half-empty classroom (he might say it was half full). Sheryl (Toni Collette) is the long-suffering matriarch of the family who tries to pick up the pieces after her brother Frank (Steve Carell), a scholar of French writer Marcel Proust, fails in a suicide attempt after being given the boot by his gay lover who happens to be a student. The moody teenager Dwayne (Paul Dano) hasn't talked to anyone in a year and has vowed to remain silent until he is accepted in the Air Force Academy. Why an iconoclastic young man who reads Nietzsche would want to sign up for the U.S. military is one of those incongruities that will be better left to others to explain.<br/><br/>The center of the film, however, deals with seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin), a sweet but plain and not too attractive young lady with a pot belly who wants to become a beauty queen and her relationship with Grandpa (Alan Arkin), a lecherous cynic. When Olive places second in a beauty contest and the winner has to vacate her title because she took diet pills, the little girl begins eligible to compete in the national ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest in Redondo Beach, California. The film then becomes the road trip from hell as the family packs into their broken down VW bus running on two gears with contrived breakdowns in each character's life. Little Miss Sunshine reaches its maximum impact, however, at the beauty pageant where the directors show us overly sexualized children who strut their stuff and grotesquely parade in front of admiring family members in their pursuit of the American dream.<br/><br/>Quite hilarious is the pasty-faced emcee who sings America the Beautiful into the children's ears. While the energy of the direction and excellence of the acting produces sympathy for the appealing characters, the comedy is at times so forced and its plot so implausible that even the excellent ensemble cast cannot save it. Little Miss Sunshine has a ""subversive"" feel to it and it correctly hints that intention is the key ingredient in achieving your goal, yet ultimately it is a pretty safe and comfortable ride and its message that winning isn't everything and losing has its rewards feels shopworn to the point of banality."

"Quinoa1984","8","3","11","11 August 2006"," definitely worth seeing, it's dark, quirky, and well acted in equal measure
","Sometimes I feel pretty uneasy about putting a certain label or name that might be attributed to independent comedy/dramas. But if there's any that can be used for Little Miss Sunshine, directed by husband/wife Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris- it's quirky. This is not necessarily a bad thing to say, and in fact this is a good tragic-comedy. But it also puts some limits on what can be done with the material. The script by Michael Ardnt creates his characters to fit into a kind of box that gives the actors playing them to give it some juice, though it's also only so much. There's some decent, sometimes very funny, comedy mined here, but it's actually the more dramatic, sadder points that ring truer in the material. The directors don't get in the way much of what the script/actors do, and it turns out to not be anything very special, but it has the charms that would not be found in most other Hollywood fare.<br/><br/>It's probably the cast anyway, not the story, and the possibilities in the roles that make it worthwhile. Alan Arkin as the crude, foul-mouthed, drug addicted grandfather possibly is my favorite, as he gives his funniest performance in a long time, probably to rank with his best. And Steve Carell gives more to add to his current streak of becoming more than just a great comic talent- his acting is the best side of the dramatic coin as the anguished gay ex-professor who tried u-successfully to commit suicide. Some of his scenes ring the harshest in the film. But also there's Greg Kinnear as the driven, un-yielding father of the house who has his '9-step' program but still can't get his life together. Only little Olive (the talented young Abigail Breslin) and her mute-by-choice angsty-teen brother (Paul Dano), have real goals they want to achieve. But by the end of their journey, all things wont quite be the same again (as case may be with this kind of indie quasi-formula).<br/><br/>In fact Little Miss Sunshine could be the true independent-film equivalent of National Lampoon's Vacation. The same vulgar humor here is not totally absent, but given a more realistic coating with the wacky antics that befall them (i.e. a certain dead body, a mission to reach at all costs, a rickety, dangerous car, etc). It's a shame then that there is only so much that the actors can do with the material. The script is content enough to assign each character a particular, interesting trait, and only so much is done to make each character really rounded. Some of this really does click, like Dwayne's breakdown on the side of the road, or the final performance from Olive contrasted with the rest of the beauty pageant. Good points are made, but there's always a certain sense of un-reality working too. It's hard to explain, and it will definitely be a subjective call for anyone checking it out. It might reach some more, like as if it's this year's American Beauty. For me, Little Miss Sunshine is a welcome addition for this month's crop of movies, and as a family drama it has some memorable scenes."

","I bought this film recently on DVD and loved it. It's not my favourite movie of 2006 but I enjoyed the film. One of the reasons I bought the film was Alan Arkin (who I fancied in Wait Until Dark which was released years before Little Miss Sunshine) I thought Alan was great in the film and one of the best characters. I found Richard(Greg Kinnear) annoying. I was disappointed that the Grandad (Alan Arkin) died halfway through the film, the film was a bit duller when he died. It's great that Alan Arkin won the Best Supporting Actor at the Bafta's and the other awards the film has won.

","Where as some indie films as of late have banked on the common techniques of the genre and fall back to the comedy that was edgy at the turn of the millennium; we find that is pleasantly untrue of LMS. The story documents an obscure family road trip in a beat up VW bus with a slew of talented actors. The three really outstanding performances were delivered (in my opinion) by Carell, Dano and Breslin. Steve Carell brings a great amount of darkness and depth to the role of Frank, Olive's suicidal gay uncle. We finally get to see a newer, wittier side of the actor that thus far has relied on outlandish comedy to get laughs. He gains sort of a strange friendship with Paul Dano's equally dark Dwanye. Dano is magical the first half of the movie using little but a pen and facial expression. Once his vow of silence is broken, we are greeted with dialog that does great justice to the once silenced character. Breslin splashes onto the screen with a stunning innocence and provides a great centerpiece for the tale. I had high expectations for her in this film as I loved her performance in Shyamalan's ""Signs"", and I must say that my expectations were more then pleasantly met. this is yet another testament to the fact that she is far a head of her years...not to mention her underwhelming brother, Spencer Breslin. The relationship between the whole family unit is fantastic and feels generally unforced.<br/><br/>One of the greatest features of LMS is that both it's dramatic and comedic moments feel so natural. The well-scripted story earns it's big moments rather then forcing them down the audiences throat. This movie evokes a wide range of emotion so fluently. During the film you feel like you are watching a well-done documentary, but afterward you walk away with the general knowledge that you just watched a well executed film in every sense of the term.<br/><br/>I think LMS is going to big contender around Oscar time after already snagging many accolades. The biggest of which I feel is the Producers Guild Award. LMS took home an award that normally is an easy get for the big-budget flicks such as ""The Departed"" as producers know what it takes to put together a film of that magnitude.<br/><br/>On the whole I loved this movie and it is definitely one of my favorite films. of all time.

"BloodMunch","9","2","6","18 January 2007"," Clear 3 act structure

This act is short.<br/><br/>Act II: We go on the adventure. This is the longest act and it is like the classic ""Candide"" or ""Peer Gynt"" type episodic structure, one mishap after another, going from one place to another attempting to reach the destination.<br/><br/>Act: III: We arrive at the destination and the true of the situation which had before this been idealized is now revealed. And here the inner strength of each of the characters is called to task. And, we are resolved.<br/><br/>I love it.<br/><br/>And as a side note I have to sing the praises of Steve Carrell whom I was lucky enough to see when he was performing in Chicago at The Second City (obviously I live in Chicago). He was amazing. He played a friendly psychopathic killer in one scene and it was so funny. I also saw a musical with him in it about a detective and he played five or six different characters including a Mafioso similar to Sonny Corleone and a brain damaged but sweet hit man heavy. He sang and danced and was wonderful, and even then my family said ""that actor is going to be a star one day"".<br/><br/>For me Carrell made the film but at the same time he blended in perfectly with the others and did not steal the show."

Steve Carell comes out of his short-lived goofy-funny character typecast to deliver the only suiting performance as Frank, the suicidal genius uncle, who so happens to be gay as well. Little Olive is as cute and lovable as any character in recent years and Collette and Kinnear pass well as the feuding parents. Dwayne, Olive's older brother, played lawfully by The Girl Next Door's Paul Dano, is an anger-ridden teen who has pledged a vow of silence until he's achieved his goal of becoming an Air Force test pilot. The funniest, and most vulgar, moments, however, come by way of the foul-mouthed Grandpa, who moved in with his son and daughter-in-law after being kicked out of his retirement home for snorting heroin. This bundle of misfits we know as the Hoover family travel cross-country to enter Olive in a pre-pubescent beauty pageant called Little Miss Sunshine, though on the way are plagued by hilarious misfortune and tragic loss. By film's end, the moral is simple and clear: no matter your troubles, family ¬ñ- even the weirdos that construct the Hoovers ¬ñ- can help one overcome all broken hopes and delicate fears, with the love only a family can give."

","Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) is runner-up in a children's beauty pageant called 'Little Miss Sunshine', and has been invited to the pageant's finals in California. Determined to see her perform, Olive's family all pile into a VW bus and make the long journey¬Ö. Olive's father Richard (Greg Kinnear), the motivational speaker who is waiting to hit it big with his 'nine step program', her blunt mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence until he takes his aviation exam and has communicated by writing on a note-pad for the past eight months. Also tagging along is Olive's beauty pageant coach, and heroin-addict grandfather (Alan Arkin) and uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) who was released from hospital 24 hours ago after a botched suicide attempt brought about when he lost his student lover to the man who has also stripped him of his title as the number one Proust scholar in the country. <br/><br/>'Little Miss Sunshine' is the first full-length feature film for husband and wife director's Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who are best known for directing music videos. This is also screen-writer Michael Arndt's first film. The fact that this film has been created by 'fresh-blood' in Hollywood is obvious in the film's extremely fresh take on an old concept: family road-trip. <br/><br/>While publicity for the film has hyped it up as a laugh-out-loud comedy, a notion aided by the presence of Steve Carrell who has hit the big time since completing 'Little Miss Sunshine' with 'The 40 year old virgin' and his lead role in the U.S smash-hit TV show 'The Office'; this film is not as hilarious as I am sure some movie-goers assume it to be. It is a very, very dark comedy, which occasionally slips in a few easy laughs but ultimately finds it's best moments in the more serious scenes, exploring grim issues. This is a fantastically quirky film which will find viewers falling in love with this family of misfits and freaks, and secretly wishing our more ordinary relatives were just as peculiar. As one would expect, the film's conclusion comes at the 'Little Miss Sunshine' beauty pageant. The finale is very much hyped up and delivers, two-fold. The ending at the pageant is exactly the kind of finish that will leave you completely satisfied. <br/><br/>At times, because I was expecting more humor thanks to the film's publicity and hype, I was a little disappointed at the sometimes far and few laughs¬Ö. But, eventually letting go of expectation and anticipation, I found myself totally falling in love with this film. Steve Carrell was the stand-out for me, especially since this was a very different character for him, so far from the awkward virgin or hyper squirrel¬Ö Steve seems to have become a celebrity overnight, and while he is thus far best known for his comedic work, with 'Little Miss Sunshine' he has managed to do what Bill Murray with 'Lost in Translation', Jim Carrey in 'The Truman show' and Robin Williams in 'Good Will Hunting' took years to do, and that is reach critical as well as commercial acclaim. The other two stand-outs for me are the always brilliant Alan Arkin as the heroin-addicted grandfather who imparts gross and brilliant wisdom, and Paul Dano as the silently suffering teenager. <br/><br/>This really is an amazing film: it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for me at least, it is going down as a favorite."
"frodo_the_sting-2","10","2","6","19 September 2006"," BEST movie of the year!
","As far as I'm concerned, this is by far the best movie of the year! I'll put it in categories: <br/><br/>Acting: This, to me, was the best acted out movie all year. You actually felt like they were a dysfunctional family. Steve Corell was excellent, as always. But this time around, hes more serious than comic (unlike his past roles, Anchorman, 40 Year Old Virgin). I stress his acting, because i truly think it deserves an Oscar for best supporting role. Along with him, the acting from Greg Kinnear and Paul Dano was very convincing.<br/><br/>Story: Simple, not complicated. I love those, i think they are good for the brain to take a break from, like movies like the Da Vinci Code. It's a super simple plot outline, trying to get to the Little Miss Sunchine competition.<br/><br/>Effect: This is what comedy should be. The humor isn't cheap, it is very well thought out and genius. That is what i call the effect of this movie, Genius. The comedy is a breath of fresh air from the recent ""comedies"". The drama side of the movie, is also very touching. You really feel for the characters.<br/><br/>Sum up: This, as i said above, is one of the best, if not THE best, movies i've seen all summer and all year. Between Steve Corrells outstanding performance, the acting of the other characters, the comedy, the drama and the all around ""feel good"" feeling when you come out, is why i give this movie a 10 out of 10! <br/><br/>NOTE: There is some heavy language. At the most, around 30 F-words, and some sexual and crude dialogue (mainly by the grandfather)."

","This movie is preposterous on many levels but it is also great fun -- laugh out loud funny in many sequences. Alan Arkin as Grandpa absolutely owns this movie but every single member of the dysfunctional family turns in creditable performances. While there is one major plot line, the script also contains numerous subplots, which might be distracting but which have been managed carefully into a hilarious whole. I saw this with friends at the American Film Institute house in Silver Spring, MD, which attracts a very sophisticated audience. Everyone seemed to have enjoyed it as much as we did. I know nothing about the script writer or the directors but I'll stand in line to see anything they produce in coming years."

","This is the winningest comedy so far this year, with clearly defined oddball characters, unexpected but witty plot turns and lots of laughs that turn an ordinary storyline into a superb film about a dysfunctional family going on a two-day road trip in a beat-up yellow VW van to enter their young daughter in a vapid ""little miss sunshine"" contest that goes hilariously awry in grand, satiric detail. Every actor is excellent, the writing is clever, economical and accurate for each of these characters, and the settings are perfect in every scene. My wife and I haven't laughed so long and often at a movie in years, and hope this becomes an Oscar contender--it deserves at least that much! Highly recommended--the ending reminded me of the equally satirical ""Best of Show""."
"WolfHai","10","2","6","27 August 2006"," Great Fun--Even If You Are Over 40
","I give it 10 out of 10, not because it is the greatest movie ever, but because in this genre, namely the not-stupid-comedy, it is simply perfect. And you can enjoy it even when you are over 40. I, and the people next to me (many of them real adults!), laughed all through the movie. There was even some applause at the end (and this was not Caracas, Venezuela, but Boulder, Colorado). It is laughter that (I think) you do not have to be ashamed of: You do not laugh because people are denigrated or humiliated (as in so many other movies, which, in my brain, leave a bad aftertaste), but because, well, because things are simply funny.<br/><br/>By the way, I do not think that the R rating is justified. The ""sexual content"" was basically limited to the f-word, and maybe someone who does not know what cocaine is would be slightly surprised. But the movie is not sleazy, and the drug use (which does not play a big role anyway) is not glorified, neither in the positive nor in the negative sense. But beware, I am German, and German sensitivities are slightly different from the Americans'.<br/><br/>I don't want to tell you anything about the story or the characters, as the less you know, the more you discover for yourself and the more fun you'll have. Go, take your spouse along, and, if the f-word does not shock you (or your kid--well, your kid probably less than you anyway), take your 13- or 14-year-old along too. A real feel-good movie!"

"bababear","10","2","6","26 August 2006"," I'm Sore from Laughing
","Since this is an independent film (whatever that means) I really didn't expect the belly laughs that this delivers. And it's got heart. It's about a group of people related by blood and living together who learn to be a family.<br/><br/>On the surface it would seem to be a spin off of The Simpsons. Dope sniffing foul mouthed grandpa. Dad who's trying to make it as a motivational speaker. Mom who's trying to hold the whole thing together. Brother who's an elective mute. Uncle who's a suicidal gay academic. And, at the heart of things, a kind and innocent little girl who dreams of winning the Little Miss Sunshine kiddie beauty contest.<br/><br/>If you didn't know that these things are real, the beauty contest would make you think that the film's writers are on crack. There are eleven girls who look like Barbies and Bratz come to life. These children, who look like thirty year old midgets who've lived hard, are horrifying. Worse yet, the girls playing them really perform in these travesties. Chubby little Olive is the only one on the stage who looks like a human being. And her dance routine is, well, definitely different.<br/><br/>Last weekend I saw and hugely enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS. In the final analysis, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has even more laughs for your buck. This is a prize. Enjoy."

"vertigo_14","10","2","6","14 August 2006"," Casting sunshine upon life's poignant miseries. (spoilers)
","There are several films which pompously proclaim to be the ""cultural event of the decade"" (Pirates of the Caribbean 2) or the movie that ""defines a generation"" (Step Up). And, amidst another year of, it seems, one horrible Hollywood production after another, Little Miss Sunshine stands out. It is one of the best films to be produced for the mainstream this year. A subjective opinion, sure, but it has been a long time since a theater audience has been so diverse and more importantly, reactive, in their movie-going experience, generating laughs throughout the film and at the end, applause.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine should also be commended for a willingness to break free of much of the cookie cutter style of film-making that much of Hollywood (and a large sector of the independent sphere) has been reduced to these days, spitting out one piece of nonsense after the next. It does take a common theme -- that of a world trying so hard to sustain this outrageous semblance of ""normal"" and ""perfection"" that it seems that tragedy is inevitable for all who are unable to live up to its standards. Normal and perfection is a myth. And this has been repeated ad nausea in depressing dramas like 'Imaginary Heroes' and 'The Ice Storm,' among others (why always set this theme in the 1970s when it clearly applies to today?). But, rather than deliver another story of depressing and relentless misery upon our characters, this film offers an opportunity to laugh at everything about it even in the slightest details even though things never seem to bid well for our characters. It seems to approach things with more humor and light-heartedness, too, than say 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' which is really a sad form of mockery in that it will make you laugh only because the characters are so off-the-wall. But that's wherein their humor lies--as an oddity. That doesn't quite happen here.<br/><br/>The story centers on seven year old Olive (played wonderfully by Abigail Breslin). A cute kid who aspires to compete (and win) the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. A chubby, optimistic kid (a real kid, if you will), she doesn't seem like pageant material (and some of the pageant competitors are freakish rather than beautiful and hardly look suitable for seven and eight years old). But, her opportunity to compete seems to come at an inconvenient moment. Her uncle Frank (Steve Carrel) recently attempted suicide and is now living with his sister (Toni Collett) who is on the brink of divorce from her motivational speaker husband (Greg Kinnear) who is riding everything on a business deal to promote his 9-step program. Their teenage son (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence as an homage to Nitchze. And their grandfather (played well by Alan Arkin) is a heroin addict. It seems that for everyone, all that they aspire will eventually come crashing down around them, but in a strange (or really, outrageous) way, it is this goal of struggling to get to this Little Miss Sunshine competition that will force them to reevaluate things.<br/><br/>A wonderful film and probably the best I've seen all year. Perhaps its success will inspire some filmmakers to become more daring and creative (or at least, where they already are, for others to invest in that innovative style and substance)."

","If you know someone who didn't like Little Miss Sunshine, you should not be friends with them. Seriously. It is the most enjoyable movie I have seen in a long time. The cast is great, and everyone performs at the top of their game. Greg Kinnear proves that he is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. Steve Carrell takes on a new type of role, and comes through with a subtle, textured performance. And then there's Alan Arkin, whose portrayal of Grandpa is destined to be talked about and quoted for years. The offbeat humor and the pace of the movie reminded me at times of Fargo and even of Spellbound, but is definitely its own movie and it is unlike any American movie I have seen in a while."

","Little Miss Sunshine is a brilliant movie with a great,however very depressing and emotional storyline and a fantastic cast that suit their roles perfectly.I don't think Alan Arkin deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role,he was good in it,but he was barely in it and I definitely didn't consider his performance Oscar worthy.I think that Steve Carell should have at least been nominated,I know hes usually in comedies,but e plays his character brilliantly all the way through and I was much more concerned for him rather than Alan Arkin's character,he was definitely snubbed.If your a fan of drama movies,but also like when there's plenty of comedy,you'll definitely enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Olive,a young girl who's dream is to become a pageant girl,heads off cross-country with her family to be in a popular pageant,but the journey causes a lot of drama and conflict with her already unhappy family."
"My_Pet_Mongoose","7","1","2","15 June 2013"," Quirky and Sweet Comedy-Drama
","I quite enjoyed this film. It felt more like a novel than a movie with its complex characters and their changing attitudes of one another. The material is nuanced and handled with deftness by the directors and the excellent cast. The filmmakers had enough trust in their actors (and the audience) to leave a lot of the characterizations to simple looks and fleeting expressions. Such restraint goes a long way towards softening and humanizing otherwise over-the-top characters and is welcome indeed.<br/><br/>Arkin is great in a showy, easy role. Kinnear--perhaps the one with the biggest arc--underplays nicely. Dano conveys much with expression and body language. Breslin doesn't hit any of those false line-readings so common in child actors and seems completely genuine and adorable. Carrell has the most complex role and plays it with a soulful conviction that, unfortunately, he rarely gets asks to do anymore. Collette has the thankless, underwritten Mom-role but brings such life and emotion to it that you're sold. Even the bit parts are well cast with famous faces and each does an excellent job inhabiting a fully realized character in the few minutes of screen time they're given.<br/><br/>I could have used a bit more humor, a bit more heft to the plot, and perhaps a bit more resolution. But these are ultimately quibbles. The movie finds its quirky sweet spot early and stays there all the way to the end--to entertaining effect."

"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","30 November 2011"," The inspirational effect of ""Rocky"" combined with the irresistible charm of an early-season Simpson episode ...
","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is one of these unexpected gems like only Cinema can produce and definitely, one of the most defining and endearing films of the last decade. <br/><br/>I so would have loved to see the independent-spirited underdog win over the conveniently acclaimed Scorsese's ""The Departed"" but 30 years after ""Rocky"", times have changed, and there's no place for 'little' movies anymore. But since I learned one thing from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is to see the bright side of life, I'm confident that in 30 years, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" will be regarded as an immortal classics with the same appeal than ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""Back to the Future"" and the picture of the family running and jumping in the yellow Peugeot van as one of the most iconic of American cinema ¬Ö <br/><br/>When Family films were reduced to a bunch of sappy moralizing dramas or brainless comedies where kids outsmart the parents, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" resurrected the genre with a sweet, touching and intelligent comedy-drama involving a dysfunctional but united family, the Hoovers and an inspiring but not patronizing message about 'winning'. I hope the non-fans won't take the comparison too literally but I found that the film had the same appeal than a touching Simpson episode from the earlier seasons, and I guess my reference is also inspired by the heart-warming yellow that defines the film's sunny mood, putting a little sunshine in our hearts with so many touching moments. More than the triumph of a film, it's the triumph of a spirit, conveyed by a beautiful score and a clever Oscar-winning script.<br/><br/>What's the secret of ""Little Miss Sunshine"", the special little thing that makes the difference? I believe the movie's greatness relies on the performance and the characterization of Olive, by Abigail Breslin, so naturally balanced between smartness and innocence that the perfect note was found to provide a character the kids could identify with. Breslin plays a little girl excited to be selected in the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest, which might be surprising because this kind of competitions are infamous for having girls posing and acting like 'little women'. But Olive is determined, she prepared a secret number with Grandpa Edwin (Alan Arkin), Richard, the father (Greg Kinnear) preaches the concept of winning in his conferences and Sheryl (Toni Collette) is the kind of loving mother that would do anything to please her daughter. Olive is the emotional core of an order that would collapse without her. <br/><br/>Indeed, without Olive, the whole unity and solidarity of the family is undermined, the grandpa is a foul-mouth and pervert old man, the father is alienated by his own theories, Dwayne, Olive's brother has made a vow of silence to fulfill his dream to become a pilot and expresses the thoughts of his implosive anger in a notebook and Frank, the step-brother, played by Steve Carell, is a homosexual literature expert with suicidal impulses and as he loves to remind, the number one fan of Marcel Proust. And it's up to Sheryl, the mother to deal with all these personalities in the road to the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest, and the plot is so well constructed that they all must go together, starting a touching road movie in which all these egos, all these stories' arcs will converge with each member of the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" family having one moment to shine, through laughs, cries, breakdowns ¬Ö poignant outbursts of strong and vulnerable humanity.<br/><br/>And this leads to the other secret of ""Little Miss Sunshine"", it's a movie for outsiders. In the road, it's hard to imagine that this cute chubby girl with glasses stands a chance in a beauty pageant, but in a way, we don't really care about the result, since we already have in mind that the film isn't about winning, it's about letting your little voice be heard. And in the family, each one represents a part of human personality that finds something difficult to communicate, the frustrated number two, the insecure teenager, the blinded know-it-all, the grumpy old guy, they are less stereotypes than representations of the little differences that poison the lives but enrich the world, or vice versa. And when Olive is confronted to the girls in the pageant, we realize how the girls all look identically 'artifical' while Olive is clearly the only visible one.<br/><br/>""Grandpa, am I pretty?"" candidly asked Olive. This question touched something deep in my heart as it summarizes our own fear of not being accepted. Olive is confronted to a double dilemma, losing because she wouldn't be pretty, and disappointing her father, Grandpa's answer is simple, and remains as one of the truest words of wisdom ever spoken in a film. A loser isn't someone who doesn't win but someone who doesn't do anything because he's afraid of losing. And with that idea on mind, we're already confident about little Olive, and only wish that she would have the opportunity to express herself in the pageant, the result doesn't really matter ¬Ö didn't I mention the similarity with ""Rocky"" by the way?<br/><br/>But all the inspiring messages of the world would be meaningless if they didn't have great movie moments to immortalize them, and like the iconic finale of the 1976 Best Picture, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" ends in an apotheosis, when we finally discover Olive's secret number. The musical climax is the movie's highlight and the best illustration of its positive message. At the end, all the members of this unforgettable Hoover family have corrected some aspects of their life's conception, and so we did.<br/><br/>To conclude, whether it's about winning and losing, one thing the movie would surely win is your heart."

","Little Miss Sunshine is a wonderful heartfelt movie because it lets the actors play their game, without plot devices, movie magic or a emotionally simulating soundtrack. It works because, the casting is pitch perfect, the directing is automated and the situation seems real. The movie is about dreams, pursuing, the journey, the destination and realisation. It is a satirical comedy without the actors ever trying to be funny. In fact it is one of those rare movies where the whole family can sit in a van on a highway and along with the induced silence, the movie still moves along. It's a movie that makes you think further on about everything and at the same time, it lifts you somehow. Perhaps you don't know it, but you will feel it.

"watchivyshine","Null","1","2","6 November 2010"," dare say this out loud? It's OK to be a loser.
","Little Miss Sunshine tells the story of a financially broken-up family, of which every member has a serious issue of his own to deal with, goes on a trip to enter their youngest child Olive into a beauty pageant. The story started off with uncle Frank (Steve Carell) trying to kill himself.Soon we learned he fell in love with a boy student and lost this love to his academic opponent who then also took his career title. We then follow this to look at other members in the family. Father Richard is an unsuccessful professor who,ironically, is obsessed with ""being a winner"" and boasts a self-developed ""nine steps to success"" and is now trying to sell it so they won't go broke. The older brother Dwayne is an antisocial teenager who hates everyone, wants to become a jet pilot and decides to not talk until that day came true. The grandpa,who was kicked out from an elder's home where he takes pride to, in his own words of wisdom to his grandson, ""f*** not just one woman, A LOT OF THEM"", and is now on drugs. In all, you see a family that couldn't get more problematic, and you see a lot of tension and anger and frustration in the air of the house. All of these negative emotion though(and this runs through out the film), contrasts and objects to the young girl Olive's dissolve to win Little Miss Sunshine and the entire family's care and support of such dissolve.<br/><br/>Some compromised will, some reluctant agreement, an abundant of arguing and yelling, and there we have the Hoover family on the road, in their half-to-dead VW bus.<br/><br/>And there goes the trip,unfolding more of each member's unfortunates. First on the line is Daddy's career going in trash, with no one buying his ""nine steps"" and leaving the family in potential bankruptcy. Then Uncle sees his former lover boy in grocer shop with his current lover all glowing and rich,and is seen by them sloppy with porn magazine. Then Brother finds out he is colorblind(too dramatic?) and will never be qualified to fly a jet. Lastly out of nowhere (although at this point you kind of see it coming) grandpa dies in his sleep which the family not only have to grieve but also, as if they haven't been unfavored enough by fate, find out that they'd have to steal his body out of the clinic to get back on the road. And they did.<br/><br/>At this point you'd figure all this bad luck would've at least traded for Olive's success in the contest‚Äîand even this isn't happening. Every girl in the contest is entirely prepped like copies of Britney Spears at best,Paris Histon at worst (lose the alcohol, drugs and jails but you get the idea) and is being justified by everyone for acting this way. The family tries to stop Olive from going on the stage but when She did get on that stage, she was more embarrassing than they thought: she went stripping, taught by Grandpa. <br/><br/>In the end there were no dramatic miracles for the family. Everyone lost in everything they started off doing or wanting to do, and got on that horning, push-up bus (oh I left out the bus's funny failure, well, you can see for it yourself) to head home. There was no answer declared for anyone's problems: how are they going to make ends meet, what is Dwayne going to do with his life, how is Uncle Frank going to start over, or is Olive ever going to be a winner. Nothing is said about anything, and yet we have one confirmed feeling about this family: they're now repaired and pulled together as they never have been, and ever will be.<br/><br/>That's the magic of this film: there's no far-fetched happy endings, not even a hint of one. Every single person was abandoned by their dream and would be, defined traditionally, exclusive losers. But we feel they in some other way they have not failed. They're happier, stronger, with the help of a true little Miss Sunshine.<br/><br/>It was BECAUSE they did not succeed at the goals they set out to reach, and because of what they went through to realize this fact, that at one point or another they found peace for themselves, and found out what they didn't know before that DOES NOT MATTER:to be a loser.<br/><br/>Because why should it? Are the goals we set for ourselves ultimate means to define who we are, and should be the reasons we give up on life once they're not realized? Or do we simply put too much gravity on things and meaninglize them to a point we MAKE ourselves feel we're losers all the time? WILL THE WORLD COME TO AN END AND WE STOP HAVING SIGNIFICANCE IF WE FAIL? <br/><br/>The answer is self-explanatory. It's not an answer this film points to your face, which is why it's not preachy or patronizing. You walk out of the cinema feeling uplifted and refreshed, you get the message it wants to deliver, and you feel as happy and thankful as this family does at the end of the film.<br/><br/>The casting was great, the directing and storytelling were, while not perfect, pretty nice to reckon with. Steve Carell again gives a very impressive performance. Greg Kinnear, Toni Colette, Alan Arkin all did very well with their characters. Abigail Breslin did not disappoint the audiences with her witty, innocent, praise-worthy act as Olive, although my recognition of her best performance still lies with Kit Kittredge. Paul Dano really surprised me with his part as Dwyane the brother whom he played so well with that accuracy of a depressed teenager, that I couldn't help relating him to a lot of teenagers I remember. In all, Little Miss Sunshine is a well written, well thought-out comedy drama that speaks of a comforting message."

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the funniest journey of normal family. The main characters: Olive(Abigail Breslin),Sheryl(Toni Collette),Richard(Greg Kinnear), Frank(Steve Carell), Grandpa Edwin(Alan Arkin), and Dwayne(Paul Danoand)go to the talent contest in Redondo Beach,California to make olive's dream come true. While they get to the contest, they are facing so many family problems on the car that everyone may have experienced. Most of the time of this movie is focusing on a crazy family journey which is very very funny. <br/><br/>The story of this movie is quite simple , but really nice movie ever!! It made me laugh HARD all the time. I promise you'll be laugh out too when the movie has just started. Unfortunately, this movie was not big hit in Japan which is very sad, so I watched it on DVD with my family, my friends, my boyfriend and myself many times! Anyone can have fun! So why don't you see Little Miss Sunsine?! You must be love it!!"

","2006 had two Best Picture contenders that weren't loved by everybody but were still managing to get lots of awards attention. ""Babel"" was one of them (which I LOATHED) and the other was ""Little Miss Sunshine"", which I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>The story was nice and original, the cast was great and all of them gave great performances, and I also really cared for the characters and wanted them to succeed.<br/><br/>While Alan Arkin received an Oscar that was really a combined deserved/veteran win, I feel that Steve Carell and Paul Dano both gave more interesting performances and were more interesting characters and both should have received more notice. Abagail Breslin is a cute little girl and she gave a very sweet performance but I wasn't sure she was Oscar worthy for it. I was shocked to hear Dustin Hoffman say her performance was one of the best he has ever seen. Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear both shine as the parents, especially Kinnear.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and feel it is one of the best indie movies of the past 10 years along with being one of my favorite films of the past 10 years."
"ratherdashing-1","9","1","2","7 March 2010"," One of the greatest films ever made
","Let me start by saying i LOVED this movie. The movie is about an odd and dysfunctional family. Their son(Paul Dano) has given up speech and wants to be a pilot, their father(Greg Kinear) is an unsuccessful motivational speaker, their mother(Toni Collette) is a housewife, and their daughter(Abigail Breslin) is an adorable yet chubby girl who is accepted into a beauty pageant. This family is living with their perverted grandfather(Alan Arkin) and their suicidal gay uncle(Steve Carell). They go on a long road trip in their VW Bus and every moment is either funny, moving, or sad. Every event that occurs on the trip helps this family come together and solve each of their problems. The ending at the pageant is hilarious and is like giving beauty pageants the finger. This movie is strange, funny, and awkward. It is a movie that just reminds you how great life is and that sometimes you got to move on and forget yourself for a second."
"CodeGeronimo","10","1","2","30 January 2010"," Cried and laughed my ass off about this sublime storyline.
","What more do you need to know except that the cast is terrific. The human factor is amplified in this movie where human weakness shows to be the power of the family in the movie. It is a story of tolerance and unconditional love, although one of the characters says he hates everybody he shows the contrary over and over again. Failure is not an option for the characters in the film. You can see that they are not the most successful people in the world but they go trough life thick and thin and really never give up, even if that means that they have to beg for it. They are determined to win and it shows that it can be done although not in the way they hoped to but in the way they are. Some profane language is being used so be careful with kids around some scene's with grandpa especially in the bus, so plug your children's ears when grandpa starts rolling of his opinions which are really HILARIOUS! All in all a perfect little family road movie where no harm is done to anyone, ENJOY!"
"Sanou_san","10","1","2","8 September 2008"," Splendid slice of life film
","Since I saw Abigail Breslin shine in one of her movies (independent ones, specifically) titled ""Keane"" together with an exceptionally fine actor Damian Lewis, I've been anticipating her to boost her talent and professionalism in acting field to the best. Little Miss Sunshine, deep in my heart, is superbly a best choice for a movie connoisseur. It is indeed a Slice of Life movie, with absolutely no slow-phase moving story plot, haughty scenes and nostalgic-to-boring expositions. I love its imperceptible but convincing atmosphere, likable characters (cast of Abigail Breslin herself, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin, Toni Collete and the funny but serious, solid role of Steve Carell), exciting phases of the movie and versatile story that doesn't saturate the whole film just by focusing on the main character of the story. In accordance with the recent remark I gave about the movie, it doesn't only focus on the main character¬óOlive, but along their wacky, fun, dramatic, and riveting journey a lot of the things begin to surface, each member of the bus begins to realize their own identities and tendencies. Olive's grandfather (played by Alan Arkin as Edwin) succumbs of being drug-user, but never renounces his support and love for her grand-daughter. There's also Frank Ginsberg¬ó(Sheryl Hoover's gay brother, mother of Olive, played by Toni Collete) who was recently discharged by the hospital for almost killing himself due to a devastating relationship and job conflicts, however he was as well one of the people who Olive enthusiasm had touched. Sheryl, her mother, and Richard (played by Greg Kinnear) got their own issues as well, whining and fighting over each other's inefficiencies and inaccurate decisions but decided to cool off for their daughter's unfailing dream. Lastly was Dwayne (played by) whose unwillingness and hostile aura decides to hate everyone but deep inside love his entire family.<br/><br/>The film for me is a mix of blending feelings. At portions of the movie, you tend to be excited, then thrilled, then emotionally moved and begin to unnoticeably fill your eyes with cries then there's also laughter, resentment, shame, above all this film certainly a best preference to spend a worthwhile moment."

","Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rare films like Ratatouille, Spiderman and Stuart Little which can be enjoyed with family members especially young children.It is an honest film which never intends to be a masterpiece as it has its own shortcomings and positive facets. Although it is a film about a beauty contest for young children,we learn a great lesson of humility.We are taught that it is not the exterior beauty which is more elegant but the beauty of the heart.For Little Miss Sunshine,a team of music clip directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris decided to show a dysfunctional family.There are many funny laughs in this film but it is not clear whether a dysfunctional family has been shown in order to gain viewers' sympathies.We also see that parents put everything at stake in order to get success for their kids.Toni Collette is nice as the mother of two kids.This is her best role till date after mesmerizing performance in Muriel's Wedding directed by P.J.Hogan.A good film which informs us all about the importance of family life."

","Funny how any movie that doesn't completely suck gets put in IMDb's top 250 list right quick. ""The will of the people is strong, but their ability to forget is insurmountable"" (or something or other paraphrased from Mein Kampf). Democracy! Yay! In other words: people rush out to vote for films based on fleeting emotional tangents which would be more strongly evoked by older movies that did it with more class.<br/><br/>Not that this is necessarily the case here. Little Miss Sunshine is decent -- sufficiently heart-warming and bittersweet. You know, one of those movies about how we have to love the people we're with even if we don't like them or get along too well on a personal level. It demonstrates how these familial bonds are tested in stressful and depressing circumstances, but these are the only bonds that can survive such circumstances. I can jive with that message.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm just reading into it. REGARDLESS, the cast works well together and the pacing is good and there are some genuine laughs along the way.

","I watched this again last night, having seen it first in the theater when it first came out (it's SO fun to laugh your guts out with everyone else in a packed house), and having read a draft of the screenplay on Simply Scripts. Pure genius, on every level.<br/><br/>The member who posted his/her theory of how the final act offers a critique of baby beauty pageants--sorry, forget the name--really has a great reading, I think. I'd recognized how all you have to do is show what actually happens at these sick events to make fun of and criticize them. But the poster makes the smarter point that Olive's routine is more similar than different from those of her fellow competitors; it's a comic exaggeration of what these little contestants are called on to do at these things.<br/><br/>I think Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are amazing in every movie they make."

Or, how about we have one of the kids not talking to the family the whole movie -- uh, wasn't that done in ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" The parents are good, Alan Arkin plays another in his long chain of annoying characters and I don't think a character spouting off obscenities throughout a movie is particularly humorous. <br/><br/>LMS has some cute moments, but the rip-offs from other movies, the obscene grandpa, and the trashy ending made this a big disappointment."

","1. Edwin Hoover - Worthless horny old man, gets kicked out of a retirement home for doing drugs, can't string a sentence without the F word to hold it together.<br/><br/>2. Richard Hoover - A motivational speaker with no audience, peddling a useless model that is so obviously useless.<br/><br/>3. Sheryl Hoover - Married to loser number 2. That makes her a gullible loser, worse than Richard Hoover.<br/><br/>4. Frank Ginsberg - The biggest loser of them all. Gay out-of-work scholar, expert in the works of an author that seems to be almost as pathetic as the characters in this movie combined, who loses his job and boyfriend to somebody who is less of an expert on Proust than he is.<br/><br/>5. Dwayne - Loser with a silly belief that he would get to fly fighter jets if he doesn't talk to anybody. In a way, a live example of what loser number 2 is preaching.<br/><br/>The way I look at it, this is a movie about uber-losers designed to make losers feel good about themselves. With the mortgage crisis and economic slowdown, I guess this makes the rednecks whose homes were foreclosed a little less miserable about their own lives. I'll bet people came out of the theater thinking ""Oh, thank god my life isn't so full of manure. Maybe I'm not that big a loser after all."" Only saving grace was that unlike the usual ""feel good"" movies, this one ended with the whole family making a fool of itself. Typically, this movie would have ended with the girl exhibiting some breath-taking talent on stage, and winning the pageant, and the whole family living happily ever after.<br/><br/>The family was an assemblage of losers at the beginning of the movie, and they stayed that way till the end. Basically to make the audience go ""Hey I'm not a total loser after all!"".<br/><br/>PS: The humor was better than most other movies, but this still is not top 250 material."
"paulmamak","7","1","2","27 June 2007"," One of a very few moving comedies that depicts the problems and delights seen in society today.
","This film certainly brought out each of the actors/actresses acting capabilities. It truly emphasises what it is like in the lives of middle class families today and what effect society can have on hard working individuals. I am also very glad that the plot remained realistic and not just another predictable and corny plot.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin has a promising acting career ahead of her, as unlike most child roles, you actually felt for the character.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear gave a great portrayal as the unsuccessful father, who lets face it, delivered very motivational lines throughout the film.<br/><br/>Toni Collette did her bit once again as the emotional mother, she played the role well once again, but if I was her I would move on from these types of role as she has so much more to offer.<br/><br/>Paul Dano's acting was truly outstanding, his performance as a 15 year old could not be any more accurate and the scene where he finds out that he is colour blind was one of the best scenes of the film.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin certainly deserved the academy award for his role as the grandfather, as I did not even recognise that he was the same guy from Edward Scissorhands. He really gave the character a dark side as a drug addict, a funny side (when talking about girls to Dawyne) and a caring side. I truly had no expectations that his character would have died so early into the film.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell, in my opinion, deserves the most credit in this film as like many of the greatest comedians he undertook a troubled character. You really feel for him at the start of the film, discovering that he is a depressive who tried to kill himself and if he already has not gone through enough he has ended up having to live with his sisters family in the most embarrassing circumstances. What makes his performance even more astonishing is that you find out that he is a homosexual. This is most probably one of his most serious roles to date, but he still delivers his genius wit throughout (e.g. the sarcasm scene).<br/><br/>What I think made the film is how they show how sick young beauty pageants are how they are just bad taste.<br/><br/>Overall though, a very good film."
"dromasca","8","1","2","22 June 2007"," the right to be a loser
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is not at all my kind of movie, and yet I enjoyed watching it. The story is about a gathering of characters who call themselves a family, each bringing his or her own combination of dreams, stereotypes and disappointments, trying to make their ways in the context of the very American competitive system to which none seems to fit very well. When the little daughter in the family wins the right for a hopeless participation in a kids beauty pageant the family embarks in a trip that would make them maybe see where the right value of their lives lies.<br/><br/>The nice thing in this movie is the freshness and sincerity of acting. First time directors Dayton and Faris succeed to make the characters alive, distinct and likable from the very first minutes and so they remain for the whole duration of the movie. There is a lot of talk in the film about how not to be a loser, and apparently the characters as individuals and the family as a whole seem to be super-losers in the real world, yet on the human plan they end by being winners, and so they are in the hearts of the viewers."
"jboothmillard","7","1","2","8 May 2007"," Little Miss Sunshine
","I have seen a few independent films that make an impression, and this is definitely one of the finest, because it has all the right elements that you could have in a more high budget film. Basically the dysfunctional Hoover family live in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and seven year old daughter Olive (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Abigail Breslin) is ecstatic as she has qualified to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in Redondo Beach, California, and the whole family are forced to drive there Volkswagen T2 Microbus. Father and husband Richard (Ghost Town's Greg Kinnear) is trying to build a career as a motivational speaker, mother and wife Sheryl (The Sixth Sense's BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Toni Collette) is overworked, Sheryl's brother Frank (Bruce Almighty's Steve Carell) is gay and recently suicidal, Richard's father Edwin (Oscar and BAFTA winning Alan Arkin) is foulmouthed and teaching Olive her routine, and teenager Dwayne (Paul Dano) hates everyone and vows to stay silent until he becomes a US Air Force pilot. It is not an easy journey, as the family have to try and get on with each other as they travel across the states, the van claps out often and eventually has a broken horn, and personal problems come into play as well. Richard fails to get anywhere with his career, Sheryl tries to keep the family together, Olive asks a lot of questions but continues to hope and practise, Frank tries to forget his bad feelings and move on with his life, Edwin swears a lot and gives honest opinions, and Dwayne finally breaks his silence when he is upset to be colour blind, which means he cannot fly. There is the death of the Grandpa on the way, but the family finally make it to the pageant, and they had no idea that Olive was going to perform a burlesque dance to the Rick James song ""SuperFreak"", she is innocent and unaware that she is doing anything wrong, and the audience are shocked. In the end, after the family do their best to support her and help her finish the performance, they are told never to enter the daughter in a beauty pageant again, which they happily accept, and they all drive back home to Albuquerque. Also starring Jill Talley as Cindy, Bryan Cranston as Stan Grossman, Dean Norris as State Trooper McCleary, Child's Play 2's Beth Grant as Pageant Official Jenkins and Lauren Shiohama as Miss California. The performances are all great, especially of course award winning Arkin, but also from Kinnear as the desperate dad and Carell as the helpless homosexual trying to move on from his recent troubles, it has some really funny moments, but also it has the needed touching moments where the family overcome problems and bond together, a must see road movie comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film and the David Lean Award for Direction for Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

"ingres77","8","1","2","27 April 2007"," Quirky. Dysfunctional. Charming. One of the best films of the year.
","The film follows a family on their journey to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California, which the 6-year-old daughter (Olive) hopes to win. Though this is the overall plot, it's really just a backdrop for this film, which is actually more of a study of a dysfunctional family trying to come to grips with itself.<br/><br/>Billed as a comedy, Little Miss Sunshine is more of a drama, along similar lines as the brilliant Sideways or About Schmidt. In fact, I didn't find the first hour or so very funny. Quirky, yes, but not funny. Almost all the laughs, for me, were crammed into the final 45 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Also, I was disengaged for most of this movie's first half. I didn't identify with any of the characters (which included a gay, suicidal, Proust expert; a cynical, Nietzchean teenager who's taken a vow of silence; a drug-addicted grandfather who's epithet-laden rants about sex offends his family; a portly six-year-old girl with giant glasses and no discernible talent, but with ambitions of being a beauty queen; a pathetic father striving for wealth, fame, and success; and a mother who's almost the most sensible of the group, but ultimately unable to bring any sanity to her family). Though I couldn't identify with any of them, I enjoyed them all.<br/><br/>But once the family hits the road, this all changes. They begin to bond as they never have, and there are a number of honest and charming scenes of familial love and appreciation. Nothing melodramatic, just an honest portrayal of a family finding itself.<br/><br/>What truly makes this picture, though, is the ending. Once they reach their destination, you discover that this family had no actual idea what a beauty pageant for six-year-olds entailed. They are, justifiably, stunned at the spectacle, and are protective of their daughter once they realize the laughing-stock she will become.<br/><br/>For me, the most remarkable thing, here, was that the filmmaker's didn't flinch at showing how disgusting these pageants are. The six-year-olds are dressed up like strippers, and their presentation is decidedly unnerving. Even worse, the audience eats it up. They clap, and smile, and encourage their children to behave like adults. These children are sexualized, but it's allowed because it's ""cute"".<br/><br/>If you, the viewer, aren't thoroughly horrified by this, then you need to re-examine a few things about yourself.<br/><br/>The filmmaker's knew what they were doing.<br/><br/>What makes this scene work (as opposed to having this scene ruin the whole movie) is that it's deliberately ironic. It's a joke, at the expense of all those who go to, or involve themselves in, child beauty pageants.<br/><br/>When Olive (the family's daughter) finally gets on stage, she's literally doing a stripper's routine (to Rick James' ""Superfreak""), and the audience is horrified. What they (the filmmaker's) have done is take the ""cuteness"" out of the show, and left the sexuality. The horror on the audiences faces shows the hypocrisy of the pageant.<br/><br/>The only difference between Olive and the other contestants is that Olive isn't objectified. She does her own routine, and sought to be in the contest, herself. Her family supports her in her ambition (and seek to protect her), they don't force her into it (like the other families presumably have). Olive isn't glammed up in some idealized version of childhood sexuality (as if a thing should exist), she throws the disgusting nature of the pageant in the face of the audience.<br/><br/>This scene is jarring. The entire movie up to this point is quirky, and fun - if fairly serious. Like the family, you aren't prepared for the spectacle of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. But, once there, you are overcome with how despicable the whole thing is.<br/><br/>Amazingly, the true magic of this film lies in how the pageant is done. It follows the development of these disparate characters coming together to form a familial bond for the first time. You follow them on this journey, and come to love them. You want everything to work out. You even want Olive to win the competition, and then you don't want her to even go on stage (and the father, uncle, and brother try to stop this from happening).<br/><br/>When it becomes obvious that the crowd hates Olive's performance, you feel sorry for her. She doesn't know why they don't like her performance (she is only six, after all), and you want to protect her as if she were your own daughter. When the family finally joins her on stage, your reaction goes from horror, to emotional warmth. What had been building with this family is finally realized in an absurd dance routine.<br/><br/>Literally, my face went from open-mouthed shock, to a smile in the space of two minutes. I've never seen another movie like it.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this film wasn't half as funny as I hoped it'd be, but it was far more endearing and meaningful than I imagined."

I am not a type of person who often laugh while watching movies, but this is a different kind of comedy, the unfortunate events this family face make the movie hilarious. With all the laughing, the movie is full of messages. I believe the family learned many lessons in this trip and so did we. And I say it again, never judge a movie from the first 10 minutes."

""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the most imaginative movies that i have ever seen of the recent years. This movie has all that things that our eyes deserve. ""Little Miss Sunhine"" told us the story of a family like any other. A father who do anything for his family with his projects, a mother who take charge of her family, a depressed uncle, a grandpa who loves drugs, a son who lives quietly his adolescence and... Olive, our little girl. Olive has a dream, be the next little miss Sunshine in a beauty contest. Now she had the chance, and all they have to do is go to Califotrnia and make the best. The whole family is not right with this... but that don't going to stop Olive for her dream. So, with an old yellow VW and one that another hope, goes for Olive's dream. But, not everything will be as easy as they think This dramatic comedy is fun and delightful until it finishes it drop, is a real masterpiece of modern films. The movie talks in a really spirited way, where we see a family that is sustained, no matter what. The movie begins with an introduction of each character. Their problems, their feelings, their dreams and the way of live in a plastic world, because ""this life is damn beauty contest"". We see love of characters, dreams of characters, problems of characters. We see that little Olive dancing and rehearsing with her grandpa. We see a real analysis of the fact of be a winner or a loser. Second by second, scene by scene, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" touch our hearts with great messages for us. You must go for your dreams, of course you're going to fall, that is that make us humans. Be and go for all that things that you want, no matter if little plastic girls surrounds you. I love dance ""Superfereak"", and... what the hell... i dance that song because i loved it. If you do this, no matter if you win the contest or not, you are already a winner. And that is what ""Little Miss Sunshine"" do with certain roguery and fondness. If you want to see, really an excellent movie... watch ""Little Miss Sunshine"", after that, you will feel as an entire winner with a pleasant suffering.<br/><br/>*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any."

","I was waiting for this DVD for so long as it will take at least another 6 or 8 months to hit the theatres in India, and i was dying to c this movie after i read all the glowing reviews and the 8.1 rating from IMDb. but i was having a constant fear that the hype that it created will never be met, but wat a relief.. it did not just meet the hype but it scored more too..<br/><br/>the story is so simple(as many people have already talked abt the story I will cut that part). The way the screenplay has been done is simply marvelous, and the editing and the direction is just flawless. Such a movie can lose its pace very easily but except for a few minutes in the middle wen Richard tries to deal with his problem at night could have been crisper. But nevertheless it was flawless.<br/><br/>The reason for this movie to go from good to greatness is the acting part.. flawless is too small a word to describe this work of art.. all the cast have just lived the character.. Greg Kinnear was awe-inspiring, Toni Collette so natural, Paul Dano was a revelation (pls check out the part wen he finds out that he has colour blindness and cant pursue his dream-it will blow ur mind), Steve Carell was just amazing, this might well be his best work till date.. and last but not the least the Oscar contenders Abigail Breslin as olive and Alan Arkin as her grand pa.. it was just out of the world experience.. Abigail was so cute to be true and if she doesn't win the Oscars I will make a golden statue and present it to her myself..<br/><br/>Had a grt time watching this amazing Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris's piece of art. Pls check it out and u wont be disappointed I will guarantee.<br/><br/>9/10 ( i wanna give them a ten but i am a little strict..hehehe )"

","I saw this with a group of friends who didn't know much about the film. After about 30 minutes, one of them commented, ""Is this suppose to be a comedy?"" That's pretty much the feeling for the first half of the film, but once the characters are established, the viewer is set up for one of the most charming displays of a family bonding ever in a film.<br/><br/>The family is extremely messed up. It felt like we were visiting a home where we were seeing things that we shouldn't be seeing. It was painful and compelling at the same time because you could tell that everyone cared for each other very much but all their personal S**t was getting in the way of them making healthy connections to each other.<br/><br/>The youngest of the family, 8 year-old Olive, gets into a beauty contest and the whole family embarks on a trip across country in a decrepit Microbus to support her dream of being Little Miss Sunshine. Olive is adorable, but not cutesy at all. Her father is so hard on her to be a winner that he even starts getting her to hate her body and be thin so she can become a beauty queen. Olive isn't fat at all. She looks like a normal kid. This isn't light humor, but biting commentary about society.<br/><br/>The middle part of the film is a bit like the movie ""Vacation."" Unfortunately, there are some plot problems that couldn't be ignored so I took away a star.<br/><br/>Once the family reaches The Little Miss Sunshine Pagant, be ready to be hit over the head with some of the funniest comedy I've seen in a long time.

"dfranzen70","9","1","2","25 January 2007"," Little Miss Can't Do Wrong
","You know, a decade or so ago, I had a 1977 Volkswagen minibus. Had a couple hundred thousand miles on it and was a tough drive if one wasn't used to manual transmissions, but it looked cool in a somewhat-ironic way and was, of course, a viable means of conveyance. You'll find almost the same exact VW in Little Miss Sunshine, with the same wacky orange exterior and weird off-beige interior, but what sets this one apart from mine is that the Hoover family car has such fun problems as a disappearing clutch, a side door that doesn't close correctly, and a horn that doesn't quite stop honking. And yet somehow the vehicle manages to hold itself together long enough to travel from Arizona to California and back for the much-heralded Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for young girls.<br/><br/>One of the two magnificent aspects of the movie is that the family's comprised of unlikeable people, that is, normal people to whom you yourself might be related. There's no hero, exactly (save Olive, the kidlet), because each of the members has some kind of negative vibe going on, whether it's bankruptcy, smoking, muteness, drug use, or suicide. Oh, sure, they're a regular Manson Family there, except for the killing bit. Anyway, the family has to shepherd young Olive to the pageant one weekend because she learns at the last minute that she's become a contestant (she finished fourth in an earlier pageant, but third place got sick) and her usual ride for these pageants is unavailable. So the entire family piles into the microbus (without shovels and rakes and implements of destruction - see if you get that reference), owing to a whole bunch of reasons. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is going, because he's responsible for teaching Olive the number she'll do for the talent portion of the show. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) is going because he alone can drive the VW; mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) is going because, well, she wants to. And suicidal uncle Frank (Steve Carell) can't be left alone, but brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is perhaps a little young to stay home aloneish.<br/><br/>If this were a typical family movie, you'd expect the dysfunctional clan to grow over the course of their journey, to learn to love each other despite all flaws, to bond and harmonize soulfully behind the dreamy Olive. No way that happens here; these people clearly don't like each other, except Olive, who's immune (and/or oblivious) to the negative vibes surrounding her family.<br/><br/>A great deal of the entertainment value of Little Miss Sunshine are the wacky adventures that the group gets into during the ride to Redondo Beach, and it's not just red herrings that filmmakers toss in to distract you from a crappy plot - you can well imagine these things happening to anyone, such as the aforementioned clutch problem. So the movie automatically feels real to you, not like you're just watching a bunch of actors going through the motions. And then things REALLY pick up once they get to the pageant.<br/><br/>Like I said, everyone's sort of dislikable. Grandpa is a drug-using, cranky ol' coot who's prone to blunt, profanity-laced tirades. Which makes him several kinds of awesome right there. His son Richard is a controlling goof who completely subscribes to the nine-steps-to-success program that he hawks for a living (""Don't be a loser!""). Cheryl, who somehow holds the family together, chain smokes and seems the very portrait of crass white trash, while her brother Frank is a gay near-suicide who's been released into his sister's care. Oh, and then there's Dwayne, who's intentionally mute. Nope, not saying a word, no way, not until he enters the Air Force Academy; it's some sort of discipline exercise.<br/><br/>And at the center of all this weirdness is little, slightly pudgy Olive, played by the wonderful Abagail Breslin, perhaps best known for playing one of Mel Gibson's strange kids in Signs. Olive is adorable and real, in contrast to other contestants, who are perhaps adorable but quite artificial. Anyway, Olive seems ignorant of the wacky behavior of her relations except in the most abstract terms, as one might expect from an eight-year-old (meaning she's not stricken by that Hollywood disease of precociousness). Breslin's a real treat, and she was rewarded for her excellent performance with an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>I mentioned two entertaining aspects of the movie; the other is that the denouement isn't a perfect happy ending. Add that to the realistic - often hysterical, mind you - situations in which the family finds itself, while seemingly not behaving out of character, and you have a gloriously funny film."
"Guinevere723","5","3","12","13 January 2007"," One of the summer's biggest surprises? Are you serious?
","If I looked up the word ""overrated"" in the dictionary, I wouldn't be surprised if I read the words 'Little Miss Sunshine' scrawled across the definition. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to bring myself to understand why this was the ""biggest and most pleasant surprise"" of last summer. What exactly is so special or endearing about this sad little story? Frankly, I found it to be frustrating more than anything else.<br/><br/>For the entire movie, we're stuck with a dismal and dysfunctional family whose last hope at some sort of happiness seems to lie with getting the littlest of the bunch, Olive, to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California. So they all pile into their vintage VW bus and brace themselves for the long trip ahead. But along the way, it seems that one bad thing after another keeps happening to this poor family, which only makes the discontented lives of these people that much more bothersome¬óthey just can't seem to win no matter what. If it's not the car falling apart, it's the disgruntled, Nietzsche-reading teenage son that discovers he's colorblind (and in turn won't be able to pursue his goal of becoming an Air Force Pilot). And if it's not the father, Richard, failing at getting his personal betterment plan published, then it's the grandfather dying of a heroin overdose! This movie just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it?! It's only the fitting icing on the cake when poor Olive makes a fool of herself during her talent segment and is removed from the final judging for being such an embarrassment to the pageant. And at the end, they all pile into their decrepit VW and drive on home.<br/><br/>So I ask those of you who actually enjoyed this movie¬Ö what exactly was the point of going through all that? Am I supposed to feel all warm and toasty inside because, despite all the misfortunes that the family had to endure on this road trip, they all managed to ""grow"" in some way? Okay, so we should all be proud of Olive for not conforming to the synthetic world of pageantry by just being herself, even if that means not winning. And we should all be pleased that Dwayne finally outgrew his ""vow of silence"" stage and finally started to show that he could exhibit some emotion and learn to care about something outside his own agonizing adolescence. And we should all be uplifted that the Hoovers never gave in to defeat and always managed to trek on, because ""you're only a loser if you don't try"". Trust me, I get all that. I just didn't find the underlying message to be all that moving. In some movies that sort of thing works, but it didn't seem to gel here. The only thing I got out of this film were a few chuckles brought on by brief moments of dark humor that somehow managed to be funny. And furthermore, did the movie really need all that profanity? Did the F-bomb's help to further the humor in some way, and it just managed to escape me? I doubt it. It was completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>I assure you, I really wanted to like this movie. I'm a lover of all films, including the dark, offbeat quirky comedies like this one tried to be. But unlike other dark comedies, this wasn't all that funny. That's kind of a requirement, isn't it? With all the buzz surrounding Little Miss Sunshine and all the good things I kept hearing about it, I had nothing but high hopes for the time when I could actually sit down and watch it. But when the time came, the experience wasn't what I expected it would be and I was sorely let down. It's such a shame too because I was really encouraged by the casting choices (Kinnear, Collette, Arkin and Carell are all great talents). I'm convinced, though, that the let down was of no fault of the actors; just the general circumstances and the events that unfolded throughout the story. And I'm especially disappointed that this movie found a spot in the IMDb's Top 250. Seriously, is this the best we can come up with? Oy! Spare me!"
"amiratsky-1","5","3","12","2 January 2007"," Good concept - Stupid story
","As seen many times, a great concept can go wrong or it can turn stupid-- so stupid, it's hard to believe that even ""losers"" or ""dysfunctional"" could lack any level of common sense and intelligence. Being funny does not require stupidity unless you're writing Dumb & Dumber. Good writing is creating funny situations, but NOT at the cost of creating stupid characters and story. This film, like many other critically acclaimed smart movie, gets worse by the minute. I love the cast in general, but the characters they play are unconvincing, simply by being so oblivious to the expected ""norm"". Usually, parents know what kind of act their kid is going to perform before the actual contest-- a teen knows if color-blind way before the age of 16-- you don't tell a cop NOT to look where-- a suicidal can't cope so normal right after a suicide attempt-- and so on & on & on... I was so looking forward to see it, but-- a HUGE disappointment."

Maybe it's just personal taste, but I found myself laughing at many parts of the movie just politely (as opposed to falling out of my seat laughing). I'm not quite sure why I didn't think this was the funniest movie in a long time, but maybe it's the implausibility of the setup (how dysfunctional can a family get?) or maybe the jokes are too intelligent? Anyway, I don't want to slam this movie, as it is very well made and I loved all the actors in the film. The scene at the end is priceless, as it glaringly shows the hypocrisy of these ""beauty pageants"". Overall, a pleasant film that won't disappoint!"

I felt that the movie was trying to get onto this list by making the audience realize something about family... Like there isn't enough! There's Lilo and Stitch, Pay it forward, The Wizard, and several of them are flops anyway. Why did this one think it could stand out? All this movie is is problem after problem after problem. Was the world trying to kill them? Wait, is this a ""SILVER-LINING"" lesson that several thousands of movies have taught you to pull through? It looks like it is because ""Sticking with the family can always let you pull through problems"" is another one of these aims. I've never seen one of those movies, wow, it's even less credible.

","I like the premise, I like much of what the movie communicates. But Alan Arkin's ""grandpa"" character was too filthy for me to like this movie overall. In one scene, while the whole family is in the van, he is telling his 15 year old grandson that his one advice is ""while you are young, 'F' (the sex act) all the girls you can"", continuing to advise him to do it now, while he is still under 18, so he won't get in trouble with the law. All in front of mom and dad, but little daughter is listening to music on headphones and can't hear.<br/><br/>This kind of writing is puzzling and bad, because it is unnecessary and cheapens an otherwise good movie. Not to mention the bad message it gives to any teenager that might be seeing it. The story could have been better told with milder, less graphic dialog and still established the character for the events near the end. After that scene, the movie never recovers for me.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear is obsessed with his ""9 steps"" to success, thinks he has a contract lined up with a firm to publish him, meaning big $$$bucks at last. But his daughter gets a last minute chance to compete in the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contest in California, meaning they have to take a road trip from Albuquerque. All the reasons why are complex, and are explained in the opening scenes. Mom, dad, daughter, angry and mute son, heathen grandpa, and an uncle on suicide watch. Much of the movie involves misadventures along the way, plus additional misadventures at the pageant.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. The pageant itself makes fun of child pageants, with little girls dressed up and made up almost looking like prostitutes, singing and dancing. Our little miss sunshine does a dance taught her by her grandfather, who dies on the trip to California.

","I was a bit disappointed with the way they portrayed the real pageant girls in this movie. Lauren Yee is phenomenal, the one in the navy talent, and they didn't show hardly any of her routine, but they lingered on the swimsuit competition. By the way, the men are fathers...you learn that if you do child pageants. The mothers are usually backstage making sure everything in attached. I have never seen a girl strip at a pageant, and you see how rare it is by the reaction of most of the contestants. I have also never seen a director tell the emcee...they were making fun of a real emcee...to get a child off the stage. Yes, they do spray tan and wear the makeup, but so do all-star cheerleaders and dancers...It's a stage. If you are in the audience, it looks fine. These kids work their butts off and are more coordinated than you could believe, and they barely showed any of it. I guess the acting was OK...the brother was impressive and the grandpa was kind of funny, but other than that, it was a plot that has been used for so many movies/TV shows that it's not interesting. I felt I wasted $4.00 on a movie that has been done many times before. Well, I'm going to sit through it again and try to see where it was a comedy, but honestly, I think it would have been better as a made-for-TV film..."

","I went to this sneak preview really wanting to like the movie. I really like Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, and Steve Carell. The plot was deliciously dark: a dysfunctional family goes on a road trip so the young daughter can participate in a beauty pageant. <br/><br/>But, the problem is that the movie screamed ""I'm an indie flick."" From the poster to the commercials, I should have been warned that it would fall into the traps that these independent films generally do. But, I had high hopes.<br/><br/>Nevertheless they were somewhat dashed. Little Miss Sunshine is indeed a darkish comedy of sorts, but only of the most contrived sort. The family in Little Miss Sunshine neither feels like a family nor acts like they are connected by having lived together for years. The family includes:<br/><br/><ul><li>Olive, the young daughter who asks all the good questions that need to be asked for the movie to develop its plot. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Richard, the over-talkative father who spouts self-help while calling everybody losers. He is depending on a book deal that may not come through.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sheryl, the working mother who is impatient with the whole situation.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dwayne, the Nitzche-reading son who has taken a vow of silence until he can get into the air force to fly jets.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Grandpa, the perverted old man who snorts heroin and is also Olive's coach.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Frank, Sheryl's homosexual brother, fresh off an attempted suicide after a failed relationship with his grad student.</li></ul><br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, Olive is given the Sunnydale regional Little Miss Sunshine title due to her placing second and first place was forced to drop out. The last-minute nature of the phone call sends the family into a flurry of action leading to the decision that everybody will be in the VW van for the road trip. <br/><br/>The road trip consists of many odd and stupid contrivances in order to set up for repeated jokes and motifs. The van's clutch drops out, which causes everybody to push it in order to drive it. Phone signals drop out at inconvenient times, and chance situations all pile on top of each other. Add to these contrivances the fact that none of the family reacts like people who have known each other for years. They act and react like characters in a cheap play. <br/><br/>The only one who moderately pulls it off is Toni Collette. Thankfully, Toni has the timing and grace of a truly caring mother trying to hold the family together. <br/><br/>However, the comic aspects of the rest of the performers are all spot on. The movie isn't all bad. When it is funny, it is frequently hilarious. Especially when it is believable. When the situations aren't so constructed to seem like they were written solely for laughs, Little Miss Sunshine really shines. When it isn't believable it is tiresome and stretched. <br/><br/>Paul Dano also shines in the first half-hour of the movie when he acts like a child who is tired of the family. But, by the end, he just isn't trying nearly as hard as he was. <br/><br/>Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear also flex their comic timing muscle in the movie as they can. They make their jokes work even when they aren't working. <br/><br/>For the dark humor that the movie gets right, it is an enjoyable movie. It isn't bad, it just isn't great. It just doesn't click.<br/><br/>B-"

","The institution of the dysfunctional family has been fodder for a thousand independent films. It's a dependable old device on which filmmakers often hang eccentric characters so we won't assume they're clinically insane by their own right.<br/><br/>Dysfunction by itself does not make for great comedy and that's part of my problem with Little Miss Sunshine, a cross-hybrid of American Beauty and National Lampoon's Vacation without the dramatic structure of the first or the belly laughs of the second.<br/><br/>The movie centers on the Hoover family, a small family of dysfunctional misfits including Richard (Greg Kinnear), the family patriarch who gives lectures about a 12-step system that can make you successful at anything; Sheryl (Toni Collette), the family matriarch with a sour personality but a strong belief in her family; Dwayne (Paul Dano), a pucker-faced teen who is giving the family the silent treatment until they allow him to enter the Air Force; Frank (Steve Carrell), Sheryl's gay College professor brother whose suicide attempt over a failed romance would probably prompt a better movie; There's Sheryl's dad Edwin, a horny old coot with a passion for sex, drugs and skin rags. And then there's little Olive, whose dream is to win the Little Miss Sunshine contest.<br/><br/>The movie centers on the family's attempts to get Olive to the contest in Redondo Beach via a beat-up old VW Van. It's one of those ""movie cars"" where the family has to push it to get it rolling then has to chase it to get in and when the thing is no longer useful to the plot, the door falls off.<br/><br/>All the performances in the movie are fine but they're trapped in their predetermined personality traits that aren't that interesting. The exception is little Abigail Breslin, a Olive who is a wide-eyed kid who asks questions and seems filled with a certain wonderment. In the film's only winning moment she asks Grandfather Alan Arkin in which she asks him very sweetly ""Grampa? Am I pretty"". He very lovingly answers ""You're the movie beautiful girl in the world"". I wish the rest of the movie could have found the same notes.<br/><br/>By having the movie focus on a beauty pageant, I suspect that the point was to take shots at those disturbing Under-12 displays that turn little girls into Bratz Dolls and remind one - unnervingly - of Jon Benet Ramsey. Olive's embarrassing dance number, a half jiggle-fest, half striptease to Rick James' ""Super Freak"" left me wondering what the writers were thinking.<br/><br/>My basic problem with Little Miss Sunshine is that it's just not funny. I like road pictures that are about human discovery but when it's a comedy, I expect a few laughs. The movie is less of a comedy and more of a study of human nature.

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a very funny film. The writing is smart, the acting is pitch perfect, and the adept direction from the husband and wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris keeps the film rolling along at a charming pace, much like the yellow VW bus that carries the Hoover family from Fresno, AZ to Rodondo Beach, CA for a beauty pageant.<br/><br/>While the writing is sharp, it is really the performances that make this film what it is. The whole cast is in fine form, but two really stand out: Grandpa (Alan Arkin), and Olive (Abigail Breslin), the eldest and youngest, respectively, of the Hoover clan. They have a chemistry that is enchanting and utterly believable, and their relationship is the rock that anchors the film. <br/><br/>Also notable are Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as Richard and Sheryl, the mom and dad of the family. Collette is engaging as always; playing yet another stressed out mom, but with honesty and grace, again, as she always does. And Kinnear, who is growing on me with every film he does, brings a wonderful nervous determination to his role as an aspiring motivational speaker. <br/><br/>Rounding out the cast is the depressed odd couple of Dwayne and Uncle Frank, played dryly by Paul Dano and Steve Carell. They are more spectators than participants, as compared to the rest of the family, but their subdued commentary on the absurdity that transpires provides a good balance to their more electric relatives. <br/><br/>The film is very enjoyable, aside from a disturbing array of child beauty queens, whose presence is funny until you learn that they are played by real beauty pageant veterans, complete with their real costumes and makeup, which make them look more like prepubescent Real Dolls than actual human girls. At one point during a pageant, Richard asks the man next to him, ""Is your daughter in the competition?"" to which the man replies, after removing an earplug, ""First time?"". <br/><br/>Hints of pedophilia notwithstanding, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a fine film, and may find itself regarded as a classic in years to come."

","The new style of 'independent' movies made in the States, sentimental, illiterate, sentimental, badly-constructed, and did I mention sentimental? Not one plot point is believable starting with why are they all in the van. Everything that happens after they get in the van is a clich√©. The 'professor' has clearly never read Proust - I doubt the writers have either. I found it hard to believe he'd ever been to a university. And all the clap-trap about following your dreams was laughable. Alan Arkin was about the best thing in it but he's only in a couple of scenes. For this he gets awards?<br/><br/>Beats me why this dreck has the reputation that it does. It's like Capra remade by the brain- dead."
"Buddy-51","8","2","8","22 August 2006"," fun family road picture but where are the seatbelts?
","Death, drug addiction, attempted suicide, emotional instability - these are just a few of the elements that make up what is fast turning into the sleeper hit comedy of 2006 - ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" in which an extended family of six piles into its rickety minivan and takes a thousand mile road trip from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Newport Beach, California, so that their daughter can compete in a beauty pageant for pre-teen girls. Needless to say, the family experiences many colorful and lesson-instilling adventures along the way.<br/><br/>The characters, for the most part, fall into that category that anyone familiar with independent movie-making will instantly recognize as the ""photogenically dysfunctional."" That is to say each has his own individualized ""quirk"" stamped onto his character to make him both ""weird"" and ""recognizable"" at the same time. The father, Frank (Greg Kinnear), is a win-at-all-costs motivational speaker who has designed a nine-step program for success that he expects not only his clients but his own family members to internalize and follow. Cheryl (Toni Collette) is his generally pragmatic wife whose relative sanity is the only thing that seems to be keeping the rest of the family from spinning off into unrestrained movie quirkdom. Frank's father (Alan Arkin) is a cantankerous, heroin-sniffing old man who cusses a blue streak, obsesses over pornography, and says everything that is on his mind no matter how politically incorrect in nature. Frank (Steve Carell) is Cheryl's morose gay brother who has just been released from a mental hospital for a failed suicide attempt. Dwayne (Paul Dano) is the teenaged son who wants to be an Air Force pilot and has taken a vow of silence until he reaches that goal. Finally, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the adorable little moppet with dreams of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant and who seems, along with her mother, to be the one levelheaded thinker in the group.<br/><br/>This is, for the most part, a charming, extremely well acted film that can be very entertaining provided one doesn't go into it expecting too much. The conflicts and interactions among the various characters are often sharp and shrewdly observed, and directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris keep the tone and pace of the film lighthearted and breezy (even in its darker moments). The screenplay by Michael Arndt walks a fine line between cynicism and sentiment, only occasionally stumbling along the way. Unfortunately, about halfway through the film, one of the most engaging and entertaining characters drops off the radar screen, and his absence is definitely felt. There are also a few too many sitcom level routines and situations, and the scene at the beauty pageant comes perilously close to endorsing the very thing - the sexualizing of pre-pubescent girls - that the film is supposed to be savaging (although I can see where the filmmakers could mount a counter argument to me here, but I'm not sure it would be all that convincing).<br/><br/>Although all the performers are fine, Toni Collette is really the one who brings this film to life. In portraying the one generally ""normal"" adult on hand, Collette lets reasonableness and common sense guide her reactions to the near-surrealistic events that are happening to them. And young Abigail Breslin is a natural-born scene-stealer.<br/><br/>Apart from its few flaws (including the fact that not a single one of the six riders in the car - not even the little girl - is ever seen wearing a seatbelt), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a winning film that seems to be saying that, good, bad or indifferent, family is what really matters in the end."

","Maybe it's me. This isn't a bad movie; I was only moved to write a neutral/negative review after reading page after page of gushes. Somebody's publicist really deserves a raise!!! I don't know - I was expecting/hoping for something more like Death To Smoochy or American Beauty or Memento. You know; a tried and true plot with a unique, dark and twisted POV. Well developed characters, often playing against type. Strong dialogue. Great performances from a good ensemble cast.<br/><br/>I have no beef with the cast or the performances. Toni Collette's reputation made me sit through most of Sixth Sense. She still owes me for that! She's great here, as usual. The rest are good to great (little Olive); Alan Arkin, Toni Collette's godfather of sorts, does a lot with what should have been excrement.<br/><br/>The film succeeds, I suppose, by being good enough for viewers like me, who didn't really like it, to bother commenting on it. Call it disappointment, I guess. I know that I'm usually in the minority, especially when it comes to films. I can see the staple marks, the editing, the overacting, and I've never even wanted to be a film student or actor. I'm just a fan.<br/><br/>Over 90% of the people whom I saw the film with loved it. That has to carry some weight. 59 million people voted for Dubya Bush even after the tragedy of his first term. So I'm not telling you what is or isn't good for you. If you like good, mainstream movies you'll probably like this. If you like indie films and have a generally positive attitude, you'll like it. If you like a good strong cast and the mashing together of lots of scenes you've seen before in dozens of other movies, you'll like this.<br/><br/>If you're expecting subversion, nuance or good old fashioned noir, you'll probably feel ripped off."

"markstenroos","2","1","3","30 January 2015"," Overrated and really quite awful.
","This movie was a MAJOR disappointment for me as it features so many gifted comic actors whom I otherwise love.<br/><br/>But the premise of this movie is so beyond belief that it's nearly unwatchable. Great comedy has to have some connection to reality. Yet time and again, this movie fails miserably in that respect by presenting situations and behaviors that are beyond belief.<br/><br/>I'll give you one example: a couple of times in the movie, the travelers need to get out and push-start their VW van. Their very young daughter participates in this ritual, which is seen a couple of times. Once the van gets going, the ""pushers"" need to run alongside the van and jump in as it gains speed.<br/><br/>Now ask yourself: 1. just how much help would a pre-teen child be in physically push-starting a van?, and 2. what family with ANY semblance of responsibility would have a child do such a thing? I'd think that roughly 100% of families would realize that the little girl's physical efforts add NOTHING to getting the van started while risking danger to her life by having her jump into a moving van.<br/><br/>Of course, the director sees this staged scene as distilling the essence of the flick, even using a still from one of these scenes as the promotional icon for the film.<br/><br/>And so goes the rest of this flick, with similar caricatures of human behavior littering the screen.<br/><br/>Worse, the movie is incredibly predictable. It's just a matter of in what order which unbelievable behavior will occur.<br/><br/>Just awful."

"Boba_Fett1138","9","1","3","8 November 2011"," Very rich on its characters.
","It's funny that while this movie was really liked and praised at the time, there are more and more people now days who are dogpiling on it, in a negative way. I guess it makes this movie a case of you'll either love it or hate it. I for one absolutely loved it! <br/><br/>For me this is how a Wes Anderson movie should be like. Wes Anderson movies are independent ones with a very subtle and minimalistic/realistic approach to its comedy and feature all kinds of odd and just plain quirky characters in it. It's the same sort of style and approach that this movie uses, only difference is that in this movie it actually did work for me, as opposed to Wes Anderson his movies, which I more often just hate- than like to watch really. In that regard I also have some sympathy for those that did not like this movie at all. When it's not your type of movie, it simply isn't your type of movie. The comedy, the subtlety, the story, the situations, the characters, it all might be something that some people just aren't able to appreciate or like about this movie.<br/><br/>Key to me as to why I liked this movie, as opposed to Wes Anderson movies for instance, was the movie wasn't being pretentious at all about its style and wasn't showing, what I would like to call, any independent film consciousness. It was simply being a very honest and straightforward movie, about the simple little things and what makes things so beautiful or tough to live through at times.<br/><br/>This in itself of course would not had been good or interesting enough to create an entire movie around but luckily the movie managed to throw in plenty of subtle and somewhat dark humor, as well as a whole bunch of very well written characters. Everybody in this movie has so much depth and all of the main characters are some real likable ones. They have great, though also very exaggerated, personalities that keep the movie going at all times and is also what makes the movie such a rich filled, warm and likable one.<br/><br/>For what its worth, this really was a movie that made me feel happy, though the story in itself is not a very happy one. It was more the way the character's dealt with all of their issues or crazy problems they ran into that made this movie a very heartfelt one. It's a real family movie, not in the terms of that this is a movie you can watch with your whole family, but more that this is a movie that is all about the family bond and unconditional love for each other.<br/><br/>The movie was obviously very dependent on its characters, in order to let the overall story and style and approach of the movie to work out. And it's not just thanks to the writing or the directing approach that they indeed all work out but also really due to its casting and cast. I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying that everybody got perfectly cast in this movie. Even actors who I'm normally not very impressed with, such as Greg Kinnear, simply did an amazing job. I was also really surprised by Steve Carell, who didn't played a goofy comedy role for a change but a far more subtle one and he was absolutely great at it. It makes you wish that he would do more movies and movie roles like this and stop wasting his talent on lame comedies. But like I said, every actor in this movie deserves lots of praise and it also would eventually be Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin who would be nominated for an Oscar as well. Alan Arkin was the only one that eventually also won. There was an Oscar as well for its script, which I'm also really happy about and think this is something this movie truly deserved.<br/><br/>The only regret I have was that I didn't watch this movie any sooner.<br/><br/>9/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","In Little Miss Sunshine, then ten year old Abigail Breslin plays seven year old Olive Hoover in the 2006 film. In Little Miss Sunshine, the Hoover family typically define dysfunctional; a father (played by Greg Kinnear) who has become so absorbed in his own motivational program that he no longer can tell when his business life ends and when his family life begins, a heroin snorting grandfather (played by Alan Arkin), a brother who refuses to speak until he reaches his goal of becoming an air pilot (played by Paul Dano), an uncle(played by Steve Carell) who tries to fight his inner demons by attempting suicide, and a loving mother caught in the middle of all of this (played by Toni Collette). Olive is a cute seven year old with her sights set on becoming the newest Little Miss Sunshine so much, that she mimics pageant winners on television. Complications dictate that the family has to make the trip from Albuquerque, NM together in their nearly run-down, yellow VW bus to Redondo Beach, CA where the pageant is to be held.

The direction, the writing, everything is just brilliant. The acting of the whole family are brilliant as they all bring their characters to life. Alan Arkin is hilarious as Edwin, the foul-mouthed grandfather who has been kicked out of his old retirement home for drug use, as is Greg Kinnear as Richard, the pompous motivational speaker father, who shows an amazing emotional turn when something horrible happens to the family. However, it is Paul Dano that ultimately steals the show with his role of Dwayne, a troubled teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he can accomplish his dream of becoming a test pilot. Throughout the film he bottles up his emotions, until he finds something out about himself, and his emotions just come falling out, with a nice moment between Dwayne and his pageant-queen sister, Olive played by Abigail Breslin. It is Dano who utters one of the best lines in the film.<br/><br/>Look for this film and watch it, you will not regret it."
"Imdbidia","8","1","3","16 March 2011"," Fresh, fun and meaningful
","A road movie about a dysfunctional family trying to take the little girl to a beauty pageant interstate. An incredibly fresh, witty and enthralling movie with freak and quirky characters, brilliant dialogs, great performances by all actors, and a story that is never boring.<br/><br/>I want to highlight four elements that make of this film a great one. <br/><br/>The first one, is that a dysfunctional and somewhat/sometimes freak family is depicted in a non-judgmental way. They epitomize the dysfunctions that most families, called normal have. The viewer feels that the family is freaky, but at the same time as normal. There is a lot of empathy in the way the movie shows them to the viewer.<br/><br/>The second element is a subtle criticism of the ideal of the American dream and of the self-help tools addressed to turn anybody into a famous rich person. The character of the father -so well played by Greg Kinnear- epitomizes the bullshit that these messages can have, pushing us to fight for success no matter what, following recipes that usually lead to failure and fracas, for which they don't provide any recipe. The mother --played by Toni Collete- is instead the voice of common sense, and a much more successful person in that regard.<br/><br/>The third element is the very cleaver non non-confrontational criticism of child beauty pageants. The script poses a rhetorical question, what happens to the little girl going to the beauty pageant being the answer,one with which the viewer agrees without hesitation. The question is, what is freakier, a beautiful child sexually dressed wearing slutty make up who poses and moves in an adult way, or an innocent girl who sings and dances to a raunchy song that she does not understand?<br/><br/>In fact, it is what happens to the little freaky girl what shows that the family is not that freaky after all, and that appearances are always deceiving. The family does not push the girl into the contest, does not force her to dress or behave in a certain way, does not dress her as little prostitute, does not expect anything from here, just supports her the whole way, even when everybody turns against her. The other parents, the ""normal"" ones, appear as real freaks after all, projecting their frustrated dreams and aims into their little kids, tools to mask their personal failure. All of the sudden, the dysfunctional family is just normal, warm and caring, the others just the opposite. Not that dysfunctional after all.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie gives us so many iconic images that imprint our retinas with strength -- The pushing of the van and the music, the girl singing ""super freak"", the escape from the hospital, among many others.<br/><br/>The movie could have been pretentious, obscure, too simplistic, unclear, but it is nothing of this. You have a great time at watching this movie, but it makes you think. What else do you want?!"

Yeah, it was probably supposed to have ended that way, but it made it seem so undone. It seemed like it had no climax in the movie. I also think that it wasn't as funny as everyone claimed it was. Sure it was pretty funny, but it wasn't ""laugh out loud oh my god I gotta tell everyone I know about this movie"" funny. It was ""ha-ha whats the next joke"" funny. It was exceptionally funny, but something was off, something is missing. I must admit that Abigail Breslin did a fantastic job and made that movie ten times better.

"Otoboke","Null","1","3","7 October 2007"," Heartwarming and Original Comedy.
","Little Miss Sunshine is a wonderfully made film that is unique comical and sentimental to the viewer's heart.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest thing about the movie is its characters that are all developed into fully realistic dynamic people who by the end of the film you feel connected to and care about their eventual outcome. Both the script and the actors collaborate successfully from beginning to end, creating characters that will stay with you for some time, but more importantly will keep your eyes glued to the screen during the film itself.<br/><br/>The film's soundtrack is mostly well mixed into the film but there unfortunately were a few moments where it distracted from the film and didn't gel well with the action on screen. As a whole however, the film boasts a great soundtrack and suitably bright photography that brings the story to the senses nicely and with vivid effect.<br/><br/>If there is one problem I had with the film it was its central plot. Don't get me wrong, I loved each character's own subplots, but I felt the main feature -although well developed- was a little dry and needed a little more to it in order to bond together with the individual character's stories more successfully. On the other hand, the lack of plot did help bring out character's and allowed a good sense of pace consistent throughout, even if it was a little on the slow side.<br/><br/>Overall, Little Miss Sunshine is a great watch and certainly surprised me on many fronts. I can't say it met my expectations regarding all the praise it is has had from critics, but it was an enjoyable ride for what it was worth."

","Family values have been an ""it"" thing in theaters ever since the medium was invented, yet somehow the genre keeps producing fresh entries every few years. In 2006, it reached a new height when both critics and audiences as one praised the independent hit that could - Little Miss Sunshine. A dark tale about a malfunctioning family, this road trip comedy is a touching drama that makes you feel for each and every one of the characters without retrieving even once to genre clich√©s.<br/><br/>The cast of LMS is made up of incredible B-list actors who are way unappreciated for their cumulative works. Academy Award nominee, 11 year-old Abigail Breslin (Signs, Raising Helen), delivers the performance of her lifetime as Olive Hoover, a precocious little girl who scores a place in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty competition by default. Thing is, Olive is funny looking and not all that talented, but there isn't a soul in sight to tell her that. Her father Richard (Greg Kinnear, Academy Award nominee for As Good as it Gets) is a failed motivational speaker; her uncle Frank (Steve Carrel, in a wonderful detour from his usual shenanigans) recently tried to commit suicide; her brother Dwayne (Paul Dano, The Girl Next Door) is under a willing vow of silence and loathes the very essence of his family; and her grandfather Edwin (Alan Arkin, who received a long deserved Oscar for his role) seems to be the only understanding soul around, but also takes drugs and is obsessed with porn during his free time. Olive's desperate mother, Sheryl (Toni Collette, Academy Award nominee for The Sixth Sense), is determined to let Olive compete in the competition, which is held on the other side of the US, and manages to gather the malfunctioning members of the family in their VW mini-bus. <br/><br/>From here on out, a macabre-yet-invigorating chain of events begins, thrusting the family into absurd scenarios and eventually bringing them closer together. On their road trip from hell, the Hoovers experience run-ins with the law, car trouble, sibling rivalry and the ultimate test of them all ¬ñ a beauty pageant for little girls. During this chain of events, however, they learn to appreciate and even love one another, and get to deliver a strong message against exploiting preteens working within the fashion industry.<br/><br/>You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to hug the adorable Olive, but most of all you'll smile. This memorable little drama is a tour de force of talent in display, and a perfect original film who stands out in a world of sequels, remakes and huge franchises."

I mean sure, its a comedy, but simply shoving it into this genre does no justice whatsoever to how good the film actually is. Because of what i had heard about Little Miss Sunshine before seeing it, i was more or less expecting a smart, and funny film with something to say about life. And that's exactly what i found, but so much more.I certainly wasn't prepared for the emotional depth of the characters,the,in places, stunning cinematography (i was especially impressed with the camera work in the opening sequence) and one of the best feel good endings i've seen in a while! The main point i want to get across is that its not everyday that i see a film that makes me think 'wow' and actually inspires decisions in my own life. Three kings, American beauty, and Rain man made me feel similar, just to name a few. However i realise that the film would not affect everyone in this way, some people may miss the point all together. but for those who want to see a group of people with more messed up lives than your own trying to tackle bizarre circumstances with life-affirming results, then you're in for a real treat..."

I don't know who considers it to be a good one, critics with a bad sense of judgment maybe, critics that don't mind swearing and have a very poor set of values maybe, I don't know. Actually, I wish I would never have watched it, it left a very ""bad taste in my mouth"". If you don't want to be offended, don't watch it. I cannot believe that this movie is considered ""good""! This is nothing but a trashy movie. I was horribly disappointed to say the least. If this is what Hollywood considers to be good, I would say this world is in a sorry state of values. Grandpa's swearing was very offensive and Olive's debut scene also an offensive one! I give it a minus, minus, minus zero."
"Luuk-2","6","1","3","20 April 2007"," What a bummer!
","How superficial can a film get? This one certainly does its level best to outdo its predecessors. I was mildly amused when I watched the film, but just as sometimes films become better after reflecting on them, others deteriorate, and I am afraid this film falls into the latter group. Not one of the characters has any depth, they are all stereotypes, from the heroin abusing grandfather, to the vaguely Christian mother, the mad-at-the-world 15 year old, the loser father ... do I need to go on? None of the characters say or do anything worth remembering after the film is over. The plot is paper thin, and the actual shooting, scenery, props, insipid to the extreme. In short, I fail to see why this film ever got made."

","I enjoyed Little Miss Sunshine. If I enjoyed watching a movie I do not hesitate to give a 9 or 10 score. The general theme of this movie was about ""family"". Even though the family was going through difficult times, they all pulled together for one another when it mattered. From the film, it was quite obvious that the family members had communication problems with one another to some degree. They all speak to one another, they were hearing each other, but no one was ""listening"" to what the other person had to say. The grandfather was the funniest character in the film. The ending was original and surprisingly unexpected with Abigail Breslin stripping to Rick James's ""she's a freak"". In the end, they pulled together and supported one another, that is what a family is!"

A terrific and fresh script paves the way for fine performances and, best of all, a plain old good story. Each character is fleshed out in full and Alan Arkin more than deserved his Oscar as Granpa who tells the wisdom of ages like never before. Eddie Murphy, young in comparison, still has plenty of time to flex his acting chops. Steve Carrell takes a welcome dramatic turn as uncle Frank, formerly suicidally depressed from work and life stresses. Then there is, of course, young newcomer Abigail Breslin as Olive in what can only be a career starting role.<br/><br/>Fresh, hilarious, honest and even touching - all the reasons people go to the movies. --- 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R for profanity.

"femaleanimefan","10","1","3","15 March 2007"," Hilarious, a totally must see
","This film is an instant classic. It starts with a very dramatic opening, and turns into a hilarious dramedy about a dysfunctional family on the road from New Mexico to California. It has a brilliant script and a shiny plot. I loved this movie from beginning to end. And so will you.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Sheryl(Toni Collette) going to pick up her brother, Frank(Steve Carrell), a homosexual who has just recently tried to kill himself. She takes him home to her house to live with her for a while. Her family includes her overachiever husband, Richard(Greg Kinnear), her silent son, Dwayne(Paul Dano), adorable daughter Olive(Abigail Breslin) and of course, Grandpa(Alan Arkin). During dinner, Sheryl gets a phone call on the answering machine saying that Olive can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pagient. Olive runs around the house packing yelling, ""I WON!"". Therefore, all the Hoovers are going to California.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful! Abigail Breslin is one of the cutest kids ever. She is a great actress and pulls off Olive so well. Richard, the overachieving father, is played by Greg Kinnear, who i am normally not a fan of, but he pulled off Richard very convincingly. I liked him. Toni Collette as Sheryl was so great. She could totally hide her Australian accent perfectly. Of course you got Grandpa! Alan Arkin is absolutely HILARIOUS as Grandpa. He totally added great humour to the story. Then you got Steve Carrell. Really funny as the depressed homosexual. Very convincing and very funny. In my opinion, there are two performances(although they all rocked) that stood out the most. Of course, little Abigail, and then you have Paul Dano. He was amazing as Dwayne. I found that he and Frank sort of bonded on the trip. They both never really smiled at all and they used great comedy. Dano's character doesn't say a single word until the middle/near the end. His character has taken a vow of silence until he can become a pilot. His scene where he finally talks is kind of emotional yet SO funny! I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who wants to laugh and maybe even cry at the same time. Rent it or buy it. Either way watch this film. It is excellence. It deserves its top 250 spot. Though maybe even higher.<br/><br/>P.S. This isn't a kids movie. There is bad language and drugs in this one. But kids from 12+ can handle that."

"MovieMaster92","8","1","3","10 March 2007"," A Well-Rounded Performance by Everyone
","When I first heard of ""Little Miss Sunshine"", I thought it was an interesting idea for a movie. Its concept was new, fresh, and had never been done before. But it wasn't the endearing story that I was really impressed with. What I was really impressed by was the performance by each of the talented actors.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" carries a cast of pretty colorful characters, including Alan Arkin as a sex-obsessed heroin addict for a grandfather, and Steve Carell as a a homosexual man, who, after losing the man he loves, as well as his title as #1 scholar in America, attempts suicide. The cast also includes Paul Dano as a disturbed teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his goal to be an Air Force pilot, Greg Kinnear as a motivational speaker for his ""9 Steps to Becoming a Winner"", Toni Collette as a mom who tries to be optimistic even when she knows things are falling apart, and, of course, we can't forget about Abigail Breslin's performance as Olive, an excited 7 year-old who is determined to win the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in Redondo Beach, CA. These were very different roles for all of the actors, and showed their incredible range of talent. This especially goes for Steve Carell, who spends most of his time being the boss of ""The Office"", where it doesn't require a whole lot of acting. Abigail Breslin definitely applies here, too. She's definitely not that little girl from ""Raising Helen"" anymore, and her Academy Award nomination was well deserved.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" won the 2007 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and Alan Arkin received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. It has received 28 more wins and 34 more nominations for various awards. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a treat and I would recommend it for anyone over the age of 13."
"I_Am_The_Taylrus","9","1","3","8 March 2007"," One Of The Best Films Of 2006 (SPOILERS)
","SPOILERS <br/><br/>I had never seen this movie since about two hours ago. When I first saw the trailer of this movie I thought that I would not really enjoy this type of movie. When it got into the IMDb's Top 250 and actually got nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards I had to check this out. I was pleasantly surprised. This was a terrific movie with some of the best acting and some of the best cast of 2006. There are funny and quirky moments yet there are really dramatic moments. However, I thought taking Grandpa's dead body out of the hospital and into the van was a bit over-the-top, but it was hilarious and wrong nonetheless.<br/><br/>Here is the plot of this movie. A mangled family has to pile into a broken van to get to a beauty pageant for young Olive. There is Richard, the father that has an unsuccessful book, the mother Sheryl, and her gay and suicidal brother Frank. There is the dirty Grandpa, there is Olive, who is going to be in the pageant, and there is her brother Dwayne, who wants to be a pilot and is only going for the flying lessons. Who is also not talking. Basically everything goes wrong. The Grandpa dies from an overdose and they steal the body, they are pulled over, their horn on the car does not work, Dwayne realizes he is color-blind and can not become a pilot, and much more. They finally get to the pageant. Olive does a little type of dance that was taught by Grandpa, which can not be good. When she gets booed the family joins in, and they are arrested. They get out and go home.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic movie. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2006 and you can not miss this movie. This movie may be about a Clark Griswold type of road-trip, but if you look at this movie a couple of times you will realize that it is about a disgruntled family finally becoming close, in some sort of deranged way. Anyway, this is a great and heartwarming and hilarious and funny movie that totally deserved every award and nomination that is had gotten, whether it is the Golden Globes or the Academy Awards or even the Independent Spirit Awards.<br/><br/>9/10 <br/><br/>Recommended Films: Vacation."
"kenjha","7","1","3","7 March 2007"," Little is right
","Film about a family heading west to have their little girl participate in a beauty contest is entertaining but hardly the great film many have made it out to be and lacks originality. The plot seems to be a reworking of ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" including the routine about the dead grandparent in the car, except that the humor is darker and it's not as funny as the Chevy Chase movie. The cast is good, particularly Arkin in his Oscar-winning role of the foul-mouthed patriarch. Breslin is cute without being cloying. The plot is far-fetched and predictable and the characters are basically caricatures. It's amusing enough but how could it possibly get nominated for Best Picture Oscar?"
"nycritic","9","1","3","5 March 2007"," A Genuine Surprise
","I believe that the clever marketing of this fantastic movie made people come back in larger and larger crowds until it couldn't be ignored that it was a force to be acknowledged because as advertised, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE had the makings of a straight-forward comedy. When seen in its entirety however, it reveals itself as much more -- a deeply complex dramedy that burrows under the skin of these extremely dysfunctional people locked together in a make-or-break road trip. It couldn't have been released at a better time -- the height of summer, when releases have the look and feel of desperation due to the fact that they've been shelved to the end of the summer blockbuster season and thrown at the public like ragged leftovers.<br/><br/>This one is a winner in every aspect. It's actually a rather dark movie, dealing with subject matters that are hardly the basis for laughter. Dad (Greg Kinnear) is not a nice person: he believes in winning at all costs and has this thing about self-help that borders on crazy, more so because he himself is a brittle man. Mom (Toni Collette) is trying to help her gay brother (Steve Carell) out who has attempted suicide over a romantic abandonment. Dwayne (Paul Dano) has his own issues with his family, which he hates. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) has a heroin addiction and has the subtlety of a self-conscious train wreck. Olive (Abigail Breslin), the little girl at the center of all this mess, is the glue who ties them together when they threaten to fray at the seams, is remarkable.<br/><br/>Olive has by chance, won a pass to participate in a beauty contest. However, she doesn't look or act like any of these little girls who have been groomed since babyhood into becoming pint-sized women -- aspiring Jon-Benets. The contest is to be held in California, and off they go in a broken-down VW bus (often seen in the movies promos). Of course... this is where the limits of tolerance will come to light, and where the movie takes its incursion into much darker areas masked under the banana yellow of the van.<br/><br/>LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE doesn't have any standout images, or clever editing to boast. Tremendous acting by the entire ensemble, although Alan Arkin gets dropped off the plot a little too soon -- I wanted more, but that's okay. There's also never a moment when you doubt this family of misfits, and the sequence when Olive takes the stage is a showstopper in its clumsiness because it's been hinted all along she doesn't fit into this mold -- not because she's not beautiful, a winner in her own right, but because she's too good to be degraded like that. Which is what the movie in its own is -- much too good to be penned into any given audience, much too good to be bogged down by merits. It's really the story of the little film that could."
"FMACDONALD","10","1","3","5 March 2007"," Finally!! A Comedy Nominated For Best Picture, That's Actually Funny
","Usually comedies that get the best picture nod are not that good. The Full Monty was not funny, and Four Wedding & A Funeral was even worse. However there was something about Little Miss Sunshine that made me want to go to my local video store and rent it. Maybe it was because Steve Carell was in it? I don't know. Regardless I am happy to say that I am glad I rented this and I would have payed full price to see this movie.<br/><br/>In the film we meet the Hoover's. There's father Richard (Greg Kinnear) who is trying to get his ""nine step"" self motivation program off the ground, and finding little to no success. Then there is mother Sheryl (Toni Collette) who is the sole bread earner in the family and not doing well. Then there's uncle Frank (Steve Carell) who is a genius, but has failed at trying to commit suicide because he was dumped by his lover. There also Dwayne (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence till he can get into the air force. There's also Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a foul mouthed, heroine snorting old man, who has been kicked out of his old age home because of his drug addiction. Last but not least is Olive (Abigail Breslin) the youngest of the family who has dreams of becoming Miss America some day.<br/><br/>Needless to say the Hoover's are an extremely dysfunctional family who can not see eye to eye. Then Olive gets a phone call that tells her she has been invited to compete is The Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant, and the dysfunctional family piles into their broken down old Volks Wagon hippie van, to get Olive to Califirnia to make her dream of competing come true.<br/><br/>Now some critics will try and use big words to explain how this movie is an artful masterpiece, but the truth is, L.M.S. is nothing more than a road trip movie that is a dry humor fest. Soem people might watch this and not understand why people find it so funny because there is no over acting (Jim Carrey anyone?) or any over the top zaniness going on. L.M.S. is more in the same place as The Ice Harvest, or The Princess Bride, and that's what makes this film work.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear gives a great performance, and proves that he should be in every dry comedy ever made. Toni Collette adds another good flick to her resume (Mariel's Wedding, The Sixth Sense) and proves she will win an Oscar some day. Steve Carell proves why he is the best comedic actor since John Cusak in Hollywood today, and can play perfect roles in zany comedies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin (My personal favorite comedy)and has a great dry sense of humor for a film like this. After seeing him in this film, my expectations for Evan Allmighty have grown even higher. Paul Dano, even though he does not speak brings some great laughs to the screen, and Abigail Breslin will become the kid star that Haley Joel Osmet was supposed to be.<br/><br/>The best thing about Little Miss Sunshine though is Alan Arkin, who won an Oscar for his role as the foul mouthed, drug addicted grandfather. He steals every scene he's in, and had me holding my sides. I've always felt this man was funny especially in The In-Laws (along with Peter Faulk) and Gresse Pointe Blank. He is finally getting the attention he deserves.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for something different, or just love a good dry comedy like I do, then go to the video store and rent Little Miss Sunshine. It's worth it."

","The title is very miss leading, but the film itself is truly fantastic. A very sweet comedy that is in no way offensive, or misleading it's all done with a smile and it has a very satisfying ending. The acting and chemistry between the characters is what keeps the film going at a splendid pace and it also manages to keep the audience keen. The films comedy is warm and never grotesque, even with some slightly interesting subject matters it maintains a dignity that, I personally think has been lost in comedy for a long time. In terms of scripting the film really excels and quite rightly it now has an Oscar to match its truly memorable writing. The director, though not doing anything we haven't seen before, manages to make some scenes really memorable, especially at the point in the film when the Little Miss Sunshine takes place.<br/><br/>All in all Little Miss Sunshine is an enjoyable comedy, with good values and sharp writing, and is really worth a watch whoever you are."
"harborrat28","7","1","3","28 February 2007"," Clich√©d W/ Some Funny Scenes & Cameo Characters
","This movie came highly recommended by a friend in the movie industry whose own tastes run to foreign, esoteric and intellectual. He described it as one of the best movies he's seen recently. With this in mind, I was very excited about seeing the film and, also, expecting an awful lot. I was disappointed.<br/><br/>First, the entire film hinges on an untenable postulate: an adorable, chubby, sweet, kind little girl from Alberquerque (Olive, played magnificently by Abigail Breslin) has won, by default, a beauty pageant and been invited to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine competition in California. Her coach is her grandfather, a heroin snorting, randy old man with a penchant for loud shirts, leather vests and T&A magazines. The rest of her family has never seen her routine and has had no part of designing her hair, make-up and costumes.<br/><br/>The Hoover family is entirely dysfunctional but each of the individual members is engaging in his or her strangeness. Indeed, these idiosyncratic characters are the movies strength and salvation. My favorite was Dwayne, the 15 year old son who is fascinated with Nietzche, has taken a vow of silence until he attains his objective of getting into the Air Force Academy to become a jet fighter pilot and is, at heart, a great kid.<br/><br/>The family speeds toward California in a decrepit bright-yellow VW bus that is used for rather clich√©d comic purposes, including attracting a clich√©d, potbellied, red-neck motorcycle cop who ultimately lets them off when he finds grandpa's T&A magazines in the back of the bus. I won't tell you what he, bigoted redneck stereotype that he is, fails to see right before his eyes in the process.<br/><br/>In California the Hoovers find that the pageant is really for air-brushed, powdered, big-haired 7 year olds dressed to look like Las Vegas showgirls (this was realism, not humor). The audience of the pageant is filled with other-America stereotypes, including one 400 pounder woman and a tattooed biker who is a follower of these shows and clearly comes for the bumps and grinds.<br/><br/>Then the ending! How merry. What a charming moral (I hear the director defended the stale jump-start-the-bus bits as a symbol of the family pulling together). Gag me with a spoon. But I guess this is Hollywood's vision of wholesome."

Many people in the world feel like they can relate to that. I love how they are all having their problems. Grandpa is on drugs. The dad is a person who thinks that people who don't think they can do it are total losers, and he's bankrupt. The mom is thinking about divorce to the dad. The uncle is a gay guy who wants to commit suicide. The son (Dwayne) is a colourblind kid who has taken a vow of silence and wants to join the air force. And Olive is the girl who is keeping them together as they take her to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. They seem to cope with everything, and seem to get along with each other in the end after a while. This is a fun, black comedy you'll want to see. Trust me. In fact, I think I'm going to see it again sometime soon."

When you watch this movie, you will experience laughter, and amazement of the unique ability of this movie. But along with every movie, there is also some downfalls. This is no exception. This movie had a lot of language, sexual reference, and things like that. There is really *tons* of language that I thought was disturbing. It made me wander..why? I don't think anyone liked this movie any better because of the language..I thought the language part was just awful. This movie talks a lot about porn and homosexuality.

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is without a doubt one of the most endearingly family movies in film history. The Hoover family is certainly likable and down to earth, but each have their own faults some very dark. It all begins with over-caring mother(Toni Collette) who lends support to her depressed and homosexual college professor brother(Steve Carell) who just got away from the hospital after a suicide attempt, moves in with the family. To further bring differences the household is rounded out by a hard working father(Greg Kinnear) who is trying to sell his motivational success as a book, but the sales pitch has little success among both family and his employers. The dark person in the family is certainly grandpa(Alan Arkin) who's brilliant as a foul-mouthed extrovert who's very profane with a snorting heroin habit. Now the children of the family are different as daylight and dark, the son(Paul Dano)who's taken a vow of silence to reach his goal, pales in comparison to the daughter(Abigail Breslin) who's bright and adorable as an average little girl with above average dreams of someday being Miss America. The journey and complex light of these people all come together when they take a road trip from their New Mexico home to California so little Olive can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. The family just creeps along in their white and yellow VW bus which is running on it's last legs. Along the way you see this family as very dysfunctional and their souls appear tortured, but as a whole all seem to roll along together. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a film about an unbending family wanting to be winners, and it's nice to see a film that highlights a common family with real and believable problems, proving it's not always if you win but how you play your game, and it's important to get enjoyment out of your experiences and journeys. Some of the scenes are memorable and all performances are good, but the work of Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin is super."

","Little Miss Sunshine, the laugh out loud comedy, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and written by Michael Arndt is an inspired work of comedy, acting and cinematography. <br/><br/>When young Olive, brilliantly played by Abigail Breslin, is flung into the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant at the list minute, her slightly off kilter family packs into their VW Bus and heads off on a long road trip, so she can compete. Richard, Greg Kinnear's character, takes the driver's seat, in every respect. Richard treats life and his family like his 9 step program to self improvement. Paul Dano plays Olive's brother Dwayne. Dwayne has committed to a vow of silence until he can become a test pilot. Alan Arkin plays Olive's drug using, potty mouthed, sassy grandpa. Sheryl, played by Toni Collette, is the nurturing and insecure mother. Steve Carell wraps up the family tree as Uncle Frank, the suicidal scholar who can't be left alone. <br/><br/>The writing in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a flawless work of timeless comedy with a sprinkling of ageless wit. Writer Michael Arndt drives this movie from somber to strange and right on to silly. Arndt uses all different kinds of comedy, as if he was creating a fine sauce and avoids making cinematic gruel. Each of these characters' personalities are so incredibly rich, you feel that you've known these people for years. Even more still, I felt that each of the characters is a little bit like me. It is hard to make me laugh audibly, but there was no shortage of snorts and laughter coming from me during ""Little Miss Sunshine."" <br/><br/>It's rare that an entire cast gives an equally exceptional performance but from now on we'll be able to point to ""Little Miss Sunshine"" as an example of just that. The more anomalous performances in a film, the exponentially better the film's quality. <br/><br/>In order to deal with his own insecurities, Richard tries to fix his entire family. He sees them all as losers waiting for his 9 step program. Kinnear performance left me wanting to strangle him, wanting to shake him and laughing at him. Richard is not intentionally funny; his disconnect from reality is unintentionally so. Still Kinnear does a great job of portraying Richard's insecure mess. <br/><br/>Paul Dano's role is even more difficult. As you find out in the first few minutes of the movie, Dwayne doesn't speak. His distain and contempt for his family may be perfectly adolescent but playing such disgust with no words is a feat unto itself. Dano's ability to show his emotion clearly and unambiguously but with out over acting his mannerisms is admirable and painfully funny.<br/><br/>Sheryl keeps the plot from getting stuck on any one character. She is constantly trying to protect people's feelings and end fights. She feels responsible for the welfare of every member of her family and it seems that no one feels responsible for her welfare. Toni Collette never gets over emotional or secure. Her performance is deeply complex and yet, simple to understand. Her wavering strength is relatable and hysterical.<br/><br/>Dry hilarity is the only way to explain Steve Carell's masterful performance. Frank is depressing, his struggles for love saddening and yet, you can't stop laughing at the situations he and his depression creates. Carell's character is quick with sarcasm which is perfectly timed and poignantly placed. <br/><br/>Alan Arkin gives new meaning to, ""Too old to care"" as Grandpa. After years of having to care what people thinks, Grandpa doesn't care anymore. He does and says what he wants, when he wants to whomever he wants. His high jinks and wild ideas give the movie some of its most memorable moments. He and young Olive have a special relationship that makes the end of the movie nearly bladder emptying and touching. <br/><br/>Young Abigail Breslin made me laugh more than any other character in the movie. Her performance is unrestrained by adult convention. Olive's innocence keeps the characters in check. Breslin gives such a fearless life to Olive, her performance should be a highlight, even if she becomes an adult actor. <br/><br/>The cinematography in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is exceptional. Every single scene's light, angle and composition are well planned and the attention to detail almost makes the movie worth watching with the sound off. It's obvious that Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris as well as Director of Photography, Tim Suhrstedt, wanted to make sure that the way each scene was shot matched the current mood. <br/><br/>I think I spent more time laughing in this movie than not. It's no surprise that this film has earned the label ""Comedy"" and it is certainly no exaggeration to call it so. Yellow is now my favorite color."

The dialogue is never wasted, the actors are dead on with their respective characters. This is not a a film to be missed! The second time around it's even better when viewed. Personally, it makes a satire of beauty pageants and everything that is wrong with them, while staying true to the quirkiness of the characters involved."

","I love this movie soo much! I laughed more in this movie than any other recent movie. I highly recommend getting it. Steve Correl has such a subtle humor about him in this movie, and it makes it all the better. The story line is very original and will keep you holding your stomach due to excessive laughter. So many things that turn the story left and right and back and forth making it amazingly fun to watch. So I say get your bag of popcorn ready to be put in the microwave, start up the DVD player, grab a friend, and get ready to enjoy, in my opinion, the best movie to hit the big screen in years. You wont stop laughing, I promise. And if you do stop laughing, I'm sorry."

","I'm sure by now you've all heard about ""Little Miss Sunshine"", about its hilarious band of misfits otherwise known as the Hoover family, and of course about the plucky charm of 10 year old Abigail Breslin as would be beauty pageant queen Olive Hoover. The film has been praised by many critics as the best comedy in years. I'd say that's a fairly accurate judgment. This may not be the funniest film of the year (Borat!) or the most affecting (United 93) it's one of the most enjoyable films perhaps ever.<br/><br/>The story centers around the Hoover family: Richard (Motivational Speaker/Father) Sheryl (""Pro Honesty"" Mother) Grandpa (A heroin addict who's been kicked out of his retirement home) Dwayne (He has taken a vow of silence until he becomes a pilot.. and because of Nietzsche) and Uncle Frank (A suicidal gay Proust scholar who's lost his job and lover). And, of course Olive. Together this rag tag band embarks on a trip for California in a beat up VW bus. The group goal: Get Olive to the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty contest. Along the way the family encounters many mishaps while receiving many of Grandpa's pearls of wisdom (""Fuck a lot a' women kid. Not just one woman... a lot a' women). The humor however never seemed forced or random. All the behavior somehow seem appropriate inside the confines of each character and their personalities.<br/><br/>The entire cast is superb, without exception. Newcomer Abigail Bresin is quite the find as young Olive. Her performance deserves to be mentioned along with Tatum O'Neal and Anna Paquin as young Oscar hopefuls. However, the film isn't just stolen by, it is OWNED by Alan Arkin as the radical old Grandpa. It's a well written part especially for an ""actor's actor"" like Arkin. As an audience we enjoy seeing him as the self described ""voice of experience"".<br/><br/>With a sharp script and capable actors 'Little Miss Sunshine' arrives as one of this year's best and brightest films. It is also a film that will be able to survive multiple viewings due to comedic pacing and all around charm. Without a doubt, one of the year's best!"

So the youngest Olive (Abigail Breslin) finds out she has been accepted into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California so unwillingly the whole family must travel to California in a old yellow 70's Volkswagon that shouldn't be on the road.

One university professor is in love with a student who prefers his colleague who is also his main scholarly competitor. Hard to take so he blows his top, gets fired and commits suicide and even fails that. Another university professor who teaches positive thinking and being a winner in nine steps is unable to get a book published, in other words, is a loser himself. The grandfather of the house is on cocaine and is dreaming of a life of sex and sunshine he will never get. The son of the family has sworn never to say a word to anyone till he is accepted in the air force academy to become a pilot, and he is color-blind. No flying in these conditions. The seven year old daughter dreams of being the winner of a beauty contest in California and the whole film is about the whole family going there for the pageant. Quite an adventure and each step is a new catastrophe, a new development of losing on the greatest and biggest scale you can imagine. The car will conk out. One member of the happy family will die. A cop will stop them on the highway and they will be saved by a couple of skin magazines. They will be four minutes late to register. You name the obstacle and the handicap on the way to success, you can be sure they will have it. Up to the final finale that is the best ever and imaginable failure that is a perfect success though, but as a revenge against this paper chase and rat race society.

"monk_e_fish","8","1","3","7 November 2006"," Bittersweet funny ensemble road movie
","America is a country obsessed with success. The constant desire to be number one, the best of the best is what fuels the national image. It is a world of constant competition where everybody wants to be a winner, or in the words of Nietzsche obsessed teen Dwayne, ""life is one f**king beauty contest after another"". Little Miss Sunshine gives us the Hoover family, the embodiment of the disappointment that comes from chasing this American Dream of success but ultimately failing on every level. The obsession with winning permeates all through the film, from minor details like the rossettes pinned to the Hoover's pinboard and their relatives inability to take Olive to the beauty pageant because their horses are competing in ""nationals"" through to each character's desire to be the best. Motivational speaker Richard (Greg Kinnear) is desperate to spread his message of not being a loser, of bringing out the winner within to the extent that he constantly pushes this on his family even while he is clearly himself a loser in his inability to sell his ideas. Uncle Frank defines himself as being the country's preeminent Proust scholar and when his rival is given a genius grant above him, it drives him to attempt suicide. Meanwhile, little Olive is only able to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant as runner up in her regional competition after the winner was disqualified. This is a family who come off worse in everything they try and that is what makes them likable losers in this weird success obsessed America. As Tolstoy said ""all happy families are alike, unhappy families are unhappy in different ways."" Of course, there are no greater clich√©s in American independent cinema than the dysfunctional family and the road movie and Little Miss Sunshine doesn't escape from falling into a lot of these. The scenes of the van breaking down are funny but we've been there so many times before. However, it is an expertly made film which is more bitter than bittersweet up until the hilarious and genuinely heartwarming finale at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant itself, a sort of grotesque parody of adult beauty pageants (the smarmy MC of the show is particularly bad) and an event so weird and disturbing it's hard to believe it actually exists. Music video directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton give the film a bright but faded colour scheme that seems to reflect the character's high ambitions and their failures. In particular there is a strong recurring usage of yellow, from the Hoover's falling apart VW van to Dwayne's ""Jesus Was Wrong"" T-shirt. What really lifts this picture above the pack, though, is the performances and the genuinely touching relationships that develop between these disparate characters who individually may seem clich√©d dysfunctional family archetypes. Much of the laughs early on are generated by Alan Arkin's foul mouthed, drug taking grandpa but his mentoring and coaching of Olive is as touching as it is strange. Similarly, the way Frank's relationship with mute Dwayne gives them both someone to understand them is well done with the ""high school's your prime suffering years"" speech particularly affecting. Steve Carell excels in his role as the gay, suicidal Proust expert, displaying a talent for deadpan sarcasm and a genuine sense of suffering and depression untapped in his previous performances in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty. Special praise must also be given for young Abigail Breslin as Olive, the cheerfully optimistic yet insecure girl with the enormous glasses whose unlikely dream holds the whole family together. Resting such a weight of the movie on the shoulders of a child is often a big mistake but Breslin is adorably cute but also gives a surprisingly subtle performance with an impressive range. She brings out the best in the other characters, the ice cream in the diner scene being particularly good. It is undoubtedly one of the best child acting performances in a long time. While not being anything particularly new, Little Miss Sunshine is an entertaining, funny and well performed little picture about being one of life's losers and will certainly brighten up your day to see it. ****"

"Pulpmariachi","10","1","3","5 November 2006"," Hands Down, Best Movie of 2006
","It's hard to find a really good road movie. Most tend to have really great moments but are followed by long, drawn out sections that are kinda boring and making us as the viewer wish they'd go to funnier things. 'Transamerica' is a great movie, but it did drag on the road at times. Same with 'Vacation' and boatloads of other movies in that vein. Of course, then there are the absolutely down-right horrible road movies, like oh, I don't know...""Road Trip"" and pretty much all the Vacations that followed the original.<br/><br/>So we come to 'Little Miss Sunshine'. The film opens with a young girl (Abagail Breslin of 'Signs' fame--she's way better in this), who is about 7 or 8, staring directly at us. We know she's watching TV because a beauty pageant is reflected in her glasses that are about twice the size of John Lennon's.<br/><br/>What follows is a brief introduction of all the characters of the Hoover family. There's the son, Dwyane (Paul Dano from L. I. E.), who has been reading Nietchze and has decided that the only thing for him to do is to take a vow of silence until he can get into the Air Force Academy; he spends most of his time working out and reading 'Thus Spake Zarathustra.' Next comes the Grandpa (Alan Arkin) who just got kicked out of his retirement home for chasing the women and snorting heroin. The dad (Greg Kinnear) is attempting to become a self-help guru; he's bent on winning and sees losers as seem to be dragged along the sidewalk, yet his 9-step program isn't doing that fabulously. The Mom (Toni Collete, always great) really wants the family to stay together but there's just not enough time for everything. And then there's her brother, Frank (Steve Carell), who has just tried to commit suicide because his boyfriend left him for the world's second-most Proust scholar who is climbing up the ranks.<br/><br/>That's the family. Like The Simpsons, there's a little bit of everyone you can see in The Hoovers.<br/><br/>Everyone is cast so perfectly. It's one of those instances where you forget all these big names and refer to them as Olive, Frank, Dwayne, Grandpa, Sheryl, and Richard. When a cast can do that you know they're doing a great job.<br/><br/>The movie's trailers may make it seem more like a comedy-drama but the drama angle is actually downplayed. 'LIttle Miss Sunshine' is a genuinely hilarious film. That's all I can say because the road is paved with comedy that's even the more hilarious as you come upon it.<br/><br/>Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Ferris take the Spike Jonze route in their transition to the big screen rather than the, say, McG approach. This directing couple are visionaries, that's for sure. One doesn't need to look further than the two best Chili Peppers videos, 'Otherside' and 'Californication', to see that. They keep the weird visions subdued for the most part, but they are able to keep the incredibly boring road from Albequerque to Los Angelos interesting. That's quite a feat, I have to say, because New Mexico is really boring.<br/><br/>The music also stands out, especially since the songs are performed by DeVotchKa, probably the most original band out there that I've heard of (and they're from Colorado, take that The Fray!). They have this beautiful and strange sound that matches the entire film. Also contributing to the soundtrack are some great cuts by Sufjan Stevens, one of those big indie guys. DeVotchKa's better but still.<br/><br/>Really, this is a farce movie. There are loads of hysterical events that had my entire theater bursting guts. I don't envy the cleaning people after this showing. The Volkswagon Bus, being held together by it's last remaining nerves and muscles makes a great metaphor for the entire family but at the same time is a great gag throughout that never grows thin through all its foibles (though of course, if I were driving that thing I'd get pretty annoyed with it pretty quickly).<br/><br/>'Little Miss Sunshine' was picked up at Sundance for nearly 10 million dollars, the biggest in Sundance history. It was well worth it. It's an audience-pleaser and a great piece of art. There's a great satire underneath the entire thing too. It's most visible towards the end of the film during the beauty pageant, which is both uncomfortable and, how many times have I said funny? Can't really deny the truth. This should be the 'Brokeback' of 2006 mainly because it's about four times better than that. It's 'Vacation' with a heart.<br/><br/>The audience I saw it with when I sojourned to Denver applauded at the end. Everyone just seemed so happy while walking out the theater.<br/><br/>A+."

","This film tumbles all over you like a truck load of bricks. The opening scenes thrust you into the middle of a family of odd characters having multiple crises. The only character who is even close to normal is 8 year old Olive (played by Abigail Breslin, who also puts in a fine performance in The Ultimate Gift), who wants desperately to be in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in far off California. The dialog is sharp, witty, hysterical, full of pathos and poignant all at the same time. These characters are real. You probably have neighbors, or perhaps relatives, who are just like them. You'll laugh and then you'll cry, and then laugh again. This may be a dysfunctional family but it is a family that cares and pulls together no matter what the odds. In the end, Olive gets her wish, but it doesn't turn out anything like you might expect. All in all, this movie is great fun and worth every minute."

","The last several years have seen some remarkably fine small or ensemble family-oriented films come out of independent American filmmakers, very different from the big-production values of typical Hollywood films. The ethos of these films clearly owes something to independent films from other countries, yet the results have been quintessentially American - we being the home of the Simpsons, the road trip, and the very-underage beauty pageant.<br/><br/>Such is Little Miss Sunshine, a charmer of a film that will sneak up on you, then whack you over the head with its screamingly funny and perceptive take on the dysfunctional (but aren't we all?) family of Olive Hoover. Dayton, Faris, and Arndt work their way into certain clich√©d situations and characters, but then wriggle them in unexpected ways, always keeping the audience guessing. The ultimate goal - the Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest - is almost beside the point. What happens on the way is the real meat of this film, with memorable characters and moments. And the beauty pageant at the end is just the set-up for the movie's hysterical final scenes, the ultimate comment on what little girls are made of. You'll have to thank the late Rick James and JonBen√©t Ramsey for this wicked piece of satire."

When Olive thanks her grandfather for teaching her her dance moves the host asks ""where is your grandfather now?"" and she replies ""in the trunk of our car.""

","This movie is a little beauty! I'd read a few reviews and seen the shorts yet was somewhat unconvinced, ready for a quiet letdown. We laughed and smiled almost the entire way through. Most of the cinema had big-spirit smiles each time I turned around. <br/><br/>There is nothing pretentious or over cooked about this movie as it deals with hope, family, life and death, teenage anger, friendship, little town comes to big city, parenting and the crazy side of life. <br/><br/>This small budget film manages to keep you gripped to your seat (smiling) as we follow the family in their VW ""Kombi"" bus, off to the win the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant. The adorable but rather goofy looking eight year old, the only 'normal' person in the family, has high hopes that she will be the next Sunshine, with the a little help from her grandfather as they practice her dance routine.<br/><br/>On paper the character setups seem like textbook clich√©s, from the angry teenager reading Nietzsche to the father and his ""Nine Steps to Success"" power sales mantra. On film they all blend in naturally, a testament to the clever script, acting and directing. You can tell they all had a ball making this movie, I can't wait to see the DVD and the out-takes! It has that beautiful magic when story, actor and crew just click. <br/><br/>Most of the movie is shot in and around the VW bus, yet the lack of sets and locations doesn't go amiss. The kooky Kombi is just as lovable as the rest of the dysfunctional family.<br/><br/>Just lovely. Take the family!"

","It all began for me when I saw the trailer a year ago. I was somehow hooked on it, not realizing why. Was it the sight of Steve Carrel? The notion of another comedy with Arkin, whom I adore since Edward Scissorhands? No idea. But I was hooked nonetheless. Then I got to travel to Canada after i got discharged from the Israeli army. I can honestly say that those three years I wasted in the army, those horrible years of despair and entrapment, they were all worth it. Not because I gave to my country, oh no. But because I decided to go to Canada and watch this piece of art.<br/><br/>The dysfunctional Hoover family decides to do everything for their youngest kin, Olive. She's a sweet girl, and she just entered the final round of a beauty pageant in California. That's all she wants in life, and the family obliges, and the journey from New Mexico to California ensues.<br/><br/>We have the father, Richard (Kinnear), a failed motivational speaker, a loser, and a destructive force in Olive's life. The Brother, Dwayne (Dano), 15 year old, who vowed a vow of silence following his biggest dream, and Nietzche. The Uncle, Frank (Carrel), a gay, suicidal leading lecturer of Proust. The Granfather, Edwin (Arkin), Richard's father, a drug addict, grumpy, perverse and Olive's personal Trainer.<br/><br/>And then we have the Mother, Sheryl (Collete), a neurotic, loving, bored, helpless glue to this circus of a family. Collete brings an extra feel to this diamond of a movie, with a brilliant performance that can be matched only by the performances of her fellow actors.<br/><br/>I've heard some people claim that without all the harsh language, this movie could be a lot better. I disagree, and not only because I think this movie, in particular, is perfect as is, but also because eliminating cuss words from movies who try to portray real life is the same as taking cuss words off the street. Almost everybody I know speaks in semi-harsh language. It's realistic that way. Makes everything look much more authentic. Try a gang-based movie and take the language out, what do you get? a bunch a guys shooting other guys, and looking noble and polite while they do it.<br/><br/>This is not a family film. The language, the sexual content, drugs, and, more importantly (and the most... disturbing) the storyline nearing the end. They all suggest an R rated film. That's because ideas of such deep intersection on life on earth cannot be shown to young children. <br/><br/>I've never in my life cried and laughed so much in such small periods of time. Plus, it's been a long, long while since I saw an audience giving a four minute standing ovation for a movie theater with neither the directors or the writers in there. They just applauded a big white canvas. And I saw it twice, and twice they stood up and put their hands together. Because this movie is bigger than life. It's the story of all of us. So funny, so sad, so tragically hilarious, nobody can resist it. True problems for true people, and some serious, ingenious problem-solving that seems to come out of the characters themselves, almost eliminating the notion of a ""Writer"" to this huge masterpiece.<br/><br/>A true soul candy like I haven't seen in a lifetime."
"Martin-Winbolt-Lewis","9","1","3","20 October 2006"," Quirky, dark and funny look at American dreams and nightmares
","This film will not appeal to everyone. As a graduate of the National Lampoon series with Chevy Chase, I now feel ready to move on after seeing this film. Here we have a worthy successor to the slightly forced humour of American Vacation and its celluloid siblings. By the end I was so enthralled that I spontaneously clapped. I was so warmed by the conclusion I forgot myself,and to my surprise the largely student auditorium followed suit. Was this a Pavlovian sheep response or does Miss Sunshine truly touch buttons for all ages ? I think the latter. The reason, I believe, is that much has echoes of we live we live and observe. Dysfunctional families like little Olive's Hoover family actually exist. We all know that element of quirkiness and the crumpling under pressure in our own - be honest ! From this film we will recognise the over conscientious mum trying to hold it all together and the strident dad, largely in denial of all that is going on around him. We know, and have been, the moody teenager. then there's the slightly worrying relative and the outrageous crinkly grandparent, who lets the side down. Each character is given a twist to send them slightly over the top. then there's little Olive who probably wouldn't notice if a bomb went off in her own back yard, so charmingly ensconced is she in her own little world. Part of her world world is the doubtful aspiration of being a beauty queen.<br/><br/>Not wishing to spoil your experience of watching this - and this is a DVD film, the big screen is not absolutely necessary - the majority of the film is about journeying. It is about journeying in every sense of the word.Behind the humour there is the deeper reality of experiences that change you as a person.Developing from the sudden 'all up in the camper van and go' beginnings to the race against time across several states, laughs and perils mark the way. Some are unlikely and challenge credibility, some are plausible. It doesn't matter because this film does not say 'take me seriously', but 'understand the principles'. For the most part the situation humour is subtle and dark, but for me personally, chuckle-funny.<br/><br/>The characterisation is well developed. Frank,my favourite,is a brilliant but sombre gay academic who is rehabilitating in his sister's family after a suicide attempt. He softens up in time and helps to draw out Dwayne the teenage Nietsche loving son who has taken a vow of silence to escape his family. Richard Hoover, the dad is driven and success orientated, but hits a brick wall.His journey ends in his trading being a 'winner' to being an celebrator of life. Edwin his father, the hippie grandfather, a rather far-out Victor Meldrew, and well...you'll see. Sheryl, the mum comes out as the most normal; stressed out and exasperated but recognisably human. Olive as mentioned before is homely, innocent and wonderfully unselfconscious.<br/><br/>Grandfather Edwin's legacy is to leave his granddaughter Olive a 'dance routine' to perform at the contest. It blows the mind of the Beauty Contest audience and the anally retentive judges panel in different ways but provides the catharsis for the journey and their lives. The journey ends with American warm glow life changes, new values, the opening of eyes to new ways of being, and that liberating feeling that simply makes you want to clap in appreciation, probably wishing you could be as transformed as this redeemed Hoover family setting off in their yellow camper van for the journey home at the end."

","This movie really did it. I feel that the humor in this movie was right on. A lot of movies now a days are very stupid funny(Beerfest and Van Wilder) and some of them are good and make you laugh. But this was just FLAT OUT FUNNY, nothing stupid, just good humor that all ages would love. There were points in the movie that were so hysterically funny i was having trouble breathing.<br/><br/>The entire cast was perfect from the drug addict, don't give a sh#@t about anyone else but himself grandpa(Alan Arkin) to the innocent fun loving little daughter,Olive(Abigail Breslin). And yet again Steve Carell had another phenomenal performance as the suicidal gay brother. It seems everything he does touches to gold. The skill Paul Dano presents as Dwayne was incredible. An entire movie basically not speaking, his sarcastic attitude towards the family and seriousness towards life was a great blend with the rest of cast. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette created great drama as mom and dad, but at the same time made almost everything they did hilarious.<br/><br/>I've read that this movie is to be considered a dark comedy, but I believe it's brevity of drama and continuous humor makes it just a pure comedy. This movie is the best comedy of year, and one of the best films. This movie is simply wonderful.<br/><br/>Mike 10/10"

","I found this movie excellent. The beginning may be something short of 'ideal' but no matter, the movie grabs you seconds later and pulls you into the plot. I really loved the whole atmosphere of the movie, their portrayal of the 'typcially messed up family' was very accurate, yet held a delightful amount of humor. I really enjoyed Paul Dano's role in the movie, and the way he played it. It was very well done and I admire the work he did with it. I will definitely be seeing this movie more than once and I am very happy with the way it ended. There wasn't the typical happy ending that everyone is expecting, which makes it unique.<br/><br/>When I left the theater my brain was churning, and my whole body and mind were satisfied with the best movie of the year. This movie showed just how powerful a movie can be & the emotions that can be shown and felt through audience. I guarantee that if you see this movie you will love it from beginning to end. If you don't, I am certain you won't be able to hate the entire thing, and will find joy in some part of the film. The wise-cracking humor and accurate portrayal of the family will pull your heart into the film. Overall this movie was 'two thumbs way up, smiling.'"

","Does anyone know the family's last name.. It's a game and I'm wondering if anyone's oober obsessed enough to know this.. Anyways I thought this movie was really amazing.. The filming was excellent, my friend noticed some continuity errors, and I usually notice those as well, because I'm into the industry, but I found it was so good I didn't even notice except the one time they didn't have to push the van.. I also liked the perspective of the movie and it was just hilarious.. Their were lots of laughs in the theatre.. The only time I thought it inappropriate when the audience laughed was when Dwayne found out he was colour blind.. I mean come on guys it was his friggin dream! You don't laugh at that maybe at the fact that his sister was so cute and just hugged him and then he got up.. I love her belly! When I have a kid they are loading on friggin junk! Yay for ice cream.. I did it.. Bowl of ice cream every night.. Of course, I can't now, but my daughter ho... she will have a belly.. yes she will.."
"Flavia89","7","2","10","20 January 2007"," Was I supposed to laugh?
","Good idea, bad movie. Far from being a comedy. The lines were dreadful, the acting could have been much more better, the plot was insignificant and there was nothing to laugh about. People got used to laugh about silly things, American simple jokes, but THIS IS NOT HUMOUR. Olive is naive, the silly girl who wishes to be a model, like other one hundred thousand girls from America, and this is indeed a funny thing to laugh about: Americans make fun of themselves. Olive's family is mediocre, her parents can't come to an agreement and they argue in her presence (the ice-cream scene), making her desolated and confused. There is another funny thing: Olive's family should have known that she would have had slight chances to win the beauty contest because she was FAT and not so beautiful. And what was with all the striptease performance? Her parents weren't even curious to see what will she do at the talent competition? No! They didn't! They left that part to that dirty old grandfather to teach her, so of course what she did had to be something pervert and unapproriate for the Little Miss Sunshine!"
"Drtimk","4","2","10","24 October 2006"," can't agree
","Sorry. I can't agree with all the kudos for this film. I found it really quite trite, inane and boring.<br/><br/>Direction is shoddy, the characters are too disparate to make any connection and the dialogue isn't funny.The basic motif regarding life being like a beauty contest/competition and all you have to really do is simply what you love is worthy enough but overplayed and corny in the end.<br/><br/>Some bits were nice enough but in the end I thought wow, that was silly. Maybe its an American movie. (I'm an Aussie). Then again,I thought American Beauty was crap. Leave these movies to the Euros and the Aussies who do them much better."

","I really wanted to love this movie, I'm a big Kinnear fan but I didn't love it. I liked it in some spots, some scenes were pretty funny but hated all the swearing. The stupidest part, well, there were two, the dragging the dead grandpa out of the hospital window. I thought that was way over the top. And the dance at the end. Why would the parents allow that? I really didn't care about any of the characters, not even the little girl. Her saying her dead grandpa was in the back of their van? Just too silly. I've always liked Kinnear, back from his Talk Soup days but found him to be pretty one dimensional and no growth even though he was supposed to have come out a better person. Glad I rented it and didn't pay full price at the theater."

","The Hoover family takes a trip to California so daughter Olive (Breslin) can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.<br/><br/>This movie takes too long a time to get to what this is all about. That is besides telling the story of a dysfunctional family. More on that later. Where it eventually goes is to the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in California where young daughter Olive (Breslin) will compete. Seems grandpa (Arkin) has taught Olive some new moves and no one has seen them until she is finally on stage. Without knowing what she is doing she satirizes the whole concept of child beauty pageants and tells the world what the competition is really all about. Yes, that does sound interesting, doesn't it? Remember, I said it takes too long to get here.<br/><br/>The family: Father, Richard (Kinnear), is a failed motivational speaker who is trying to publish his 9-steps to success; Son, Dwayne (Dano), hasn't spoken to anyone in over a year and won't until he gets accepted to the USAF Academy to become a pilot; Grandpa (Arkin) is a dirty old man who lets loose with F-bombs at the drop of a hat; Wife, Sheryl (Collette), is sort of okay but is too supportive of the rest of the family when she shouldn't be; Frank (Carrell) Sheryl's brother is gay, and failed a suicide attempt and has just been released from the hospital. Olive (Breslin) is the only normal and innocent one in all this. You learn all this very early in the movie.<br/><br/>Although billed as a comedy, it is lite-drama and there are some almost good lines in here, but to give any would give too much away and there weren't many anyway. You are not missing anything. The physical comedy is old, tired and no longer works. One would think that a dysfunctional family would garner some comedy, but not here, well, save for some okay good lines just mentioned, but cannot be divulged. And, again, you are still not missing anything. The lines were good, not great. Read my lips: you are not missing anything.<br/><br/>The acting is fine. It's the script until the competition and even there it still needed work.<br/><br/>The ending is what bothered me the most. By my account there wasn't one. If you watch this, you will see. And, no this doesn't open the door to a sequel. At least I hope not. They wouldn't, would they? Oh, God!"
"pencritical","2","1","4","4 July 2018"," Almost Didn't Watch it. Should Have Listened to that Intuition
","When this movie came out I saw the reviews, heard the hype, knew it was nominated for top awards and just didn't see the reason for it. It didn't interest me anymore than Juno and I still have not watched that. Probably never will. I do wish I had continued to listen to my intuition, but this movie is on my shelf, having been given to me as a gift somewhere along the way and I happened to see a trailer for it here last night as I was looking at something else, so I thought, what the heck. Maybe. <br/><br/>What was I thinking? Definitely not. This movie did not leave me feeling good. It left me actually feeling repulsed and a bit like I needed a shower. <br/><br/>There is not much I can say nice about this movie. I'll try. I don't know the young man who played Dwayne (or was it Duane), but I love every other single actor in the movie. They are all wonderfully talented. How anyone could manage to put them together and come away with a movie so jaw-droppingly bad is beyond me. <br/><br/>I actually enjoyed Duane's little bit in the movie a bit, but it was only a tiny piece almost unrelated to the story and it wasn't much of a story at all. <br/><br/>There isn't much more to say that is nice, unfortunately and other critics have said it all. The jokes are lame and stolen from other shows. The end routine is not funny, it is stomach turning. I was rooting for the horrible lady to shut it down. The grandfather was disgusting and I am far from a prude - but seriously, you left that man alone with your seven year old when he talked like that in front of you with her present? How do you think a man like that talked when the parents weren't in the room? <br/><br/>I love Steve Carell, even though I despise his trite sitcom, The Office, (see note) but he had absolutely nothing to work with here. His story was trite and 'Jonah and the Whale tale' unbelievable. Toni Colette probably does ditzy lady better than any comedienne in the business since Carol Burnet retired, but you have got to give her something to work with and though Greg Kinnear's comedic chops are far inferior, he does make a good straight man when he has a good partner. But, again, you have to have an actual script to work with and a director with some respect for the actors he/she is directing. Obviously these actors had neither. <br/><br/>A couple of other things: If I have to watch them push that van one more time I think I'll barf. We get it. Enough already. Not funny the first time . But neither was stealing grandpa's body, the cop not noticing it, or six dozen other stupid jokes. And for heaven's sake, you are driving through some of the most beautiful country on earth and all you show is gas stations and asphalt? The cinematography is atrocious. Especially the little girl make up in the end. Yes they wear too much make up. Not that much. <br/><br/>Enough rehash of what all this movies critics have already said more eloquently than I can. I hated the movie. I felt bad for Abigail who is a doll. Next time my gut says don't bother; I resolve to remember to listen, even over a decade later. If you've never made the mistake of watching this-
 Don't. <br/><br/>Note: Don't read anything into my not liking The Office. It's just me. I haven't liked a sitcom since Mash except Will and Grace and Third Rock and I only kind of liked both of them. I didn't like W&G well enough to tune back in to the reboot..."
"gloriahur","6","1","4","17 June 2017"," Comical but tedious
","Before I watched the movie, I had hear a lot of good things about it so I was really looking forward to watching it. However, it was very difficult for me to watch it until the end. The story line was pretty easy to predict and tediously slow. There was nothing in particular in the movie that was outstanding or interesting. It wasn't particularly attractive visually, nor very humorous or touching.<br/><br/>But still there were some unexpected parts that could be entertaining or touching after you think about it again. The characters were all very distinct and familiar in real life, and the few darkly comical scenes made me smirk. Also, the acting was great, and I was especially impressed by Paul Dano's acting. Overall, it wasn't a bad movie, but I wouldn't necessarily watch it twice."

","This is what we call, a very American movie. A silly road trip of a family to take the 7 year old daughter to a beauty contest, together with her drug-addict grandpa, her depressed gay uncle, a loser father and a detaching teenager brother. Several unexpected things happen on the road to add to the silliness that is supposed to teach us that family is more important than anything else. And that beauty contests are a silly tradition. So, being too ""American"", all the teachings are more than obvious to make sure they reach even the dumbest. A collection of stereotypes that are ""torn down"" as the movie evolves as the family realises what is really important. There are deeper and better movies to show that. Watch it only if you think that beauty contests should still be a thing. If you don't live in an superficial world, you don't need this waste of time to teach you that family ties are more important and life is worth fighting for.."

","If you thought that the movie ""Vacation"" had a lot of moments that embarrassed you and made your skin crawl, then are you in for it if you watch ""Little Miss Sunshine""--especially the ultra-bizarro ending! It features a god-awful family on their bizarre trek from New Mexico to a children's beauty pageant in California--and practically everything that could go wrong goes wrong. There's the brother they must bring along because he's just attempted suicide and cannot be left alone, there's the elective mute teenager who hates EVERYTHING, there's the surly and perverse grandpa, a father who does nothing but spout catch-phrases from his worthless self-help lectures and a completely inept mother. The only one you don't hate is the adorable little girl...and she seems like the most normal one among them! So what's going to happen? See this twisted film and find out for yourself.<br/><br/>This is a movie that you're likely to love or hate--depending on what your tolerance is for painful comedy. It is not the sort of film that is subtle or for the easily offended--and has some amazingly adult language and VERY strange situations. But, if you have a high tolerance, it is worth seeing. Not brilliant and a bit like ""Vacation"" if it was written by John Waters!"
"pontifikator","8","1","4","21 March 2011"," A sick, genius screenplay
","Michael Arndt wrote a sick, genius screenplay. I saw reviews for ""Little Miss Sunshine"" when the movie came out and passed on it. Whatever the descriptions were, they totally missed it. This is a very funny comedy about failure. Epic failure.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and it stars Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Steve Carell, and Toni Collette, along with others. Arkin won a best supporting actor Oscar for his brief time on the screen, and Arndt won for best original screenplay.<br/><br/>I don't know who did the costuming (I assume Nancy Steiner), but the clothes were wonderfully awful, especially little Olive's choices. (Mom's clothes sucked pretty bad, too.) Dinner seems to have been take-home buckets of chicken all too often, given Grandpa's comments. All the details of a harried, wrecked homelife get nailed in the opening scenes. Nobody has time to think about dress or food, much less be good at anything.<br/><br/>In this family's life, everything goes horribly wrong, and it's so horribly funny that I had to keep backing up the video because I wasn't through laughing when something else happened. Lee Marvin said his horse should have gotten an Oscar in ""Cat Ballou,"" and the family VW van should have in ""Little Miss Sunshine.""<br/><br/>Although ostensibly about Olive's quest to win a child's beauty contest, this movie is no more about beauty than ""Bull Durham"" is about baseball. If you liked ""The Station Agent,"" you'll like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (and vice versa)."

","Worst movie I've seen in a long time. The characters were completely unsympathetic and devoid of any personality. Within the first five seconds of seeing the wife, I wanted to punch her in the face. Then we had the over-sexed grandpa, and that kid doing his best to impersonate a brooding teen.<br/><br/>This is like a road trip you were forced to take with your family as a kid. It's long, boring, somewhat depressing, and very annoying. Every thing that can go wrong does go wrong. And although it's advertised as a comedy, very little humour is derived from the situations the family finds itself in along the way. I did not laugh once. In the rare parts when it tries (too hard) to be funny, the jokes are same-old garden variety that you've seen done better in a thousand other movies. The characters make a lot of stupid mistakes too, mostly because they can't seem to see easier solutions to their problems. We need to get to California for three o clock. Should we send someone ahead with the kid so they can register in the pageant on time, or do we smuggle grandpa's body out of a hospital?<br/><br/>The only person in the film who's eyes I didn't want to throw acid into was the pageant registrar who took five minutes out of his time to sign up a late contestant. Seriously, only likable character. <br/><br/>I'm embarrassed for Steve Carrol.<br/><br/>Also, where'd they get these actors? Some obscure community theater in rural Saskatchewan? <br/><br/>Okay, I get that this was the film debut of a directing husband and wife.

The script is injected with flat drama, stuff that would have, strangely enough, been used for laughs in a superior comedy.

The good acting, all the weird and ""different"" characters.. it all falls to dust because the story is actually lacking the essential spice to get the viewer to the end with a feeling it was worth the sit.<br/><br/>It happens so often with American indie type movies.

","If you want a feel-good story that never gets schmaltzy, then ""Little Miss Sunshine"" turns out to be a great pick. It boasts a positive denouement that argues courage is a more important thing to have in your armoury than credentials. If you've never felt that you measure up, then this movie welcomes you and asks you to take heart in the fact that there's bound to be one area where you excel.<br/><br/>It's a message that in my opinion is delivered with much greater aplomb than something like ""Napolean Dynamite"" - another 'outsider' paean - for example, because it doesn't feel stilted. These people are unabashed about their foibles and won't accept marginalisation because of them. This is a story that isn't afraid to let it all hang out when it comes to personal character quirks that could potentially be awkward. Each member of the family has uncomfortable flaws that aren't shied away from, and yet somehow against all the odds they are able to pull together and function as a successful family unit when it gets down to crunch time. Whereas Napolean almost seemed content to spend most of his time on the sidelines, ""Little Miss... "" has all of its principals make the brave decision to get right into the thick of things.<br/><br/>If you yourself feel like a ""superfreak"", then watching this allows you a private moment to rejoice.

It has so many hidden layers and it's analysis of everyday life, woven into the kooky world of this family, is one of the most realistic I have seen in a long time, despite it being a comedy.<br/><br/>I laughed at the pure simplicity and idiocy of scenes like the malfunctioning horn and the policeman with the porn magazines and equally shed a tear when the family comes together in the end to share the grandfather's philosophy on life.<br/><br/>All of the performances were spot on in this movie, particularly Steve Carrell, who very much surprised me with the versatility he showed(Steve, Evan Almighty? Come on you're better than that rubbish).<br/><br/>Also worth mentioning is the fantastic score and superior cinematography, which I thought complimented the quality of the performances and script.<br/><br/>Most importantly though about this picture is that it is a movie that makes you think about life and, for all it's gloom and sadness, leaves you at the end feeling totally uplifted without the needs for the usual crass Hollywood style moralising or schmaltz.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","All right, this is probably a lame comparison between Little Miss Sunshine and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath but I see it. Both films are about family and what pulls them apart and what holds them together. Greg Kinnear is in his own way Pa Joad trying to provide for his family dealing with economic forces he doesn't understand. Toni Collette is Ma Joad: keeping the family together is everything. Alan Arkin is Grandpa Joad, too old to kid himself and too old to be taken away from his home. Paul Dano is Winfield and a redemptive Connie Rivers. Steve Carell is Casy, a lost tag-a-long who finds his soul. And Abigal Breslin is Rose-of-Sharon who certainly is able to bring life and hope to a family in need of both.

"hall895","8","1","4","1 June 2007"," Relentlessly charming, thoroughly enjoyable
","Of all the terrible ideas in the history of humankind the idea of beauty pageants for seven year old girls must be among the worst. Seeing little girls all tarted up to look like mini-whores is beyond unsettling, it's downright repulsive. Happily, Little Miss Sunshine, the film, takes the time to point out the stupidity and awfulness of Little Miss Sunshine, the pageant within the film. More happily, the film is really not about the pageant but rather about one little girl's journey as she and her rather odd family travel to the pageant. And what a charming, hilarious and ultimately uplifting journey it is.<br/><br/>The movie centers around young Olive, a refreshingly normal girl compared to the rest of the ""beauty queens"" on the pageants for third graders circuit. She gets the opportunity to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, which as you can see by her reaction when she finds out she gets to go, is apparently a really big deal. And here the hilarity begins as her family piles into their old VW bus for the journey from their home in New Mexico to the pageant in Redondo Beach, California. Suffice to say the trip does not go exactly according to plan. And with the motley crew that makes up this family there is no shortage of laughs. But in addition to all the laughs the film has so much charm and heart. It's a movie which certainly has its dark moments but in the end it's absolutely a feel-good story.<br/><br/>Now, about that family. Olive is the key, and in playing the role Abigail Breslin is simply amazing. You need not qualify it by saying it's a great performance for a child performer. It's a great performance, period. Breslin wonderfully captures all of Olive's varied emotions, and there are many on this journey. Whatever it is she has to get across at a given moment, Breslin does it. Saying she is amazing really doesn't do her justice, she's absolutely perfect. Hard to be better than perfect. Everyone around Breslin does a great job as well, certainly no casting missteps here. There's Greg Kinnear as Olive's father, a self-help guru who could use a lot of help himself, both in jump-starting his moribund career and in holding his family together. Toni Collette plays Olive's mother, the most seemingly normal one of the bunch and apparently the glue that barely does hold the family together. Paul Dano plays Olive's rather unhappy teenage brother Dwayne, who has taken a vow of silence until he realizes his dream of becoming an Air Force pilot. The hurt Dwayne feels shines through. Kudos to Dano for being able to say a lot without saying anything at all. Steve Carell is remarkably understated and quite good playing Olive's Uncle Frank, a gay, suicidal Proust scholar whose life is in tatters as the journey begins. And finally, Alan Arkin plays Olive's foul-mouthed, heroin-snorting Grandpa. If not for Breslin's brilliance, one could say Arkin steals the movie. As it is he's just one noteworthy piece in this brilliantly conceived puzzle.<br/><br/>Stick all these wonderfully varied characters in that beat-up VW bus for a couple of days and what you get is comic brilliance. You also get to see these incredibly different people come together to support one another through thick and thin. There's a lesson in this movie but Little Miss Sunshine doesn't beat you over the head with its lesson. It's much more subtle than that. After giving you plenty of laughs along the way it may only be when the film ends that you realize just how sweet and endearing the film was. This is one incredibly charming ride."

","(Read this with a haughty British accent) This delightful little comedy eschewed the easy laughs and simplistic humor in order to focus on the oft hilarious personalities of its various members. Gay Uncle and erstwhile Proust scholar Frank played with dry wit by Steve Carrell tied together the misfit family. Father is bankrupt and selling a 9 steps to success program. Mopy Oldest Son reads Nietzche and has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Airforce. Crass Grandpa has been ejected from a rest home; he decided that since he's old, he might as well snort heroin. And little Olive with her rotund child's belly wants to be in beauty pageants. Oh the sheer mix of the quirky interactions brought joy to my heart.<br/><br/>(Read this with your best stoner's voice) Dude, Little Miss Sunshine rocked. It is sooo unlike all the crap Hollywood usually puts out, there was no sappy love story, no victory at the end, just weird people hanging out, doing their thing and trying to avoid killing each other. The dance at the end was awesome and I almost fell off the couch when the grandpa told the oldest son that he should hook up with lots of chicks while he's young. You've gotta see it.<br/><br/>This movie is like Squirt, my favorite grapefruit flavored soda. I don't drink Squirt often, it is sometimes difficult to find, but when I do I love the tartness of the grapefruit mixed with the sweetness from the sugar (high-fructose corn syrup really). It can quench the tickle in the back of my throat like no other. The carbonation often surprises my nose as I take a drink and makes it light and airy. After a sip, I feel refreshed and quenched. 8/10 <br/><br/>http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"
"diac228","6","1","4","21 March 2007"," A very grim and dark story told in a most adorable fashion, Little Miss Sunshine is a charming little film with heart but flaws as well
","Little Miss Sunshine went from a tiny personal independent film to one of many of the ""little films that could"" back in 2006. Working on a small budget and not much press, it would emerge as a sleeper hit at the box office and would prove to be a highly-praised effort by the well-known directing duet Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. Mixing comedy (quite dark actually) with a heavy hint of drama, Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rare decent dark comedies and a rare decent road trip movie. But, despite all that, its not perfect. Billed as a comedy but coming off much more as a depressing dramedy, Little Miss Sunshine suffers from an unbalanced blend of genres, a few slow moments, and an ending that doesn't really complete the story. As a matter of fact, the ending just screams indie and could have been seen from a mile away. At this point, the conclusion may have just been spoiled, if you've seen enough of these lower-budgeted, ""unformulatic"" films.<br/><br/>In Little Miss Sunshine, we follow a very dysfunctional and depressed family full of oddballs that are hitting bumps in life. Whether its depression, divorce, long vow of silence, drugs, or lack of motivation, there is almost every kind of unfortunate scenario and situation within the family. The glue keeping everyone together is the adorable daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), who just happens to be able to enter a beauty pageant for smaller kids. The rest of the family unites together, despite their anger, frustration, and tension amongst each other to help Olive attempt to claim her moment in the spotlight.<br/><br/>Running the show is the superb acting from practically everybody. From veterans Alan Arkin and Greg Kinnear to up-and-coming stars like Steve Carell, Paul Dano, and Abigail Breslin, excellent casting and even better acting runs Little Miss Sunshine and is its standout feature. None of them truly stand out, but they all blend in together with the chaos and drama going on throughout the film. It was fascinating how in one moment, they can make you laugh, and in the next moment make you cry.<br/><br/>Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are excellent directors in the field of music videos. Within the past decade, some of the better music videos come from them. With Little Miss Sunshine however, their creativity and usage of visual effects isn't utilized here, but instead their skills in terms of capturing emotion is used at full blast. Capturing scenery was no problem, as the duo made art out of everyday backgrounds. They kept the pacing quick and consistent, and refrained from taking any long shots unless its bits with no dialogue.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is the writing and the story in general. Dark comedies can be hard to find, since accidentally crossing the line past dark comedy leads to drama. Little Miss Sunshine aims to be a cute and charming film, but with so much gruesome drama and so much cynical humor, it ends up becoming a gruesome look at life and a rather grim tale of everything going wrong when it shouldn't. Its dark comedy is hard to laugh at sometimes when the dysfunctional family continuously hits roadblocks on the way to the pageant. Kind of like the main weakness of Pursuit of Happiness, Little Miss Sunshine suffers from way too much drama. But, unlike Pursuit, the film has practically no closure in any of the subplots and the bad news that keeps charging into the film every couple of minutes. Topping all the grief is lack of closing as the film ends very abruptly.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Great directing and great acting couldn't save the movie from having a rather bittersweet taste towards the end. What was a decent story in the beginning disintegrated into an incomplete body of fiction that screams indie and a potentially unnecessary sequel. Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rare films that is cute and dark at the same time, like a Gothic Red Riding Hood with big innocent eyes. We see a lot of careers rising out of this, and directors successfully crossing into another field of entertainment, but not an instant classic that shall be adored for generations. Best Picture nomination? How did it get that? Little Miss Sunshine: Good, but not uber fantastic."

","As a fan of movies like this and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, i can say that in my movie-viewing experience, this movie is the best. I saw one night and was surprised by the seriousness, artsiness and streaks of humor it contained. Steve Carrel (Frank) was a sure vote for best supporting actor in 2006 as Abigail Breslin (Olive) did for best supporting actress. Toni Collette (Sheryl)was her best since The Sixth Sense. Alan Arkin performed an Oscar winning role for best supporting actor. Overall this film was nominated for four Oscars: Best supporting actress (Abigail Breslin) Best Supporting Actor (Alan Arkin) Best Original Screenplay, and Best Motion Picture of the year. Of the four noms, this film won 2, Best supporting actor, and best original screenplay.

"Robert_Hearth","10","1","4","10 March 2007"," ""Grandpa, Am I Pretty?"" --- Olive (Abigail Breslin)
","""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris <br/><br/>Starring: Abigail Breslin, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, & Steve Carell <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for language, some sex and drug content) <br/><br/>If you have never read a little story called ""The Little Engine That Could"", then I don't think you can truly appreciate ""Little Miss Sunshine"". For those of you have not read the book, I will give you a brief overview. It tells the story of a little steam engine that can't pull a particularly large load up a hill¬Öbut, through positive thinking and self-confidence, the little engine that could succeeds. For most children, this story is their first encounter with the notion of ""positive thinking and devotion can lead to success"". ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is that timeless children's story adapted for adult and is just as timeless and effective. It is a movie that truly understands people, families, and how they all relate to each other. Sporting some of the best performances of the year (particularly from the young little Abigail Breslin), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the year's best comedy and one of the best comedies of the past few years.<br/><br/>Olive (Breslin) is a young girl who only wants to be pretty and to win a beauty contest. When she gets the chance to compete in the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant, her diverse family all pile into a VW van to take a cross-country trip to get her to the pageant in time. Her family contains some of the most awkward yet lovable characters ever formulated, including her caring mother, Sheryl (Collette), her controlling motivational speaker of a father, Richard (Kinnear), her brother, Dwayne (Dano), who has taken a vow of silence, her drug-abusing foul-mouthed grandfather (Arkin), and her homosexual, suicidal uncle, Frank (Carell). With a plot like this, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" could have easily been just another Chevy Chase ""Vacation"" rip-off and yet it certainly is not. It is a touching, poignant film that is soaked in originality, creativity, and colorfulness. Its plot, though simplistic in nature, becomes a complex, multi-layered story as each different character is introduced.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" features some of the best performances of the year. It has a truly amazing cast that all display some of the most electric and realistic chemistry ever put on the screen. Abigail Breslin, despite being so young, proves that a skill for acting is most definitely in her blood. She owns the movie, completely winning over the audience with her character's realistic childlike wander and understanding. Greg Kinnear managed to capture a very complex character. His character has so many detestable qualities and yet he is truly a good person. Kinnear nails it. Toni Collette took a simple part and made it real. Her character is really the only family member without a significant plot point and yet she never feels overshadowed. She holds her own and gives her likable character more substance than the script originally did. Paul Dano speaks only a few times in the movie and yet manages to be a sympathetic, relatable character that we grow to love just as much as any of the other family members. Dano achieves this through facial expressions and slight mannerisms. Steve Carell plays a gay man and yet he does not flaunt it. He underplays it, not giving a clich√©d, stereotypical performance. I definitely respected the realism he injected into the part.<br/><br/>When comparing ""Little Miss Sunshine"" to ""The Little Engine That Could"", one cannot simply discuss the message they both share. ""Little Miss Sunshine"", itself, is surprisingly comparable to that little engine. Here was an independent comedy that, like many films of the same ilk, could have been praised by critics and ignored by audiences. However, it became a surprise hit, winning over critics, audiences, and Oscar voters, as well. It became one of the most successful independent films ever, grossing nearly $60 million on an $8 million budget. Much of this can be attributed to the amazing press it received from its premiere and, fortunately (as so many bad movies are becoming shockingly successful lately), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" deserved all of its praise and financial success. If you have not yet seen ""Little Miss Sunshine"", then you owe it to yourself to do so immediately. It is one of the most effective comedies made in the last twenty years, giving amazing performances and a solid, truthful heart that is as touching as it is realistic.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Heartfelt and real, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a wonderful comedy.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)"
"MOscarbradley","9","1","4","6 March 2007"," The best road movie in years
","Don't be put off by the title. This comedy about a dysfunctional American family, (father, mother, grandfather, gay uncle, son who has taken a vow of silence and the tyke who wants to enter the eponymous contest), is anything but cute. If the feel-good factor goes all the way up to ten, the yuck factor is a pleasing zero. The precedents for this film aren't those appalling Adam Sandleresque comedies about errant dads bonding with kids left on doorsteps but the best American TV comedies going at the moment, such as ""Curb Your Enthusism"" and ""Arrested Development"".<br/><br/>The Hoovers are the family in question and they are thrown together at very close quarters when they take to the road in a battered VW van on route to California so their youngest can enter the Little Miss Sunshine contest for which she is being coached by heroin snorting granddad, (Alan Arkin, brilliant). Inevitably things don't go as planned, (the film takes a nicely dark turn about midway through), but in the course of the journey lessons are learned and people whose lives were previously lived in isolation suddenly find themselves bonding in a very unlikely manner. But as I've said, don't let this put you off if, like me, children, animals and the American nuclear family are high on your hate list. Thanks to a cracker of a script by Michael Arndt, nicely observed direction from newcomers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and a terrific cast, this hits the spot every time.<br/><br/>As the parents at permanent loggerheads, Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are on career-best form while Steve Carell as the suicidal gay uncle manages to create a completely believable, likable, living, breathing, hurting human being totally devoid of caricature and as the little girl with hopes of finding herself in the big bad world of kiddies' beauty pageants, Abigail Breslin is a revelation. Best of all, not only is ""Little Miss Sunshine"" the best 'family' orientated comedy in years but it's also a very welcome addition to that recently defunct staple American genre, the road movie. Go see, then go see again."

","Wow. What can i say about Little Miss Sunshine? It was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. If you have not seen this movie then please watch it. It is a brilliant movie filled with comedy and drama following a family full of problems. I loved every character in this film and every moment of it. The ending was a very funny/heart-warming ending also. Because even through everything they experience throughout their trip, they became a stronger family. This movie just sent chills down my spine.

"jertob","9","1","4","15 February 2007"," Like another great film
","This may seem far out, but this film reminded me of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" in a modern mode. Consider: the loss of Grandpa; the breakdown of their automobile; the gay brother who regains his self-esteem like the preacher, Jim Casey; the family realizing that they are a strong family unit that can survive the hardships and disappointments they experience. Okay, maybe I'm overdoing it, but I still feel the resemblance. Olive is an accomplished actor and I would be disappointed if she did not appear in more films. This picture is an excellent example of what can be accomplished without the use of phony special effects and when the characters themselves comprise the depth of meaning in the story."

","I sincerely wish Little Miss Sunshine could win the Oscar, though it is not likely. Beneath a comedy overtone, the fact is quite sad.Richard(Greg Kinnear), Dad, is a motivational speaker, who never tastes the sweet smell of the success himself, Sheryl(Toni Collette), Mom, provides the Kentucky fried chicken as dinner, whose brother Frank (Steve Carrel ) just joins them, after a suicidal attempt because of being dumped by his boyfriend. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) try to be a libertine before death. Teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dyno) who takes a vow of silence is a admirer of Nietzsche. He hates everyone. And last , eager to win the title of the movie title, is seven-year Olive (Abigail Breslin), who is exactly a little miss sunshine. Even so, she already starts to be afraid of becoming a loser. Yeah, she knows this word, and she knows her father is a big loser. Sad, very sad. They are a family of losers. When his dream to be a pilot broken ,Dwayne breaks his vow,and what he says is quite right. Life is a beauty contest, you accepts the criterion imposed by outer-world, you prostitute yourself, you lose yourself, you are a phony! Like Holden Caulfield in The Catcher In The Rye always says, phony. Yes, there are two kinds of people, winners and losers, but who can judge us, who has the right, this is the question."
"droorogers","10","1","4","10 February 2007"," Phenomenal
","I saw the poster for this film and read some really good reviews of it before it received its theatrical release, but never really looked twice at it. I'm not much of a comedy person, so this sort of missed my radar. Once the Rotten Tomatoes rating of 95% positive reviews (at the time) came in I decided to watch the trailer online, and fell in love with it immediately. It also had Steve Carell, one of my favourite comedians, in a starring role, so I knew I had to see it.<br/><br/>Seeing the film in theatres was an experience. Every joke was dead-on, and everyone in the theatre was roaring. When the credits rolled, the theatre applauded, something I had never seen happen before. I was applauding right along with them.<br/><br/>Every single performance in this film is incredible. Abigail Breslin has overtaken Dakota Fanning's position in my mind as the greatest child actor of our time. Not only is she a great child actress, she's a great actress. Period. Steve Carell hit emotional depths I didn't know he could. He's come a long way from The Daily Show. Paul Dano's performance makes you think initially that he's an unlikable moron, but the character ends up so well developed by the end.<br/><br/>The music was also very strong. As a musician, I often notice soundtracks and film scores where others ignore it. However, everyone else I saw this with noticed the score. It perfectly compliments and underlines the events of the film without overwhelming it.<br/><br/>Dark, cynical, hilarious, oddly uplifting, quirky yet accessible. I loved every second, and consider it to be one of my favourite films of all time. A+."
"mckeano","Null","1","4","28 January 2007"," The ending
","I found the ending of this absolutely hilarious because of Olive being taught how to strip-tease for her beauty pageant. Her granadad was a dirty old man! Especially to do that to his granddaughter. It wasn't hilariously funny throughout the whole film, as it was more or less about a family thats falling to pieces, which I can imagine we all have preferences to! I found the adolescent boy funny with how he reacted to anything and everything which was funny. Well he hadnt been able to talk for 9 months because he wrote that he wasn't speaking until he became a pilot. and when he discovered he was colourblind he found out that he couldn't be a pilot, so he had a huge rant at all his family. so funny lol"
"robwealer","Null","1","4","21 January 2007"," Good in parts but haltingly delivered
","Had a sense of disappointment in watching this film after all the hype the preceded it. It was clear what message was trying to be delivered but scenes and how this was done seem stammered and out of sync. I think the film failed in it's building of sympathy for lead characters, through lack of character development and history, an essential component if we are to take the internal journey with the character. We had a smattering of obvious signs of dysfunctionality, troubled brother, drug addicted grandfather, disfunctory and hurried family dinner etc., but nothing wanted me to actually care for these people at the start. We only really find out that Dwayne is a troubled stepson when he cracks and breaks his vow of silence. Before that, it is a presumptive footnote not explicitly addressed or really mentioned as a possible motive for his behavior and was not entirely sure who's son he was from what previous marriage. Which is a shame as his character was one of the most interesting and he never said a word for 3/4 of the film. This film also relied heavily on the compassionate powers of the viewer to fill in the emotional blank spots it was unable to put on film and regularly attempted to draw on this with long silences and superb shots in the absence of real dialog. Some great moments however this film will not stand the test of time nor make conversation in the coming years for these very reasons. All characters did pull it off however and played their roles expertly to the limit the script would allow for and we really see professionals earning their pay interpreting and adding value. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette should be given an award of another type for pulling it out of the fire."

","It's one of the best of the year! I rented this movie thinking it would be your typical indie film, which I usually like. But this film is so much more than that! It is clever, witty, plenty of laughs and enough drama to go around. I'll get started on the plot, it follows the story six people all members of a highly dysfuctioninal family. Greg Kinear wonderfully plays a wannabe motivational speaker, with a ""if you're not first you're last"" personality, he is constantly driving his family nuts. Enter his wife greatly plaid by Toni Collet. She is always trying to keep this family together, the type of person who try's to keep it fair and kind always, but is constantly frustrated by her husband (Kinear). Then there the heroin addict grandpa, played with scene stealing roles by Alan Arkin. He is a very cranky person who has points in the film where he shows that he really DOES care about his family. Then there are the children played by Pual Dano and Abigail Breslin, both masterfully played! Olive (Breslin)dreams of winning the little miss sunshine beauty pageant and that is why this crazy road trip starts. Pual Dano plays a kid who is keeping a code of silence until he makes it to Airline school and he seems to be mad at the world. And then comes my favorite performance of the film, Steve Carrel who plays a suicidal homosexual. The best part of this movie is that each character has time to develop. My rating for Little Miss Sunshine 9/10"

But Little Miss Sunshine is about so much more -- family, finding a connection with the people we're bound to, perseverance, being true to ourselves and the people we love.

The cinematography is delicious and exciting. I love the the fact that two directors gave their input (That's another reason the Coen Brothers are so successful) The sets are outstanding, you feel you've been there at some time, they're familiar and nostalgic. The hairstyles and make up were not overdone, hence making these characters believable and unobtrusive. The ostentatious make up and hairstyles on the child pageant entrants, however, was perfectly garish and outrageous which added to the validity of the social folly we live in today.<br/><br/>Bravo to the Cast, Crew and all involved in this and I pray tell it gets Oscar recognition because this is REAL Film-making."
"forindcine","Null","1","4","23 October 2006"," A laugh-out-loud comedy
","One of the unique things about independent cinema is, if you live outside the City of Angels, the Windy City or the Big Apple, you need to wait weeks before an ""indie"" film comes to your area. These cities have the audience and are proved testing grounds for this type of cinema. Indie films thrive in disassociation with the large film studios because it would limit their ability to be unique and produce cinema that some might call controversial. Few copies are made until the film proves it can stand on its own. Once that happens we all get to see them. With the use of satellites the emerging digital film distribution systems should assist in making these films available faster in the coming years.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine has been playing to rave reviews in those cities for weeks but that doesn't necessarily make it a great film. You might remember the screenplay ""Brokeback Mountain"" an indie film with a huge advertising budget yet the movie stunk up the place.<br/><br/>""Little Miss"" stands taller than the hype. It's a story about a father/grandfather thrown out of a nursing home; a dad who bets everything on his 8-step to success theory; a teenage son who decides not to speak; an uncle recently released from a psyche ward for trying to commit suicide over a gay lover; mom, the only sane one in the bunch; and little Olive wonderfully played by Abigail Breslin. The family decides to take a road trip in a VW bus from New Mexico to California to enter Olive in a JonBenet Ramsey type beauty pageant named, Little Miss Sunshine.<br/><br/>It's a laugh-out-loud comedy which avoids every predictable humorous scene shown in so many comedy films. Instead of the predictable the film provides you with so many hilarious and unexpected surprises. Because you never know where it's going your enjoyment is greater. Near the end of the film you find yourself laughing so hard you can't hear the soundtrack but who cares the images are so funny that it's not needed.<br/><br/>If you consider yourself straight-laced or think you have it all together chances are you won't enjoy this film. But if you're are like me - slightly twisted, partly dysfunctional, and can enjoy 101-minutes of steady laughter, you can't afford to wait to see this on DVD."

Performances were outstanding all around. This movie is about a dysfunctional family making a frantic road trip across the country to get their daughter to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. The dynamic works because the director somehow manages to combine many elements and mini story lines into the plot, from the grandfather's death to Dwayne's sudden realization he is colourblind, everything gels together nicely. The audience never went 10 minutes without a huge outburst of laughter in the screening I attended, and I have found few people who disliked it. A class act all around"

","i really enjoyed this movie!! a dark comedy in which you can feel for each character but laugh at them too, in my opinion steve carell has never been better, it's refreshing to see him take a break from his usual hilarity and take on a more serious role. i like greg kinnear's role because he is a master of success but completely unsuccessful. his daughter is the essence of beauty on the inside and as far as everything else goes i think Paul Dano portrays his character dwayne great, to give out that emotion and not say a word for almost the whole movie is remarkable in itself. this movie kept me laughing throughout the entire duration and yet i left the theatre feeling inspired. a true dark comedy but one that should not go un-noticed."

","I stepped into my local cinema with no particular interest in Little Miss Sunshine. I was aware that it was showing and appreciated that it was much more appealing than ""The World Trade Center"", but still, the title gave me little hope. When I started watching it however, I began to fall for all of the characters. Even the patronising, obsessive father begins to grow on you, although more so towards the end when he naturally realises the error of his ways.<br/><br/>While the most obvious message withing Little Miss Sunshine is that of Family Values and following dreams, what impressed me most was the film's ability to portray ""Little Miss"" pageants as what they truly are. Disgusting, (and near Peadophilic) freak shows where by six year old girls, dolled up to look like 1950's porn stars, are paraded in front of crowds, stealing what ever genuine innocence they have left. As if little girls today aren't growing up fast enough"

","I was expecting the movie to be a drab movie saved by Alan Arkin. In fact, Arkin was just one character in an extremely funny movie. Not only is this movie funny, it also critiques modern America. The story revolves around a seven year old who dreams of being Miss America. She is not the ""barbie doll"" type. She wears glasses. Her crazy family all piles in to an aging VW van to head from Albuquerque, NM to Redondo Beach, CA. There is the uncle, a man who became depressed after the second foremost Marcel Proust scholar left him for another man. There is the teenage brother, who worships Friedrich Nitzsche, and has decided to talk to no one until he makes it to the Air Force for pilot training. There is the father, who goes all over the place with his ""seven steps to success"", but is a failure in life (but still drives everyone nuts with his seven steps). Then, there is the grandfather, who doesn't care what he says, no matter how offensive. The movie is clever, and perhaps the funniest moments deal with the problems with the vw van that they have along the way. The movie showed that in today's World, we all want to be successes, but we all have to deal with the craziness of life along the path to our dreams."

Little Miss Sunshine looks into the family dysfunction, crossed with a road trip and that stab of satire, to bring an honest look at family dynamics.<br/><br/>When Frank, a gay scholar and ex number one expert on Marcel Proust, survives a failed suicide attempt, he is taken in by his sister Sheryl. Sheryl has a smoking problem and tries to keep the family together. Sheryl's husband Richard is a failed motivational speaker; with one monochromatic look at society. Their son Dwayne idolizes Nietzsche, and vowed an oath of silence till he is reaches his goal of being an air force pilot. Also shacked up is Richards dad Edwin; a fouled mouth man who speaks his mind, without hesitation.<br/><br/>When daughter Olive wins a spot in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, Olive is screamingly beside herself, too the rest a nightmare. All agreeing to driving from Alberquerque to LA, crammed into a falling apart, bright yellow VW, people's limits hit boiling point. Richard's nine step program is not taking off with a book deal hanging in the balance, Dwayne laments his family, Sheryl tries to keep everyone together and looking after Frank, to stop him relapsing. With dysfunction all around her, Olive is the most sane of the bunch.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is such an honest look at family dynamics, the dysfunction and border line meltdown many families run. First time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, with first time writer Michael Arndt, have created a stunning, debut feature film. Michael Arndt has created characters that are honest, holding a reality to them. Each character detailed with unique idiosyncrasies, and grow over this trip. The humor perfectly blends a mix of situation and character derived comedy, while mixing genuine pathos. Adding to the humour, Dayton and Valerie make some heart wrenching moments, adding some harsh juxtapositions with Arndt's script, making you laughing in some of the most inapt times.<br/><br/>While not the biggest part of the film, the young beauty pageant is great satire. Much like mock-doc Drop Dead Gorgeous, you are taken to the back stage scene of this young pageant, and the sheer crassness they are. The young girls are from space than earth, looking more like aliens; Olive the only human girl, with the imperfections, glasses and pot belly. The pageant holds the crescendo of the film, with hysterical results; it's side splitting.<br/><br/>The cast is the real driving force of Little Miss Sunshine. Greg Kinnear begins as one of the most irritating characters, though as Richard grows and realises he's the loser he constantly telling others they are, you really warm to him. Toni Collette is strong and flawless as Sheryl. Steve Carell steps out of the comedy and really shows his versatility, with a great dramatic role. Alan Arkin spits out all the great lines with such mirth. Paul Dano does very well showing much range while not speaking most of the film. Abigail Breslin is beautiful as Olive, with such innocence and the most together while everyone around her is falling apart.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine a real gem. Absolutely exhausted from laughing and running the ride of emotions."

","I mainly went to see this film because my friend is a massive Steve Carrel fan but by the end I had laughed my ass off and almost come to crying at the same time. The beauty of this film is that you can follow most of the characters on the journey. Many critics have claimed that Steve Carrel's Frank is the protagonist of the film and to an extent that is true as we learn of his plight first he has tried to commit suicide because he has been beaten both academically and personally by Larry Sugarman, through the trip he is taken down a peg or two by having to push the van reminding everyone that he is the number one Proust scholar in the country while doing it. By the end in his conversation with Dwayne he admits that Proust is stupid and realised that the family is more important. Greg Kinnear's character Richard of course is a self-help speaker whose words are discouraging rather than encouraging his children's growth he thinks Dwight's silent protest is a good thing it shows character and he encourages Olive not to eat ice cream. But when his book falls through because of him and he finds the family is virtually bankrupt it would be most characters downfall. But he redeems himself by defending his daughter at the beauty pageant and letting her dance her dance. Following Dwight's silent protest is another way of looking at the film. His journey to become a fighter pilot is thwarted because he finds out he is colour-blind. The touching scene where Olive holds his hand and he carries her back up the hill was one of my favourite in the film. And again he goes from hating everyone as he writes in his pad to joining his family at the end of the film. Of course the central and most obvious journey is the trip to the Little Miss Sunshine contest, Olive's need to win and her total innocence of child beauty pageants is great. Her relationship with Alan Arkin's grandpa is also very sweet, her scene where she asks him if she's pretty was also a great one in my eyes. In my opinion Toni Collete doesn't really have that much to do and her character only reacts to those around her but her role is as vital as any of the other ones. I laughed my ass off in the last scene depicted the joining together of the family as Olive dances her risqu√© routine to Superfreak the family all joining hands to dance with her. This really was a great ending to a superb film. And all the actors from ten-year old Abigail Breslin to seventy-something Arkin acted their socks off, I was particularly impressed with Paul Dano's performances having only seen him in the Ballard of Jack and Rose before now. All in all I think the best film you'll see this year."

","It was a dreary Saturday here in Cleveland and I said to the wife ""how about we go see a movie?"". After glancing at the movie reviews on the web I saw this one and noticed that it had Steve Carrell from the Office in it. I must say that it was one of the most enjoyable movies that I've seen in quite some time. Some of the scenes were fantastic. I laughed so hard at the gas station scene when he buys his magazines. I've been telling all my friends about this movie and I think the title turns people away. I think people assume it is a kids movie. Anyway I would highly recommend this movie. Its been a long time since a good flick like this came out. And the ending is hilarious."

","After a summer of excruciating, tedious, bland and generally rubbish blobkbusters, I'm really glad that small independent movies like this one are gracing our screens again. It's one of those classic little gems about dysfunctional families, growing up, getting old and going on a roadtrip of self discovery.<br/><br/>Most of the movie will have you laughing, even though most of the time it is dealing with serious issues such as suicide, death and the horror of beauty pageants for children. Serious types will probably say it's a bit shallow and contrived, and I'll agree that it lacks any real depth, but at the end of the day it made me smile. Hah!<br/><br/>Great performances all round, but for me the standouts were Alan Arkin as Grandpa, and Abigail Breslin as Olive."

His best performance since the original IN-LAWS, which may be the funniest movie ever made.<br/><br/>The ""surprise"" didn't surprise me...I saw it coming about 20 minutes before it happened -- and yet, the unfolding of the story is such a joy, it didn't make its arrival any less delightful.<br/><br/>Movies like this only get made if they are supported by box office.<br/><br/>See this film.

","This movie was done so well, it had just the right blend of artistic influence in it to make it different from most other movies coming out this day and age. The plot was strong and consistent throughout the entire film, the characters were well depicted and developed, the morals were pretty strong, there was not really any strong sexuality (nice to see that a movie can still come out these days without exploiting the female or male body), the language was not atrocious (but for the more conservatives in the group be warned there is cussing), and it was worth seeing again. I'd really recommend this movie to a great many people, there are very few people who would not respect and enjoy this film. Now, if you are looking for films that are just packed full of action or mindlessness like XXX or Napoleon Dynamite, then this sort of film is not for you. But if you are more a fan of spending your $7.50 or what have you on quality entertainment that stimulates the mind, then Little Miss Sunshine is a good movie for you. ¬ñPeace"

"Astralan","9","1","4","26 September 2006"," how to review... hrmmm.
","Chick Flick alert.<br/><br/>This is an interesting and humoresque film. Co-directed between first-time big screen directors Jonathan Dayton and Valery Faris, the truth about dysfunctional families comes into full boom as a family pursue the ambitious dream of their youngest family member to a totally surprising end to the movie. Both incredibly annoying and entertaining, Little Miss Sunshine takes you to realms that some women will find hilarious, but for their male escorts, may be ready to chew on their leather belts for their desire to shoot everyone in the cast within the first 30 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>The one line description of the plot goes as such: A young girl slides by chance into a competition that takes her family into an emotional romp that is both disparaging and sympathetic at the same time. The characters take you into realms that we all know are purely fictional, yet at the same time reminding you of people in your past (if you are old enough yet to have that line of memory) that just make you want to slap due to lack or reality to begin with. I have to admit, I was ready to plug myself into my MP3 phone and totally diss the movie because of all the associations I have had with people just like these portrayed in this movie... YET! You persevere and see what happens next. I really didn't want to go some places.<br/><br/>The story opens with a tragedy. The brother of the wife in this instance has done something that the state frowns on and end up in a hospital. Unfortunately, insurance isn't going to cover everything, so this bud has to go. So, lets move him in with a boy that has Nietzke emblazoned on his wall and has taken an oath of silence until his dream comes true. The father is a lost soul trying to put together a ""Steps"" program from motivation but is having a hard time promoting it. It is embarrassingly obvious from the start why it's not flying. And all this time there is a grandpa that is helping a hopeful youngster fulfill her dreams of becoming a beauty queen by developing a special talent.<br/><br/>All and everything get thrown into a yellow mid-60's VW Micro-bus that is just as dysfunctional as it's passengers, and they make the trip from New Mexico to Los Angeles to attend and compete in the title pageant.<br/><br/>What could POSSIBLY GO WRONG!! That is for you to find out. All I can say is you will be in for a totally psychologically emotional ride that just make you laugh and spit at the same time. The totally incompetent father, the teenage son living in total denial and anger; the addiction of the grandfather, the angst of the wife's brother in his personal relationships make you feel at times there is no hope for the male element for any purpose on earth. That is contrasted deeply by the optimism of the little sunshine queen, which seems to end up making the most outrageous contribution to the pageant... enough to get her ejected from the passion all together if it wasn't for the shining knights in white armor that charge in and rescue her in her hour of need. The only person that seems to be centered and in the center is the mother, and she just seems to be dragged behind everywhere the family horse ends up going.<br/><br/>There are lots of twists and turns, surprises that are and aren't welcome at times. There is a lot packed into this film.. but then again, it's a comedy, a situational comedy that you just have to expect that things will be rushed and compacted. However, it's funny, witty and nostalgic in a contemporary sense.<br/><br/>In light of this, I have to give it a thumbs up, but I don't think I could take this movie a second time!!! I'm a guy! SPARE ME!!!"
"LoudMouth6145","10","1","4","26 September 2006"," One of the best Movies of all time!!!
","This Movie is so funny, and I have never seen a movie that made me literally, fall out of my seat in laughter! I love Olives talent performance! ""Shes a super freak, Super Freak"" since when does an eleven year old dance to Rick James!! OH and when they stole the grandfathers body! I SO called that! I was trying the whole movie to read the sons shirts, the one that says ""Jesus was wrong"" had me rolling! Was it just me and my friends, or did Olives shirts look stuffed to make her look bigger? My favorite character would have to be the grandfather, although he died (OD)I still felt that he was everyone there's pillar, had he not gone the story would have been lost. I am also extremely excited that Steve Carrell somewhat stepped away from his usual characters to play a gay, suicidal, Nietche scholar. It sounds funny, but it was a captivating performance. Anyways, I am in love with this movie and I would recommend anyone to see it!"

","Little Miss Sunshine was insanely funny. One of those off-the-wall, slice-of-life movies that was totally worth the ticket price, no regrets, for a change! Obviously low-budget, compared to the lavish sets and special effects of other movies of this current era, but that's one of the great things about this movie. (Reminds me a bit of The Breakfast Club in the 80s, in the midst of amazing productions, special effects, sets, etc., there was this little gem, one of the greatest slice-of-life movie, set only with high school kids in a school library the whole time.) <br/><br/>In Little Miss Sunshine, the direction, character development and plot are brilliant enough to keep you entertained. It pulls you in within the first few minutes, and in no time at all, you're careening through this dysfunctional family's wacky journey to get to an event on deadline.<br/><br/>We laughed very hard the entire way through the whole journey. Great family movie for mature 12-13 and up. Drug references and language, but all tolerable and within context (not gratuitous.) <br/><br/>This is one we'll buy and watch over and over again."

","What the best thing to do if your family is a financial and personal crisis? Take a road Trip Of course; well that's what the Hoover Family did. Richard Hoover is unemployed and is trying to make his idea of the ""10 steps to becoming a winner"" Go global. Sheryl Hoover is a housewife and spends all her time trying to make her kids happy. Dwayne Hoover is there son, and has taken a vowel of silence until he can go to flight school. Olive Hoover is just an ordinary girl, but has the dream of becoming the next Miss America. Grandpa Edwin Hoover lives with his son's family as he got kicked out of his nursing home as he got caught taking a line heroin, and his philosophy of life it to do everything even it kills you. Frank Hoover has just moved into his sister's house, as he has now been let out of hospital as he tried to kill himself, when he got fired, lost his house, lost an award that he should of got and his gay lover left him. So all together they make one jumbled up family. When Olive gets told that she is going to be a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty Pageant, the whole family drives across the country to get her there on time, but while they make it in time, and by the end of it, will they be a much closer family? This is a movie, that everyone will enjoy, children will not find it funny though, as they will not understand most of it, teens may understand some and find it slightly humorous, but adults will love it and find it funny and thought provoking. A great performance from the virtually unknown Abigail Breslin, she makes a very cute olive and is really believable. Once again another strange performance from Steve Carrel. This movie is really enjoyable, but not maybe you would want to watch over again and again. It really does make you think about yourself, your life, the world we live in and other's around, especially the one you love the most. You're Family. The Humor in the movie is rather crude at times, and does have a kind of ""damn the world"" attitude to it. This movie is also a bit quirky and if you like those random and weird movies then is defiantly one for you as it is full or weird and random story lines and it is full of quirky jokes. The jokes in this movie isn't so upfront and are obvious to see, they just kind of creep up on you. As well as all of this this movie shows an insight into the sick world of beauty Pageant's and how little girls and made up to be like porcelain dolls and act like them to, its shows how horrible it must be for children in those beauty pageants and how completive the movie can be. Like I've said adults will absolutely love this movie and think it's hilarious whereas most children will not, but it is defiantly and movie to go and see at least once, whatever age you are."

","This movie has everything a good movie should have. There are parts where you want to cry, and parts where you laugh so hard you end up crying. Honestly, I have never heard a theater laugh so incredibly hard. This is a great family movie, even though it's rated R- the only mildly questionable scenes involve a man snorting heroin and use of the F-word a couple of times. This movie really is incredible, and makes every member of the audience feel connected to every problem of these dysfunctional people. Steve Carell, who is more commonly known for Anchorman and The 40-Year Old Virgin, is absolutely stunning in this as a character he does not usually play- suicidal, quirky, and depressed. Think twice about not seeing this movie- it is by far the funniest movie you will see all year!"
"puppycupcake","10","1","4","22 September 2006"," Mistake in character listing
","I was not able to go onto the goofs section to make a note of this. But I have a comment about a possible error. Frank was Sheryl's brother, yet he is listed as having the same last name as everyone else. He would have a different last name. Besides that comment, I have to say that this was just an excellent movie. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when Olive started her act. Every time anything happened, you wanted to laugh, and just cry over how sad and pathetic their lives are. I loved the ending. Any mainstream movie would have had Olive pull some fantastic talent out of the sky and beat all the other girls out. The love that they had for each other was also touching. They loved each other and they knew how pathetic they were as well."

The movie detail did not make sense to me, but maybe that is because the model was different--still, I wonder, as the ""mechanic"" character said it was a bad clutch--if that was the case, the car could not move at all.

","Once in a while, there comes a comedy film that comes out of nowhere to become a surprise box office hit.

In 2002, a little movie called My Big Fat Greek Wedding showed longevity in the box office becoming the highest grossing romantic comedy of all time. This year that honor will go to the two movies: The Devil Wears Prada and this: Little Miss Sunshine. This is an unconventional family movie. Only the female members of the family are normal: the mom (Toni Collette) and her daughter aka Little Miss Sunshine (Abigail Breslin). As they travel from their home in a town somewhere in New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California for the daughter to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine kiddie pageant. They encounter some funny and awkward situations therefore strengthening their family bond.

","Who would have thought that a first time screenwriter (Michael Arndt) and first time directors (husband and wife Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris) would create that comedy? Definitely not me or anyone else who saw Little Miss Sunshine, it surprised the heck out of me and is easily my personal favorite movie from this year.<br/><br/>It tells the story of the dysfunctional Hoover family and their VW road trip to get their dopey yet adorable seven year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) to compete in the Californian Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. What makes it so special? For one, the characters, while somewhat stereotypical, are acted and written to perfection. There is the cranky crude Grandpa (Alan Arkin) battling a heroin addiction. There is the miserable angst-ridden teen Dwayne (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence and prefers to write his statements in a notepad when forced to communicate with others. There is the hard working Mother (Toni Collete), trying her hardest to take care of her family and not have a mental breakdown herself. Her husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a wannabe self help guru whose constant words of ""encouragement"" only manage to alienate himself from his children. Much discussion has been had over the casting of comedian Steve Carrell as the Uncle Frank, a Proust scholar who is taken in by the Hoover's after attempting suicide. Like every other actor in the film he is perfectly cast delivering all the necessary moments of comedy while still bringing to life a flawed, interesting, and likable character. Finally there is Olive, whose only flaw is that she has the unattainable dream of becoming a beauty queen. It is also worth noting that the she delivers the funniest line in the entire screenplay. I won't give it away, but when you hear it you will know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>The story and characters give the movie an ample amount of comedic potential and it is all fully utilized. Everything from the family banter to the deadpan look one character gives another to the major set pieces deliver big laughs. The comedy is intelligent and dark yet at the same time accessible enough for a wide audience. Heck, if it was not for the language it would be the perfect movie to take the kids too. It is all about sticking to and looking out for your family no matter what while professing the always popular moral of ""true beauty lies on the inside"". A handful of moments are surprisingly emotional, so much so that if your eyes get misty you won't know if it is from laughing to much or simply viewing genuinely moving cinema. The word gets tossed around a lot these days but no film I have seen is more worthy of the being placed in the sub-genre that is ""dramady"". This summer movie season was one of the worst in recent memory; filled with movies that I thought were either not all that great or left me very disappointed. I am very thankful this incredibly wonderful gem was discovered by me mid-august. I really cannot praise Little Miss Sunshine enough. See it on DVD you guys and place it amongst your favorite comedies, I know it is one of mine."
"meeza","9","1","4","20 September 2006"," Sunny Delight!
","Quirky characters have always been a necessary criterion in dialogue-driven independent films. The indie sunsation, I mean sensation ""Little Miss Sunshine"" glows to that mold exactly. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette star as Richard & Sheryl Hoover. Richard is a struggling motivational speaker whose egoistic tactics derail his career instead of motivate it for success. Sheryl is the Gibraltar of the Hoover Damn Family who tries to put everything in its place doing rocky times at the Hoover Damn. Steve Carell plays Sheryl's gay brother Frank, who unsuccessfully tries to commit suicide because quite frankly his gay lover left him because he was no longer considered the top Prost scholar. Paul Dano plays Dwayne Hoover, the angst tacit teenage Hoover son who has resorted to ""sounds of silence"" to allow him to escape from the family torments. Alan Arkin plays Grandpa Edwin Hoover who is the antithesis of Dwayne. Gramps talks way too much about anything he has his mind on. And then there is the Little Sunshine herself. Abigail Breslin plays Olive Hoover, the young pageant-obsessed Hoover girl who has qualified to enter in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest in California. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a bright & wonderful family road trip film which focuses on the Hoover mission to get Olive to the pageant in Cali. Michael Arndt has written a delightful script which is worthy to be called a ""piece of Arndt"". Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Paris also should be noted for their big dynamic duo effort in developing ""Little Miss Sunshine"". However, it was the stellar cast of this film that really ""brought the sunshine in"". Could very well be the premier acting ensemble of 2006. All are worthy of Oscar nominations! The scene-stealing work of Arkin has to garner a Best Supporting Actor nom! Make the sunshine of your movie life a viewing of ""Little Miss Sunshine"". ***** Excellent"

","Saw this film at the Universal Cineplex in Florida this week. Decided to go as it looked like a bit of a giggle, you know, a little poke fun at the bizarre world of pageants. However, when this film started it proved so much more. As a dysfunctional family ( Mum Toni Colette, Dad Greg Kinnear)embark on a road trip to see their little girl, Olive, into the Little Miss Sunshine pageant,things do not go to plan and the darker your sense of humour, the more you will enjoy this film. Think of the worst day you've had, where nothing seems to go right for you and times it by 100. The cinema was by no means full but from the laughter coming from everyone you would have though there were double the amount of people in the audience.

"DICK STEEL","10","1","4","19 September 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Little Miss Sunshine
","This is today's GV Surprise Screening.<br/><br/>For their debut feature length film, directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris probably couldn't ask for a better script - Little Miss Sunshine is a comedic drama which has plenty of heart, even though the characters are misfits put together in a dysfunctional family.<br/><br/>But wait, before you roll your eyes at yet another story with quirky characters, this one probably proved itself to be relatively superior given its easy going delivery, never taking itself too seriously with the messages it tried to put across, and the cast is a joy to behold. Telling the story of the Hoover family's journey cross-country to bring their young daughter to the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, it's an insane road trip movie as well in their yellow family mini-van.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin first made her debut in M Night Shyamalan's Signs as Mel Gibson's daughter, and here she's the wide-eyed adorable child who will just tug at your heartstrings - you'll probably be sympathizing with her character's (mis)fortune with a family like hers. But there's where the fun is, no? The more recognizable actors here will be Steve Carrell (The 40 Year Old Virgin), as her gay scholarly uncle, and Toni Collette (In Her Shoes) as her mom. Rounding up the cast are Greg Kinnear as motivational-inspirational speaker Dad, Paul Dano as her brother who had taken a vow of silence, and Alan Arkin as coke-sniffing, foul- mouthed grandfather who dotes on her.<br/><br/>While the opening might take its time to set the scene, once the family gets together there's no holding back. The dialogues and interactions between characters are fast and snappy, and each character's given enough screen time to showcase their tribulations and respective resolution. Which I found to be deftly done both in script and direction. There was one major loophole spotted, but nothing to mar your enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>What I totally liked about the movie, is by the end of it, there's this warm fuzzy feeling that you'll feel about the message brought across, that the strength of family lies in sticking together, and through that, any adversary can be defeated, any troubles overcome. Anything else doesn't matter so long as there's unity, and the movie shows this pretty nicely - the gem of self-discovery together, and the getting out of the rut with support from one another.<br/><br/>The crowd favourite is definitely the finale, which will more than likely to blow you away as it comes rather unexpectedly, and raises a few eyebrows too. At the screening, almost everyone was clapping and cheering, and the last time I experienced that kind of joy, was in the finale of Kinky Boots, which on hindsight, is similar in the kind of feeling it evokes from you. Though I must add that it was kind of unnerving somewhat watching the young performers prance around with their fake plastic smiles, stiff hair and loads of makeup.<br/><br/>In life there are winners and there are losers. Little Miss Sunshine, is definitely a winner. Go watch!"
"dbel8893","10","1","4","18 September 2006"," This is a perfect dark comedy
","Dark comedy is not synonymous with laughing out loud, but this movie was a huge exception. I was in tears about 5 times in the theater!!! Tough to make the plot work and be funny, but they nailed it. The casting was awesome... Steve Carell (Uncle Frank) was surprisingly and convincing for his odd role. The rest of the cast fit perfectly too. Could go on and on, but give this movie a chance, it's good for anyone. Gentlemen, if you can, convince your lady that its a chick flick (the name will give her nothing to come back with!)... You'll be seeing a great movie and get to pick out the next one you go see!!

"cheers-2","9","1","4","18 September 2006"," All of my favorite emotions in one film
","Yesterday I saw the movie Little Miss Sunshine. And I cannot be any clearer in saying that this is now one of my most favorite films ever. I can be quite critical and do not use the term 'favorite' loosely. Another one of my most loved movies also happens to star Greg Kinnear, As Good as It Gets. And this reminded me a lot of that ¬ñ not the story or the characters, but the feeling it left inside.<br/><br/>I can tell you that I haven't left a theatre feeling this way in many years. In fact, I haven't FELT this way in many years. Through out the entire movie I would weave in and out of crying and laughter as though I were on an emotional loom. The all too familiar sense of the 'dysfunctional' family brought me into the story as though these actors were simply a part of the everyday family that we see in the stores, live next door to, and have in our own homes. The problems may be different, the issues and personalities certainly vary¬Öbut really, like it or not, this is an American family. The so-called 'normal' family simply does not exist.<br/><br/>And what was so heartbreakingly wonderful about the Hoovers were that through each failure and setback, the love was still there and was touchingly visible. And that is exactly what it all comes down to¬Öthe love. Just about member in this family through the duration of the film experienced some type of failure or let down. But just as in life, they stood again ¬ñ even proudly, loved one another, and moved on.<br/><br/>As I explained earlier, this movie was the Space Mountain of theatrical emotion. One moment I would be crying and the next, hysterically cracking up. And then there were those opportunities of experiencing my favorite ¬ñ happy tears. Ah, so many happy tears in this movie.<br/><br/>The very end of the movie has to be one of the best endings of all time. I was crying while I was laughing almost uncontrollably. My cheeks actually hurt. What a fabulous experience.<br/><br/>This movie is full of humor ¬ñ some dark, some not so dark. This movie is full of real life substance ¬ñ to which so many of us can relate. It is almost tangible how honest, authentic, and genuine this story comes across. I have not seen anything like it in a long, long time. And I am begging filmmakers out there ¬ñ please, we need more of this.<br/><br/>And to all of those who made this movie possible ¬ñ thank you thank you thank you."
"Chris Knipp","9","1","4","17 September 2006"," A perfect little film, truly fun and surprisingly real
","Little Miss Sunshine is a splendidly simple piece of screen stagecraft: it is about characters and a situation that brings them all together, and as only a film can, it takes them on the road. So it's a road picture. About a weird family in New Mexico whose members all get roped into taking a little girl to California to compete in a kind of beauty pageant for little girls. Actually the family isn't so much weird as it is heightened. The father Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker with a ""nine steps"" program he's concocted. He's full of confidence and looks like a successful businessman, only he isn't successful; he's a failure. He's no Tony Robbins; he isn't anybody, and he's broke. His 15-year-old son Dwayne (Paul Dana) is a depressed teen who's taken a vow of silence and reads Nietsche all the time; he wants to become a fighter pilot and won't speak till he's assured a place at the Air Force Academy. The wife and mother Sheryl Hoover (Toni Colette) is struggling with the family's problems, but she's not so unusual in herself. The grandpa, dad's father Edwin (Alan Arkin), is a grouchy but spirited eccentric. He's been kicked out of a retirement community for, we must presume, using foul language, advocating promiscuous sex, and taking hard drugs, things he does freely now at home. And a new addition to the household is Richard's brother Frank (Steve Carell), a gay professor and the number one Proust scholar in the United States, who's just attempted suicide over a male student who dumped him in favor of the number two Proust scholar. He's lost his teaching post, had to live in a motel, and been passed over for a MacArthur genius award for Proust scholar number two. The Hoovers rescue Frank from the hospital. <br/><br/>Frank's put in Dwayne's bedroom, where Dwayne writes a message on a pad: DON'T KILL YOURSELF TONIGHT. Olive (Abitgail Breslin) is just a little girl with an enormous enthusiasm for competing in a beauty pageant. She's sweet and has a nice smile and pretty skin but she's ordinary looking and has a tummy and wears big glasses. There isn't much time to get Olive to the pageant in California when she learns she's allowed to compete, and there's no way Richard will permit but to drive in their old VW bus. The bus soon loses its clutch and it can't be fixed, so they have to give it a running start by pushing it or drifting it down a hill. <br/><br/>The element of surprise is important to the pleasure Miss Sunshine can abundantly provide, so it's impossible to reveal how the story progresses from there. All we can tell you is that on the road, the family members don't escape from their problems or their dysfunctions; these continue and have to be confronted. The pageant, when they finally get there at the very last possible minute, is a bit of a shocker for all concerned. It's a sign of how admirable this little film is that one can't sum up its world-view, though one feels it does have one. There's something about families here: their unexpectedness, the way people in them seem more extreme than they are, and turn out to be better than anybody thought. There's gentle fun made of institutions and laws and politicians and the humidification of childhood and the crass culture of ""winners"" and ""losers,"" but nothing gets in the way of the story, and one's never distracted or bored for a single minute. Minor characters are treated rather cruelly, as is the beauty pageant (it almost makes one gag) and the film's economy also means the omission of some explanatory details. But simply drawn as the characters are (and despite Sunshine's Sundance Festival origins), there's no sense of indie clich√© or indie contrivance or indie cuteness here. This is a triumph of minimalism. Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who directed, and Michael Arndt, who wrote the screenplay, have put together a beautiful thing. It wouldn't have worked, of course, if the actors hadn't all contributed so ably and evenhandedly to the enterprise. The result is truly fun, and surprisingly real. <br/><br/>P.s. Okay...near-perfect. But in the field of this year's (2006) American films, it's damn-near perfect."
"lcampbell-7","10","1","4","17 September 2006"," Absolutely amazing.
","This movie completely and absolutely blew me away. I did not go in with high expectations at ALL.

Every single character gives an Oscar-worthy performance. To be perfectly honest, I don't think that 10 out of 10 does this movie justice.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and see this movie.

This is a morality play which is fun to watch. Preview of movie on TV is poor -- preview is depressing in mood and silly in content. This movie is a sleeper and one of the best of 2006. It portrays values in modern life in a satirical way but it does so in a very funny manner. This movie is well acted (I assume actors enjoyed making this film) with a very good script.

"dhaufrect","10","1","4","16 September 2006"," ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the brightest film this year.
","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the brightest film so far this year. It is a comedy that had me laughing and crying simultaneously. Abigail Breslin plays Olive, the charming daughter of a most dysfunctional family. Dr. Phil would be extremely challenged by this group. Greg Kinnear does another masterful job in his portrayal of an inspirational speaker, Richard, with somewhat less talent at accomplishing this feat at home. He is perfect in this part. Paul Dano plays Dwayne, the silent brother who is rebellious and introspective nearly throughout the whole movie. His Tee shirt is a scream, and his silence is golden. Toni Collette plays Sheryl, Richard's wife, and she too gives an outstanding performance. Alan Arkin is perfect in his portrayal of the Grandpa with a spark for his granddaughter's talent, yet an extremely comical attitude that permeates his character in his inimical way. Lastly, Uncle Frank is played by Steve Carell, a suicidal, gay man who is brilliant and intense in his role. Don't miss this sun-shining film. It is masterfully done and will grab your heart and your funny bone at the same time."
"Animal89","9","1","4","15 September 2006"," The Breakfast club hits the road. Best movie this year so far.
","I love going to the cinema and seeing a film that completely and totally original, something that is just nothing like anything I've ever seen before and so my response to ""Little Miss Sunshine"" was one of love at first sight.<br/><br/>The narrative follows a pattern similar to the legendary ""The Breakfast Club"" before it. A dysfunctional family whose youngest daughter Olive has made it to the final of the little miss sunshine contest must travel to California and by a string of bad luck the entire family ends up coming along.<br/><br/>Every member of the family is unique and they are all superbly portrayed by a talented and well-picked cast with each character being original and well developed. However what makes ""Little Miss Sunshine"" so fantastic is the chemistry between the characters. As the trip begins a wall can almost be seen around each individual character as they dwell silently in their own problems. As things start to go wrong and bad moves to worse, one by one the family opens up to one and other, their stories sporting hilarious but frequently moving results and the relationships between them are truly touching.<br/><br/>Now for the new and completely original and brilliant part. This film strikes the perfect blend between extremely moving drama and its comic element. Its brand of humour is beautifully original and very odd. As the film gets moodier and more intense the humour gets blacker and so blends with the feel of the film meaning that no gag is out of place and that many comedic parts actually add to the mood of the film. This allows the audience to laugh and enjoy the film but still take it seriously for what it is. It is all topped off with a final scene that is so bizarre and unpredictable you won't know weather to laugh or simply look sheepish.<br/><br/>It's a fantastically black comedy and moving drama with a unique and touching look at family life. Best of all it was the most original film this year and in an age of sequels, second sequels, spin-offs and remakes, originality is becoming a precious gem which is getting increasingly rare. The last truly original film the I saw was ""Pirates of the Caribbean; The Curse Of The Black Pearl"", and that was 3 years ago.<br/><br/>Also recommended; The Breakfast Club<br/><br/>Forrest Gump"

I sat on the back of the cinema not on the best spot so it didn't started very well, but soon the movie got a grip on me. Itr started all quiet sad and i was thinking good god is this a comedy? But soon the first humorous situations come up and the first laughs fell the normally quiet cinema. A excellent Carell a excellent Kinnear and a excellent Colette and the revelation for me is Abigail Breslin.She played the role of Olive with loads and loads of talent. This movie couples drama with sophisticated humor and with gross humor, but at the end this movie is just great.Little Miss Sunshine also has something more than movies in the same genre it climbs to its zenith to reach a fantastic finale. The finale of this movie is the best part of the movie and that is wonderful.People started to clap their hands while they were laughing because it was so funny, i felt more in a theater than in a cinema, because of the atmosphere that reigned in the cinema. A feeling of a two hours that you couldn't have enjoyed more, a feeling that said no , i don't regret i was here, no Mather what.

","I saw Little Miss Sunshine not quite knowing what to expect -- was it supposed to be a comedy?? A sad movie? I didn't know what it was going to be like. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! This movie is a great family comedy-- it's got the perfect amounts of funny parts, sad parts, parts that make you feel incredibly lucky, and parts that make you realize how awesome your family really is. If you're a fan of Steve Carell, like I am, you'll love his part in this. He never fails to add comedy to a movie. Paul Dano's part, Dwayne, was definitely my favorite character, though. He did a great acting job, and his character added a lot to the story. The whole film displayed great acting... there was never a moment when I didn't believe what was going on or thought ""That's stupid"". Overall, I gave this movie 10/10 stars, and I suggest going out and seeing it in theatres. It isn't one you want to miss."
"breo","8","1","4","12 September 2006"," Little Miss Sunshine (a cinematic hug and a tickle)
","Little Miss Sunshine appears to be another in the latest batch of comedies with a quirky tone and long silences, but it's actually quite conventional and crowd pleasing. It's the story of a family traveling miles together to enter their little girl into a beauty contest called Little Miss Sunshine. <br/><br/>The family consists of the dad Richard (Greg Kinnear), a success driven motivational speaker, Sheryl (Toni Collette), a tired, patient mother, the Granpa, (Alan Arkin), a world weary heroin addict, Shreyl's brother Frank (Steve Carell) a gay manic depressive suicide case, Dwayne (Paul Dano) a moody teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he gets accepted into the Air Force and Olive (Abigail Breslin) a cute, caring 6 year old girl who wants to be Little Miss Sunshine. <br/><br/>The strongest element of this film is the characters, they're all beautifully rounded, likable and excellently portrayed by an astounding cast, each one perfectly complimenting the other, it's hard to say who stands out, Toni Collette is perfectly cast as the long suffering supportive wife and mother, with an American accent you can't fault (she's Australian)you'd be forgiven if you are reminded of Frances McDormand. Greg Kinnear is also reassuringly restrained with a character that could be so over the top, with his rants about winners and losers, he's likable but frustrating. Alan Arkin is hilarious yet pathetic with his inappropriate advice and heroin snorting but close relationship with his granddaughter. Steve Carell is once again there's a thin line between comedy and tragedy, as he is in the long line of comic actors to impress in a mainly dramatic part. Paul Dano also does excellent work a character that could have tired easily, a moody teenager who doesn't speak is hardly the most original character but you actually see things from his point of view and you sympathise when it all crumbles around him. And finally without sounding clich√©d, the little girl, Abigail Breslin really is the star of this film, cute but realistic cute, not in a kids say the darnedest things way, she seems to be the bond that ties these people together, particularly seeing as she's the reason she is the reason they're on this trip in the first place, but she looks at each of the characters with unjudging eyes and loves them whether she's making them feel better or innocently questioning them, the scene where she asks Frank why he tried to kill himself is a stand out. Her innocence is portrayed perfectly when she laughs at the fact that he was in love with a boy, proclaiming it silly, it's a performance to rival Dakota Fanning, Drew Barrymore and any other child actress you care to mention.<br/><br/>It's beautifully shot film, bright yellows and vast scenery, lush but not over stylish, surprising considering directors Johnathon Dayton and Valerie Faris previous work is mainly music videos. <br/><br/>A great debut script from a Michael Arndt, who's only previous film work seems to be assistant to Mr. Broderick on Addicted to Love, there's hope for all of us. The writing is both touching and funny, some of the more obvious comedy scenes however such as sneaking out of the hospital, the cop finding their porn stash and the dance scene at the end seem a little tacked on to up the belly laugh factor and distort the smooth flow of the film.<br/><br/>Overall it's sweet and funny, with excellent performances from all the cast, complimenting brilliantly written characters.<br/><br/>8/10 http://brensfilmblog.blogspot.com/"

Reminded us a little of the road-trip zaniness of National Lampoon's ""Family Vacation"", but certainly in a different class in acting (all primaries great, and secondaries such as Beth Grant as a pageant official and Matt Winston as the MC deserve a mini-Oscar), story, atmosphere, and commentary on aspects of American culture, including 12-step programs and kiddie beauty pageants. (Makes you ache for poor Jon Benet even when she was alive.) Plot keeps you guessing right up to the end.

","This movie is definitely going on my all-time ten best list. It has so many funny and true-to-live scenes, as well as touching and life-affirming moments. There are those consoling scenes, like where Olive (Abigail Breslin)consoles her brother by putting her head on his shoulder, or where the grandfather (Alan Arkin) consoles his (supposedly) positive-thinking son who has just had his whole world pulled out from under him. Then there is the great and touching scene where Olive asks her grandfather ""Am I pretty?"" and his loving reply.<br/><br/>There are also great comedic moments, such as at the beginning where the grandfather is cussing about having the f***ing chicken all the time, and also where he counsels Dwayne (Paul Dano) to (make love to) lots of women, ""not just one."" And of course, there is the penultimate comedy scene, Olive's dance at the end.<br/><br/>I always put a spoiler alert in my reviews, whether there is a spoiler or not, because I am so afraid of being black-listed by IMDb!

They broke the cinematic rule of putting characters near a pool and having them fall in. Is this film ""punk""? yeah. The grandpa turns out to be sweet. Were dealing with issues the size of life here. The big questions, but also the day-to-day routine questions as well. I thought the ""Jesus was wrong"" t-shirt was Threadless, but I was wrong. Beauty contests, OK. Anti-pageantry? Well, not necessarily. The loser/winner dichotomy is established quite early in the film. This film milked polarity of that battery.

Greg Kinnear has never been better. Alan Arkin is a pure joy. The pacing is right on. I do not know if it is possible to make more movies like this, but someone ought to try. So much of this movie rings true, just dead on, that it is hard not to relate to it. Even the small part played by Wallace Langham is great. It is not exactly politically correct, but is life? It is not an idealized version of our world today. Little Miss Sunshine is a warts-and-all portrayal of the things we all have gone through. And underlying everything is the belief in the human spirit, and the belief in the ability of human beings to love and to forgive others. I thought it was superb."

"pyrocitor","8","1","4","10 September 2006"," Bittersweet road comedy with genuine heart
","Little Miss Sunshine<br/><br/>I must confess, what ultimately drew me to this smaller, indie black comedy was the prospect of seeing Steve Carell, one of my very favourite actors since his turn as brain dead weatherman Brick Tamland in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, play a more serious role as a gay suicidal professor. The concept sounded too great - it could either be a more serious, affecting role, or be twisted on its head for a more morbid comedic role. Well as for Carell's character, in the end he manages a good amount of both, and in fact the same could be said for the entire movie. For although I had come to see a single performance, in the end I discovered a wonderful, moving comedy with smears of poignant drama and a real heart and soul to it. <br/><br/>The story follows an incredibly dysfunctional, yet still lovable family, including the incredibly success oriented yet unemployed and unspectacular motivational speaker dad, (Greg Kinnear) the stressed out yet constantly trying to be there for her family mom, (Toni Collette) her brother, a recently fired prestigious university professor just out of the hospital after attempting to kill himself, (Steve Carell) the constantly angry grandfather who tries to relieve his cynicism by buying porn and snorting heroin, (Alan Arkin) the mute by choice world weary adolescent son, (Paul Dano) and finally adorable seven year old daughter Olive (Abigale Breslin) who only dreams of winning a beauty pageant. The drifting apart and seemingly more incompatible family is forced to band together for a road trip when it appears Olive's dream has finally been realised, and she is given the chance to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. <br/><br/>First time screenwriter Michael Arndt must be given tremendous credit for such a masterful piece of work, as should co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris for bringing such a wonderful piece of writing to life. The filmmakers have succeeded wonderfully in creating a myriad of fresh and interesting characters, noticeably flawed yet ultimately lovable despite their foibles. The tone of the movie is also unique, balancing the fine line between black comedy and sweet but not syrupy film boasting the true values of family and success. Somehow Little Miss Sunshine gets away with this obscure crossing of genres while creating a movie that will have viewers laughing hysterically and close to tears in turn. <br/><br/>The pitch perfect cast is what makes the movie really succeed, with the adorable Breslin capturing every viewer's heart as little Olive but delivering a surprisingly affecting performance as well, outshining almost all fellow child actors in this day and age. Greg Kinnear is also wonderful as the macho father who promotes the values of winning above all else, despite the fact it is a quality he himself sorely lacks in his life. Toni Collette is terrific as the harried mother, trying to hold keep her eccentric family together. Paul Dano is great and often hilarious as their silent son, easily holding his own with his much older co-stars despite the fact that he has no dialogue for almost the entire duration of the film. But my two favourite performances out of a cast chock full of masterful ones are Alan Arkin as the sarcastic grandfather who still believes in ""living it up"" and Steve Carell, who blends a poignant, affecting sympathetic dramatic performance with his more usual light hearted humorous side in a truly masterful piece of acting. I wouldn't be at all surprised, and in fact quite happy, if Carell ended up with a Golden Globe or Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. <br/><br/>All in all, Little Miss Sunshine may be bittersweet, and expect to tear up many a time, but the laughs outweigh the sadness in this bittersweet yet lovable comedy about the true meaning of family and success in one's life, not to mention taking a much needed shot at the frightening states of children's beauty pageants, contrasting the refreshingly normal Olive with her disturbingly fake looking fellow contestants. Little Miss Sunshine is one of the most unique and very well made films of this year, for those in search of a laugh, albeit a thoughtful one, this one is definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>-8/10"

","The Hoovers: combine an honest mother, a father whose career is on the fritz, a silent Nietzsche-obsessed brother, a drug-addicted grandfather, a suicidal uncle and a girl who just wants her moment to ""Shine"" and you get one of the most dysfunctional families on earth. The new comedy, Little Miss Sunshine, tells the story of a family who drives from New Mexico to California in hopes that their 7-year old daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin, Signs) can win the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant. With an ensemble cast that includes Greg Kinnear (As Good as It Gets), Toni Collete (The Sixth Sense), and Steve Carrell (TV's The Office) one would expect a movie that produces ""I laughed so hard, I cried"" reactions. Yet, this is one of the best movies to use intelligent humor to attract and hook its audience. Perhaps it was expecting to see Steve Carrell be as outrageously funny as he was in such blockbusters as The 40-Year Old Virgin and Anchorman that was a downer. It is Carrell however, whose performance is serious and subtly funny at the same time. Carrell plays Frank, Olive's gay, suicidal, Proust scholar uncle who needs constant supervision. It was awkward and fascinating to watch Carrell play a serious character. While his performance is worthy of all the praise it has been given thus far, it is not the performance that drew much attention¬Öat least from the audience I viewed it with. Paul Dano, a relative newcomer, seems to overshadow his costars. Dano plays Dwayne, Olive's teenage brother who has taken a vow of silence until he is admitted into the Air Force Academy. I should have guessed from the moment I saw Dwayne's mural of Nietzsche and ""I hate everyone"" scribbled on his notepad, that his cynical view of the world would be the most interesting. It is his observations during the film that provide some of the most comedic moments such as his various facial expressions and witty remarks on his notepad to his odd-ball family. There is another uncredited character in the film that provides some of the best laughs¬óthe family's VW bus. Starting in New Mexico, the audience follows this bright yellow bus 700 miles west to California with several mishaps along the way. A key moment in the film occurs when the stick-shift breaks leaving only two functioning gears. The family is then forced to push the bus to get it rolling and do some clever stunt-work by jumping in after it gains some momentum. This visual gives the film one of its many themes¬óto chase your dream. Finally, it is when the Hoover family, sans grandfather, reaches the pageant when the film becomes the most heartbreaking. With visuals that seem to be taken from documentaries about kiddie pageants, such as a mother spray-tanning her daughter and a over-the-top host, Olive seems to be out of her element. Wanting to spare his daughter the embarrassment of performing, Richard (Kinnear) tries to convince his wife Sheryl (Collette) to pull Olive from the competition. That comes only after Richard pleads with a pageant official to let Olive compete when they arrive just five minutes late for registration. Sheryl tells her husband ""Why can't we let Olive just be Olive?"" The film's message is perhaps wrapped up in that simple quote¬Öto just let people be who they are without trying to fit them into a mold. Little Miss Sunshine is hopeful and heartbreakingly funny with a talented cast that is worth seeing on the big screen. This film has been called ""too real"" by some, but it is its realism that gives it humor. Go see this film, it's worth it."
"LydiaHollowell","10","1","4","9 September 2006"," Funnier than you could have imagined
","This movie was so funny is so many different ways. If you've read any reviews, you know the movie is going to be funny and, at times, sad. But it's actually funnier than you would have imagined and the sad parts, done well, are funny. Most of us can relate to at least one of these characters. Maybe all? And the character of ""Olive"" is so well done by this young girl. Toni Collett and Greg Kinnear are perfect as mom and dad and Alan Arkin is another gem, especially his moment with Kinnear in the van where he shows tenderness for his son's confusion. And Frank, Toni's brother, is just perfect for the role. Carnell is such a good actor and this shows it once more. The ending is absolutely worth the wait; the audience was laughing and I was laughing and my friend was laughing and it's hard to stop laughing. It also pokes great fun at these ridiculous beauty pageants for young girls. It makes one feel sick to see these little girls losing their childhoods. Great satire."

I usually decide if a movie was worth my dollars or that I should have waited for it to come out in the video stores.<br/><br/>Well, this movie was worth the money and more. I never once looked at my watch and I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. I have never heard the kind of laughter from the theatre audience that I heard during this movie. In the emo scenes you could have heard a pin drop. I don't even recall anyone leaving the very packed theatre to go to the bathroom. When we were getting in the car to go home after the movie, we could still hear people laughing all around us in the parking lot as they exited the theatre. <br/><br/>It's not a children's movie even though it's about a child.

","This was a great movie and the little girl who played Olive was delightful to watch. She was cute with a capital C!!! There were many parts of this movie that were slightly odd, in particular the final dance scene in which it is hard to watch. I was not expecting that at all. There were many funny parts. The horn honking scenes were among the best and I know that this movie will get an Oscar nod if all goes well. I have to admit that I really liked the dynamic between that kid Duane and the 40 year old Virgin. There was great chemistry. Toni Colette was beyond amazing and proves once again that she is far better of an actress than Kate Hudson. I will have to watch this again. Alan Arkin was amazing in this movie also. I give this movie a perfect ten because it was sooooo good."

","So I finally got around to watching ""Little Miss Sunshine"" last night...and I loved it. It's an independent film about a bunch of odd characters in a somewhat dysfunctional family.<br/><br/>What I loved most about this movie was the rawness of human emotion and impulses that it portrayed. I loved the way it showed how us humans tend to create our own misery, without even realizing it. It showed the intense pain of having your dreams shatter and collapse right before your eyes.<br/><br/>Most importantly, it showed what a huge impact a father's opinions and judgements can have over a child's psyche.<br/><br/>I can relate to this movie, as I'm sure anyone else who has had some disappointments in life will also relate to it.<br/><br/>I recommend that you all go out and see this movie before it leaves theatres or that you at least rent it once it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>Although the ending could've been a little better, it was definitely worth my $10.50."

","I caught this one at Sundance, and while there's a part of me that would like to tell you that my favorite film at that festival was some seriously obscure documentary that you might be able to see someday if it gets picked up on video, just so I might seem that much cooler...no, in fact, it was this wonderfully twisted-but-warm crowd-pleasing comedy that left me most in renewed awe of the joyous power of cinema. This is what we needed as of 2006. The fact that the first-time feature directors needed to work as hard as they did to raise the funds is sadly understandable, because who would have guessed that they could pull something like this off? Fortunately, Fox Searchlight knew a breakout hit when they saw it -- if they hadn't, someone else would have -- and ponied up a no-brainer record investment.<br/><br/>Dear Academy: for your consideration."
"wisewebwoman","9","1","4","8 September 2006"," One of the best of 2006
","This is one little treasure of a movie whose total cost was about the same as the make-up budget for any blockbuster out there. It rings not a false note from start to finish, the cast meshes like they have lived together for years and the road trip busts all the hollywoodizations of all the movie road-trips we have taken.<br/><br/>Newcomer Abigail Breslin is amazing in a part where she is on screen most of the time and has to run the full gamut of emotions. Her strong desire to take part in a contest many hundred miles from home drives the plot.<br/><br/>If a family could be called ""Dysfunction Junction"" this one is it. From Alan Arkin, who plays the role of the heroin junkie grandfather (he insists the time to do drugs is when you're old and not young, as then you need them!)and curses and swears incessantly, to Paul Dano who plays the son - most of the time wordlessly, all the way to Toni Collette who is at the end of her rope as the mother to this barely together family.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear plays the put-upon manic father beautifully (my way or the highway) and Steve Carell is remarkable in a very difficult role as a suicidal professor. Delicious surprising dialogue and you can't ever tell where it is going. Subtle putdowns of the entire beauty contest phenomenon in the states and the contest itself is enough to make you want to throw up, these tiny little girls dressed as hookers.<br/><br/>So many laughs and true emotional moments - more than I could count. Finally, in this decade a real family that resonates and a breathtaking ending. Yes!<br/><br/>9 out of 10 and I would see it again."

","Make way for yet one more dysfunctional family and this one's a doozy. No one, but no one is anything but totally fouled up. We get to meet each one in an economical opening sequence which establishes that father is heavily into WINNING which means, of course, that he's a Loser, right. Teenage son hasn't spoken for several months, Mom's brother is recovering from a failed suicide attempt after being given the air by his gay lover, dad's father has been kicked out of a retirement home for substance abuse and is obsessed by sex whilst pre-teen daughter has eyes to be a Beauty Contest winner despite being as homely as a mud fence. Because of a technicality the daughter is suddenly eligible for the finals in LA so dad decides that the whole family will drive the 800 or so miles. Naturally everything that can go wrong does go wrong and there's a nice satirical swipe at this kind of contest in general. Alan Arkin's grandpop dies half way there and it is him who has been coaxing the girl in her dance; astute members of the audience will probably not be too surprised when they see her 'act' but the husband-wife director team play down the clues so it will be a revelation to some. This is one of those movies like Sideways, The Station Agent, Garden State, etc, that score heavily on initial viewings but may not hold up subsequently."

It has a little something for everyone: physical comedy, sarcastic humor, teen angst, aging issues, regret for what you've done, regret for what you haven't done, action, drama, family bonding, the very universal feeling of being related to people you just can not understand, desperation, heroic attempts, selfless acts of bravery and the fears and insecurities that we all face.

"sullibrandon","9","1","4","7 September 2006"," A Genuinely Hilarious Film About Family
","These days, the words ""comedy"" do not inspire in me much confidence when going to the movies. When I see the word ""comedy"" I think of nauseatingly sappy romantic comedies, or disgustingly over-the-top gross out comedies. The market is so inundated with clich√© films of this genre that when a new, innovative, and genuinely hilarious comedy comes along, it feels like a breath of fresh air. Little Miss Sunshine is this breath. Not since last year's 40-year-old virgin has a comedy felt so genuinely funny.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an introduction to one of the most dysfunctional families I have ever seen on screen. Steve Carell plays a suicidal gay uncle, Abigal Spencer a young girl named Olive, who is obsessed with winning beauty pageants, Greg Kinner her loser optimist father (a role for which he was born to play, it seems), Alan Arkin the foul-mouthed lovable grandpa who loves and cares for Olive more than anything, Paul Dano Olive's brother who has taken a vow of silence, and finally, Toni Collette, the mother who has to put up with this mess that passes for a family.<br/><br/>The premise of Little Miss Sunshine is simple enough. Olive has been accepted into the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, and the family cannot afford to fly there, so they take a road trip in their beat up yellow VW van. As you can imagine, hilarity and chaos ensue along the way. Sound clich√© and boring? Well, though this premise (dysfunctional family goes on a road trip) has been done before, in no way is it boring, and it never ever feels like a clich√©.<br/><br/>Props for this must go to the cast, for pulling it all off so beautifully. Mad props go to Steve Carell, who once again proves what a comic genius he is. Another thing is - this film does not feel like it is riding on Steve Carell's shoulders. Sure, Carell is helping to support it, but it is the chemistry with the rest of the cast that works. Toni Collette, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, and Greg Kinnear all work wonderfully in tandem with Steve Carell and each other, and never once do they not seem like a family. The writing is brilliant and hilarious, sometimes bouncing forth in wild and wacky outrageous ways, in others quiet and muted, only being funny because it is quiet and muted. Though the premise is a bit clich√©, none of the jokes are. Everything comes off as genuinely funny in its own right. There are no moments of outrageous slapstick, no disgusting gross-out humor, no excess use of lewd content to pass as humor....the entire script has the feeling of working perfectly in and out of itself....it just works wonderfully.<br/><br/>Aside from all this, Little Miss Sunshine is a dark comedy. There are areas that it treads where you'll find yourself uttering a small gasp, wondering, ""Oh my gosh I can't believe he just said that!"" Though this could have been overplayed and completely wasted, it is ingeniously pulled off, parodying and satirizing many elements of American culture throughout. Most of all, it embraces the idea of family. Throughout the film, this family sticks together, they love each other. The message of this film is not, ""Ha! Look at how hilarious this family is because of how dysfunctional they are! HA! Isn't that FUNNY!?"" The message is, ""Look at this family. Look at how screwed up they are. But look at how they love each other. Look at how they come together. Look at, just, the sheer caring these people exude for each other!"" We can laugh at these people, but that doesn't mean we can't genuinely feel for them. Most comedies make jokes at the characters' expense...this film never feels like that, not once. The characters are embraced, not hated. Sure, they're funny, but hey, aren't we all? <br/><br/>Flaws? The ending may have been a little bit over-the-top, however amazingly hilarious it was. Other moments of forced hilarity may seem too much for some people, but I thoroughly enjoyed them. Once or times Carell's vibrant acting personality shines through - which is fine, I guess, but I thought it cut down his character a bit. The film isn't too long - one hour and forty minutes feels just about right.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is simply a feel-good, laugh-out-loud, genuinely hilarious comedy that anyone with a heart for family will love. I certainly loved it. It is rated R, though, but I don't believe this really hindered the movie at all. Sure the characters swear, they talk about sex, and whatnot, but who doesn't? Little Miss Sunshine is everything a comedy should be. It is happy. It is sad. It is hilarious. It is tragic. It is family."

He plays a pompous ass incredibly well. Toni Collete is always a great actress and this time was no exception. I adored her character and felt her frustration. Steve Carrell may have finally gotten over his massive sucking cinematically. While I love ""The Office"" I hate almost all his movies b/c they suck. In this movie his is actually funny and poignant.

","Possibly the years best film, Little Miss Sunshine is in the league of The Royal Tenenbaums and The Squid and the Whale, all films about dis-functionality in the household of the middle American class. Little Miss Sunshine, a motion picture debut by music video veterans Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris hits home more than the other two films mentioned. Lacking the unnecessary and aberrant anomalies that are added in some dysfunctional family films, Sunshine focuses on the habitual and conventional problems a family might and does have. WIth the exception of one scene that does not hold up to the sincerity of the rest of the film Sunshine goes above and beyond the call. With an outstanding ensemble cast, each having a completely different take on family life, writer Michael Arndt turns in an almost flawless screenplay of dialog. Beautifully shot across rural America, with beautiful colors embracing the screen, this is the quintessential Middle Class American film."

For example when a guy was standing by a pool you were thinking ""don't push him in"" and guess what, he didn't push him in. There's other times but I'm just using that for an example.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. A little girl came second in a beauty pageant but the first place girl got disqualified so she becomes first. With that she is allowed to enter another beauty pageant called ""Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pagent"" but the the family doesn't have enough money to fly so they have to drive to where it is. So on the way they run into many conflicts and they're all hilarious and great.<br/><br/>This movie was original as well. Most of the jokes or what happens is new and isn't recycled from other movies. The directors and writers for this movie should be proud that what they've done isn't done much these days. To make a great movie that everyone will enjoy and it'll be rare for someone not to like it.<br/><br/>The characters are interesting and each play a valuable role in the movie. You have the crack addicted grandpa, the gay uncle, the mute kid, the happy, optimistic girl, the work-a-holic dad and the mom. Now they use each of these characteristics well into the movie to give out they best jokes and the best situations they can get out of it. Each of the characters had pretty much an equal role in the movie. The way they did it was amazing.<br/><br/>The ending.....just wow. I can bet anyone who watches this movie will not expect the ending to come the way it did. Another good thing about this movie, the unpredictability. When you think something will happen the complete opposite will happen. Simply amazing.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I would definitely recommend you to see this movie even if you think it looks good or not or if someone has said something bad about this movie."
"nived84","9","1","4","4 September 2006"," The best comedy of the year!
","When I first saw the trailer for Little Miss Sunshine in front of Thank You for Smoking I thought to myself ""Awww that looks like cornball hell"". But to my surprise an enormous amount of absolutely glowing reviews came pouring in praising the film. This time you can trust the critics. Little Miss Sunshine is not only the most hysterically funny and original comedy of the year, it's also one of the very best and most delightful films I've seen all year long. That's right, it truly is. This innocence and carefree little flick serves up a great dish of bittersweet drama and plenty of quirky laughs. If the Academy Awards have any real value left to them this film would at the very least get a Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay; its proof that movies can still be funny and original without having to rely entirely on potty humor and tasteless sex jokes. This is one of those underrated films that should get more attention, and hopefully more people will go and check it out.<br/><br/>This dramedy about a super dysfunctional family revolves around one little girl named Olive; an innocence oddball child with aspirations to win a beauty pageant named ""Little Miss Sunshine"". One look at her and you think to yourself, ""Well that ain't happenin' anytime soon."" Abigail Breslin (the little girl from Signs) is outstanding as Olive, and her performance is a real winner for such a young actress (Look out Dakota!), but this film isn't necessarily all about one great performance, instead we get six! Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear play Sheryl and Richard, the mother and father of this gang of misfits, which includes not only Olive, but her older brother Dwayne, who aspires to be a pilot and has taken a vow of silence until he achieves his goal. And then there's Frank, Olive's gay and suicidal uncle, played by funnyman Steve Carell. Carell, whose ability to whip up laughs in last year's The 40-Year-Old Virgin, keeps himself in a constant downtrodden mood and never seems to try too hard to get laughs, but he gets 'em anyway. He could have stolen the spotlight easily, but he doesn't. And rounding out the family is Alan Arkin as the grumpy and horny grandpa named, well¬Ö honestly, it's just ""Grandpa"". Whose complains about getting old and snorts heroine to deal with his life. All the performances are equally great, no one really seems to outshine anybody else; much like a real family they work together and together they make one of the most entertainingly fun and enjoyable dysfunctional families I've seen on the big screen in quite a long time.<br/><br/>The majority of the film is the family packing into their busted up and literally falling apart VW minivan and traveling hundreds of miles to get Olive to the pageant on time. Sounds like a simple premise, but to anyone whose seen a road trip comedy you can bet that the journey will take plenty of hilarious detours, and the best part of Little Miss Sunshine is that most of the detours you won't see comin'; when you think you know exactly where the joke is headed it immediately takes a sharp turn and goes somewhere else entirely. The amazing script by first time writer, Michael Arndt, is full of tender and soft moments, but the film never gets sappy or corny, and instead sometimes stings with quirky humor and very deep insights into the joy of life, family, and the misery of the pressure to win and the bitter taste of losing. The great thing about the film is how it's handled and how perfectly balanced it is; it never becomes predictably trite or overly sentimental.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a delightful little surprise that rides a roller coaster of emotions from sad, to heat-warming to hysterically funny and enjoyable. This isn't exactly a ""family movie"". It's rated a mild R, for some language and sexual humor and brief drug use. But this is such a charming and entertaining film you hardly seem to notice the R rating. So if you're looking for something refreshingly original and equally funny and enjoyable and you're sick of shallow entertainment like Snakes on a Plane or Beerfest and looking for something that'll put a nice big 'ol smile on your face I'd highly recommend rushing out to the theater and seeing Little Miss Sunshine, even if you have to give your car a push start to make it to the theater, it's worth it."

You will love Abigail Breslin aka Olive. The jerk-less story moves along with first-rate acting from everyone. I thought it would be a sad movie. It was not. A movie delving relationship complexities (mostly frustrations)? No, it is not. It is about laughs. It was a treat. Go, and enjoy it."

","Little Miss Sunshine was by far the best movie I saw this summer- and I've seen everything, ranging from Superman to An Inconvient Truth. The humor in LMS is excellent-from obvious laugh out loud scenes to subtle but hilarious details. This movie is also incredibly touching. It changes from light and joking to serious and emotional in a heartbeat. However, these emotional scenes are what help to make the movie so great. Dwayne's breakdown and his connection with Olive were so touching, I almost cried. The acting was wonderful;the characters were portrayed in such a natural manner. The soundtrack compliments the movie so well- I'm remembering scenes from the movie with the matching background music. I highly recommend this movie-it is, without a doubt, fantastic."

He gives a performance that is nuanced, funny and at one point heartbreaking.

","I thought Little Miss Sunshine was a great movie. It was one of those movies were you have a to have a certain sense of humor to enjoy it. But I don't think it deserved an R rating. I'm not saying I don't understand why the thought it should be R, but come on. Practically the only bad thing was the cursing and that was about it. I thought it deserved a PG-13. Anyway, it's a great movie to see when you need something to perk you up. It's a great story line that you probably haven't seen before. And the characters are extremely funny. The uncle is probably my favorite character. It's definitely not a waste of money."

Toni Collette is amazing as usual; she is the fiber that seems to hold the whole family together. Abigail Breslin will be nominated for several awards for this film as well, and if she wins or loses, she is still going to be a major film star.

","I really liked this movie, it seems these days all movies have unbelievable plots and messed up morals. Hollywood has become obsessed with fart jokes and animals acting out of character, and let's not forget stupid dance movies. this movie remained realistic while covering many controversial life situations. The family was weird but lovable and the movie held up credible moral standard, which most movies lack these days. This movie scored high with me but not excellent due to the fact that I don't believe one family would ever have that many eccentric people in it, most people are boring. Steve carell did an excellent job, he did a great job breaking his type cast and has proved he belongs in the movies. This is a feel good movie that will make you take a second look at your own family with more appreciation and hopefully encouragement. I hope you enjoy, I did."

","Funny and intelligent. One of the greatest movies released in a long time. Disregard the way the title and the plot sound. Blah, blah, blah, yet another silly family road trip movie... boring... If you think the title sounds ridiculous, then you can start to understand the humor of the movie. Little Miss Sunshine is intelligent, hilarious and touching all at the same time. The characters are genuine in every scene. This is not slapstick comedy. Nothing is jammed down your throat. It took a while for the people in the theater to warm up and realize the situations were supposed to be funny. Then by the end of the movie everyone was in tears from laughing so hard and applauded when the credits rolled. I had never seen such a thing and not been disgusted as people applauded for Star Wars or whatever other mind numbing blockbuster I happened to stay awake through. I am not going to review any of the plot or go into any details of the movie. I simply suggest you see the movie. Don't read any other reviews or learn anything further regarding Little Miss Sunshine. Just go see it and let it pleasantly catch you by surprise too."

","Steve Carrel is a scholar, suicidal and gay...thats just the starting guys. This dysfunctional family gets you thinking even hours after the movie is over. The six characters which make up the family are not really that weird but just obsessed with something or the other and their dedication is something to be appreciated actually. But when they all get together and start off on a journey which makes them go through some interesting circumstances, they realize that they do care for each other. The movie ends on that note. It is the subtleness with which the fact is driven home that in spite of the individual idiosyncrasies, it is the concern for each other that makes a family a family."

","Or, the best movie of this year. This summer I was anticipating so many movies. M:i:III, while being a fun movie, it delivered on what i expected it to be. X3 was just popcorn nonsense, and Superman Returns, was kind of a letdown. I was left looking forward to the comedies of the summer to bounce back and show us a good time at the movies. Clerks II and Talladega Nights were great laugh-out-loud comedies, but Little Miss Sunshine comes off as an amazing, hilarious film. From the opening of the movie, to the final shot, nothing lets you down. The characters are great, funny, and moving. Steve Carrell continues to do some amazing work. The the others like Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin play their parts with such...realness. If that's even a word.

"phillipstephenso","9","1","4","27 August 2006"," Cute Movie
","This is a charming, if quirky, film. The film chronicles the experiences of an unusual group of 6 family members, ranging from age 7 to maybe 87, who are traveling from Albuquerque to California in an aging Volkswagen bus to a Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. The travelers range from the little contestant herself to a profane grandpa, who also snorts heroin. Meanwhile, a middle-aged married couple (and the parents of the little contestant) are in the front seats handling the driving chores, including Greg Kinnear, who makes a very good performance as one of those Zig Ziglar style of professional motivators. The other two main characters include the brother of the wife, who also happens to be gay and recovering from an attempt at suicide. And, finally, there is the 15 year old son of the married couple, who is trying to be disciplined so he can be accepted at the Air Force Academy. The film is full of charming incidents that show off the humanity of all the characters, as they are constrained to bear each other's company in a spirit of family solidarity and persistence and determination. Travel can be educational and even broadening in the sense that family members have to be in close quarters with each other for a change and solve problems together, and certainly not merely to enjoy the trip."
"cultfilmfan","8","1","4","26 August 2006"," Little Miss Sunshine
","Little Miss Sunshine is about a very dysfunctional family with a father named Richard whose attitude is that everyone has to win all the time, the mother Sheryl, the suicidal uncle Frank, the son who doesn't talk named Dwayne, the grandfather who speaks whatever is on his mind and a young girl named Olive who wants to be in a beauty pageant being held several states over. To not let her down the family gathers into their VW bus and travels to get to the pageant, but along the way they argue, experience all sorts of problems and learn a lot about each other. Little Miss Sunshine has good direction, a good original script and Oscar worthy performances by the main cast. It took me a little bit to get into this film, but after seeing it and thinking about it I appreciate the film even more. The film had sharp writing and there are a lot of really good conversations between the characters in this film and especially near the end of the film there is a lot of satirical humour that worked quite well I thought. I thought everyone played their parts great and after awhile you really start to like this family and it doesn't really matter that they are dysfunctional and have their own problems because in many ways I think people will be able to relate to at least somebody in the film. I also liked how at the beginning of the film everyone in the family was really wrapped up in their own lives, but because of this trip they learn more about each other and start to work together more as a family. This movie had a lot of dark and offbeat humour in it as well and I liked how it gave the film a certain edge that few comedies have. There are however still some warm hearted scenes and scenes of togetherness and bonding that I thought worked quite well too. This is a very original comedy in a lot of ways and I liked how different it is than most of the regular comedies we have been seeing lately. I think a lot of people will appreciate this film and it will become a hidden gem for most people who will give the film a chance because when I saw this film in theatres the audience really seemed to be loving it. For being original and having sharp writing and a great performance by the cast I recommend Little Miss Sunshine."
"the_Poppuns","8","1","4","26 August 2006"," Pretty good intelligent comedy
","But it will remind you of a few movies you've already seen and perhaps have liked more. The overall story is new. It's about a messed up family who has to go together by van to see the young daughter compete in a ""Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant. That's new. But if you've seen enough movies there are some events that happen along the way that you will be able to predict with incredible accuracy. You'll be reminded of 9 to 5, About a Boy (big time), National Lampoon's Vacation, or if not that, then Deconstructing Harry. At one point, I thought we were going to get a reference to Sparkle Motion. Maybe they were meant to be homages. I couldn't be sure.<br/><br/>But even if every scene wasn't completely original it was very entertaining and funny and in some moments inspirational. I mean you've got an incredible cast here, most of all Alan Arkin, who should have had more screen time. Everyone else was great especially Abigail Breslin, who you probably remember from Signs. There are lots of laughs in it if that's what you're in the mood for but it's not a slapstick comedy. It's got some serious stuff too. It's definitely worth the money."

","What an outstanding film!! Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Found myself both laughing and crying at the same time. The acting was superb. The family reminded myself of my own. Why can't Hollywood through out the gadget special effects and come up with real movies like this?? Give me a good plot with good acting anytime over the mainstream. If Alan Arkin doesn't win an Oscar for best supporting actor for this one, there is no justice. The attention to detail was wonderfully exemplified by the actual pageant scene with the spectators in the audience. One of my daughters got enthralled with Irish Dancing and I hated going to those stupid ""feishes"" with their amped up stage moms. This show had it all."
"RYNOmediaman","9","1","4","26 August 2006"," Welcome to Hell.
","This movie moved me, physically as well as emotionally. At times, my body had moved from the theater seat to the floor, as I could not control the laughter than encompassed my body. Emotionally, it affected me just as much; my mind slid off the seat for a while, and I saw things in my life as they really were.<br/><br/>This movie was based on a typical, dysfunctional American family. Maybe most of the feelings I had toward this movie came from the fact that I could relate so closely to the family on screen.<br/><br/>One tagline for this film read: ""Welcome to Hell."" In fact, that's just about what it was.<br/><br/>The movie floats around the young girl of the family, Olive. At the age of seven, she is invited to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California. The only way to get her there is to put the whole family into a beat-up VW bus, and drive. This is in fact where most of the dark comedy is ensued.<br/><br/>First off, the cast of characters is just magnificent. Most of the events pulled off would not be even as close to as funny or dramatic as they were without the terrific cast of characters.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear leads the family as the strict and over-ambitious father, Toni Collette is the stressed out mother, Alan Arkin as the perverted, junkie grandfather, and the daughter and son, Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano. Then throw in the amazing Steve Carell as the depressed and suicidal uncle, and you have one of the funniest ensemble casts to grace the screen in a long time.<br/><br/>Every family member is starkly different; yet they fit together perfectly. The acting is top notch, from the grandfather's tainted ranting to the mute-by-choice son, to the fighting parents and the sarcastic uncle. Olive is on her own, spending most of the time listening to her music to avoid hearing the explicit conversations occurring in the bus.<br/><br/>I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Every joke hit perfectly, and everything that could go wrong, happens. It's a disaster flick, disguised by the title and premise. There was so much comedy in this movie that it spills over into the blackness right before the end credits, and you can't help but keep laughing as you walk out of the theater.<br/><br/>The family encounters almost everything on their road trip; they experience love and hated, death and healing, and even a bit of car trouble. It leaves the audience with things to think about; with questions to ask themselves.<br/><br/>I walked out of that theater with a full mind. Full of questions that were building and will probably never be answered. Questions about family, and dealing with emotions, and even life itself¬Ö As the teenage son says, ""Life is one f----n' beauty contest after another."""

Not only did it make me laugh from the situations that would arise on this family's trip, but something serious would take place to make me feel a tinge of sadness. I clapped and thought to myself (and maybe said out loud) to spurn someone on in the movie. And he did exactly what I had hoped. Not only that, but the whole family did what I had hoped. It also showed me how words weren't the only way to get someone to do something for them. A simple arm around you and a head on your shoulder works just as well. EVERYONE involved in this movie should receive an Oscar! And it was great how the audience were so in tune to this movie. I absolutely loved it!"
"krisviolin","10","1","4","25 August 2006"," Even better the second time
","I have to say that this was one of the best movies I have seen all year. I first saw it at the Sundance Film Festival, at our local Ogden UT theater. The theater was full (including a row of small children behind me...I have to wonder when people will learn that unrated does not mean G rated. This movie is entirely inappropriate for children, as it deals with suicide, drug use, pornography, plus it's full of the ""F-bomb"".) Anyway, I just love the way the filmmakers illustrate the absurdity and in appropriateness of children's pageants, all the while affirming the importance of family. It did get a little silly in the middle with an homage to National Lampoon, but it was underplayed, and didn't ruin the film for me as it did for a couple of reviewers.<br/><br/>So, August 25, this film finally came to our local theaters, which is slightly ironic as I first saw it right here in our town during Sundance. People will support those movies during the festival, but when indies are released they don't often get to our town. At all! At least this one finally got here (only a MONTH after its release elsewhere). But I digress. I have to say that this held up for the second viewing. I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time and heard a lot of lines that I missed the first time, as everyone was laughing so hard that much of the dialog was drowned out. Unfortunately, the theater was nearly empty (actually, I personally prefer it this way, but I know movies won't make money on empty theaters) today. I hope business picks up, but around here, many of the ""masses"" won't see an R rated movie, regardless of WHY it was rated R. (sigh) Anyway, GO SEE THIS MOVIE, adult types. You'll enjoy it."
"saved4eternity","8","1","4","25 August 2006"," Who said summer movies were just fillers till the good stuff comes around?
","Once in a while, a movie takes you completely by surprise, either because you dropped in just to be 'amused' and found yourself totally immersed and entertained, or because its perceptions of what's important in life resonate so strongly that it leaves you giving this thing we call 'family' one more hooray! Little Miss Sunshine is just such a film. The cast is so totally on target, from Alan Arkin as grumpy, dope addicted but totally lovable grandpa, to Tony Collette as the mom struggling to keep some sense of normalcy in her everyday mundane existence. Of course, what can you say about Greg Kinnear as dad? This actor has been so underrated, mainly I think because he has chosen roles for their meat rather than glitz. In many ways, he reminds me of Kevin Bacon and Johnny Depp in that Kinnear knows what his forte is and relishes in every word on the page, making it totally his own and that to our captivation as an audience. I think fondly of his rendering of Frank Zabaski, Meg Ryan's comfortable relationship/ego maniacal newspaper columnist in You've Got Mail. I delight in every line Kinnear delivers because it is so obvious he is making THIS line his heart and soul at the moment he delivers it as though this chance at immortality will never come again....the mark of a consummate actor. Every performance in Little Miss Sunshine indeed does shine, but the story tugs at your heart in a way few films do. There is something or someone to identify with for everyone in this movie. What's more, we may wish we were more like one character but actually see ourselves in another. No one wants to see themselves as the depressed to the point of giving up on life uncle, but in some respects haven't we all gotten to that point at some time or another? It isn't so much that we didn't make the genuine attempt to end it all, but that we have all FELT as if COULD feel that desolate at some point in our lives. We would all rather be the over-the-top optimist most of the time, but the truth is, we all vacillate between feelings of utter isolation and frustration and all too infrequent feelings of sufficiency and self worth. The real winner in this movie is Olive, because her identity is still waiting to be forged, amidst the imperfect examples she is living with, hopefully gleaning the best from each and making her world a happy place. As far as the audience is concerned, we are all winners because we purchased a ticket to this film! Bravo Little Miss Sunshine! Summer films can sometimes make us smile!"

","I felt completely refreshed when I left the cinema, having seen this wonderful film. A family barely making it and full of beautifully sweet and obscenely funny characters pull together for their youngest family member. Greg Kinnear really made you want to slap his character at first, and he played his role to a T. Steve Carrell continues to impress me with his comedic style, and his character's depiction was one of my favourites. Great writing and fabulous fodder for cinematic T-shirts. The mother's character is the glue that miraculously keeps all the crazy together and running smoothly. The character Olive is a fine example to pageant contestants everywhere, that you can be yourself and be proud of your accomplishments even if it is to everyone else's horror! The son's character has a heartbreaking scene with his sister that has to be my favourite in this film.Grandpa's character was uncensored but his passion for lewdness is equal in his passion for supporting his family. A must-see, quality film for the hopeful and and the hopeless!"
"Solipsisticblog","8","1","4","24 August 2006"," Thoughtful comedy asks some tough questions
","Does anyone remember the ""Jiminy Glick"" skit poking fun at the Independent Film Channel where every movie advertised was about a drug addict, homosexual, and suicidal person hitting the road? The skit then continued with different combos of folks hitting the road and learning more about themselves and life.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine""--an indie comedy that the studio is betting will have broad appeal--almost becomes that movie. We have a homosexual suicidal Proust scholar (Steve Carrell), a drug-addicted septuagenarian (Alan Arkin), a sullen teen Nietzsche disciple (Paul Dano), and a floundering motivational speaker (Greg Kinnear) all hitting the road in a VW van to learn more about themselves and life. What saves this movie from the typical malaise of many indie comedies are the women in the lives of these lost men. Toni Collette as the mother trying to keep her life afloat and her men happy and more importantly little Olive (Abigail Breslin), an eternal optimist who has just learned she has won a spot in ""The Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant.<br/><br/>The family has to make an 800 mile trek in two days to get Olive to the big pageant which she has been preparing for all her young life. (Grandpa has been helping her on a special routine for her talent competition.) As the trip begins, each member of the family, except the oblivious and cheerful Olive, would rather not be journeying to the pageant. But as the journey continues and the obstacles grow, getting Olive to the competition becomes everyone's quest.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic in this thoughtful comedy and it has yet another great performance by Greg Kinnear. Steve Carrell gets to display some range in his role and shows that even if his attempt at movie stardom fails, he will always find work as a character actor. Abigail Breslin, as Olive, though, carries the movie on her small shoulders and makes it work. Will she be crowned ""Little Miss Sunshine""? By movie's end she has proved that she is a true ray of sunshine for her struggling family.<br/><br/>I should mention that this movie takes a hard look at child beauty pageants. Should little girls be forced to portray mock adults and be dressed and behave in ways that are seen as appealing in adult women? Should eight year olds be placed in situations that leave them concerned about their body image? The movie asks these questions in ways which may be offensive to some viewers, but I believe are handled acceptably and deftly. The movie's climax is both hilarious and trenchant as it brings these issues to a head and asks that we let children be children."
"AvonleaJunkie","9","1","4","23 August 2006"," Awesome movie
","As soon as I watched the preview for this movie I knew that it would be a good one to go and see. All of the actors do a stunningly good job but I have to say that Greg Kinnear really stood out to me. You want to trust him and hear what he has to say, regardless of how crazy he gets! One note of warning, however, is that you should give this movie a full viewing before making a judgment on it. It has a slow start and the pace can make you want to get up and shake the actors to make it all happen faster. It's very worth the wait! There are certainly darker themes explored in the plot but they never dwell on them quite long enough to truly get you depressed. There is always another comic twist right around the next turn. By the end of the movie you will most likely be laughing uncontrollably, like I was, and wanting the movie to never end. Give it a try - I bet you'll love it!"
"crazycracker205","9","1","4","22 August 2006"," A good message with hilarious qualities
","I had the opportunity to view a free screening of Little Miss Sunshine in Chicago earlier this month and the film completely blew my expectations away.<br/><br/>Ranking right up there with The Squid & The Whale and Me, You & Everyone We Know as the best ""Indy"" movies I've seen in quite some time (if you can even call a movie with Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear ""Indy), Little Miss Sunshine was enjoyable on every level. Every character in the film had an enjoyable quality about them that made you feel so many different things for them at the same time. The character who's performance stood out the most was Paul Dano's. He was a voluntary mute who seemed to hate the world and his family, yet early in the film you could see him act differently towards his sister Olive, he was still the big brother who wanted to protect her from getting hurt, despite the fact that he still had to give off his macho persona. His character was strengthened when he found out that he was color-blind, and couldn't become a pilot (the exact reason he took a vow of silence). His macho attitude took a backseat to his pain and he became much normal from the public's perception.<br/><br/>The overall message for the film is one that can be dangerously clich√© and the fact that the filmmaker pulled it off without it seeming clich√© makes it that much more impressive. Even after all of the treacherous events that the family encounters throughout their trip (grandpa's death, dad's deal falling through, color-blindness, etc), the family still finds peace through the central figure in the story, Olive. As all these incredibly humorous events take place, Olive is the one person who stays positive throughout, and even though she doesn't match up with the other girls in the pageant (incredibly over-emphasized, and rightfully so), all the family cares about in the end is that Olive is happy, and throughout all the turmoil they experience, they find solace in that.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is an incredible American Comedy that, despite it's small production and limited release, should garner Academy Award Nominations. If for nothing else, Best Original Screenplay. I recommend it to anyone."
"ruby_fff","8","1","4","22 August 2006"," Enjoyable and endearing, full of life's natural contradictions that strengthen a family bond
","This is a gem, without a doubt. One would hardly think a story about a dysfunctional family on a road trip in a rather shabby VW bus can be 'heart-warmingly' touching, down to earth satisfying and hilariously endearing. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is perceptively scripted by Michael Arndt, full of everyday flawed characters. What an ensemble cast: gifted Greg Kinnear as Dad the winning failure, ever-capable Toni Collette as Mom the pillar collected, underrated Steve Carell as uncle Frank the improbable mentor, with veteran Alan Arkin as grandpa the unpredictable, talented Paul Dano as teen brother in angst, and the star focus of little Abigail Breslin as Olive - a ball of energy determined (destined) to enter the Little Miss Sunshine 'beauty pageant.' <br/><br/>Featured debut partnered direction from husband & wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a successful and worthwhile endeavor. Certainly helps to have strong producers that have faith in a rather non-Hollywood, unpopular and bold subject. A sleeper, all in all. Some of the language/ideas in passing may not be for everyone, but it's all uttered/delivered rather naturally.<br/><br/>The music soundtrack enhances most appropriately. The choices made by directors Dayton & Faris (who are well-versed in music video productions) made the film the more engaging, with score by Mychael Danna, 'backing' the music/songs by the band DeVotchka. The dynamics radiate and we, the audience, catch on to the evolving situations and take things as they come just like the Hoovers on screen. I pride myself for being able to guess at the moves/next steps they'd take: at the hospital with grandpa, how Olive interacts with brother Dwayne by the roadside, or on stage with Olive, so I applaud.<br/><br/>It was wonderful reading the production notes about how the film came to be - a dedicated force gathered: from writer, to producers to selecting director(s) to casting and production team of photography, set design, costume, editing, and music.<br/><br/>If you're willing to take a chance to go on this road trip with the Hoover Family ensemble of characters not unlike life's little encounters and happenstance, you will be satisfied and have an enjoyable time - hilarious and heartening at best."
"Halfwaytoheaven","8","1","4","22 August 2006"," A charming, if predictable, indie experience
","It's the elephant in the room that no one ever talks about: the little girl with the dreams of beauty pageant glory has a snowball's chance of winning. She's cute in her own way, sure, but hardly up to the standards of appearance expected in those contests that have done so much to creep us all out over the years. Actually, this movie couldn't have come out at a better (or is it worse?) time; the recent return to prominence of the JonBenet Ramsey case makes the overly-made-up hopefuls all the creepier. They sort of look like the munchkins in ""Wizard of Oz,"" only they don't have candy, or a coroner, and they don't seem to be in on the joke.<br/><br/>The other characters are pretty much off the shelf: the melancholy teen who hates EVERYONE; the contented, if ribald, grandfather who we can all guess won't be around for the closing credits; the suicidal intellectual; the beleaguered homemaker. Toni Collette plays the part well, keeping her hopes up without being unrealistic in her expectations, but there aren't a lot of notes for her to hit that we haven't heard before. Paul Dano's character has given up speaking, but from the moment we meet him its a pretty fair bet that he'll give up that promise by the end, and we can generally guess how it's going to happen. Greg Kinnear's failure of a motivational speaker is perhaps the most predictable of the lot, as he begins by belittling and offending everyone he encounters, and finally comes around to...well, he comes around to something, I suppose. Too bad grandpa wasn't around for it.<br/><br/>Still, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" manages to go to a lot of unexpected places, and its sense of comic timing is spot-on. Witness: the broken car horn that manages to go off at the perfect moment, or the stash of pornography that gives just the wrong impression not once, but twice. There are a lot of good laughs here: honestly, it's pretty hard to take those dolled-up tykes in the climactic pageant seriously. Some of grandpa's humor is pretty forced, but this little film has a lot of smarts, and a lot of heart."

Like others, I found myself laughing out loud in places¬ósomething I might do at home, but seldom do in the movie theater. OK, so this was the quintessential dysfunctional family, but nothing about them or the humor seemed really forced. As for Abigail Breslin¬óWatch out, Dakota! Loved it!"
"Lmiklowitz","Null","1","4","20 August 2006"," Shows the edgy and sweet side of family life
","The first third of the film is very difficult to watch. The Hoover family is a Norman Rockwell tableau from Bizarro-land. Each member of the family in Albuquerque, NM, is wildly idiosyncratic. There is fun in the dysfunction with a lot of black humor.<br/><br/>The father is the creator of a ""Nine-Point Plan"" for success where there are only winners and losers. He's waiting manically for a call from an agent at a convention in Scottdale who is pitching the plan.<br/><br/>His father is a sex-obsessed, heroin-snorting senior who seems to say whatever comes to mind.<br/><br/>Their teenage son refuses to speak, but says much in short, heavy-handed writing like ""I hate everyone"" and ""Welcome to hell."" He has his nose in Nietchze's ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" for most of the movie.<br/><br/>The mother's brother is an unemployed Proust scholar with bandages on his wrists from a recent suicide attempt after being spurned by a male graduate student who hooked up with a rival. Steve Carell is outstanding.<br/><br/>The mother is an enabler who pretends everything is okay and tries to keep the family functioning. <br/><br/>The only light comes from the unsinkable bespectacled,precocious daughter whose optimism and love doesn't quit. She brings out the best in her cynical grandfather and everyone else. Abagail Breslin, a newcomer, gives a memorable performance.<br/><br/>Somehow Olive manages to come in as first runner-up in a girls' beauty contest while visiting her mother's sister. She's been spending a lot of time with Grandpa working on a new number for a future contest. Then the fateful call comes: the first-place winner has been disqualified, and Olive is being invited to compete in the finals in Redondo Beach, CA. After weighing the options, the parents decide that the only way they are going to go there is to drive. Dad's old yellow VW bus (without head rests or seat belts) is pressed into service on I-10 for the 700-mile trip. Despite their own personal agendas, they are devoted to Olive and her dream.<br/><br/>The trip is also a voyage into the psyche of each of them. The brother and the father are thrown into despair, but Olive in her unassuming way helps them hold on with her innocent love.<br/><br/>They make it five minutes late to the pageant. After falling on his knees, the father manages to get the ice-queen director to let the daughter register. The story builds to a climax in this world of preternatural sex kittens. The brother and uncle beg the mother to keep Olive from competing, but the decision falls to Olive.<br/><br/>In the end, it is love and loyalty that redeems this family. They committed to be part of this yellow VW Noah's Ark out of devotion to Olive. By the end of the first leg of the trip, they have been transformed. The return trip should be at lot more peaceful.<br/><br/>There are some real shortcomings in the premises that take a lot of suspension of belief. As a former VW bus owner, I know the mechanical details are not plausible. The VW bus' transmission fails, so the father is advised to get the bus rolling up to 20 mph so he can shift into 3rd gear. There are many laughs as the family members run and push and then jump into the side opening, but clearly the van is not moving faster than 5 mph. Then the script departs from verisimilitude when the father has to deal with a funeral home in California that is nothing close to reality. It couldn't have happened in one afternoon to make a report, get clearance of the medical examiner, and complete a cremation and have the ashes returned. I'm not carping, tho, the depth of human interactions makes up for these shortcomings."
"EUyeshima","8","1","4","6 August 2006"," A Bumpy Ride for the Hoovers Makes for a Thorough Enjoyable Character-Driven Comedy
","Road movies are a particular weakness for me, and this out-of-left-field 2006 movie is no exception. It's a charmer written by first-time screenwriter Michael Arndt about a dysfunctional family that you end up liking in spite of how they often act. Co-directed by the husband and wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, this uproarious comedy obviously benefits from both perspectives in balancing the satirical elements with the subtleties of the character arcs in the Hoover family as we follow them in their dilapidated Volkswagen van.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around seven-year old Olive, who finds out that she is a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant to be held in Redondo Beach, California in two days. Her father Richard is a motivational speaker who wants the world to think he is the next Tony Robbins. Her grandfather has been thrown out of his retirement home for shouting expletives and snorting heroin. Her brother Dwayne reads Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until he gets accepted for flight training into the Air Force Academy. Her Uncle Frank, a gay academic expert at Proust, has just been released from a hospital after trying to commit suicide over his lover's abandonment. Her no-nonsense mother Sheryl tries to hold the family together through sheer will but often finds herself lost under the strained circumstances.<br/><br/>Eerie visions of JonBenet Ramsey will come back to you when you see the pageant climax itself but not before the actors inject a great deal of humanity into their performances. Reunited after playing a divorcing couple in 2001's ""Dinner with Friends"", Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette show their expertise in portraying a marriage in trouble. With a wariness corrupting his usual preppy veneer, Kinnear brings out the nasty edge of a resentful man unable to fulfill his ambitions. Collette continues to impress with her unique combination of sharp intelligence and visceral emotionalism. As Frank, Steve Carell shows a surprising ability for gravitas that his Frat Pack cronies have not yet exhibited. Veteran actor Alan Arkin is a welcome presence as Grandpa, and looking appropriately Goth-like, Paul Dano is hilariously dead-eyed as Dwayne.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin is an unaffected joy as Olive, and she makes the most of the talent competition in the film's most winning moments. There are also memorable bits from Paula Newsome as a curt grief counselor; Beth Grant as a snippy, bouffant-headed pageant official; and Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe from ""24"") showing her trademark perturbed look as a contest assistant. There are some contrived moments, for example, the chance encounter between Frank and his lover in the convenience store or the free-wheeling freeway exit contortions, when reality is sacrificed for dramatic effect. On the whole, however, this idiosyncratic road movie is well worth the ride share."

","The reviews I found at the time I saw this movie (today - weekend of first release) were mostly very positive and there were a small number very negative, and I went into it expecting a lot - assuming it's one of those pictures you either identify with and love, or just don't understand what the big deal is (like with Napoleon Dynamite for me, a movie I wanted to like and just can't - sorry fans; but I loved Donnie Darko and notice some parallels in the ""you control your own destiny"" sense).<br/><br/>My end impression is that I loved this movie - not every single moment - but I did genuinely laugh out loud more times than I can remember for a recent film. I've read a couple of reviews at this point claiming it is dark and cynical over being a comedy, and yeah, maybe you could interpret it that way but I don't think that's the point of the film at all - quite the opposite. <br/><br/>There are people out there claiming it's just an updated version of ""National Lampoon's Vacation"". As a great fan of that movie I disagree - yes there are similar plot mechanisms, but Little Miss Sunshine delivers a similar message (life is short and have fun and revel without shame in who you are) in a fresh, modern way.<br/><br/>This film is not for those looking for quick cheap laughs and nothing else - I saw Talladega Nights last night enjoyed it, I'm no stickler, -but it's one of the best in a long while that makes you laugh and want to examine your own life.<br/><br/>Arlington, VA"

Abigail Breslan is just a treasure as Olive Hunter, beauty pageant contestant. She is shaping up to be the actress of her time.

Every ten minutes, it's shots of a van driving on a highway - now they do happen to stop for eating, buy drinks, sleep over at a motel. That's not a movie.

"MovieEnthusiast13","6","1","5","4 August 2010"," Works as a drama, but a disappointing comedy
","Little Miss Sunshine works well as a drama, but the comedy doesn't appear until the very end of the movie. I had expected Little Miss Sunshine to be more of a comedy and its disappoints if laughs are what your looking for, but it is a good drama with great acting.<br/><br/>This movie is about a slightly dysfunctional family from Albuquerque. The children's uncle just tried to commit suicide, the grandfather was kicked out of his retirement community for heroin use and the father is spending all of his time trying to sell his idea for a book (which is not going well). The main story is about the little girl in the family, Olive (Abigail Breslin). Her dream is to be in a beauty pageant. Within the first few scenes we find out that Olive has been accepted into the 'Little Miss Sunshine' beauty pageant for children. The rest of the movie depicts the entire family traveling from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach in an old yellow VW for the pageant.<br/><br/>The comedy in Little Miss Sunshine is subtle but there is some, particularly in the last few scenes. Throughout the entire film there are lines which are funny, funny enough for a chuckle, but not a head-rolling howl. For example, the grandfather preaches to the son about how important women are, and that he should have lots of sex in his life. When the father says 'hey', the grandfather replies something about him still having Nazi bullets in his skull. Most of the other jokes are darker, but can be funny if you're in the right mood for it.<br/><br/>The acting is perhaps the best part of Little Miss Sunshine. The father (Greg Kinnear) is an annoying character, but the acting is still good. Olive is cute and Abigail Breslin is perfect for the role of the innocent little girl. The brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is strange as he doesn't speak for most of the movie, but once he opens his mouth his scenes are quite powerful. The mother Sheryl (Toni Collette) is good, so is Steve Carrel as Uncle Frank. However, the best performance is arguably that of Alan Arkin as Grandpa, his performance his funny and full of satire. Arkin now has the Oscar trophy to prove that he did a great job on this film.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a dark comedy with a happy ending. The great acting is very believable and the cast has great chemistry. The story itself is pretty good and the script was well written. If you feel like a dramatic movie with the occasional laugh, you know, Sundance Film Festival kind of movies, then I would recommend Little Miss Sunshine. If you prefer comedies like The Hangover, then you probably wouldn't like this film."

","I was not sure what to expect of this movie. My wife has this sick obsession to watch ALL the movies that win Academy awards. This movie won 2.

I know Alan Arkin pretty much won the Academy award due to his fantastic ability to deliver the F word. Most notable was his phrase ""What's that, chicken? Every night it's the f**ing chicken! Holy God Almighty! Is it possible just once we could get something to eat for dinner around here that's not the god**med f**ing chicken?!"" <br/><br/>For some strange reasons fans of this movie like to say that it was unpredictable.

You knew that the brother would eventually start talking. The only surprise was Alan Arkin dying...which is too bad he was the ONLY entertainment in the movie.<br/><br/>I do predict that Abagail Breslin will become a impressive actress. But I base it mainly on her ability to take on serious roles and roles surrounded by other serious roles.

","Its rare that you come across a film as genuine and outstanding as Little Miss Sunshine. It is so simple, yet so effective. The plot and dialogue are also original and fantastic, but it is the characters that make this film unmissable.<br/><br/>The Hoover's are a slightly dysfunctional middle-class family from Albuquerque. The father Richard (Greg Kinnear) is the wannabe motivational speaker attempting to make it big. Toni Collette is the family 'glue' as always holding it all together as the mother, Sheryl. Steve Carell is Uncle Frank, the failed gay academic who recently attempted suicide. Alan Arkin, brilliant as the foul-mouthed, promiscuous, drug-using Grandfather. Paul Dano also fantastic as the silent and reclusive 15-year old son, Dwayne.<br/><br/>And then there is Olive (Abigail Breslin), whose performance I will speak of in more depth. Olive is chosen as a contestant in the beauty pageant 'Little Miss Sunshine' to be held in California. And so, these six very different character set off on a wacky road-trip, filled with laughter and tragedy.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin is simply mesmerizing, as the refreshingly innocent, naive and cheerful Olive. Certainly it would have to go down as one of the best performances by a child actress (aged 10) in film history. For that matter, every character is just superb. Good acting unquestionably, but the development of the characters themselves. Whilst initially they all appear (and are) flawed in their own ways. By the end of the film we have seen the best of all of them, and they have seen the best of each-other. And that's what makes this film so uplifting - we have this family, on the rocks and whose resolve is being seriously challenged by constant difficulties occurring on the trip. And yet these challenges bring out the best of them and bring them closer as a family. And Olive, the central character unites them in the climax of the film at the beauty pageant, which is one of the most hilarious and brilliant scenes I've seen in cinema! The dialogue is sharp and delivered impeccably. What is so great about this film is there is so many things to take away from it also - to embrace your suffering being the most memorable theme I took out of this and so many more. You will walk away from this film with a great satisfaction, a smile on your face and with a few issues to think about. What more can you ask for? The near (if not) perfect cinematic experience. <br/><br/>YEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH!! ALRIIIIIGHT!!!!!!!"

","Although Browning's ""Freaks"" is suggested (""That makes One of Us...""), this more closely follows ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" (cantankerous, plain-spoken grandpa drops dead on the road; the etiquette of proper handling is ignored because the goal's so near).<br/><br/>For this to matter, it needed to be ruthless...that didn't happen. There's no hint of blackness to the comedy, and therefore, no edge. The friction between the members of the freak family sometimes grates, but always leads to Hallmark-card amelioration. That's TV sitcom sentiment, not the sort of stuff for cinephiles to hang our hats on...and they suggest Proust and Nietzsche!<br/><br/>As for the final 'performance' within the performance, I'd hoped for a ""Napoleon Dynamite""-styled delivery of a come-uppance...but that didn't happen either. The entire movie was spent building up the tension that the little girl will beat the beauty pageant 'freaks' at their own game...instead it goes for the feel-good twaddle of a 'just be yourself' message."

","Abigail Breslin shines as an actress in this flick, displaying an ability far above most other child actors who play a quick role, who make one cute scene, or woo the audiences sentimental side. Although she can do all these (and does during the movie), she also proves she can actually act and create a coherent character, which is more than commendable for a child actor, or any actor for that matter. But this film is much more than one actress. It is an ensemble film, like Altman's, where each character is treated completely, with faults, but with dignity. Perhaps Greg Kinnear's character is the weakest link, but even he comes through in the end to create a heartwarming story of loyalty and family. The end can be a little hokey, but what movie that ends on a good note can't be described as a little hokey. The message, however, is anything but... it gives credit to those who try and win, try and fail, try and fail worse, and try and absolutely fail, but in that failure, they change those who support them, and perhaps that's the greatest gift. A pretty movie, with a bus like a bee, but in the end a little too cute to be anything great. A good watch, but don't expect greatness."

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a surprising and thoughtful take on the dysfunctional family picture - with elements of a road comedy and a pageant spoof thrown in. While the script is never quite as tight or witty as you want it to be, there are a few unexpected surprises in store. To weather the few dry spots there's a terrific cast. They never fail to bring empathy and humanity to the desperate characters. The direction and design are considered, but never overtly so (watch for the skillful use of sunshine yellows). This film put me in mind of Beth Henley's ""Miss Firecracker"" (a Holly Hunter vehicle) in which a group of sad and lonely Southerners find an emotional connection by helping a misfit girl through a small-time beauty contest. Both 'Misses' are testament to the human spirit and the strength of individuality."

","Little Miss Sunshine is not a film about winners. Everyone in the movie is a failure in some fashion. And without giving anything away, I can tell you that you're not going to get a Hollywood ending. Ultimately the family goes through a lot and learns a lot, but the road to getting there left me shaken. It reminded me of the film Breakdown which is so frenetic and panicky that I had the jitters all day even though Breakdown ends on a happy note.<br/><br/>This is not a good film to see if you need a laugh. Maybe some people will find it uplifting but I did not. It's a dark comedy, a little too dark for me. Dark comedy is rarely laugh-out-loud funny, the kind of comedy I prefer.<br/><br/>Despite that, the acting is superb, and I like the van that's busted but works with a little sweat as a metaphor for the family as a whole. The ending was classic and entirely unexpected, and managed to be wild and yet make sense to the characters as well. There is ultimately two messages about winners and losers, one being the beauty show (a good one) and the other being from Proust (which I didn't buy).<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- People who like dramas, just the adults. This film is R-rated, it is not a children's film. But not if you're expecting laugh-out-loud funny or need an uplifting film to calm your day.<br/><br/>-- Inspirational speakers with a 9-point program for personal improvement I toyed around with an 8 out of 10, but I'm going to have to give Little Miss Sunshine a 9 out of 10. I wanted a happier ending but admittedly it would have been out of place within the dark comedy theme."

"manuel-pestalozzi","3","1","6","10 December 2007"," The Grapes of Egotism
","This movie brings a few really funny moments to the screen. It lingers on in my memory and planted there a seed of irritation that is growing.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine seems to be loosely inspired by John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and John Ford's filmic treatment of that novel. A family of colorful, desperate characters move west to California in an unreliable car and have various experiences en route and once they get there. It is not sheer poverty that lies behind the daring trip. I mean, yes, the folks are poor in a way but not outright desperate for a crumb of bread. There's no doubt that life will go on somehow (they still sleep in comfortable motel rooms). The motive for everything that happens here is, as I see it, self fulfillment. Yes, that's very important, too, but it lacks urgency (for outsiders, at least). The movie takes us on a trip to a realm where the motto is: take it or leave it. A man made dreamland where commitments are lighter than air and consequences heavier to digest than a ton of cheese.<br/><br/>Everybody has dreams. Why many think that making dreams a reality should be at the center of man's activities, is beyond me. So maybe my irritation stems from a lack of comprehension. At the center of this movie is a little girl. She wants to win a beauty pageant. She is on a kind of a short list for the finals and she can count on the support of her family. Anyway, they decide to accompany her to the pageant. Now, considering the wish to participate and the support, one might assume that the family is well acquainted with the pageant routine and basically accepts those conventions.<br/><br/>As it turns out, the girl was secretly coached by her grand dad, a guy who habitually consumes illegal drugs and has a bad and primitive vocabulary (believe me, there's nothing original or funny about it, it's just plain vulgar and nasty). She presents a strip-tease at the pageant, and even her folks seem to be surprised at that ¬ñ which surprised me as a viewer in turn. Her performance and her dress cause a scandal, and in fact they appear to be mainly a protest against that kind of pageant. There are a great many reasons to be against it, but here it looks like the little girl was the instrument of an elaborate hoax concocted by her grand dad. Apparently she has no idea that what she does is inappropriate and will cause a stir. As I said, maybe I did not understand that angle correctly, but I found it abusive, cruel and reproachful. In no way does the movie make a comment on that aspect and somehow I resent that."

","If I was a member of the Academy and I had to pick Best Picture of the previous year with the choices between Martin Scorsese's The Departed and Little Miss Sunshine, I'd definitely pick the latter. This dysfunctional family road comedy-drama (or dramady) has some of the most realistic-funny dialogue I've watched from recent times. And the performances are all great from Greg Kinnear to Toni Collette to Steve Carell to Oscar nominated Abigail Breslin (what a cute girl!) and, especially, Oscar winner Alan Arkin as the heroin taking grandpa who loves his grandchild and is so hilarious with his salty take on life! Also loved Wallace Langham as the guy who played the music picked by the grandpa (and didn't turn it off when some people got upset) and, nice surprise here, Chloe O'Brien herself, Mary Lynn Rajskub as the lady who accompanies Olive (Abigail's character) to the stage. One of the best independently made movies I've seen in a while!"

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2006), was directed by the husband-and-wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. It's a road film--the extended Hoover family (mother, father, daughter, son, grandfather, mother's brother) travel from New Mexico to California in a battered van.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin plays the daughter, Olive Hoover, who is the only stable family member. Her brother has elective mutism, and communicates only by writing. Her uncle has just attempted suicide. Her grandfather (Alan Arkin) is snorting something--I think morphine. Her father (Greg Kinnear) apparently believes the motivational garbage he preaches, and her mother (the excellent Toni Collette) is trying to cope with marital, financial, and family stresses.<br/><br/>The movie is hilarious while you're watching it, because the filmmakers set up an enclosed universe in which everything fits together in its own bizarre way. Just don't think too much about the movie afterward, because, when examined logically, everything falls apart. The movie ""Memento"" was a film where people got home, took out a piece of paper, and tried to diagram the action. Not a good idea for this film. Accept ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for what it is--if you try to analyze it, it won't be funny anymore."
"evanston_dad","10","1","6","18 September 2006"," A Movie That Will Make You Proud to Be Ordinary
","Much of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" shouldn't work, yet almost all of it does.<br/><br/>One of the best ensemble casts in recent memory delivers this outrageous material with a tremendous amount of heart and conviction and, as a result, a screenplay that threatens to stretch the bounds of credibility comes across as believable and achingly poignant. The characters are given such strong motivations for their actions that everything they do and say feels utterly plausible, even when the film itself threatens to teeter into Faulknerian Southern Gothic crossed with National Lampoon's ""Vacation."" The writers, director and cast stubbornly refuse to allow us any tidy character assessments. Therefore, we see the brittle and harsh side of Toni Collette's otherwise loving mom; the warm, charming and please-like-me vulnerability of Greg Kinnear's otherwise smarmy and nearly intolerable dad; the intellectual pompousness and snobbery that peeks its head through Steve Carell's otherwise emotionally wounded suicide case; and the affectionate patriarch lurking behind the otherwise gruff and offensive exterior of Alan Arkin's grandfather, whose greatest crime may be that he's too honest.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" hands over this motley cast of characters and lets us glory in their imperfections, and through doing so helps us feel better about our own. As the movie points out, perfection isn't possible, and the aggressive pressure in American culture to achieve it is only making people miserable about failing at something they never had a chance of succeeding at in the first place. The movie is so warm hearted though, that its ultimate lesson isn't a downer. At the end, this close-knit family realizes that they're proud to be ordinary, and dammit, so am I.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

"squaradox","7","1","7","26 December 2006"," ""Comedy"" is almost misleading
","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is thoroughly enjoyable. Of the greatest importance: this movie is not a ""family comedy,"" but the -other- kind of ""comedy."" If you've seen Duncan Tucker's ""Transamerica,"" for example, you will be familiar with the feel of ""Little Miss Sunshine."" It's more interested in making you cry than laugh. When humor emerges, it is dark and tinged with other emotions. And like ""Transamerica,"" ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is both involving and satirical as a portrayal of how modern Americans relate to one another.<br/><br/>The screen writing is mostly good. From the very first scenes, I was drawn in by the quirky yet identifiable characters. Even more importantly, the main cast tackled these roles with verve and honesty. Olive (played by the remarkable Abigail Breslin) is a believable child with actual feelings, quite rare in comedies (and movies in general, really). And it turns out Steve Carell -can- take on a role demanding subtlety.<br/><br/>""Little Miss Sunshine"" works best when it's not taking itself too seriously, keeping me engaged with the subtleties of the characters, their relationships, and the pacing of the story. The film has its misses where it overreaches. There are a couple serious scenes that are too slow -- slow enough that I was allowed to become aware of how thin and fairly unimaginative the plot really is. After all, the storyline is based around a road trip that brings together its participants; that's not exactly re-inventing the wheel. On the other hand, I can't tell you how refreshing it is to finally see a road trip comedy that -doesn't- retread all the tired conventions of the movie style. Yes, there is car trouble, but it's not employed as an overwrought plot device, and the family doesn't end up walking in the rain and falling in mud. Yes, they argue en route, but cutesy ""Mom, he's touching me!"" moments are mercifully absent. By balancing lightness and honesty throughout, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" ends up more bearable than 75% of the ""comedies"" that get churned out today, Hollywood or independent. Check it out -- just don't expect to laugh too much."
"moutonbear25","8","1","7","14 August 2006"," Sunshine and Rain
","LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is this year's Sundance breakout and nearly all the press its received thus far has lauded it as, well, a little ray of sunshine to carry audiences through the last month of summer. It is the independent underdog that will tickle your funny bone, stimulate your mind and warm your heart. This little movie has so much to live up to and it has barely even gone wide at the moment I am writing this. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE isn't generating its own buzz; it's having its buzz generated by the machine that wants so badly for it to be that movie it could. Y'know which one I'm talking about. The smaller, simpler movie that allows a more mature audience to wind down their summer, to let the ringing in their ears from all the explosive blockbusters subside. What the machine doesn't understand is that the movie that fills that particular void is not manufactured. It is genuine and it earns that honour all by itself. <br/><br/>This honour is not one I feel LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE would have earned if it weren't manufactured for it. Albeit an endearing film with authentic moments of hilarity and sentiment, it is often disconnected and unresolved. The dual director team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris create a believable family unit by giving each member their own personal touch. Dad is a failed motivational speaker; Mom has to deal with loser dad; Grandpa has a heroine problem; older brother has taken a vow of silence until he becomes a fighter pilot; and gay uncle Frank is fresh out of the hospital after trying to kill himself. Dealing themselves such a diverse hand of characters leaves many opportunities to cross the line between quirky and just plain awkward, which they do more often then they should. Then of course there's Little Miss Sunshine wannabe herself, Olive. With an earnest enthusiasm and innocence beaming from her face (like a ray of ¬Ö sorry), untouched and uncorrupted Olive reminds the family that they are in fact a family. It's a lovely story but it is one that only takes shape in the final moments of the film. Prior to that, each character's individual problems guide all of their own motivations and they only barely have any depth past these problems. Shifting each characters' focus outwards gives the film some much needed structure but it leaves many an issue either unresolved or resolved far too quickly. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE reigns as the true heart of this organism. Cramped together in their yellow mini-bus, many different personalities fester. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are the heads of the family. Collette is merely a device to highlight the failures of her husband through her aggravation with him. Kinnear's role however is hefty and he stridently carries that weight as an emasculated patriarch who preaches his failed life lessons to his daughter because she is the only one still buying them. Like another successful family piece, Noah Baumbach's THE SQUID AND THE WHALE, the influence of the parents on the children manifests before your eyes in a difficult and painful fashion. Steve Carrell plays suicidal uncle, Frank, like a seemingly dormant volcano that may or may not erupt. You just can't tell. His mystery is heartening and shows promise for his developing capabilities.<br/><br/>As a critic, shedding expectations is a higher state of being I try to achieve before I watch anything. I don't read other reviews before I see the movie or even before I sit down to write my own, all as an effort to keep it real (dawg). It only takes a quick glance at a magazine cover to get whether people are hating, liking or really loving a movie so it is hard to avoid entirely. But as much as I try to approach each film with a fresh piece of paper to write on, buzz manages to influence the way we see things. When I'm told that something is really solid and it isn't, even just a little, my disappointment is magnified. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has so many things going for it that what it is lacking makes it all the more frustrating because you really want it to live up to the hype."
"Bologna King","7","1","8","17 January 2007"," Who's to Judge?
","There are two plots going on in this film. The first is like the movie Clockwise or a bad dream which you have probably had in which you have a deadline to meet in some other place but every possible obstacle seems to prevent you from getting there. Part of the dynamic is that at every stage the protagonists are faced with the choice: do I keep trying to get there or do I give up now. Every time you choose to keep trying the stakes are raised, so that eventually the incentive to quit, no matter how strong, cannot outweigh the investment made in carrying on. ""We've come this far; we can't quit now"" trumps every objection, even those based in breaking the law or standards of propriety.<br/><br/>Once the Hoovers reach their destination, a new plot situation takes over. Now we are at the competition where our hero (or in this case our heroine Olive)is the underdog facing overwhelming competition. Ah, we've seen this situation before, haven't we? Rocky, Cool Runnings, The Mighty Ducks, Seabiscuit, Sister Act II? <br/><br/>The thing is that while the road part of the plot was going on the assumptions which support the competition plot have been steadily undermined. At the start the father Richard represents the hackneyed standard American attitude to winning and losing: life is about winning and losing and if you're a loser you have only yourself to blame. Again we see this in Frank's suicide attempt because he might not be the number one Proust man in America. We see it also in Dwayne's love of Nietzsche (the philosopher who said that winners have the moral high ground) and his determination to cause himself pain in order to get into flight school. Richard supports Dwayne, but it doesn't take long for us to start to really dislike Richard and what he stands for. Our dislike for Richard makes us like the grandfather more (more than we probably should, as we ultimately realize) because his character is so strongly contrasted with Richard's.<br/><br/>By the time they get to the beauty contest Richard's philosophy has been beaten to bits. Both Dwayne and Frank have come to the fore as spokesmen for a new philosophy which we hear in the line, delivered to try to persuade Sheryl to pull Olive from the contest, ""I don't want THEM judging her."" There is no reason to submit yourself to the judgment of others, especially as their qualifications to judge may be dubious. In the face of the new philosophy, we are not rooting for a clich√© ending.<br/><br/>Clearly, this film is not a typical comedy; indeed, I would recommend that people go into it not expecting any humour at all. People who are painfully struggling with the fundamental principles of their lives are not all that funny. The characters are dealt with more thoroughly, the themes considered more fully, than we usually get in comedies. The solid acting throughout keeps the viewer interested in the people, especially the heroes Frank, Dwayne and Olive. I don't think that it should be ranked as one of the top 250 films of all time, but then isn't the IMDb top 250 just another beauty pageant? Does it matter whether this is number 251? Not really. I think the film tells its story and makes its point which is all that should matter. Check it out."

","I don't know what it is about Little Miss Sunshine that makes it so appealing to so many people. I was first introduced to the movie while on a flight during the holidays. I didn't watch the movie at that time but I don't know if it was the movie or the alcohol served on the plane but there were so many people laughing throughout the entire movie. I thought to myself this must be a really funny movie so I thought I would like to see it down the road. Well low and behold on the flight back from my little holiday trip the movie was on again, so of course this time I did watch it and I was a little disappointed. I thought the movie was cute but I wasn't laughing nearly as much as everyone else on the other flight. To me the movie took on some challenging story lines and I applaud the writers for their script. At times the movie moved a little slow for me and I needed to have a little more development of the family together. I didn't know how long they had been married, what happened to the kids Dad. I don't want to give away spoilers but what I will say is if you like really dry humor you will probably like this film. There are certainly some laugh out loud funny moments but not nearly as many as I was anticipating after listening to the passengers on my flight laugh all throughout the flight."

","I really wanted to like this movie better than I did. I'm drawn to odd, quirky, iconoclastic, low-budget movies, especially ones with an edge of meanness (e.g., Alexander Payne's Election). LMS started off great, with a collection of characters that, while more than a little contrived, were interesting and deliberately challenging. But as the movie went on, the writer's and directors' desire for forced quirkiness and audience reaction overcame any sort of logic of consistency. SPOILER HERE And you know the film-makers aren't on top of things when they kill off the funniest character halfway through. One of the most telling moments comes at the very end, when the family---reconciled to each other in most unbelievable ways---drives eastward back home into the setting sun. If the film-makers will cheat on the makeup of the solar system, they'll certainly cheat on true human emotions and reactions."

","I'd love to know if I am the only one who thinks that this was an almost great movie spoiled by a weird flirtation with pedophilia. Right up until Olive took the stage to do her 7-year old strip tease complete with tear-away clothes and hyper-sexual gestures and expressions, this was a witty, insightful film. For me, the sight of a seven year old imitating the gestures and expressions of rough sex taught her by her coked out grandfather spoiled this otherwise delightful film. Maybe it was meant to be satire but it came much too close to the real thing for my taste. Were we supposed to be amused when the child molester in the audience got up to cheer Olive on? Sorry, folks. This was an almost made it witty movie that, like play it forward, was ruined by a needlessly fatuous ending. Too bad."
"GradysGhost","6","1","9","22 December 2006"," Been there, done that...
","Okay, so I guess I'm the only person on the planet who didn't think this movie was anything special. Don't get me wrong. It was funny, a little dark, and paced well (almost). My big problem with this movie is the fact that I didn't care at all about any of the characters.<br/><br/>When Grampa died, I didn't care. I didn't cry, I didn't laugh, didn't feel one iota out of the ordinary. And it didn't seem like the other characters did, either. His death comes out feeling like another bump in the road. Rather than dealing with it, they decide that Grampa is only holding them back and Linda, the bereavement lady, won't let them just dump the body on the hospital. The family didn't grieve over Grampa's death except for about thirty seconds! For Christ's sake, the character doesn't even have a name! He's either Grampa or Dad. How impersonal can you get? Furthermore, there is only one dynamic character here: Dwayne. Paul Dano's character is the only one I even felt remotely sympathetic for. That may only be because he was given a better role here than in other films he's been in (The Emperor's Club, The Girl Next Door). The change he makes is rather dramatic and is an example of fine acting.<br/><br/>I'm also getting very tired of the idea of a ""road movie."" The ""road as a journey"" metaphor only works so many times, and it only really works when the characters are actually changed by the challenges they face. It's losing its metaphor status and quickly taking the plunge into Clicheland. It works well in Stand By Me (in which friendships are strengthened and manhood is achieved by the time the destination is reached), decently in National Lampoon's Vacation (over the length of which the family's bond is first weakened and then finally realized), and not much at all in Little Miss Sunshine (where the destination is reached after several tribulations and still, nothing has changed).<br/><br/>I appreciate the comedy, our laughter at how pathetic the characters all are (and thereby how pathetic we are). I think the film is well-shot with truckloads of unbalanced shots which throw us deeper into the chaos of this dysfunctional family. All-in-all, it's decent entertainment. I just don't think there's much here to be said that hasn't been said before and better."
"come2whereimfrom","7","1","9","12 September 2006"," Little Miss Plagiarism, but still OK.
","Firstly it is an amazing film, I think my mum would love it, but for me it just reminded me of the pain of growing up and how dysfunctional families can be. Telling the story of olive who so badly wants to win the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant and the wacky road trip that her family take to get her there. The thing that I didn't like about the film was the lazy film-making stealing bits from 'National Lampoon' to 'Napoleon Dynamite' amongst others; you will see what I mean when you watch it. So they are arranged into a new story of sorts but the plagiarism is blatant, maybe someone who doesn't watch a lot of films wouldn't notice but for me personally it spoilt the viewing experience a little. The family dynamic is portrayed well with some great performances from Toni Collette as the mum trying to hold together the rabble, Steve Carell (fresh from being the American 'David Brent') as the suicidal gay teacher Frank and Greg Kinnear as the dad always trying to prove himself a success. Add to this the son who won't speak and the drug addicted granddad and you've got a right mixed bag of characters all travelling along in a knackered up VW van to California. As you can well imagine it isn't all smooth running and from the go get you can let the laughs commence thick and fast. A mixture of script based and slapstick gags it never really lets up and isn't typically preachy or moralistic for an American film, although there is a bit of the old family bonding nonsense in there, well how could there not be? Not disturbing enough to be ranked alongside a Todd Solondz movie, but just weird enough to make a fifteen certificate. If 'Sideways' was for the dads then this is definitely a film for the mums. A great little film that deserves to do well."
"rgoodden","6","1","10","21 January 2007"," Misses a little in box office shine
","The producers of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" would like you and their fellow Hollywood liberals to know, up front, of their disapproval of the Bush Administration. They've built this modestly-entertaining rehash of plot innovations found in National Lampoon's ""Summer Vacation"" and ""American Beauty"" around that important political point. Actually ... I'm exaggerating almost beyond belief, as a mind game just to imagine how it would seem to any liberal to encounter in a Hollywood movie political snideness gratuitously directed, even in a brief scene, at their own liberal pantheon of political heroes! But as we all know, that will most assuredly never happen, so it's pretty much a moot exercise. Seriously, this film would be okay as TV re-run fare if you're not paying for it and have nothing more stimulating available tonight at the local video shop. The cast professionally serves up black humor American-style, using American society's ample lampoon-able aspects. Too bad, though, about the so-so ending: it could have benefited from some extra effort on the part of writers perhaps too pleased with themselves at sneaking in the prescribed quota of partisan nastiness."
"DKosty123","5","1","11","20 January 2007"," Talented Cast- Weak Script
","The cast is very talented in this film. Every cast member makes a lot of good things happen to carry this one on screen. It is interesting that a talented cast performing very well has made this into an over-rated film. <br/><br/>As for script, it could be better. While it makes sense with the ending beauty pageant, a lot of loose ends from the beginning of the movie don't quite fit.There is a major continuity problem with the VW Bus which has to be pushed to be start after the first part of the movie. At one point later when the bus does start & leaves our little girl(Abigail Breslin) at the gas station, the van inexplicably starts & takes off without needing a push. Did the van starter suddenly work because she is being forgotten at the gas station? <br/><br/>Alan Arkin steals this film as Grandpa while he is alive. He is a center of the storyline too. He deserved the Award for this film, no doubt. Fine work from the veteran actor.<br/><br/>The cast makes the film go. The script actually borrows some material from the original ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" & uses it to get laughs & an Oscar for best ""original"" screenplay. In fact, a lot of the material in this script has been done before. This script has very little originality. Guess stealing a plot from a 1980's comedy & changing the action to a little girl's beauty pageant is now Oscar winning material? If you really think so, Finding Forester which plagiarizes script from other films out to interest you.<br/><br/>The DVD has 3 alternate endings, none of which seems very exciting or an improvement over the original ending. This is one of those hot nominated films that got Oscar recognition, but years later when you watch it again, you will wonder why? It was the most over rated film of 2006."
"ubu55","2","1","11","18 January 2007"," Interesting film, but NOT a comedy
","IMO, this is a well-made, well-acted film, but with a lingering aftertaste of sadness, not humor. <br/><br/>Nearly every main character has their life's dream shattered, usually with acute humiliation/embarrassment heaped on for good measure. That COULD have been made to be funny, but wasn't... unless your idea of fun is watching someone accidentally cut off a few fingers with a power saw. These people have way too much at stake, in desperate, edgy lives, for me to be comfortable laughing at their anguish. Played as broad farce, with characters so overblown and self-involved we could enjoy their come-uppance, it might be okay, <br/><br/>but seeing these poor devils repeatedly denied even the smallest shred of dignity, cuts a little too close to the bone. <br/><br/>One of the saddest moments is watching little Olive look at her plump, perfectly normal child's body in the dressing-room mirror... as she wonders if there's something wrong with her. Life being what it is, it's certainly not the last time she's going to do that. <br/><br/>A reviewer at Rottentomatoes calls this a two-hour version of that old Blind Melon music video (with the girl in the bee costume). Would that we could believe it were true, that she'll find happiness and acceptance, in her own uniqueness, and others to share it with. But the final dance her family joins her in is not some carefree expression of oddball joy... it's a desperate attempt to save her from humiliation, at the hands of people so deluded, they've turned their own little girls into a pedophile's walking wet dream. You have to know it's only a temporary reprieve, the world will find a way to get at her again, soon enough. <br/><br/>It bothers me a bit that foul-mouthed, porn-addicted Grandpa, is the one who chose her song and dance. Even played for laughs in the family living room, it's a queasy sort of entertainment. It turns out to be just the right note, for the pageant... but that doesn't make it any more appropriate for Olive. <br/><br/>I feel for these guys, but I don't like watching them much. They're all balanced on a knife-edge of despair. Only in trying to protect the child do they momentarily escape their own personal hells. And somehow, together, they manage to get that bus rolling down the road, one more time... <br/><br/>They have no choice, if they ever want to make it home."

","I felt angry that I liked this movie. It was clearly formulaic: from the stock characters (Foul- Mouthed but Heart-of-Gold Grampy, Long-Suffering Voice of Reason Mom, Angsty Teenage boy) who follow fairly predictable story arcs, classic situation comedy moments (verging on slapstick, as though National Lampoon kept on trying to get into your quiet dinner party) poorly justified, and the consistent ratio of feel-good sentimentality to lightly-twisted. The overall feeling is of something painfully sweet that has been calculatedly sour-coated, as opposed to something sour which has been sugarcoated. And yet the script keeps you guessing just-enough (about how they will do something, not what will happen next), and the predictable is artfully sidestepped or twisted ever-so slightly, so that one is left with very little concrete to complain about. In addition, solid performances by an above-average cast (Greg Kinnear and Alan Arkin often sell lines that in lesser hands would sound like they were written by a maudlin computer program) save the day. In a sense the whole film seemed like what you would get if you forced Wes Anderson to follow all of the rules of a beginning scriptwriting class. It is a feel-good movie packaged and seamlessly designed to be digestible to movie snobs, and, infuriatingly, it succeeds, like a sweater you really like and are ashamed to admit comes from... the Gap."

He was annoyingly funny as an unsuccessful, 9 step program motivational speaker, and he drove the family nuts by spouting his 9-steps whenever the family found itself in crunch after crunch on their trip, as he dimwittedly believed that following his 9 steps would solve any problem. Thus, he was the chosen family doofus as they travelled from New Mexico to L.A. in an quirky(typical)VW bus, where they intended to enter their daughter in a really tacky, little girl beauty contest. Those nauseating contests really do exist, believe it or not. <br/><br/>The hilarious Alan Arkin played the off-the-wall, heroin-addicted, and profane grandpa to the hilt as usual, and Tony Collette as the wife and her very odd, vow-of-silence son were good too. But Steve Carell of The Office was outstanding as the morose, suicidally gay uncle taken along on the trip so the family could keep him from killing himself over a failed job and romance. His acidly sardonic remarks were some of the film's best moments. But their 7 year-old Little Miss Sunshine contestant daughter was the real star of this movie. She was a natural and showed just the right spunk and guts for a beauty contest entrant, even though the choice of her talent act reflected more of her sex-obsessed grandpa rather than her normal little girl self.<br/><br/>Sounds really sick, but it was funny in context. I did wonder afterward why our national child protective services didn't comment about the provocative sexual content in her act as it related to a little girl, but guess they considered it ""humor"" and not serious enough to make a fuss about. But, the creepy pedophile in the contest audience was truly scary, as he could have been based on reality. Uggh. Think of JonBenet Ramsey. <br/><br/>But, aside from that, it was a very entertaining movie."
"robbmr","6","1","14","27 August 2006"," Abbreviated comments due to this late entry..Aug.27
","I've now read comments ranging from our external reviewers ;where are James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert when I want them? from July through August 26..We went to see the flick last night, after weeks of my procrastinating,due to the apparent' content. You've had prior opportunities to read summarizations of the plot,so I'll skip this.Personally, I did not laugh during most of the flick, whereas many in the audience laughed or giggled in many of the scene appropriate moments, including my partner,leaving me to wonder why I felt 'emotionally flat' with a few exceptions. I enjoyed seeing Alan Arkin's role as Grandpa, but realized later how absolutely despicable his character was, and how several ,but few critics, point out how naive or ignorant the parents were of exactly what Gramps was doing behind closed doors in their home, and with their daughter. That Gramps was addicted to profanity, sexual fantasies, and heroin seemed only an ' annoyance' to the family. That they had NO clue what dance ""routine"" he was teaching Olive, and seemingly what won her acceptance into the Sunshine contest in Redondo Beach is 'unbelievable',if not incredibly ignorant, given the source of the routine. As several pointed out, there is the obvious comparison to, or subtle reference to Jon Bonnet Ramsey, and her Mother's motivation to relive or recast her own dull life by grooming her daughter for a Beauty Contest which robs children of their innocence,and which arouses vile passions in some Karr's to exploit more than the momentary fame and fantasy. Horribly, this Satire portrays Grandpa's foisting his aged,drug induced fantasies upon the only 'innocent' character in the story, Olive, while all others, so obsessed with overcoming their own feelings of failure and inadequacy , eventually succumb to the Passion of getting Olive to Redondo, to enable her to become a winner, not losers, as they are, and ,in so doing, fulfill Gramp's dying wish, to have his Granddaughter become his real,live Fantasy Tramp; as he warns his grandson, to fornicate with every young girl he can before it's too late, seemingly the ultimate lesson he has learned from his dissolute life and the guiding principle he gives to his posterity. One might just wonder if behind 'closed doors', behind the parents' backs, he did more than teach Olive a 'trampy dance routine.' And this is the legacy he bestows on his family, which unites them in their 'humorous' efforts to rush Olive to the Sunshine of Redondo Beach, or is it to the ""Little Miss Bitches"" contest. Or, possibly the above is all 'sour grapes', since I could not exalt in the laughter of witnessing a family's descent into the despair of worshipping 'false idols'. YES, optimistically, we may foresee a brighter future for the Hoover's, if Mama, Papa, Uncle, son and daughter have learned anything from their travail-travels, and from burying a decrepit Old Addict, or will the Hoover's have to await a Roosevelt to imbue 'social responsibility' into their morally and apparently financially bankrupt lives.. My, My! Wasn't this a hoot? But go to see it anyway, and judge for yourself, exactly what is some damn funny in this tragic tale.."

","I saw this movie at a special pre-release screening at a drive-in theater with about 100 VW buses in attendance (including mine). It was a local LA radio station (KROQ) promotion.<br/><br/>I had heard the buzz about this film and watched the trailer so I had some expectations going in. While I enjoyed the story and the characters, with great performances by Alan Arkin (grandpa), Steve Carell (Frank), and little Abigail Breslin (as Olive), but I felt that a little more character development and emotion would have given the plot more punch.<br/><br/>The VW bus personality and quirks known so well to us bus owners made it fun to watch. Whenever something broke or malfunctioned the crowd at the drive-in cheered and applauded. If anything I recommend this movie to VW bus owners. For everyone else, you might want to wait for the DVD release.<br/><br/>In summary, I liked this movie but expected a bit more. Most of the funny scenes are in the trailer. Good acting, especially Alan Arkin (he needs to do more projects these days), But a soft plot and a lot of build up to an anti-climactic (weird) ending left me a little flat.<br/><br/>~Randawg."

","Little Miss Sunshine is a film directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. I had heard of this film once from my friend who would go on praising the film. Yesterday night when I had nothing to see my sister suddenly decided to see this. After the film finished, I was just flabbergasted.<br/><br/>Plot: A road trip is taken by the Hoover family from Albuquerque to Los Angeles to attend the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for their young daughter, Olive.<br/><br/>Story and direction: The film has a very simple story but yet its heart is in the right place. Although the film revolves around only 6 characters, but yet they are so varied. I felt an instant connection with all the characters. The pace of the story is good also. Never do you feel a dull moment. It's comedy which is in bits and pieces also works. Kudos to Micheal Arndt for the wonderful writing. Considering the budget in which the film was made, the result is awesome. The troubles and ways to get out of those troubles with a smile is perfectly shown in this film. The film gives the perfect message that whatever happens, just never give up. The film had such authenticity in its feel which is what attracted me even more to the film. <br/><br/>Performances: Greg Kinnear was great. Toni Collette was awesome too. I didn't know Steve Carell was such a talented actor. He nailed this role. Paul Dano was awesome too. Alan Arkin was exceelent as the foul mouthed elderly member. Abigail Breslin was good too. My heart went out for her. It was good to see Bryan Cranston and Dean Norris although they have roles in only one scene.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The scene where Olive doubts about her position in the competition and then Edwin instills confidence in her was my favorite scene. This particular scene perfectly defined the main theme that the film was going for.<br/><br/>Verdict: This 101 minute ride is worth the watch. This again goes to prove that with the right talent and the right script, the film can work wonders. It's a must watch for those who feel they haven't achieved anything in life.<br/><br/>It gets a well deserved 10/10."

","I watched this movie on a plane. I don't know what the person next to me might have thought of me, because I was laughing, then crying, then hysterically laugh again, then cry like a baby, to finally laugh to tears till the credits.<br/><br/>There are some movies that just get you. I don't know if it was the pseudo-indie cinematography, the light colours, the very earthly and relatable characters, the Sufjan Stevens soundtrack, the funny dialogues or everything put together; but I really felt the story close to my heart. Narrativvely speaking, it is a spring story: it goes from the utterly depressing life of an American family, to the immense happiness that can only come from having grown up as a character after a road trip. And it really manages to depict in a fair number of characters a distinct change into someone better, which gives us all hope that nothing is lost, and that in the end it will be alright.<br/><br/>Oh, and the actress of Olivia, the little girl, completely steals the show."
"warriorspirit","6","0","1","25 January 2016"," A bit dated and a bit questionable
","Looks like I am again going to be one of the minority voices on what is considered to be good and award winning movie. I am watching this on the heels of another road trip comedy ""Were the Millers"" In the latter I laughed my ass off, and in the former I barely opened my mouth to let out a laugh. I was underwhelmed with the entire movie, the situations and generally the character. <br/><br/>Perhaps this movie was one of the original road trip movies with a dysfunctional family, but is jaded now and there are far better , funnier and more entertaining ones in this genre. The comic situations in this movie are well not really all that funny, unless you think smuggling a dead body of their dirty grandpa whose killed himself from a cocaine overdose out of hospital window is funny; or a 8 year old doing a striptease at a beauty pageant for children is funny; or a gay man whose been fired from a prestigious academic job and tries to commit suicide is funny; or a self-help business man going bankrupt is funny; or self-imposed mute teenager finding out he is colour blind and cannot ever fulfil his dream of flying a plane.. is funny?<br/><br/>I did not find it funny but disturbing and a rather sad commentary on the American family. Every character in this movie is a loser; dirty grandpa who snorts cocaine, reads porn mags and speaks in vulgar sexual language in front of his grandchildren; most disturbing is he teaches his granddaughter(little miss sunshine) a striptease routine(this movie got awards) There is the gay brother in law whose tried to commit suicide because his man left him and he got fired from a top post, but rather than making him humble, it makes him arrogant and he repeatedly tells us ""I am very qualified you know"" There is the teenage son, who is a misanthrope and does not talk to people except through writing, and he throws a hissy fit when he learns he is colour blind and starts talking again; there is an arrogant control-freak father, who thinks there are only winners and losers in life and pushes his expectations on his children; there is an ignorant mother who is divorced and quarrelsome; and finally there is little miss sun shine herself, whose been deluded into thinking she is the most beautiful and talented girl in the world, and she's not.<br/><br/>Finally, what is the message of the movie? Is the message that we should not push ourselves and accept ourselves as we are? Is it children should be children and not groomed for beauty contents? Is it that though we maybe all losers, we should keep together as a family? Or is about the joy in loss?<br/><br/>There are a few tender moments and genuine family bonding moments so I am going to be generous and give it a 6. It is not a bad movie, just dated and bit questionable."

","Just a random thought: don't cha' think Rotten Tomatoes should just omit some critic's opinions. There are too many people on their who have no idea what they're talking about. Yes, everyone has their own opinion. But seriously... there are five negative reviews of Spirited Away. I don't think I could soon meet five other people who didn't like Spirited Away. If you want to get riled up, go on their for your favorite movie and click 'rotten reviews.' I do say that while everyone should be allowed to have their opinion, not everyone should be allowed to share it on a grand scale.<br/><br/>I only bring this up because I wondered onto that bloody site while looking for the director of the film. Yes, I don't have any discipline for that. It's also because I need something to vent the anger that pents up in me... but you don't want to hear about that. I do need to control myself. But I do at least get the opportunity to disprove one of the points made against this film by these so-called critics. They said that these characters don't seem 'real.' No you can argue about whether or not that's an accurate observation, but I will instead say why it's a worthless one.<br/><br/>Why are people so obsessed over characters being real. If I wanted to feel reality, I would- oh I don't know- actually go out into reality. Film is not reality. In many ways, that's a good thing. It can be better. It can invoke emotion that you can't see in reality. It can come to allow you to see the world in a different way, an enhanced way. So I'll just leave these no-knowing fools in the dust and talk about why this movie works.<br/><br/>It is of course a film about a dysfunctional American family. That's nothing new. But unlike what idiots seem to think, that's not necessary. Originality is overrated; it is just a tool from which to tell a story. All these characters are types we have seen before. But they are not just played straight, they are deconstructed and gone into deeper. It's what you would get if you put a sitcom into the hands of an experienced psychiatrist.<br/><br/>Some people seem to think that this movie wants to be subversive but isn't. Again; fools. This movie is supposed to be a feel-good movie... just an honest one. It tackles its issues in a real way. There is black comedy in it, but it is not one of those movies that exploits it. It is not 'one of those movies' of any sort. It's a singular movie. It's a movie about coming to terms and marching forward. You do not 'laugh at the characters.' You simply laugh and feel for them.<br/><br/>I really need to stop reading reviews. They get me too angry. But the film is just exceptional. There is nothing standard or subpar about it. The road trip format works perfectly. It is like a passage for the characters from one side of their lives to the others, a purgatory of sorts. Very few films before this have taken advantage of that. The cinematography is just stunning; some of the best I've seen in a comedy film. The soundtrack is likewise and is solemn without being too depressing.<br/><br/>This is not a happy film in the traditional way. But it is a stirring film. You may not rise to every height. And the droning voice telling you to (personified in this film by the father) does not help. But eventually, you come to terms with the fact that you do suffer and that's alright. You come to terms and go onwards. This is not a film about 'loserdom', as one critic put it. This is a film about deciding to face the world despite the fact that it whips you at every corner. That's an important lesson; one that can apply to everyone but is meant more for those who think they have everything figured out when they are really just surrounding themselves with nothingness.<br/><br/>This is exemplified in the exceptional talk that Frank (a man who attempted suicide) has with Dwayne (a Nietzsche-reading teen who has closed himself off to the world) by the sea. Not a speech or a quote or two. Just a talk. There is no moralizing, no weepy confessionalizing. Just a talk. That may mean nothing to people who have no sense of nuance, but it means everything to me. So goes this film.<br/><br/>The screenplay is exceptional, and with it I will segue into my final two points. This film has the sitcom typical family. The sitcoms use it for mass appeal. This film uses it to get inside everyone's head and deconstruct their way of thinking. It's stunning to behold. Every line is delivered with truth. Not grandiose delusions or pandering garbage or the dull cynicism that people my age seem to think is the truth. But truth; as in they know what they say means something and they know it. Though Abigail Breslin steals the show, everyone delivers great performances.<br/><br/>And my last point. I say, with my mother, whom I watched this film with, as evidence, is that you will like these characters more at the end than you did at the beginning. You've been on a journey with them and it shows.<br/><br/>This is the greatest film of 2006. Period."

","Laughing at dysfunction is like enjoying daytime TV. The one constant is feeling better about yourself in comparison to what is presented on TV, despite it being presented as ""entertainment"". It's quite possible I may have liked this more ten years ago, but I feel like there were new dysfunctional characters, but the same conflicts are the source of the humor, not the characters themselves. The end pay off is great, but fizzles halfway through and doesn't justify the quirky direction and forced reconciliations. The lighter moments were highlighted by seeing our little family centerpiece in the backseat of the old VW bus tying to reconnect the squares of the travel puzzle in the proper space to form a smiley face. It was quick but captured the movies point in three seconds. Unfortunately, the movie last a lot longer. When ideals clash in dysfunction, the casualties can always be found in the audience."

","Little Miss Sunshine is a salute to the heart and a feast for your soul that you can eat with your eyes. When I originally watched it back in 2007, I fell in love with it, and throughout repeated viewings (this is my fourth) it has held up better than a lot of mainstream comedies and other films that rely heavily on quirkiness and subtleties. This is a genuine, heartfelt excursion through the depressing event of life.<br/><br/>We are taken into the Hoover household, a dysfunctional, disconnected band of social misfits. Greg Kinnear plays Richard, an aspiring motivational speaker, who continues to reference his theories about ""winners and losers,"" while unintentionally browbeating his family. Sheryl (Collette) is the pro-honesty mother, continuously understanding and always bettering her children, but rarely talking about herself and her past and ambitions. Her brother Frank (Carrell) is a homosexual scholar who moves in with the family after his suicide attempt. Richard and Sheryl's children are Dwayne (Dano), Sheryl's from a previous marriage, who is currently partaking in a vow of silence until he can fulfill his dream of being a test pilot, and the spunky Olive (Breslin) who is breathlessly practicing her reclusive dance routine, coached by Richard's father Edwin (Arkin).<br/><br/>With this lovable cast of champions, it's no wonder why the film's turnout is so heavenly. The plot gets going when Olive gets accepted into California's ""Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant,"" and the already lower-middle class family decides to take a bright yellow Volkswagen Microbus from their home in Albuquerque, New Mexico to the event. Along the way, the family becomes reconnected, sometimes hostile, but most of all enlightened about themselves and the people around them.<br/><br/>These characters are so likable because they are imperfect. They are flawed, but not in the sense where dislike breeds contempt. The film is littered with poignant scenes, all across the board, and it's difficult not to spoil all of them. One of my favorites is when Dwayne discovers some life-changing news. Another takes place in a diner, another a confrontation between two men on a dock near the end of the film, and one of incorruptible happiness and optimism takes place in a motel room between Olive and her grandfather. It all leads up to that brilliant, unforgettable, amazingly-choreographed dance number that is so astonishing and satisfying you may have to watch it again.<br/><br/>What makes the film work is its ability to, almost inadvertently, dodge sitcom clich√©s and cutesy sequences. This is a true film, not manipulated by a flowery script or blooming characters. This is a walk on the side of life we rarely partake in, and for once, it feels natural and authentic.<br/><br/>The performances by actors of all different ages earn the title of ""career-worthy."" Steve Carrell is better here than he was in many of his comedy films, proving that many comedians can and will tackle a successful and promising drama role. Kinnear is wonderful as the closeted loser. Collette is a tad unsung, but the film does not overlook her at all. Abigail Breslin and Paul Dano are delightful, and Alan Arkin's one-liners cut through the cynicism so as not to overwhelm the viewer with depressed feelings as a form of guilt.<br/><br/>This is a gem in every sense of the word. It reminds me much of Sam Mendes' stellar American Beauty. Both films involve dilapidated families. One is a satire, the other is purposely poignant. Both have a plethora of fantastic performances, a script to boot their subjects, and both sort of convey a similar message at the end. Little Miss Sunshine left me feeling content and satisfied, but also very upset for reasons I still can't comprehend. Perhaps it was the abundance of dark humor. The same feelings plagued me upon finishing American Beauty. They are wonderful films, but pack in an after-taste that is not bitter, nor sweet, but real. That's the keyword for both pictures.<br/><br/>Starring: Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Steve Carell, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano, and Alan Arkin. Directed by: Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris."

Abigail Breslin doesn't deliver a bravura performance. But she nails the role by keeping it simple and natural, avoiding ""acting"" in the Hitchcock sense. This kid is the only sane one in the bunch, but then that is the right of being pre-teen. When you see the kids in the pageant, you see that their parents have taken this sanctuary from adulthood away from them.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear, with his pretty boy looks, is perfect in the role of over-confident self-help guru. He has done some fine work in other movies, but this is one of his best roles.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie is its fairly naturalistic acting, appearing at times almost like a reality TV show about an average neurotic American family.<br/><br/>It seems different people take away different things from this movie. The producers weave many levels of meaning into the story, effortlessly. In this, and in its natural style, it reminds me of Breaking Away. I think Sunshine, too, is destined to becoming something of a cult classic in the coming decades.<br/><br/>I also couldn't help but think of The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man in the Moon Marigolds, which also featured a pretty little daughter who was innocently oblivious to the neurotic family around her.<br/><br/>But perhaps most of all, this is a deliciously absurd comedy embedded in the movie's noir realism. The comedy works so well because it grows out of the movie's disjointed situations, rather than gags. Just thinking back on some of the scenes makes me laugh.<br/><br/>And for those of you who don't really know Alan Arkin, he is one of the greatest comedy actors of his era. I saw some of his early improv movie shorts that were just wonderful. <br/><br/>OK, it took me awhile to watch Little Miss Sunshine. If you haven't seen it, don't wait so long."

","I don't think it's a great movie, but it has some interesting points. The bunch of characters is mostly expressive. They all live a depression. Their dreams aren't achieved. And their connections with each other are nearly dead. It doesn't want to be a big picture for a nation. It just wants to put all the losers in one mission for winning a small dream. And the greater good that happens is by gathering them really with each other, because love is the best winning at all. So, what's wrong about it?<br/><br/>It's a road movie, with nice sad characters, and kind of good black comedy. It has lovely moments and innocent goal. What it needed to have was more than the superficial dealing sometimes. For instance, the wife looks overlooked?! I didn't catch on clearly what were her problems with her husband. Plus I couldn't understand Grandpa, despite how dazzling Alan Arkin's performance always is. It needed also coherent endings for the storylines, and sure anyone but Greg Kinnear; the guy was the lowest player, with other actor that could've been more deep and memorable role.<br/><br/>I loved the sequence of the beauty contest; the monstrous kids' look said a lot about a society that masters creating monsters. The way how the car was running, tells symbolically about wrecked life that must be caught anyway, most importantly with the family. Look at the last dance; where love is the actual and eternal beauty queen. Toni Collette is a ruby, she's one of the best actresses, how can any artiest be more believable?, just her role's writing bugged me. As you see, the movie has much potential, but did that script grasp and utilize them all?!<br/><br/>Haven't you noticed that the movie's characters have nothing to do with spirituality, where drugs and perversion are loose, or how their pop culture is destructive; so the kid is crazy about outward beauty, or how this is inwardly deformed society altogether? Well, you might notice, but not watch and feel. Because (Little Miss Sunshine) is a feel good movie after all. So the question of my title, which's 2 separate lines from the movie's dialogue, wasn't answered, or maybe was intended to be answered. Yes, being about a reunion of ugly upset American family; can be an enough social commentary about its era. Reading, and not exploring, can be useful sometimes. The thing about this movie is that it reads, without that intention to explore. So it isn't a great movie in my book. A light one about great matters maybe."

","Little Miss Sunshine seems to be a film with very polarized opinion considering most people seem to either love it or hate it. Well, I belong to that small remaining category of people who appreciated this film but expected more out of it.<br/><br/>The film has an interesting message and once they arrive in California this message is worked out really well, however the road trip it takes to get there isn't as interesting as I expected. The events that occur aren't that compelling nor are they that funny, making an actual road trip far more interesting than watching this family doing theirs. I believe it's a missed opportunity here, although I nevertheless think the ending saves this film from being forgettable. With a different ending, I would probably have rated it a 6 at most."

","I actually liked this movie. I knew it was something unique by the previews, but once I saw it on DVD, I watched again and again, about three times in one day. It has a good cast, and in fact, I like Steve Carell a lot for this movie than anything else he's ever done. There is a lot in common with our characters; we're both pathetic. Abigail Breslin is adorably cute and funny with the greatest sense of lungs; she can scream so long and so loud. The plot has a lot in common with ""National Lampoon's: Vacation"" inasmuch as both movies depict a long journey with an embarrassing vehicle and end up with a dead body and an unsatisfied end. However, in this one, it's more about five characters in search of self-discovery and that's where the movie shines."

","Have you ever read a film poster or DVD cover quote, promising that the movie in question is so funny ""You'll fall off your chair""? Of course you have. But how likely is it to happen? Statistically, I'd wager ""Not very - and, come to think of it, never"" as opposed to ""On the carpet, supine"".<br/><br/>People! Listen to me: with mine own eyes I have witnessed the miracle of chair-falling-offing. And not just involving one person, but dozens. It occurred near the end of Little Miss Sunshine, a hugely influential word-of-mouth phenomenon, which subsequently saw execs descending on Sundance in drives, hoping to bag their very own indie-lite comedy. While naturally, the resulting rash of quirkily cynical items have proved as cookie-cutter in their way as any mainstream variety; Smart People and Gigantic (also featuring Paul Dano) immediately spring to mind.<br/><br/>None of this, of course, is Little Miss Sunshine's fault. The film's comparative innocence is a big factor in its success. The performances are exemplary, very believable, and very touching. While husband-wife directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris immediately secured plinths for themselves in the pantheon of classic comedy, mere seconds after the familiar strains of Rick James' ""Super Freak"" kicked in.<br/><br/>Because that's when the miracle happened, at least in row upon row at the Cineworld Fulham Road.

SUNSHINE is clearly an indie, so it will appeal largely to that mindset, and not the mainstream audience. And again, it is an R, even after it is cleaned up for TV. The finale is bizarre, to say the least, and doesn't come off the way I suspect the directors intended. It is, frankly, embarrassing.

","Recap: One phone call can change so much. The Hoover-family got one that will change their family for ever. Seemingly innocent, the call tells that daughter Olive has won a beauty pageant since the former winner has been disqualified. Now she is invited to the Little Miss Sunshine-pageant in California and the entire family goes on a road trip like no other.<br/><br/>Comments: As far as characters go, this movie got it all. There is the father (Kinnear), a success-coach that has yet to be successful. Mother Sheryl (Collette) is totally stressed out but struggles to keep the family together by literally putting food on the table. Eldest son Dwayne (Dano) has taken a wow of silence and can't wait until he can move out, Granpa Edwin (Arkin) is just mad at everything because he is disappointed with how his life turned out, and recent addition Sheryl's brother Frank (Carell) that just attempted to commit suicide over lost love and lost job opportunities. And finally, there is daughter Olive (Breslin) that lives for her pageants, but seem to be the one most connected to her emotions in the entire family.<br/><br/>What connects them all is the Dream. The Dream of what life should be like. They all have it, and they all, in their own personal way, fail at them. The net result is a family on the edge of implosion. Now add one long road trip in a VW-van with a personality of itself.<br/><br/>So, the characters are great, and you got a good cast too. Arkin won an Oscar for his performance but I'm most impressed by Carell and Breslin. They really embodies hope and disappointment, the two extremes on the path to the Dream.<br/><br/>And the script is good too. Some moments are just great. And there is a subtle touch of humor all the way. Unfortunately it is too subtle at times, and some stretches get a little long and dull. In fact some stretches I lost interest all together, until one of those moments brought me back.<br/><br/>All in all it is a movie to watch, at least once.

","Little Miss Sunshine had it all: the great script, the great acting, and the heartwarming feeling of a big budget film. But it wasn't big budget, in fact aside from names like Steve Carrel and Greg Kinnear the movie didn't contain big names at all. Little Miss Sunshine hijacked our hearts and took us on one hell of a bumpy ride for an hour and a half. We hit all the highs, and all the lows with the Hoover family- and I don't know about you, but I loved every second of it. It was a journey wrapped in humor, but it was so much more than just a funny movie. Once we broke the comedic barrier we saw a struggling father who was doing his best to support a family. We saw a deeply depressed genius who had nothing left to live for, but finds belonging in his sister's family. A drug addicted grandfather who really does care about his family, but is also stubborn as a mule. A boy who only wants to fly planes for the military and is determined to the point of silence to complete his task. Finally a little girl lost in the wasteland of American beauty pageants, trying desperately to be something that she's not. Little Miss Sunshine is listed as a comedy/drama, but the thin layer of comedy quickly dissolves and we see a much deeper, truer story that speaks to the viewer. Yet it's still simple in its delivery. It doesn't force its message down your throat, it is subtle, and you're allowed, as a viewer, to decide whether to laugh or to cry. Personally I know I did both. Little Miss Sunshine is a movie that has stuck with me, quickly becoming one of my favorites. If you haven't seen this one yet, I suggest it very much. Little Miss Sunshine is a beautiful film that will leave you with a feeling of hope, or sadness, depending on how you watch it."

","Movies just don't get any better than this. Great story, great acting, phenomenal script and outstanding direction. The greatness of this movie lies in its simplicity, the characters are very easy to relate to and it seems like nobody acted in this movie, everyone just walked onto the sets of the movie and were just simply being themselves. The movie presents a simple family with its everyday problems and the great thing about the movie is that none of the problems are solved at the end but still...it leaves you with a happy feeling. I think that's not easy to achieve when you are making a movie. People want the bad guy to be punished, people to get married or just a happy ending. This movie doesn't not give you a happy ending per se (Some people might disagree with me) but it still leaves you satisfied and happy.<br/><br/>Did I say it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen?

","If I were Josef Goebbels, I'd probably review this film like this (including spoilers): ""Another farce made, this time by the Americans. When will they know that successful propaganda can be successful only when the arguments used work to their advantage, and not against them? Here, a homosexual cuts his wrists. Are we to feel akin to him through this? The upbringing of the American nuclear family implodes throughout this film; the father has failed in the upbringing of his family, his _white_ family. How can this be? We would never allow this through our media, yet another fact displaying the fall of the socialist regime. His woman is let to shout at him unpunished, and he has failed in rearing his female child, which rules him at a whim to partake in a vain, American cultural contest which is nonsensical as their child is not Aryan. The child, the female child, rules the male parent? Unheard of in The Reich!The only person to respect in the beginning of this nonsense is the masculine child, who revers Nietzsche, yet has his goal obliterated by gay propaganda. All in all: nothing to see. Even Leni could have jolted life into this mess. Two swastikas down."" I, on the other hand, like this film, which is a feel-gooder; Steve Carrell plays the best part seen him do so far (much like Adam Sandler in ""Punch-drunk Love""), and the script and tempo works much to the film's advantage. There is almost no soundtrack, and the action is sparse, which also works good. This film is like having a relaxing bath, yet I stayed on my toes as the film challenged me by not being linear. It's enticing on several levels. All in all, sweet, and the finale is lovable on many a level. I recommend it."

","I have heard a lot about this film prior to watching it. I heard about how funny it is and how much recognition it got from critics and the community alike. I finally was able to watch Little Miss Sunshine and I was surely not disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot of the story involves a rather dysfunctional family. The father, Robert Hoover, is attempting to jump start his career through a motivational program. The mother, Sheryl, is a overworked mother that is trying to create a comfortable life for her kids. The grandpa, who got kicked out of his retirement home for snorting heroine. The uncle who recently attempted to commit suicide. Dwayne is the quiet teen son that has taken a vow of silence until he becomes a test pilot. Finally Olive, who is a little girl that got accepted to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California. The film is the family's journey to the pageant.<br/><br/>One of the strongest points of the film is the casting. I loved Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano and Steven Carrell in this film. Their acting is top notch and makes for some memorable and touching scenes which often come with a hint of dark comedy.<br/><br/>The aspect that keeps this film fresh and not a clich√© meddled mess is the assiduous sense of innocence and awkwardness that is present on the screen. There is always a nice mix of both in the movie that it makes for some good laughs even when the topic being discussed is not something to be laughed about. This mixtures explodes in the pageant scenes at the end of the film. The pageant also provides a not-so-subtle comment about children in pageants as well The only thing that bothered me in this film is how insensitive and annoying some of the characters were. Despite the family going through many hardships during the trek from New Mexico to California, these mainly minor characters managed to irritate me to a annoying extent. I did not see a great point in adding these characters into the film.<br/><br/>The ending was very well done and finished off in the right place. The main thing I was happy to see about the ending was that it avoided clich√©s and ended on a very humorous and appropriate way.<br/><br/>Overall, this film will not disappoint you. If you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses, you will enjoy it. If you're a fan of dark comedy, yo will enjoy it. If you're into indie films, you will enjoy it. So sit back and let this crazy little family take you on a very quirky trip."

'Vacation' is full of hilarious situations and highly quotable lines ""Do you know the law against animal cruelty in this state?"". 'Sunshine' has none of this, but is a fantastic feel good film, with some good laughs (particularly the Grandad),it is well acted and has a great script. Having gone through the moody teenage Nietzsche obsession myself, this was wonderfully played by Paul Dano, and made me laugh with recognition.

","The movie is in itself not as strong or groundbreaking as the Oscar-nominations and the attention by the press made you believe. The theme of a dysfunctional family going on a road trip to discover each other and themselves, is something that we have seen before in the past. So, it's not like they are threading on uncharted territory with this title. The young girl in the main role - mostly the subject of all the praise - is as cute as she is thoroughly annoying. I enjoyed the characters around her more than I did enjoy her presence. She's not a brilliant actress, but just a kid that plays her role with verve.<br/><br/>It's easy to degrade this heartwarming comedy by comparing it to the legendary status it unrighteously generated. ''They said it was brilliant, but it isn't! So, it's nothing! '' That kind of reasoning seems to be in the mouth of those who didn't like it. But I think it's unfair to the title. While it is not a perfect movie, it still is an amusing comedy with a indie-feel to it that exceeds most of the crap that is supposed to be funny. It has a nice philosophy on how we should accept that life just isn't that form-able as we'd like it to be, and that we should enjoy the things that do come on our path. It's optimistic by being a bit depressing. A refreshing take on all the happy ends that we usually get from American filmmakers."

","""Little Miss Sunshine"" tells the story of a dysfunctional family's trek across America in order for their youngest child to take part in a beauty pageant. The movie strikes that rare perfect balance between comedy and drama. The situations are comedic but the characters have actual depth, meaning that they aren't just one-dimensional butts of jokes.<br/><br/>This mix is especially impressive since the film-makers are relative newcomers. This is the Michael Arndt's first writing credit and the co-director's (Dayton & Faris) experience comes mainly in the field of music videos. If they keep producing work of this calibre, though, it won't be the last we'll hear of them.<br/><br/>The cast here is quite an impressive ensemble. Each family member is markedly different and no-one is left without sufficient character development. Normally I'm not much of a fan of Greg Kinnear but he really nailed this role. Arkin & Collette I expected to be good (and was proved right) but I was really impressed with Abigail Breslin. She exudes a realistic mix of childish enthusiasm and insecurity. I can't remember the last time I saw an actor/actress with this much poise at such a young age.<br/><br/>The script is often funny but has several serious or heartwarming moments as well. Now, when I say heartwarming I mean genuinely heartwarming, not relying on schmaltzy Hollywood emotional manipulation. Throughout the course of the film we begin to really care about these characters. The ending will leave you smiling and pondering the differences that divide us and the bonds that unite us.<br/><br/>All in all, a highly recommended comedy, though certainly not meant for the kids, despite the subject matter.

","Once again I find myself watching a highly rated movie and thinking to myself ""is that it?"" when the credits roll.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine has been widely heralded as a ""heartwarming comedy"" and other apparently appealing phrases.<br/><br/>However the truth is that there are almost no real laughs, and your heart will be swiftly chilled by the final scene.<br/><br/>I won't put in a spoiler but the beauty pageant makes for very uncomfortable viewing indeed. As an attempt at satire and subversion it is well wide of the mark.<br/><br/>Until then the film slowly builds into a low-key yet fairly touching story of a family who grow closer on a road trip as the pillars of their lives slowly collapse. The humour is wry rather than laugh out loud. However this is nothing that you would not find in any well made TV drama.<br/><br/>What does stand out though are the performances. Young Abigail Breslin is excellent as Olive and Alan Arkin's supporting role as the grandfather steals the show."
"Cocacolaguy912-2","6","0","3","31 December 2007"," Quirky BS? Perhaps. Not as good as everyone says.
","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is borderline quirky to the point of irritating. The characters are crisp and original, but the premise is seemingly one-dimensional and the conclusion is thought provoking, but in a boring way. It isn't a bad movie but for me it failed to move me, or really entertain me that much. Many will disagree but the movie got good when Paul Dano's character started telling people off. Before that time it just seemed like a drag to a unexciting finish.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is not Oscar worthy. The actors do quite a good job, but they are only as good as the quirky, even pretentious script that was given to them. You want a really good independent film?

Also trying to bring Olive right on time for the pageant.<br/><br/>Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris made an entertaining comedy/drama that keeps it real, dark, often very funny and touching as well. This was one of the biggest surprises of both critical and at box office of this well done independent feature. The cast are terrific here. Especially Arkin, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as the man who living his life outrageously. Breslin also got an Oscar Nomination for her amusingly funny supporting performance. Dano is also good as the extremely quiet angered son of the family, who keeps his vow of silence until the day... he gets to fly jets for the navy. The characters development are genuinely good and the casts keeps it honest and fresh.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes two commentaries tracks, one by the filmmakers and second commentary by the filmmakers & screenwriter:Michael Arndt. Which Arndt won an Oscar for his fine original screenplay. DVD features also includes four alternate ending with optional commentary by the filmmakers and a music video. I would have love to see more features of this very good picture but the first commentary by the filmmakers is amusing enough. This film is also received an Oscar Nomination for Best Picture. This is one of those movies that people keep watching and it will find an new audiences time to time.

","Maybe it's just because the ""Tennenbaums"" were released earlier that I didn't give it 10 points, but it's a great movie and definitely worth seeing it. Especially if you're in to weird family stories. I also like the way the movie deals with the American beauty-craze and the (in my eyes) pretty American ""You're-either-number-one-or-nothing-at-all-mentality"". I like the extremely funny and partly absurd comedy of these actually tragic (family)situations. The acting is great, especially Little Miss Sunshine Abigail Breslin is fantastic! In my eyes the end was a little bit predictable if you've studied the character of grandpa Alan Arkin (a deserved Oscar) during the trip. I was surprised by the acting of Steve Carell who's honestly not one of my favorites - but in this he seems to be better and shows more acting skills than in any other movie I've seen him in. Respect. As I said 9 thumbs up!"
"gizmomogwai","8","0","2","15 September 2007"," Worth watching
","Long after someone recommended it, I decided to watch this after hearing just one joke on the trailer, where Greg Kinnear's character talks about sarcasm being the language of losers and someone replies with a sarcastic answer. Unfortunately, the movie has just a few other moments that are as funny, but this quirky dramedy is altogether worth watching.<br/><br/>In touching on familiar subject matter for this genre- dysfunctional families, angst-filled teenagers, homosexuality and suicide- Little Miss Sunshine adds little to what other movies like The Royal Tenenbaums have already done. Little Miss Sunshine's strengths are in playing with the idea of being a loser, a main theme of the movie, aside from its disturbing take on beauty pageants. Not recommended for anyone who hates movies that aren't action adventures."
"film_riot","9","0","2","19 August 2007"," Little Miss Sunshine
","This film has an amazing beginning that in its style reminded me of ""Magnolia"" or ""Boogie Nights"". There is high tempo and you get to know all the characters of the family, and all of this with really great scenes. So the first montage is immediately one of the highlights of this wonderful film. I've often heard critics saying ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is predictable, and yes, they are right, it really is a little bit. But when it's done as charming as here, there is nothing to complain. The way Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton give space to each of the characters and come to the conclusion that with all its faults family still can be one of the best things on earth is feel-good cinema par excellence. The end sequence on the stage of the beauty contest just made me rejoice inwardly, with its childish spirit of kicking the rich one's ass. Not that I was a big fan of the genre, but if there ever was a film for the whole family, this is it."
"DavidSim240183","9","0","2","15 August 2007"," A dysfunctional family road trip movie
","Little Miss Sunshine went on to be the sleeper hit of 2006. It may have been intended for the indie crowd, but it equally struck a chord with mainstream audiences. And it is quite a rewarding film. Its not quite as good as that dysfunctional family gem The Royal Tenenbaums, but Little Miss Sunshine has charms and strengths all its own.<br/><br/>LMS is admittedly more accessible than The Royal Tenenbaums. But I still believe it stands in that superior character study's shadow. Nevertheless, the Hoover family is every bit as quirky, and all the more endearing for it.<br/><br/>I liked the way the film introduces each member of the family individually before they all come together. First off there's Richard (Greg Kinnear), a motivational speaker. His twelve-step pyramid schemes have long since dried up. He just hasn't caught up yet. Then there's his wife Sheryl (Toni Collette), a woman who's the Pritt-Stick of the family when she should be the glue. So its no wonder the family's on the verge of flying apart.<br/><br/>Uncle Frank (Steve Carell) is a depressed gay teacher, who just attempted suicide after his lover left him for another man. He's with the family because he can't be trusted to be left on his own. Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a Frederich Nietzsche acolyte who's an Air Force hopeful. He's taken a vow of silence until he achieves his goal.<br/><br/>And then there's Grandpa (Alan Arkin), an elderly coke-addict who's just been kicked out of his retirement home. Probably because he thinks too much when the people in those places have already lost their marbles by now. Finally, there's Olive (Abigail Breslin), Little Miss Sunshine herself. A seven-year old child who lives in blissful innocence of the chaotic cracks forming all around her.<br/><br/>Olive has no idea how much trouble her family is in. But she proves to be a unifying force when she is nominated in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Despite the fact this family has problems communicating, the six pack themselves up in a camper van, and begin a cross-country trip from Mexico to California to reach the pageant. But its hard to tell which will be a bigger obstacle. The van's many deficiencies. Or the Hoover's fractured psyches and deep-seated neuroses.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine may be a tad predictable in parts, but its a smart, and refreshingly insightful road trip film. This is not the first film to feature blackly humorous dysfunctional families. And it never quite reaches the extraordinary heights of The Royal Tenenbaums, but its still a good film.<br/><br/>It has quite a few gentle surprises from time to time. Such as Frank's homosexuality. Its almost explained to Olive offhandedly. And when its discovered, it makes the reasons for his suicide attempt that much more poignant. Its gems like this that keep the film from sinking into melodrama.<br/><br/>And the ensemble playing is fine. Everyone knows their character (including Breslin), and never strays from that. Paul Dano has the toughest job out of the six, because for about three quarters of the way through, he's not allowed to speak any dialogue. So he's forced to rely upon a minimalist mode of acting. And its quite accomplished on his part. He allows for a gradual build-up in emotion, all hidden behind a thin smile and a glazed expression. And when it finally explodes, its quite powerful. And that scene is capped by a delightful moment when Olive puts her arm around him in silence. Its a sweet little scene.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin does what he does best. Impeccably controlled acting. And he does such a great job of making Grandpa crotchety but endearing. His little talk with Olive about wanting to be a winner is nicely played with that all too important dash of sincerity. And when he passes away halfway through, its a genuine shocker. I'd really grown to like this man, and his death was really quite saddening.<br/><br/>There are scenes that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Coen Brothers film. Such as trying to move a dead body, and trying to figure out what to do with it. Its broader comedy, but it works too.<br/><br/>The beauty pageant is a bit of an odd mixture of laughter and squirming unease. I think maybe that final scene goes on a bit too long, and could have done with some tighter editing, but Abigail Breslin gets to show off some real magnetism (and dancing ability!). She's an actress I hope to be hearing a lot of in the future.<br/><br/>The ending is not all that unexpected, but I'd grown to enjoy the Hoover family's company. Little Miss Sunshine is not quite as original as it likes to think it is, but its undeniably a real charmer, and has some pleasant surprises along the way."

","I'm not surprised that this film was nominated for best picture. Even though the plot was simple I thought it was engaging. The characters were not really likable at first but you grew into them.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a story of a very messed up family. The father played by Greg Kinnear, who I thought did a wonderful job, is a winner only type dad. The grandfather, who is very foul mouthed (warning!), is played by Alan Arkin. The grandfather also happens to be a drug addict. The teenage son played by Paul Dano, is confined to himself as he shuts off the rest of the world in hopes of achieving his ultimate goal of being a jet pilot. The uncle, played by Steve Carell, is a depressed homosexual who attempted to commit suicide after his partner left him and he is now living with the rest of the family. The mother(I forget the actress's name) is trying to keep the madness together. And the youngest in the family(played by Abagail Preslin) is the sweet heart with big dreams of becoming a beauty pageant winner.<br/><br/>All of the family head out on a road trip to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. As the family departs they have no true bond with each other. Lets just say that they are not much of a family at first. On their trip outrageous events occur that bring out huge laughs and sadness. Dramatic events occur that change the family and bring them closer together. This is all a build up to the fantastic climax where the whole family unites.<br/><br/>A very funny and heart warming movie, but I will warn you that there is some strong language that might catch you off-guard. strong language doesn't usually offend me but in this movie I found it unnecessary.<br/><br/>Little Miss Sunshine is a great movie with big laughs at times with very emotional scenes. But the best part about this film is the message displayed at the end. You might not find this the funniest film but I assure you that the ending and message at the end is all worth it to watch."

"Isaac5855","8","0","1","7 August 2007"," The Little Movie that Could...
","The surprise hit of 2006, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a lovely little movie that took family dysfunction and delightfully stood it on its ear in this warm comedy drama that, if caught in the right mood, will bring up equal parts laughter and tears. This is the story of little Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin), a little girl who lives in Albuquerque who learns she is going to be a finalist in a California children's beauty pageant called Little Miss Sunshine and the road trip that Olive's family takes to get her there in a broken down VW bus that the family has to push to get started. Michael Arndt's crisp, Oscar-winning screenplay brilliantly captures a family in shreds, on the edge of self-destruction, brought back to the possibility of life by having a potential beauty queen in the family. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris effectively put us right inside that VW bus and have created a family unit you feel for. The cast is first rate: Greg Kinnear is Richard, Olive's workaholic dad who unknowingly has put a lot of unnecessary pressure on his daughter. Toni Collette,as always, is vividly real as Cheryl,Olive's mom and the family referee. I love Collette because she's one of those rare actresses you never see ""acting."" Alan Arkin won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his amusing turn as Olive's foul-mouthed, heroin-snorting grandfather and Steve Carell is also Oscar worthy in a dazzling performance as Olive's gay uncle, who has just been released from a mental hospital after a suicide attempt. Newcomer Paul Dano also makes a strong impression as Dwayne, Olive's big brother who hates his family and is on a vow of silence until he gets accepted into the air force academy. There are many laughs along this offbeat road trip and the story does take a couple of dark turns, but nothing out of the realm of reality for this story. The Hoovers do get to the pageant but the story even takes a couple of twists there that we don't see coming and, BTW, a bouquet to veteran character actress Beth Grant, who is hysterically funny as one of the pageant judges. And needless to say, Abigail Breslin is a revelation as Olive, a performance endearing enough to earn her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The film was also nominated for Best Picture and after you see it, you'll understand why. Don't miss this gem of a sleeper."

","I love it when a film gets me thinking, especially when it challenges certain very popular ideas and trends. And if you're like me, you'll love this film.<br/><br/>Firstly, the characterization is just brilliant and the actors do a great job with it too, with the grandfather(in the movie) winning an Oscar. It is one of those movies where it is actually fun to see how the characters interact with such strong and drastically different characters. You've got a granddad who's a junkie, a father who pressures his kids to win and only win but is bankrupt himself, a mother who is caring but wants a divorce and keeps fighting, an uncle who tried to kill himself because his gay partner walked out on him, a son who vowed to remain silent and claims he hates everyone in the world, and the daughter who wants to win a beauty contest.<br/><br/>It may seem trivial in the beginning or even when you look back, but there is a heavy dose of philosophy delivered beneath the somewhat trivial story-line. The film itself is an attack on plastic beauty, which we 'enjoy' in beauty pageants. It also depicts many other social problems, exploring ideas such as how suffering brings about learning.<br/><br/>Honestly, I did not laugh at all and did not find the funny parts hilarious. But even then I give it a nine. In a nutshell: its a film that subtly challenges many ideas with awesome characterization and acting that really gets you thinking, leaving you with an indescribable satisfaction."

She's the young daughter of a family that includes a failed motivational speaker father, a brother who's taken a vow of silence, a grandfather who's addicted to heroine, and a mother who just loves them all. On the day that her mother's depressed and suicidal brother joins the family, Olive finds out that she gets that chance she's dreamed of. And now it's up to her family to get her there in their old VW van that barely works. However, the trip is only half the fun- once they arrive, the result is hilarious... and downright moving.<br/><br/>The whole cast is pretty fantastic. Abigail Breslin is plays quite possibly the most adorable little girl ever, and her performance is wonderful. Toni Collette is also brilliant as the mother of this motley crew, and Steve Carrell is also perfect. Their performances are easily the most underrated part of this film. At the same time, Alan Arkin's rather simple performance is the most overrated.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a story about love; love of the oddities and quirks of this family that both constantly threatens to tear them apart and also makes them love each other most.

The Oscar-winning script is relentlessly witty, the plot is far from clich√©, the length is not too long or too short, the characters are clever, and the performances are all stupendous.<br/><br/>The basic story is really quite simple. A young girl and her incredibly dysfunctional family must go on a road trip across America so that the girl can participate in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. Simple and bland? You might think so if you'd never seen the film.<br/><br/>The leading roles in this film belong to Greg Kinnear, Toni Colette, and the great Steve Carell. Kinnear, one of the most underrated actors of our time, plays, Richard, the insufferable loser that fathers the family. Toni gives another good performance as Sheryl, the dissatisfied wife who is growing fed up with her ambitious and hopeless husband.In a fantastic performance, Steve Carell steals the show as Frank, Sheryl's brother, a depressed Pruitt scholar who remains likable the entire film without seeming too sentimentalized or bland.<br/><br/>This movie is not flashy or over the top. I mean this as a positive thing. Instead of simply filming ridiculous and over-the-top slapstick scenes, this film focuses on smart humor to win the crowds over. The scenes in the film range from simple (dinnertime in the Hoover household), to sick and disturbing (the hospital scene and the pageant). Nothing is glamorized or made uglier. Things are simply the way they are. This movie is phenomenal and in my opinion, it should have won the Oscar. Go see it!!!!!!!!!!"

","Albuquerque homemaker Sheryl (Toni Collette) has a few problems, causing her some stress, leading to nicotine addiction. (""I am NOT smoking!"")<br/><br/>First, there is Richard (Greg Kinnear) her husband, who is an annoying and uninspired motivation speaker who thinks he's going to get rich hustling his nine-step pyramid to success. Loser!<br/><br/>Then there is her brother Frank (Steve Carell) who has bandages on his wrists after trying to kill himself because his homosexual lover (one of his grad students) dumped him, the number one American authority on Marcel Proust, for his academic rival, the number two authority. Pathetic!<br/><br/>Next there is Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a randy nursing home reject who snorts heroin, has a potty mouth and complains a lot. (Maybe he'll overdose!)<br/><br/>Then there is her teenaged son Dwayne an antisocial loner who reads Nietzsche, hates everyone, and is on a vow of silence until he gets into flight training in the Air Force. (Our children always disappoint us. Sometimes we forgive them.)<br/><br/>And finally there is Miss Sunshine herself, her daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) a little overweight, a little nerdy, not exactly a looker, who has entered the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for little girls and is honing her dance routine following the pornographic advice of Grandpa. Oh, boy!<br/><br/>Credit Michael Arndt whose script won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for this lineup and for a wonderful and strikingly original comedic and satirical romp through dysfunctional land. For reasons too complex to relate, the whole family piles into the Volkswagen bus and heads for Redondo Beach, California where the beauty pageant is being held. Along the madcap way, the bus's clutch goes out, Grandpa suffers, shall we say, a major setback, Richard learns that the family finances are not going to work out, Frank gets the heartbreak rubbed in his face, and Dwayne finds out that his dream is not going to come true. But can Olive win the pageant? <br/><br/>The pageant itself is pretty funny with the girls in their plastic hairdos and their Tammy Faye makeup and their fake smiles pitted against the decidedly unglamourous but ever hopeful Olive Hoover. Who will win?<br/><br/>Alan Arkin won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and Abigail Breslin and the picture itself garnered Oscar nominations. But see this for the writer. Michael Arndt's warm, funny and highly original script has me (and half the screenwriters in Hollywood and New York) green with envy.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","Finally, just when you fear that the studio industry has all but killed the genuine filmmaker, save perhaps David Lynch, you see a ray of light. A bunch of talented people got together and told a simple story involving complex characters with a beginning, a middle and an end. No flash, no gimmicks, no ""look-at-this-new-fangled-cinema technology-and-fancy-camera-work"" bogus to cover up lack of substance. No ""it's made to seem just like an indie"" fakery. The cast delivers truthful and unforgettable performances, creating a family that is functional in their love and support for one another, no matter how messed up their lives and circumstances may be. Abigail Breslin as Olive wins before she enters the competition, bringing joyful innocence into a world of sorrow. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" takes the crown by not competing with the typical two- hour commercialism. There is hope."
"spooly_montana","10","0","1","18 April 2007"," Puts the ""fun"" in dysfunctional.
","Follow a dysfunctional family made up of six vastly different individuals in a bright yellow VW bus on a hurried chaotic road trip, and experience one of the brightest filmic gems of recent memory, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. A Sundance favorite, 'Little Miss Sunshine' has emerged as a mainstream hit receiving four Oscar nominations this year, including Best Picture. The wonderfully penned debut by writer Michael Arndt earned him an Academy Award, and provided the filmmakers with ample material to shape and craft into the memorable film that resulted. The opening of the film quickly establishes the idiosyncrasies of our main characters. Richard (Greg Kinnear) is determined to become a self-help guru with his ""Refuse to Lose"" system that is far from taking off. His wife Sheryl (Toni Collette) is supportive, but her patience is waning. Sheryl's brother Steve (Steve Carell) is a suicidal Proust scholar, put in the family's care temporarily until he gets better in the head. Richard and Sheryl's two kids are as different as night and day. Their teenage son Dwayne is in the midst of a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force and becomes a fighter pilot. Dwayne keeps a book by Friedrich Nietzsche cracked open and claims to have been inspired by the German philosopher to stay mute. Olive (Abigail Breslin) is their fragile 7 year old daughter, obsessed with the validation of winning a beauty pageant someday. And finally, we have the grandfather (Alan Arkin), teaching Olive a dance routine for the beauty pageant, meanwhile having a closet heroin addiction. We are introduced to the quirky parts of this imperfect family machine and the story takes off. Olive has the chance to compete in a beauty pageant in Redondo Beach, California, and the entire family is forced to embark on a road trip full of calamity and comedy. Leaving from their home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, they each are forced to get to know and appreciate each other, whether they want to or not, in the cramped space of the VW bus. It is really not all that implausible that the vast assortment of these characters can indeed exist in any single American family, making it easily relatable to virtually anyone. Most of us can see a piece of ourselves in either the youthful angst, or the older adult crises. As the VW bus nears its destination, each of the family members are tested, with perceptions and beliefs challenged. The pageant now represents a rallying point for them all, not just a contest for Olive to compete in. Despite setbacks and road adventures, they push on to California to make it on time, and have Olive be their symbolic champion. When all is said and done they see that the outcome does not matter. The fake and polished veneer of the pageant is abhorrent, and they see that awkward little Olive cannot fit in this world, and does not belong there. For in Olive, as in all of them, lies an individual that is important just as they are. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is both heartfelt and tragic, with an important message - life is not about the destination, but about the journey. The plot does not surround the pageant really, but the experiences the family shares on the way there. This ensemble cast works so well because nobody is trying to ""steal the show""; they act together with a subtlety that is a treat to watch. This film is a wonderful comedic surprise, and certainly one of my favorites from the last year. This family puts the ""fun"" in dysfunctional ¬ñ sit back and enjoy the ride!"

","Another great indie-flick! If I would have a hat I would raise to the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" film-makers. The subject is very present. Issue of the beauty pressures is one of the most debated subject in the world. When the pressures start when you are young it is certainly alarming. Beauty pageants for young girls are touching the borders of morality.<br/><br/>Olive (Abigail Breslin) has won an entrance to the Little Miss Sunshine-contest finals. She takes a road trip with her family which might appear little peculiar. There is a success-obsessive father (Greg Kinnear), understanding mother (Toni Collette), strong-vacant older brother (Paul Dano), suicidal uncle (Steve Carell) and fantastically twisted grandpa (brilliant Alan Arkin). With this combination the journey can't be anything but interesting. The journey is full with drama and little twists. There is death and self-discovery. Little Miss Sunshine's message is that you can be anything you want to be but sometimes you can find happiness from things you never thought you would.<br/><br/>The author Michael Arndt has focused his attention to the real life's aspects. The relationships between the family members may seem a little exaggerated but it really represents the family life as it usually is.<br/><br/>Have to say that Abigail Breslin was impressive as a child-actress but it was good that she didn't win the Academy Award. I think the new-comer Paul Dano was more impressive. It isn't so easy to act without any words. And I was really surprised by the knowledge that comedian Steve Carell can do more serious roles also.<br/><br/>The ending was so brilliant I laughed and cried at the same time. You should have seen it coming...<br/><br/>I strongly recommend to watch Little Miss Sunshine. More independent movies, thank you!"

","Part road trip movie, part satire, Little Miss Sunshine is an absolute gem of a comedy, rightly lauded at the Sundance Film Festival, combining the traditional elements of road trips with plenty of dysfunction, and more than a few surprises. <br/><br/>It focuses on the Hoover family and their stressed filled lives as they cross the country in their VW van to take the youngest child, Olive, to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Firstly, there's Dad, who's a failed motivational speaker, obsessed with 'winners' to the point of driving the family insane with his mottoes. Then there's Mum, whose pent up emotion is hidden by her need to keep sane and her family together. Firstborn Dwayne has taken a vow of silence until he's old enough to go to the Air Force academy, having read Nietzsche extensively. Grandpa was thrown out of his retirement home for using heroin, and now mopes about being suitably cynical (""I can take heroin, I'm old""). Uncle Frank is a depressed, gay, failed-suicide who is drifting through his life no longer caring about anything or anyone. And finally there's little Olive, who wants so desperately to be in the pageant, despite not being shallow enough, or indeed pretty enough.<br/><br/>The whole cast are outstanding ¬ñ none of them can be faulted or accused of scene-stealing given that this is perhaps one of the best screen ensemble casts in memory. Olive (Beslin) gives an especially wonderful performance, particularly in the pageant talent competition at the end, so staggeringly inappropriate. <br/><br/>The film is also heart-stoppingly funny. From one-liners through choice background details and embarrassing episodes, there is something memorable to see in every frame, and the cast pull off all comedic timing with such skill one wonders how a film can be both this funny whilst also being so moving, bringing us to truly care about what is probably the most dysfunctional family seen on screen. <br/><br/>The film is mostly set on the road, and all the episodes that come from it, keeping nicely with the tradition of road movie (leaving people behind, vehicles breaking down, diner stops) whilst surpassing them all in humour and characterisation. The beauty pageant itself is, quite frankly, a scary satire on the lengths parents will go to fulfil their children's dreams. We see heavily made-up kids supporting bad fake tans and inappropriate clothing doing acts that mums think are sweet but are a paedophile's dream (we actually see one at the pageant, who is funnier than he has any right to be). The irony being that Olive's act is the height of what the pageant is trying to be, and manages to disgust all the parents who can't see beyond their own hypocrisy. <br/><br/>There's not a lot else to say about Little Miss Sunshine other than to say that in an ideal world it would be seen by everyone. It's a small film that manages to leap out of the big screen because it is so well constructed, through the laughs, the pace and the tone, that it is a near faultless comedy, and probably the best of 2006. <br/><br/>Rated: 9/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

My personal feeling is it's a good movie¬óperhaps providing unique insights into how to resolve a dysfunctional family¬óbut not big enough to win the Oscar.<br/><br/>The setup: we learn very quickly the nuclear family portion of the ensemble consists of a motivational speaker Pop (Greg Kinnear), his long-suffering wife Sheryl (Toni Collette), a seemingly psycho son Dwayne who reads Nietzsche and doesn't speak, and Olive (Abigail Breslin), the daughter innocently addicted to child beauty pageants. <br/><br/>Add to the mix Sheryl's gay brother Uncle Frank (Steve Carell)¬ócrashing with the family because he attempted suicide upon losing his job and being outed¬óand heroin advocate-philosopher Grandpa (Alan Arkin) who offers his perspective to everyone having problems, especially his two grandkids. <br/><br/>The plot centers around the need to get Olive to a beauty pageant in California from New Mexico, where the strange family lives. They're scraping by, basically, and have to pile into a VW bus for the trip. It's a road pic and a good 'un.<br/><br/>Each of the characters is tantalizing complex, and they unfold during the journey through striking off one another. The root of the adventure is Olive's genuine motivation to be the best she can be in the context of beauty queenery. She's innocent of the contrivances that surround the pageant business.<br/><br/>The final scene with Olive's performance at the pageant strikes a blow for honesty and integrity... and genuine human feeling.

","I have not seen this movie yet but one of the comments I read on this page really stung me. One of the users commented on how messed up people that do child pageants are. I did child pageants and my daughter does child pageants. There are pageants out there where the girls are encouraged to be little girls. Where they have a really great weekend and learn that it's not about winning or loosing, it's about gaining confidence, public speaking, and meeting new friends. Most people who have a comment on child pageants have never experienced pageants like the ones I know. Most people who have a comment about child pageants have never experienced a pageant at all except for what they see on TV(and really....what is real on TV these days?) If a child looses at a pageant, is it not the same to loose at a dance competition, or a softball tournament, or a spelling bee? If you look at loosing these events the same as people do at loosing a pageant then everyone is a big fat looser with self esteem problems. No one wins all the time. Don't place blame on pageants because you don't understand how to teach your daughter to be able to loose at ANYTHING and still know she is beautiful and to shake it off and try again. Teach your children to learn from their mistakes instead of blaming their losses on others."

","What a well-written and acted film! I loved the fact that is was a spoof of both road movies and the beauty contest theme. All the men suffered a disaster while on the road, while the woman and the girl just suffered and carried on. My favorite shot was when the boy was sulking and the mother then the sister came to talk to him with the bus and the other three framing the closeup on the skyline above. I particularly liked Steve Carrell, the gay suicidal brother, who appears to be a TV star with a very busy movie agenda these days. His resemblance to Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president, just adds to the allure. Of course these child beauty contests are truly awful and the other contestants, with their coy mimicry of adult female sexuality, were genuinely pornographic. Olive's strip tease was not because she was just herself. It is a profound commentary on America that one is tolerated and encouraged, while the other is pilloried and banned. Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his radical book on education, Emile, said that any child can be trained up to play a Mozart violin sonata on the dining table for an adult audience, if s/he does little else. The trick is to find ways of allowing children to do what they are uniquely capable of at a given age, just be being themselves. I couldn't help think of my four-year-old daughter in relation to Olive. She is so brave and yet as vulnerable as any other kid. Beautiful on the inside and on the outside, like my other, much older daughter. The strength of the script lay in its awful depiction of the nightmare of family life, with the final transcendent unity not forced at all."

","Watching ""Little Miss Sunshine"" you understand that a movie sometimes doesn't need a lot. Not special effects, not a big production, not an A-list ensemble and lots of other things make the movie something to talk about; but what definitely makes it an unforgettable experience is Abigail Breslin's fabulous performance. She is nine years old, for god's sake.<br/><br/>This could be the ""Sideways"" of this year, I mean. It is a road-movie; the writer finds the characters an excuse to make a trip that obliges them to talk and, like we say here; ""take the dirty laundry out"", which means speaking about everything bad we think of people. In this case, it is a family; and a very dysfunctional one, unluckily.<br/><br/>Abigail Breslin is Olive, the excuse for the trip, because she is participating in the singing and dancing contest, 'Little Miss Sunshine'. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is the one who's teaching her the moves. His son Richard (Greg Kinnear) lives by a philosophy of not being a looser, when, sadly, he is one. Sheryl (Toni Colette), his wife, is a liberal housewife with a brother, Frank (Steve Carell), who tried to kill himself but failed. Their other son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), doesn't talk and will stay this way until he fulfills his dreams.<br/><br/>With this over the top character personalities, the screenplay could have been an exaggeration of reality; but no. It is indeed a representation of reality, in the words of Michael Arndt, who is Oscar-nominated for his first and only work. Going back to the ""Sideways"" comparison; as this film, ""Sideways"" was nominated for best picture, best supporting actor and actress and for best director, but it won for best adapted screenplay.<br/><br/>Analyzing it, Arndt has an advantage: his tale is original. It comes from I don't know where, but it tells the story of a family that somehow you end up loving; and I don't know how he does it. Alexander Payne was nominated for best director, and although Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton aren't, to pursue this after experiencing only with musical videos has merit.<br/><br/>Their control of the still cameras is admirable and I expected lots of changes of frames, having read the artists they had made videos for. In the world of musical videos we find a lot of movement, but ""Little Miss Sunshine"" appreciates stillness; and it does justice to it. However, it doesn't appreciate silence so much.<br/><br/>The music is too weird and seems inappropriate sometimes, but I guess that's one of those things only the filmmakers understand. This is just an analysis, but probably ""Little Miss Sunshine"" isn't great as a film, but many of its elements make it really good. Particularly the cast¬ÖI said that I had to watch this cast before I could say ""The Departed"" was the ensemble of the year. Now I watched it, and this one is better.<br/><br/>There are little moments for all the actors, and there are unexpected portrayals: you're not getting what you expect from Steve Carell; Toni Colette is great (watch her movements when she's not talking); Greg Kinnear moves, Alan Arkin gets the laughs, Paul Dano has a big future and I already talked about Abigail Breslin.<br/><br/>I guess that in the end, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a very nice film that doesn't pretend. It is simple but with complex characters and, like ""Sideways"", it made his mouth to mouth and critically praised road to the Academy Awards¬ÖBut is it the Best Picture Oscar of the year?"

","It has probably one of the gayest titles for a movie ever conceived and the plot sounds boringly familiar ('The Simpsons' on a road trip) but I'm sure when this decade is out Little Miss Sunshine will be considered by many to be one of the classics of the noughties.<br/><br/>It follows the Hoovers, a family so dysfunctional none of them want to be on the same planet as each other, who decide nevertheless to travel across America in a mini-bus so little Olive (Abigail Breslin) can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. Mum Sheryl (Toni Collette) smokes like a chimney but remains in a total state of denial and Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker whose speeches are so unoriginal nobody who attends his seminars comes away inspired. Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell) is a gay Proust scholar who recently attempted suicide and is now being forced to stay in their sight. Bribed into going with them is Dwayne (Paul Dano), their sullen, alienated teenage son who's become fed up with everybody to the point where he has taken a vow of silence until he becomes an air force fighter pilot. And Richard's dad Edwin (Alan Arkin) was sent to move in with his son after being kicked out of his nursing home for snorting cocaine. Along the way, the six all learn to live with each other AND themselves, discovering that misery truly loves company.<br/><br/>This film is indeed a rare gem: a movie that will make you laugh AND smile, making you leave the theatre with a warm, fuzzy feeling. First-time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (a husband-and-wife team who made a name for themselves directing Red Hot Chili Peppers videos) have made a superbly restrained directorial debut, successfully weaving comedy and drama while obliterating obvious nods to ""dysfunctional family"" TV sitcoms and getting away with strangely welcomed sentimentality. Also, Michael Arndt has produced one of the freshest and most well-written screenplays in quite a while.<br/><br/>It also has one of the strongest acting ensembles of recent memory. Little Abigail Breslin gives a genuinely touching performance as the ugly duckling Olive who doesn't think she can win, Arkin matches her as the cantankerous grandfather who gives her someone to look up to other than her workaholic father, Carell (giving Robin Williams a run for his money) gets a great chance to show off his dramatic acting as the pushover Frank and he succeeds with flying colours and Kinnear and Collette are their ever-brilliant selves.<br/><br/>However, for me the real stand-out performer here is rising star Paul Dano (SPOILER COMING!). While the rest of the cast were just brilliant, Dano blows them all off the screen - although it is pretty obvious Dano is much older than his character, but then again that's a norm in Hollywood. This isn't just because as an 18-year-old guy I found Dwayne the character the easiest to identify with. Dwayne is admittedly the LEAST original character in the piece but Dano takes him far beyond the usual rebellious teenage son clich√©. Granted he has no dialogue for roughly the first the three quarters of the film would have made it twice as hard for him to portrays those emotions of pure, dormant teenage angst and alienation, a task that would have daunted me. Also a lesser actor of his age would have simply made the character explode (for an example of this see Justin Chatwin in 'War of the Worlds'), but Dano keeps Dwayne as a ticking time-bomb of fury ever ready to erupt (even in the scene when he snaps after learning from Frank that he's colour-blind and, as a result, won't be able to become a pilot Dano still gets away with it). This is truly is a star-making performance of the strongest kind, and if Paul doesn't earn a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for it I'll eat my words.

"Mxzplk","Null","0","4","16 October 2006"," A uncontrolled train: is what looks like the Hoover family in the comedy Little Miss Sunshine, an exception to the sameness of the independent cinema
","There isn't in Little Miss Sunshine no character that, with a variation here and there, hasn't frequented so many other American independent movies. Check in here the inefficacious father, the stressed mother, the rebelled son, the suicidal uncle, the grandfather that lost the reins - those abbreviated figures which the filmmakers of the genre had stipulated to express that something smells bad in the American dream. Or, more precisely, that it became a nightmare, and the personal and familiar misalignment is the only possible consequence for a society that as each day passes sees itself even more divided between ""winners"" and ""losers"", with the last not knowing how to transpose the abyss that separates them from the first. What is really surprising in this comedy is the way, however, that it transforms in strong points this elements that should be its weakness. Right from the start, a plate of resistance of the genre - the classic family dinner scene - demonstrates, first, that these typical roles were delivered to actors capable of making them exceptional; and, second, that the couple of directors formed by Jonathan Daylon and Valerie Paris have an uncommon sense of timing and detail. While the Hoovers swallow with lemon soda the fried chicken bought in a snack bar, their reunion at the table slowly takes the shape of a derailed train: the youngest daughter wants to know why the uncle tried to kill himself, and, in the discussion that forms about the most appropriated answer, it is almost possible to hear the noise of the iron of this derailed train twisting itself.<br/><br/>The girl, without wanting, continues in the function of pivot of discords. Interpreted by Abigail Breslin, of Signs, with no trace of prematurity, Olivia has craze for infantile beauty contests. Because of a desistance, she is called to compete in a match in California. The father (Greg Kinnear) that tries but doesn't manage to set up a self-help program of his creation, is at the eaves of the bankruptcy and doesn't have money to pay for aerial tickets. The mother (Toni Collete) refuses to leave behind her suicidal brother (Steve Carell), the son that has stopped talking for months (Paul Dano) or the vitiated in heroin and in pornography father-in-law (Alan Arkin), since it is obvious that none of the three is apt to give assistance to the other two. The solution is to travel all together in an old Kombi, crossing states under the heat and mutually annoying one another. The trip is extremely bad and the arrival to the destination, even worse: with her little belly, her homemade fantasy and the shameful choreography that the grandfather taught her, Olivia, so far star of only innocent regional events, contrasts in every possible manner with the spooky precocious prostitutes convoked for the national competition.<br/><br/>As is of custom, this choke has an instructive effect on the family. What isn't of custom, and even more instructive, is that the couple of directors does not attribute to the conflict divergence of values. Even so on the basis they seem to be divided between the superficial, the incredules and the resigned, the Hoovers have much more cohesion then what it is assumed, and what disaggregates them is so only the fact of reacting to the situation in different ways (even so unanimously desperate), their accelerated sideslip in route to poverty and what they imagine that is then the end of all and any perspective of future. (The clue to this, by the way, is in their last name, an ironic tribute to Herbert Hoover, American president during the Great Depression of the 30's.) What Little Miss Sunshine wants, however, is not to relativize the impact of financial ruin on a family. It is only to remember that much of what haunts the Americans today is fruit of their own imagination."
"bummaster2","5","0","7","9 September 2006"," Surprisingly okay
","Since this is an independent film, I knew I was not going to get a B-Rated Hollywood flick. I was expecting some witty dialouge and an okay storyline and I got it! Boy did I have some high expectations though, what was funny was that I got to see Steve Carell be serious! But once again it was sarcasm, which he can serve anybody that tries to be funny.<br/><br/>Some of the characters that were written in this film, were pretty realistic. I mean that you got the hard working mom, the over achiever dad, the grampa that is tired of life, the depressed uncle(carell), the stupid emo ""I hate everybody"" son, and the cute daughter who has a dream of being a beauty queen. It's a pretty messed up family and with the way it was written, I liked the fact everything went downhill for them. It's the American family!<br/><br/>I found that this film got saved in the end with a bang. Check it out."
"ptomblin","Null","0","2","4 September 2006"," A couple of geekly points
","I noticed two little points that would only be noticed by another VW-owning airplane geek like myself: - Dwayne was crazy about going into the Air Force, but the poster on his wall was for a Navy plane, the F/A-18 Hornet. When I was that age I was Air Force crazy, I'd only have Air Force planes on my wall.<br/><br/><ul><li>For dramatic effect, they conflated two failures that could happen to VWs. The first happened to my 1972 Super Beetle - the starter motor failed, and you either had to park on a hill, or push it, jump in and throw it into gear to start it. I drove a whole summer like that. The second happened to my brother's 1967 Van - the clutch failed. You could slip it between gears if you matched the speeds right, but you couldn't get it into first when it was moving. So you'd have to stop it, put it into first, and then lurch off from a stop on the starter motor. You couldn't do that for many weeks before it would kill your starter motor as well, and then you'd really be in trouble.</li></ul>"
"lavidavegan","10","0","3","30 August 2006"," Great.
","Little Miss Sunshine is the best movie I've ever seen. Ever. It completely exemplifies this sort of phenomena I've seen in American youth. Often there's a mentality among the average (average income, average appearance, average weight, average intelligence, average relationship with their family) that are in distress. Why? Because they don't have to work for anything. Everything is in front of them...and without a struggle they have no purpose. Without a struggle they can't understand pain or sadness...so they make their own. ""I wish I didn't have everything I wanted. Except when I wish I did."" It's a weird mentality. Among this, the movie is touching in other ways. It's, of course, about a misfit family coming together despite their many flaws. I laughed...I cried....I loved it."
"imxo","8","0","6","20 August 2006"," A Good Movie That Could Have Been A Great Movie
","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a movie that gave me a lot of laughs, especially at the beginning of the film, but the laughs slowly but surely became fewer and fewer as the movie progressed. I've decided to blame this on Alan Arkin - because his part wasn't big enough! His scatological grandfather role was the brightest spot in the whole film.<br/><br/>The whole cast was very good, but as good an actor as Greg Kinnear is, he seems to be type-cast as an irritating schlemiel with a victim mentality whom you'd just love to throttle. Greg's characters always have ""Kick Me"" taped to the backs of their shirts, and if you've seen him with Jack Nicholson in ""As Good As It Gets"" or with Pierce Brosnan in ""The Matador"" you'll know what I mean. Tony Collette was excellent as Kinnear's harried wife. She's so real I could swear I've actually seen her character on the street.<br/><br/>The writing was really one of the highlights of the film; after all, if there were no the humor in the writing there'd be no funny lines to deliver. Paul Dano was fine as the family's anguished teenage son, but the humor in his character really comes from the mouths of the writers.<br/><br/>Despite the raves you'll read on this web site - and the huge line of folks waiting to get into the theater - the film seemed to lose steam as it went along, with pathos supplanting much of the humor. By 2/3 of the way through the movie the star of the film seemed to be the VW bus the family was traveling in. So, good writing and a lot of laughs; but ultimately the film is missing something - not enough Alan Arkin."
"roland-104","8","0","3","18 August 2006"," Fresh, zany comedy about a dysfunctional family on a road trip
","Here's a comedic road movie featuring a stereotypical dysfunctional family that is very funny. The predicaments these people find themselves in, and the solutions they come up with, are blatantly far fetched, and the characters are all amusing caricatures of people we've known. There's the sullen teenage son who refuses to speak (Paul Dano, who was so effective in ""L.I.E.""); the grandfather, a sex obsessed old man who snorts heroin (Alan Arkin); the sensible, long-suffering Mom (Toni Collette, whose acting range keeps on expanding); her suicidal brother (Steve Carell, who played the ""40 Year Old Virgin""); the Dad (Greg Kinnear), a failed motivational speaker whose rhetoric about winning and success is at deliciously ironic odds with his own ineptitude. And there is Olive (Abigail Breslin), the plain, plump yet altogether winsome younger daughter, who longs to enter the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" kids beauty pageant.<br/><br/>The family's journey to the contest, from Arizona to Redondo Beach, forms the main scaffolding on which this wonderfully silly farce is hung. This is the debut feature for the co-directors, whose previous collaborations were on music videos and a six minute short comedy. Here they show considerable skill in evoking uniformly good performances from their acting ensemble. ""Sunshine"" comes as a welcome breath of fresh air in the dog days of summer. My grade: 7.5/10 B+ (seen on 08/11/06)"
"ferguson-6","8","0","3","13 August 2006"," Super Freak
","Greetings again from the darkness. For some reason I have anticipated this one since the first trailer. Funny, charming and heartfelt, it is written by Michael Arndt with amazing depth. As bizarre as the characters are, we never once doubt that they are a family and belong together.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are excellent as Olive's parents and Alan Arkin is electric as the grandpa who teaches Olive ""the moves"" for her big dance. Steve Carell (""The Office"" and ""The Forty Year Old Virgin"") is perfectly creepy as the uncle/brother who is thrust into this community after his failed suicide attempt. His explanation of that at the dinner table is sharply written and brilliantly delivered. Paul Dano (""Taking Lives"" and ""The Emperor's Club"") would steal most movies with his performance. He perfectly captures the tortured soul of most teenage boys. The reason he doesn't walk away with the film is Abigail Breslin who plays Olive. Most remember her aluminum foil headgear in ""Signs"", and here she is simply magnificent as the ever-optimistic girl who is so looking forward to the pageant.<br/><br/>There is a line in the film about life being a series of never ending beauty pageants. Sadly there is a great deal of truth in that. Watching this family travel together and grow together is painful and rewarding; however, trust me when I say it will not motivate you to buy a VW van and travel cross-country with your family! One of the better films of the year so far, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is what happens on film when a wonderful script and talented cast come together. It's not about the special effects, it's about real people and real life."
