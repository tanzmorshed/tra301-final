","I dislike Tom Cruise in general, so I was reluctant to see this movie. I was so worried it would be another asinine Misson Impossible movie. I'm so glad my wife pushed me to see it, as it was terrific. None of the super slo-mo CGI Matrix-type bullsh*t, just a Dirty Harry style movie with a great story and great bad guys and great fights. I don't believe there is any CGI in this movie at all! Amazing! Very old school, very surprising, very well done. I loved it and haven't seen a movie of this type that I enjoyed in a long, long time. I loved the way it ended... Fairly easy to see through the plot and figure out what is going on, but still very enjoyable. This is a MUST see for anyone who loved the Dirty Harry movies, or ones similar. Minimal fluff, no stupid romance, a believable plot and a good car chase. And bad guys killed the way they should be. Fantastic!"
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","199","241","4 May 2013"," Jack Reacher is an entertaining throwback
","There was a time—let's call it ""The 80s""—when action movies didn't need CGI cheats, shaky-cam and ADD-editing to entertain us. They also didn't have to destroy ten city blocks, have a ""clever"" hook or feel the need to tack on a social message to justify their carnage. No, all they needed was a reason for some good old steak and potatoes action and a star to anchor it all. 2012's Jack Reacher has these qualities in spades.<br/><br/>Maybe this won't appeal to the eGeneration who need to have their senses constantly bombarded, but for the rest of us, Jack Reacher is a solid bit of retro-refreshment."

","First of all i would like to ask how any of the other reviewers could possibly give this film 1 out of 10? They must have some deep rooted personal reasons for this i guess.<br/><br/>I nearly didn't watch this film for all of the negative reviews. I would have so missed out on something good.<br/><br/>The film was excellent! Great plot. Creepy bad guy and a reasonable amount of suspense. I have never read the Jack Reacher books, so cannot compare Cruise to the title character. I imagine that some people might have been disappointed at the lack of huge explosions and transforming robots etc etc, but this was a fine old school action thriller with many new tricks which i haven't seen before (check the buss stop scene. Classic!). I loved the pacing and the great interaction between players. Sure, some of the one liners seemed a tad forced, but they were not so common. Well done Cruise again.<br/><br/>Do yourselves a favour. Ignore the negative reviewers and give this a go."
"Jack_LesCamela","8","460","621","12 December 2012"," JACK REACHER: Action movie-making done right!
","Saw JACK REACHER on Monday night at an advance screening. Here's some of my thoughts. There are no spoilers.<br/><br/>First off, I'd say I agree with the general critical reception: 4/5 stars. To me that means it's a solid movie that delivers at the high end of its genre. JACK REACHER isn't trying to be anything revolutionary, it's more the kind of action thriller audiences haven't seen for a while.<br/><br/>This isn't MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or even James Bond. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie takes his inspiration from action movies of the late 60s/early 70s like DIRTY HARRY (which has been name checked in a couple reviews already), BULLITT (for the car chase); and maybe another Don Siegel movie, CHARLEY VARRICK. The excitement here doesn't come from over the top stunts or huge explosions. Like the action movies just referenced, you thrill to watching a strongly defined protagonist outsmart, outfight and outmaneuver the bad guys.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the character of Jack Reacher and the casting of Tom Cruise. In the series of novels by Lee Child this movie is based on, Jack Reacher is an ex-MP detective. After a lifetime spent on military bases overseas, he lives as a drifter in the United States who adheres to a life of zero commitments: No house, no job, no car, no possessions, no family. Oh, and he stands 6'5"" and weighs 250 lbs.<br/><br/>Clearly Tom Cruise doesn't match that physical description. What makes Reacher such a great character in Child's books though has far less to do with his exterior than it does with his intellect. If you've read the series as I have, it's a little strange at first. As the film played out however, I got more relaxed and more into it. This was definitely a movie about Lee Child's hero Jack Reacher, physical differences be damned.<br/><br/>Would I have preferred an unknown actor closer to Child's description to play Reacher on screen? Yes, of course. But I could say that about virtually any character, and often do. I generally want unknowns for everything.<br/><br/>Which is where Cruise's casting comes in handy a bit. Because his casting sort of guarantees a certain amount of box office, it means the filmmakers can take more chances. Like crafting an action movie that's longer on character and occasional brutal violence and short on mindless action and impossible nonsense.<br/><br/>JACK REACHER was a very satisfying action thriller for me. I felt it captured what I love about Lee Child's thrillers and Jack Reacher in particular. I'd definitely recommend it, and I'm going to see it in the theater again. That's for damn sure."
"Bruce722","9","93","123","11 May 2013"," Great film.
","Jack Reacher was a surprisingly fantastic film. I went in thinking, thanks to some slightly misleading trailers, that this was going to be a high octane action movie with a bunch of gun fights, car chases, and explosions but little development and quality. I was completely wrong. While there were a few gun fights, one car chase, and an explosion of sorts, it was done in a completely different manner and was more of an action thriller. Tom Cruise did a great job in his typical role. The rest of the supporting cast was solid enough and the cameo by Robert Duvall was awesome. The plot developed really well and made it more of a ""thinking movie"" than I anticipated. That being said, the turns in the plot kept the film from becoming stagnant or boring and the action sequences felt real and authentic. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the cinematic elements and there were some flaws in one of the plot twists but nothing that really hurt the movie-watching experience. All-in-all, I'd say this was a great movie that most people would very much enjoy watching."
"EmmaDinkins","8","162","255","21 December 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: Reacher is the Man!
","Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is the tale of a very astute ex-military policeman. The army training came in quite handy as he digs into the evidence of a heinous crime that turns out to be not at all what it seems to be on the surface. I was surprised at how funny the dialogue in this film was, it is definitely not a comedy, but the sarcastic and comedic one-liners kept coming, even in situations that were completely devoid of a humorous setting there was some very amusing conversation. There was even a scene in which Reacher is attacked in a bathroom that had me cracking up at the bumbling bad guys. The comedy was heightened even further with the old codger Cash (Robert Duvall). Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance, same here. As with any film that features Mr. Cruise the expectation is that it will be fast paced and very entertaining, same here. The only thing missing was his trademark sprint to or after something or anything. I've just come to expect to see him running, really running but we are getting older. The trailer is the only kind that I like, the ones that do not give away the whole movie. It shows that Reacher is bad a$$ without playing out every aspect of the story. David Oyelowo (Emerson) is one to watch, he is building an impressive resume and it is easy to see why because whenever he portrays a character he is that character. When he played a pilot in Red Tails, I totally believed he could fly a plane. When he was the head of a company experimenting on Apes, I was again thoroughly convinced and I believed every aspect of his being a police detective. One of the best car chase scenes that I've seen lately was in this film. There were so many attributes of this film that I liked, including the sexual tension between Reacher and Helen Ronin (Rosamund Pike) that I will just sum it up by saying. Everything just seemed to be genuine and authentic, even though I know that the fights are staged they looked logistically correct, but Steven Segal did come to mind. I liked that the film had a legitimate beginning and end, even if there are subsequent Jack Reacher tales to follow, there was no gaping wide open door of a final scene leaving the audience wondering 'What's up with that?!?'. But I do hope there are sequels, at least one. I give it a green light"

","5 people are shot dead and incontrovertible evidence leads the police to immediately pick up sniper James Barr, who simply asks for Jack Reacher. Reacher, an ex-army policeman of shadowy background, tells defence attorney Helen Rodin (who appears to have taken the case simply to spite her District Attorney father) that he believes Barr to be guilty because he got away with something similar while he was in the middle east. But he starts investigating anyway.<br/><br/>Based on what I have read in the press, I find Tom Cruise the man to be an odd individual. But as a performer, there is a reason why he has been at the top of the pile for a long time - he makes good films, and he is good in them. Jack Reacher is one of his best.<br/><br/>It is a very good part for Cruise - a macho protagonist, well able to handle himself, but not infallible. The story is strong, if a little familiar. The script is good fun, the action is handled well, Rosamund Pike provides solid support, and Robert Duvall, in a part which is little more than a cameo, is wonderful.<br/><br/>But this is Cruise's film, and it is one of the best action thrillers in recent years."
"dgefroh","8","96","150","20 April 2013"," Jack Reacher....... just good fun
","Having never read any Lee Childs novels regarding Jack Reacher, I went into this one with somewhat limited knowledge on who Jack Reacher is and what his claim to fame is. So like many, I read where the ""serious"" fans were disappointed that Tom Cruise was picked to portray this iconic hero. To them I say, so what, did you watch this movie? In truth Tom Cruise is very good in this role, the movie is fast paced and action packed, the writing is cleaver and spot on, so to those who would continue to pan this movie I say lighten up and relax. This was a very good movie, Tom Cruise was good in the lead role, the several one-liners were very cleaver and kept a sense of humor in a plot with plenty of violence and too close for comfort realism. This movie was good, it was entertaining, well acted, and should be viewed and enjoyed by all who watch it."
"bob-rutzel-1","8","56","85","9 May 2013"," Good Thriller with a Good Mystery
","James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former military sniper, is in jail for killing 5-people and says he is innocent. He asks for ex-Army MP Officer, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). But Reacher knew Barr in Iraq and is out to prove him guilty. Hmmmshould be a slam dunk.<br/><br/>It's not often that we get a good thriller along with a good mystery as well, but that is what we have here. Why would Barr ask for Jack Reacher if Reacher knew what Barr did in Iraq? Also, what was the purpose of Barr killing 5-people who had no connection to each other? Assistant DA Helen (Rosamund Pike) asks Reacher to help prevent Barr from getting the death penalty. But, we also had some good fight scenes and an exciting car chase. Let the games begin. <br/><br/>This gets somewhat talky in the beginning as Helen and Reacher analyze what had happened. But, we hang on every word because we, too, need to know things. All this sounded like the dialogue was dubbed in, but I think the microphones were just too close to the characters and this made it seem as if the dialogue was dubbed in. To be honest it did look like Rosamund Pike had weak knees around Tom Cruise, but the script wouldn't go here. It just looked that way to me. <br/><br/>The supporting cast of bad guys was good as was Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo), assigned to the Barr case. Robert Duvall comes in as a retired USMC Gunnery Sgt, Gunny Cash, who does a masterful job as the owner of a gun range and inserts some humor as he deals with Reacher. <br/><br/>Over all this was very good. But, I did have the feeling something was missing. Maybe it needed a better ending as this one was kind of weak for such a good story. <br/><br/>Maybe Tom Cruise is leaving his Mission Impossible movies behind and is now centering on another action hero: Jack Reacher, who is described as someone who seems to only wear the clothes on his back, doesn't care about the law and is only concerned with one thing: justice, and the way he goes about achieving it may shock you. Hey, Lee Child, the author of the Jack Reacher series wrote about 15-books. See? (8/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much"

","After putting off watching this film as I usually don't enjoy Tom Cruise I was pleasantly surprised. The film has a good twisting plot and Jack Reacher is a mix between James Bond and John McLane from Die Hard. There are some memorable characters and the film draws you in and makes you think. The plot is easy to follow but complex enough to keep you interested without giving you brain ache. In short I liked Jack Reacher and look forward to more films with Jack. <br/><br/>The plot has plenty of fast action scenes which are thankfully not too over the top and keep the pace of the film going. The ending was also well thought out despite the slightly cheesy last few lines. But they do leave the character ready for follow up films."
"sanddragon939","10","179","331","29 December 2012"," Introducing a new icon of the action genre...
","I'd never read any of the Lee Child 'Jack Reacher' novels so I went in with no particular expectations about the portrayal of this character. But this film can certainly live up to ANY expectations thriller fans might have had of it, in my opinion!<br/><br/>Having seen Tom Cruise as the flamboyant, charming and somewhat Boy Scout-ish Ethan Hunt in the past, its refreshing to see him as someone almost as ruthless and taciturn as Jason Bourne or Daniel Craig's rendition of James Bond. Jack Reacher's appeal doesn't lie in the fact that he's a 'larger than life' figure, or the world's biggest bada##...it lies in the fact that he's a normal, perfectly relatable and very realistic human being, albeit a trained and skilled soldier and detective.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike does a great job as the lawyer, Helen-a far cry from glamorous 'Bond girls' (one of whom Pike herself has portrayed), and Lara Croft styled action heroines who normally populate the action film genre. Instead she's a three dimensional character with her own doubts, anxieties, convictions and flaws.<br/><br/>One of the great things about this movie is how, without wavering from its narrative, it does highlight several significant real-world issues; ranging from the political debates over gun control, to legal representation for terrorists, to the politics surrounding the actions of military personnel overseas, to the corrupt political-industrial nexus...without necessarily taking sides or trying to come across as being preachy of moralistic.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Jack Reacher is virtually a 'slice of life' piece...albeit, a very dark and grimy slice of life."
"Tehmeh","8","14","20","16 September 2013"," Jack Reacher and the art of borrowing cars
","I know nothing about the books, so this review is based on the movie alone.<br/><br/>I liked it more than I thought I would. This is not so much an action film as it is a thriller and a detective story. There certainly is action, but it's not the core of this movie. There's a little conspiracy, some character development when needed, and of course the inevitable ""good vs. bad"" - confrontation in an expected manner. All of the main elements work quite well. Not exceptionally well, but well enough to keep the film interesting, intact and effective.<br/><br/>I felt like I was watching a mixture of Dirty Harry, Bourne and Taken, possibly with a little Lethal Weapon thrown into the mix. And again, I'm not talking about the amount of action, just the overall feeling of resemblance I got. So it didn't feel too original, but three things worked so well that ""Jack Reacher"" isn't just a mediocre movie: <br/><br/>1) Christopher McQuarrie knows how to put a story on the screen (as we know from ""Usual suspects""). He knows when to further the storyline, he knows when to give us a little breather. The story is coherent and moves along nicely. Just when you think you need an action scene, you get it. You get some unexpected humor and nice details every once in a while, and everything just seems to have its rightful place. This movie isn't deep and the script is not overly brilliant, but it's handled very effectively and that is something I've grown to like, because the opposite happens way too often in movies. Thumbs up to McQuarrie.<br/><br/>2) This movie is wonderfully shot. Cinematography is very good and pleasing to the eye at all times, and on top of that the action is shot very, very well. It wasn't long ago when I watched ""Bourne supremacy"" again, and I absolutely hated the unnecessarily shaky camera. ""Jack Reacher"" handles action perfectly. You can feel the chaos and the urgency in some scenes, yet you're always aware of what's happening. This is the way I wan't to see action scenes shot, be it a fight scene or a car chase (we get both, and they're very good). <br/><br/>I would also like to compliment the satisfying violence. It does what it's supposed to do and looks/feels mean enough in a movie that warrants it. Of course I would've wanted an R-rated cut, but I'm fairly pleased how things were handled.<br/><br/>3) Tom Cruise. I can't help it. I absolutely love his work. He's just got that certain presence. When he stares, when he talks, when he throws a punch, delivers some comic relief or pulls off some nice stuntwork - I'm usually sold. He's not especially impressive in this movie, but him just being a professional himself is enough, he carries this film when it needs it. I can nowadays keep my opinions of his ""religion"" at bay when I'm watching a movie. I even tried hating him at some point for some juvenile reason, but every time I saw one of his better films (Last Samurai, Oblivion), I was just thoroughly sold and entertained.<br/><br/>Acting isn't crap otherwise either. Werner Herzog is always a fun guy to watch, and Jai Courtney is decent (still not seeing Die Hard 5 though). David Oyelowo is interesting, Alexia Fast not too bad at all. Joseph Sikora has only a minor role but delivers a strong performance, especially in the end. Robert Duvall, nice seeing you too! I liked how almost every character was simplistic, in a good way. No overly complicated motivations, just the good old basics. Honorary mention goes to James Martin Kelly who plays a grieving father. <br/><br/>Rosamund Pike's character left something to be desired. She is an important piece of the movie, and sometimes I got the feeling that either the director wasn't really sure what to do with her or she just couldn't nail it. Sometimes she's smart, sometimes a little clueless, sometimes emotional and sometimes professional. I didn't get a good grip on her. I enjoyed her though, especially in scenes shared by her and Cruise. Also, it might be that she was the least simplistic character in this film and stood out in a weird way because of that.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed watching this movie. It felt like it took a lot of good things (while leaving bad things alone) from 70's, 80's and 90's action thrillers and made them modern again. There's also some fooling around with certain movie clichés in a funny way. Not a masterpiece (with an R-rating, a little more gripping story and a little more developed characters, this could've been a modern classic for me) but certainly a welcome, good old-fashioned thriller with some action and humor on the side. <br/><br/>Now, excuse me while I put on my leather jacket, borrow somebody's car and go tell some woman how to do her job."

","Jack Reacher is based on Lee Child's book ""One Shot"". For those who've read it, you already know Tom Cruise isn't right for the role. One would wish they could've gotten a bigger and taller actor to play the role like Hugh Jackman, or Chris Evans, or someone else. It could have been a new iconic appearance for a hero. The real problem is it seems Tom Cruise is just redoing his generic action hero performance. As much as he refuses to call himself a hero, he still looks like one but in a much glossier way. In spite of that, the film itself is a snazzy piece of entertainment that is rare in cinema these days. A neo-noir styled action blockbuster that will grip you by its storytelling and its action scenes. There's a chance that could have made this a much better film but put aside those complains, it's still pretty awesome.<br/><br/>The film begins with a man shooting five random innocent people. It effectively builds tension by being silent. The rest of the movie is as slick as the opening and it serves a great entertainment. The only disappointment is Tom Cruise. He may not have the appearance of the character but he could have done a lot more than just doing his typical action hero swagger. He sure has charisma but that's all. His fans might still think he's pretty cool for it. I'm not a fan of comparing a book to its film adaptation. I never cared if a single plot point or character was changed, but the Jack Reacher character is the real deal here. It seems this film is only made for Cruise to get him back in action. Well this character is not for him.<br/><br/>The film is still solidly made. At least it doesn't go to the modern generic action movie direction that is relentlessly loud but sticks to the neo-noir storytelling. The best parts is when it spends time in scrutinizing the case in silence. When the film starts talking, the dialogue is witty and interests the story's investigation. It gets exciting when it goes to the action. The action scenes are well shot. The hand-to-hand combat fight scenes reminiscence the cool eighties action with some humorous camp. The car chase is the most impressive sequence where it shows several angles as they drive away without shaking the camera. It has the potential of a classic throwback.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is quite entertaining but again they should have gotten the right actor to play the lead. Jack Reacher here is nothing more than another Tom Cruise character with a leather jacket and do what this old man usually do. The only good thing is it's not bad. It's a decent kind of action thriller that isn't famous in mainstream cinema anymore, but yet is enjoyable. It's not entirely an action film though, but people might think it is. It leaves having a smart mystery in spite of fact it lacks the anti-hero. It's fun and worth watching but there are things that could have made this a lot more interesting."

","This movie is a now-familiar exercise in Tom Cruise's narcissism. Every female in the movie, even an elderly woman, flirts with Cruise's character. His role is that of a cliché'd, ""man with no name"" hero who breaks all the rules.<br/><br/>I suppose this movie will suffice as a time killer. It's really just the same old, ""resolved-in-two hours"", recycled plot which we are all very familiar with by now, if not completely tired of. The pretty girl is kidnapped and Cruise has to rescue her. He magically avoids bullets.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has no range as an actor. He plays the same stern character in every film. His schtick is getting old.<br/><br/>There's a hilarious scene where Rosamund Pike flashes her cleavage directly at us. I really wonder if they spliced that in to wake up the audience."
"jtindahouse","5","180","344","4 January 2013"," A real let down for fans
","'One Shot' is my favourite book. Not my favourite Jack Reacher book. My favourite book. So when I heard they were not only going to be making a Reacher film, but making 'One Shot', I was ecstatic. Then I heard who would be playing Reacher and like 99.9% of fans I thought to myself, ""this must be an April Fool's joke. A 5'7"" skinny guy playing the hulking 250 pound, 6'5"" Jack Reacher? This can't be happening."" Sadly it was. And then the trailer came out and my worst fears were confirmed. Cruise was not being buffed up by any type of body suit, he wasn't being made to look taller with trick photography and he wasn't putting on the raspy 'animal-like' voice I always imagined Reacher to have.<br/><br/>Lee Child once made a great analogy to Jack Reacher. He said ""does anyone remember the story lines in the Dirty Harry Movies? Not a chance. But they sure as hell remember the character."" The Reacher books are about a single thing, and that is Jack Reacher. Don't get me the wrong, the stories in 90% of the books released so far are masterpieces and could easily be made into great films. But they still remain a vehicle for which Jack Reacher can thrive in. And the producers proved that they realised this (albeit very late in the piece) by renaming the movie 'Jack Reacher'. A little in-your-face for my liking, but I could see why it was necessary so I didn't hold it against them. However I did reserve my right to hold Tom Cruise's casting against them. And I was right to. Did Tom Cruise pull off the great character of Jack Reacher? Not in your life.<br/><br/>Cruise was cast badly, and then went on to play the role even worse. Not a great combination if you're an actor. Heath Ledger took the opposite route in his role as The Joker in Christopher Nolan's 2008 masterpiece ""The Dark Knight"". He was hugely criticised for being completely wrong for the part when he was cast and we all know how that turned out. Cruise unfortunately did not rise to the challenge in the same way.<br/><br/>For starters, I'm reasonably confident he was the shortest person in the film. Not one effort was made to make him look the least bit impressive stature wise. His haircut was ridiculous. He looked like a guy who goes to the hair salon twice a week for touch-ups. In fact Jai Courtney in the role of the Charlie had what I always imagined to be the perfect haircut for Reacher. Perhaps he would've been better placed in the role? Cruise's shoulders were not broad enough. At one stage a character asks ""I'm looking for a guy who could kill a man with one punch?"" To which he is directed straight to Reacher. Get real. Rosamund Pike was probably more likely to kill someone that way than Cruise. Cruise did not alter his voice one bit for the movie. This was a huge disappointment for me. I had really hoped he would do something like what Christian Bale did when he was in the Batman suit, only not quite to the same degree, but for the whole movie. Cruise sounded almost feminine performing some of the lines. Lastly, he kept bloody smiling (or smirking, whatever you want to call it). I was OK with him cracking the odd joke here and there, because Reacher can be a bit of a smart-ass, but he didn't have to look so damn proud of himself every time he did it. Reacher's an animal, 24-7, he (very) rarely smiles and he takes life very seriously.<br/><br/>The script was solid, it stayed pretty faithful to the book. I found the jokes and one-liners a little too frequent for my liking and took away from what should have been a dark atmosphere. Unfortunately, Reacher was never really challenged physically. Sure, everyone he fought was bigger than him, but that's only because Cruise is so short. Never once did I think to myself 'how's Reacher possibly going to take down this guy?"" Which always makes for the best fight scenes. One part of the script I did not like at all, again regarding the 'bad guys', was when two of them, whilst trying to attack Reacher, were practically fighting each other even harder. And just because they wanted to get through the door first? I felt like I was watching 'Home Alone' or something. I assume they were going for comedic value but it just went far too far for my liking.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were solid at best, in fact I found Rosamund Pike well below average in her performance, but I wasn't too bothered by this because they were the epitome of a support cast. They weren't who people came to see. People came to see Cruise and he let them down. The interesting thing is that the movie isn't being panned across the board, which is testament to how good the story is. It's a great story and could easily have been done without Reacher, which is basically what has happened for people who haven't read the books. They don't have those to compare the character to and so they leave the theater quite happily. And that's great for them. But for the rest of us they have ruined a great character. I hope when I read future books I can still picture the character the same way I always have. Sadly, I fear I may struggle."

There is a scene when Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is in his hotel room with Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) and she asks him to put his shirt on, but he says he only has one. Several minutes later he says it's late and they should get some sleep, Helen mistaken thinks that he is suggesting they sleep together and then realizes her mistake. The whole interaction is very funny but delivered in a straight faced manner, at least on the part of Jack Reacher. Many of Jack Reacher's other encounters throughout the movie are along the same lines as this. The uncomfortable interactions between Reacher and Sandy, played by Alexia Fast, are particularly amusing as all he wants is information and she keeps offering herself to him. After Sandy is killed and Helen is kidnapped the comic relief is done.<br/><br/>All this talk about comic relief by no means refers to the first ten minutes of the movie. A sniper sets up across the river from PNC Park in Pittsburgh and kills six people. The act is believed to be done by James Barr, played by Joseph Sikora, a former Army Sniper. He is arrested and in interrogation he writes one thing... Find Jack Reacher! When Reacher arrives in Pittsburgh Barr has been beaten to the point of being in a coma.<br/><br/>That is all I will say about this movie as far as the plot. I give this a vote of 9 out of 10. Tom Cruise should think of making the other Jack Reacher books into movies."
"judgehte","3","111","213","22 December 2012"," A Disappointment
","For someone like me who has read all of the Jack Reacher books, the film was a real disappointment. Tom Cruise simply is not Jack Reacher -- not close. He doesn't look the role, nor does he have the manner. Cruise does his usual Mission Impossible macho stuff - car chases, big fights, killing, etc. But there is no nuance in his performance. I was also sorry that this book was chosen for the first Jack Reacher film. It is a terrible choice. The film is bleak, excessively violent, and almost inhuman, which is not the way the Jack Reacher books read. The Reacher books are violent, yes, but with some sensitivity, comic asides, and romance. This film has none of this."
"mark-2096","3","24","40","26 April 2013"," Not half as good as some would say
","When first looking at other reviews they seem to be either 9 out of 10's or 1 out of 10's - but after going through a couple of pages you then get the more realistic 3 or 4 out of 10 scores, which personally I would agree with.<br/><br/>There is no way in this world that this movie is an 8, 9 or 10, but at the same time 1 or 2 is a tad unfair.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very disappointed, I like Tom Cruise and I rarely think he does a bad movie. He's a good actor, although the roles he normally takes don't really show how good an actor he can be. Obviously, he is generally an action star and a big pull at the box office and that can be the only way this movie has exceeded its budget (albeit not by much) because it can't be because of his performance, the script or the film itself.<br/><br/>There has been much talk about the poor choice of actor to play Jack Reacher based on look and size. I haven't read any of the books so in a way I couldn't care, but it is a shame it has been commented on so much, as you straight away realise he wasn't right for the role. It's strange how he can be so convincing as Ethan Hawke, but so unconvincing as Jack Reacher (apart from the obvious size thing) - two very different characters, but still action guys nevertheless.<br/><br/>Personally, Liam Neeson is the only big actor I can think of that would do the character justice, but perhaps having just done Taken and Taken 2 (and perhaps Unknown as well) it would be all a bit too similar.<br/><br/>That aside, the overall story is good (I imagine the books are respected), but the script is poor and the film just doesn't have a soul, you don't care or gel with any character. Cruise has a couple of cool lines and it's good to see Duvall in a film again, but other than that it's all quite poor. No amazing stunts to talk about, the fight scenes aren't great, either Cruise or Reacher can't drive and apart from Rosamund Pike the rest of the supporting cast don't bring anything to the party.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so, pretty much up until Jack Reacher is introduced and then it tailed off pretty quickly and the less said about the end the better.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very disappointed with this film, maybe my expectations were too high, but I've come to expect more from the main actor and although the director hasn't directed much in the past he wrote the screenplay for this and had previously done The Usual Suspects and Valkyrie, so I would have expected more from him as well. Let's hope they both do better on their next film - All You Need Is Kill Having relatively recently watched Skyfall, Taken 2, Haywire, Safe House, The Bourne Legacy and MI4, this is sadly very much at the bottom of that list. I'd probably put it on par with Cold Light Of Day or Abduction - although the latter was far more entertaining.<br/><br/>I've not written a review before on IMDb, but just had to when I saw all the high scores this film was getting!"

","I donno why the critics are cursing this movie , I'd love this one. Its really a good action movie. <br/><br/>It holds you up with the crime investigation like all the other crime movies does. Its done with a better action stuffs and Cruise justified it very well as he always does. Pike looks amazing with her role and look as well. It doesn't have lots of twists in the tale but the investigation itself turns as it flows. Flaws were less unless you are a movie maniac to find one.<br/><br/>I don't see any lagging or unwanted scenes. Everything just fits in so well. Each character are very much needed to the story line. <br/><br/>I love it, i bet you'd too.<br/><br/>Recommended for all action lovers. 8/10 for this one."

","I loved this movie. The movie is to the expectations (and much more) we have for Tom Cruise, as he had already set the bar by Mission Impossible series. He doesn't disappoint us, besides take us to the another level. <br/><br/>The character Jack Reacher is awesome, fantastic, it's huge. It can't be covered in just a movie. So, there should be a series of Jack Reacher movies, at least bless us with an another one. <br/><br/>At lots of points, Jack Reacher reminded me of Holmes. I'm a Tom Cruise' as well as Holmes' fan, so when both come in one packet, it's a treat. The methodological reasoning & deduction to the impossible shown behind the crime is very good. The character's military background, no baggage rule, no need of a pen, distance from women add grooming to the character. <br/><br/>When the movie is over, that's the time I hoped it just should go on and on and on. I'm not quenched with just one episode of jack reacher. That doesn't mean movie is incomplete. The movie is complete in itself. But, the thirst grows as it come to an end. Rosamund pike also does justice to the role. I as well like to see her in another episode. <br/><br/>Well, it is a top acted all in all a very good film. Just watch it & feel the thirst.."

","Those who do not bother to study history are doomed to repeat it. In the early 1980s the best-selling series in the US was called the Destroyer. It would ultimately spawn over 200 books in the series. A producer purchased the rights and actually launched the first movie spin off using the name of the central character, instead of simply picking a single book in the series as the title. The movie was called (not making this up) REMO WILLIAMS THE ADVENTURE BEGINS. The adventure ended suddenly. The movie was terrible. There were no more. Flash forward 30 years. The best selling series in America today is by Lee Child featuring the character Jack Reacher. Fading (and ageing) actor Tom Cruise purchases the rights and produces the film. Even though he looks nothing like the character in the book, as written, he casts himself in the title role. And names the film ""Jack Reacher."" The first hour of the film is painful to watch. It is all darkness and moodiness, showing none of the ""inner process"" that made the original Reacher so interesting. The second hour, although less painful, makes the Mission Impossible series look like The Matrix in comparison. Many words came to mind while watching this. Entertainment was not one of them. Those who do not bother to study history are doomed to repeat it."

","Don't see this movie, seriously it's awful. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies ever made. So here's the plot line: Guy gets framed for murder, star of the movie shows up and kills the people who really did it. That's it. There is no suspense whatsoever in this movie, every ""twist"" and ""turn"" can be seen 100 miles away, absolutely nothing unpredictable happens. The dialog is painfully cheesy and pre-adolescent. Aside from having a razor thin plot line, which is entirely spelled out in the first 10 minutes of the movie, the dialog is also painfully awful. About half of this movie seemed to be Tom Cruise having flashbacks of the killing (which he didn't commit or witness which makes it all the weirder). The scene where he gets hit in the back of the head with a baseball bat and barely falls down is hilarious, especially when the two attackers (armed with a crowbar and baseball bat) try to fit through the bathroom door at the same time and get stuck before being thwarted by the bathtub in their attempts to hit Tom Cruise (who's head stays above the top of the tub the entire time). Of course there was the obligatory car chase scene where the cops who were right behind him all of a sudden lose him completely just before the suddenly catch back up to him. Not to mention the hilarity of the part where he leaves his car in drive, steps out, and walks over to a group of onlookers and pretends to be one of them. Then there is the scene where he's driving carelessly backwards using only the rear-view camera to guide him while he reclines to avoid being shot, until one of the bad guys shoots out the camera and he immediately backs the car on top of a rock where he gets stuck (gee, I wonder who saw that coming). Then he must run around and hide behind rocks to avoid being shot. Interesting how they spent at least 30 minutes establishing that the sniper shooting at him is a super-duper-extra-excellent-A+ sniper who never-ever-not once in a million years misses, yet he can't seem to hit anything once he starts firing at Tom Cruise. This movie was so awful it made me want to see a different movie just to get the proverbial bad taste out of my mouth."

","I was on a private premiere, and didn't read the book. I liked the Usual Suspect and I kinda love the Tom, so I wasn't too skeptical but not too enthusiastic either... And what a surprise! I wanted to do this my first IMDb review because I genuinely enjoyed the movie a lot! It's a clever blend of thriller and an action movie. A bit cheesy sometimes but the plot is good, acting is just right and believable. And not unnecessary too long! Dialog are smooth, not too humorous or cliché, and some action scene are just so vivid! In a time where everything rely so much on CGI, I enjoy a realistic, ""old school"", approach of the kind! Well... Now I'm looking forward reading the books!"
"DICK STEEL","8","67","132","19 December 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Jack Reacher
","Jack Reacher is written to be quite the physical giant, so when Tom Cruise got interested in the character, many would not have fathomed that Cruise himself would take the role, although I felt it was probably one of the best ways to get author Lee Child's famous investigator onto the big screen by none other than one of the biggest stars Tinseltown has to offer. Written for the screen and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, Jack Reacher the film, based upon Child's book One Shot, is a solid investigative drama dealing with a sensitive issue of today with a sniper's seemingly random shooting, and you should know better than to trust the marketers on their treatment of this film.<br/><br/>With Drop The Lime's State Trooper track pulsating with the Camaro's engine roar, together with plenty of fisticuffs as thrown by Cruise's Reacher, one will be forgiven to think that this is an action film thanks to the trailer. Granted there are action set pieces, they are not the showcase of the movie. Instead it's quite old school in its treatment, dead serious yet punctuated with moments of wry wit, backed with a genuine whodunnit mystery. Like Cruise's other films in A Few Good Men and even The Firm, his protagonist must uncover the mystery to why he's being called by the accused, Barr (Joseph Sikora), whom everyone automatically thought he was a friend, and to carefully navigate through murky waters with yet to be revealed villains adamant in sending him back to the shadows where he came from, or to frame him up so that he's out of commission.<br/><br/>But the best in the business aren't known as the best for nothing. Reluctantly hired by Barr's defence attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) to become her investigator, we follow Jack Reacher as he conducts the ABCs of investigations - assuming nothing, believe nobody, and checking everything. No stone got left unturned as McQuarrie's screenplay gets you hook, line and sinker, drawn deep into trying to unravel the Why and the Who involved in this relatively complex piece of intrigue, and how it's pure bad luck that the antagonists have to grapple with Reacher's unique skillset, which almost bordered on a parody of Taken when he gets in conversation with the bad guys.<br/><br/>Reacher's modus operandi, and investigative skills and techniques would be what will draw the crowds hungry for this genre of film. It's an investigative drama through and through, with hypotheses and theories readily thrown up for deeper examination, which some may be quick to dismiss as convenience, but it's antagonist screw-up mostly. These naturally introduce us to the supporting cast who aid, or get in the way, of Reacher's investigations, and allows for the appearance of Robert Duvall, whose charisma in a bit role just chews up the scenery. It's the story here that's engaging, because there's zilch development character wise, where we don't get to see how Reacher develops into the tough guy he is, nor be bothered too much with it. Most times Tom Cruise just continued being Tom Cruise, which is inevitable because little is done to try and get him behind the Jack Reacher persona, but we're not complaining.<br/><br/>For those who find investigative dramas a little bit dry, there's no lack of action sequences that mattered, with a few that stood out, such as the very first time we see Reacher take on five thugs, in Spider-Man-ish style complete with very dark and wisecracks, before putting his military training and background to good use. It's no nonsense, and frankly quite methodical in his choice of martial arts, going for the jugular, or to inflict massive pain to demoralize opponents, than to waste time horsing around. Then of course there's the finale which mixed things up a lot to offer action fans a buffet of experiences, combining sniper with melee, firearms and martial arts, with some self-deprecating down-out-of-luck moments.<br/><br/>Despite having Rosamund Pike as the female lead, there's little romance thrown up in the story, unlike most other Hollywood films of such nature. Pike's presence as Helen the attorney felt nothing more than a little plot necessity in having to reach into Jack Reacher's thought process, and allow him someone with whom he can debate and bounce ideas off, versus having to talk to himself, or worse, for a movie, talk to nobody, or having a narration throughout. It's a pity her character served as pretty much the mouthpiece of the conspiracy, helping audiences piece stuff together in quite verbose terms when the need calls for it.<br/><br/>Still, I'm giving this a wholehearted recommendation, with the likes of Richard Jenkins, David Oyelowo and even director Wener Herzog himself lending star power to the film in a rare appearance as an actor. This may be the start of a promising franchise that Tom Cruise could be getting himself involved in, and it certainly does enough as a first film introduction to the famous Lee Child character, who will clearly garner more fans to pick up the books, compare the film and literary versions, and maybe devour the further adventures already available in print."
"Fields201","9","61","121","21 December 2012"," Reacher Rules
","I came into this movie for one thing and one thing only: entertain me. The movie did just that and I'm happy. Tom Cruise has an impressive resume. I'm not the biggest fan of his or anything but I cannot deny his incredible list of movies. Jack Reacher is one of those movies.<br/><br/>First, let me start out by saying that, in the near future when this movie reaches cable or TV and someone hasn't heard of Jack Reacher. Well, they will think this movie has no title because the title ""Jack Reacher"" is in the same lettering and font as the cast. With that being said, the movie starts off well. In fact, it was riveting because we see future son of John McClane (Jai Courtney) shooting down people with a sniper rifle. What makes it riveting is that we are seeing from the eye of a sniper and what exactly we are seeing from their eyes. Its really well done. Of course he shoots people and the police catch the wrong guy.<br/><br/>Enter Jack Reacher. We are given exposition that he is ghost and that you only find him when he finds you, that type of thing. Pretty soon Jack is investigating the framed sniper, and all sorts of people come out to get a piece of him but luckily Jack is one of those people with a ""particular set of skills"" and goes all Jason Bourne on them. The action scenes are awesome! I particularly love the car chase scene, you know, the one you saw in the commercial all the time when he's just blending in with the onlookers and the cops never think to check the people in the crowd. What disturbs me on that scene was the cops automatically finger point him for a crime. I just didn't get why they were chasing him in the first place. Did I miss something here or was this just an excuse for a cool action sequence? <br/><br/>While I'm on the negatives here, I just felt like Tom Cruise and that other lead girl he was with (the name escapes me) just felt like characters written on a page. True, I like some of the dialogue Cruise gives out, but I just can't help but seeing them as Hollywood stereotypes.<br/><br/>With that being said, the movie was awesome and I was never bored. It's the last movie I'm seeing this year. So looking forward to what they have in store for 2013!"
"mailtosurajk","3","6","8","16 January 2016"," Not worth watching
","Though the movie is based on Lee Child's novel ""One Shot"", it doesn't make justice to the novel. Several important characters are omitted that are omitted for the sake of brevity, and this makes the storyline jittery. The story loses the flow many times. Unwanted heroics have been added into the movie which doesn't exist in the novel. The Zec has been shown as a much weaker guy. And whoever chose those funny guys as his associates was perhaps blind or plain dumb; for me they all look like a set of clowns.<br/><br/>More than anything, the movie kills the surprise quotient by showing the face of the murderer! Honestly speaking, Tom Cruise doesn't look like the original Jack Reacher. If you're watching the movie after reading the novel, you may not like it. Further, if you're watching after reading all novels of Jack Reacher series, you'll definitely hate the movie!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Lee Child has written 17 Jack Reacher books since 1997, and it's a bit surprising that it took Hollywood this long to latch on to this enigmatic lone wolf drifter who doesn't so much care about laws as he does right and wrong. Fans of the books were outraged when it was announced Tom Cruise would play the 6'5 hulking Reacher, as much of the character's appeal stems from his ability to physically dominate a situation while using very few words.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can't ease the minds of those fans of the pulpy series, but rather to encourage them to give this a shot. Author Child was probably ecstatic when Mr. Cruise took an interest in the character, despite the obvious conflicts. Very few actors can command screen presence like Cruise, especially in action sequences. That's where this gets a bit dicey. This is not an action movie. It's an investigative mystery thriller that includes 3-4 action sequences.<br/><br/>The film has a real 1970's feel to it along the lines of Billy Jack or Walking Tall mixed with Dirty Harry or numerous westerns with strong, silent types. See, Reacher is a former military investigator with a mind that is always a step or two ahead of everyone else. He looks at the obvious evidence and immediately notes a list of doubts where none previously existed.<br/><br/>A seemingly random sniper attack is a bold way to begin a movie given recent real-life events, but the opening sequence is executed with methodical precision and daring so that we can quickly believe in Reacher's conspiracy theories. In the blink of an eye, Reacher has appeared out of nowhere (his usual address) and is in the middle of the investigation being conducted by the lawyer of the wrongly accused James Barr (Joseph Sikora). The defense lawyer is played by Rosamund Pike, whose character is the daughter of the District Attorney (Richard Jenkins). The police detective is played by David Oyelowo and it's easy to tell something isn't completely right with city hall.<br/><br/>Reacher roams the beautiful city of Pittsburgh asking questions and piecing together the puzzle left behind by creepy villain The Zec (Werner Herzog) and his henchman Charlie (Jai Courtney). We get three Reacher fistfights, a ""Bullit"" type car chase in a beautiful 1970 Chevelle, and some military sharp-shooting from the depths of a quarry. What we don't get is the Hollywood tradition of a Cruise sprint. Not once do we see his trademark all-out dash to or from something. In fact, he moves much like his Stacey Jaxx character from his recent musical Rock of Ages.<br/><br/>Director Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar, and my ever-lasting respect, for his ""The Usual Suspects"" screenplay. This story is infinitely less-complicated, but it does offer some fun moments thanks to the Reacher character. Maybe things would be a little better if a guy like Reacher really existed. Totally off the grid and taking down the bad guys that the cops can't quite catch. Sounds a bit like ""Dexter"", only Reacher's code includes doling out physical pain and then moving on to the next town ... with a new set of Goodwill duds and a fresh toothbrush.<br/><br/>Caleb Deschanel (Director of Photography) provides a really sharp look to the film and, thankfully, doesn't cheat on the action scenes. Herzog (a highly respected director) has a great look for a bad guy, but is painfully under-utilized here. Rosamund Pike may simply be my least favorite actress working today. Her limited range is cringe-worthy on multiple occasions and I was thankful that Reacher had no ""interest"" in her. Robert DuVall makes a colorful appearance as the late-arriving character that breaks open the case, and he seems to relish the reunion with his ""Days of Thunder"" co-star. The most interesting character to me was Jai Courtney, who will be seen next as Bruce Willis' son in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"".<br/><br/>If you haven't read the Lee Child books, you will probably readily accept Cruise as Reacher. If you are a fan of the franchise, your eyes and brain will have massive conflicts for the first hour, but then acceptance creeps in, and you'll probably agree that it's a simple, effective piece of entertainment ... far superior to most Nicolas Cage movies these days!

","Spoiler alert! If you are dying to see Jack Reacher DO NOT READ THIS. Having said that, this is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my life! It's definitely top three. I would never have believed that movies this bad were still being produced and released into theaters. In fact, I've seen tons of straight to internet things that are a thousand times better than this movie. Jack Reacher wins the award for worst writing in any movie ever in the history of the universe, bar none. My daughter and I actually started laughing so hard and trying to stifle it so as not to irritate anyone else in the theater that I had a coughing spell and had to go outside to recover. Actual dialogue from movie: ""I will drink your blood from my boot"" and ""I'm a homeless drifter! I have nothing to lose!"" Full disclosure – my daughter and I both LOVE action movies! In fact we prefer them to almost anything else. And we definitely do not expect Shakespearean dialogue in such movies. As a rule, dialogue should be minimal and action should be plentiful. This movie was just abysmally bad! And I think part of the reason was they seemed to reverse that formula – way too much dialogue, all of which sucked, and just a little bit of action. The acting was also laughably horrible. The acting talent of the main female in the movie apparently consisted of wearing the same low cut tank top with different sweaters, opening her eyes really wide and not grasping any of the plot points of the movie until Tom Cruise engaged in a lengthy badly written speech to explain it to her. And let's not even get into the Eastern European stereotypical bad guy who CHEWED OFF HIS OWN FINGERS in a Siberian prison so the frostbite would not turn to gangrene and kill him. Not even joking. Now, if you are someone who appreciates a good belly laugh over horrendous writing and equally bad acting, then you should definitely gather a group of your friends and go have a good laugh. But don't go see this embarrassingly badly made piece of crap expecting an actual good movie"

It lacked any real character development and i found myself being glad that i saw any parts of the movie that did not have Jack Reacher in it. I feel it is a duty to mention that you are watching A Tom Cruise Production that really did say it all. this guy having any creative decisions is just plain bad. I encourage you to watch this when your drunk because your at least be able to enjoy yourself being drunk and you can add it as a regret that you will never drink again on fear of watching this again.<br/><br/>If I'm not mistaken Tom Cruise definitely picked the supporting cast because i would not have recognised half of them which only tells me that he didn't want to be overshadowed ironically i think the best performer was in fact the David Oyelowo and i haven't seen a whole lot of movies with him in.<br/><br/>The plot would have been good except for the fact that it was as bumbling as the bad guys. everything was pretty much the usual type of stuff you'd expect but done badly.<br/><br/>Dialogue was a ""what the hell"" for most part the writer either did it on purpose or in my opinion Tom Cruise decided that he was a better creative artist and shoved in a lot of one liners that were basically from past films he's been in mixed with common quotes that have become quite over used.<br/><br/>if your lucky enough not to have the time to watch this movie then believe me when i say don't bother, hopefully the lack of interest in the future will force the production to be filmed with a better actor and a better support cast.<br/><br/>do yourselves a favour watch something else."
"Mr-Fusion","7","7","10","30 May 2013"," I want more.
","I remember seeing the trailers for ""Jack Reacher"", last year. They sold it as a badass Tom Cruise muscle care beat 'em up. So it probably turned some off when the move wound up being part crime thriller, part '70s action film (no caffeinated editing or shaky cam), methodically paced, and tension that runs at a slow burn. You can always blame the chimps in marketing.<br/><br/>Size controversy aside, Tom Cruise brings all that is necessary to the role, making you believe that he can actually beat the shít out of 5 other guys in the middle of the street. And as an action film, ""Reacher"" subtly delivers, with a nail-biter of an opening sniper scene, an ending quarry shootout that is surprisingly tense (happily so), and a well-done car chase that leaves one righteous cherry-red Chevelle in a tragic state (heartbreaking, that one). The fist fights are raw and brutal, well-choreographed with Cruise delivering a plethora of groin shots and bone crunches. It's a sight to behold. <br/><br/>What's disappointing about this movie is that it's a one-off. It didn't do well at the box office, and I'd love to see more of this character. He's hard-nosed, brutal when pushed, and when the case is solved, he drops off the grid. Is it even possible to do that in today""s hyper- connected world? The ability to just quietly recede just floors me. But even more than that, it's his code of doing what's right that makes him someone to root for (that fist-pumper of a closing shot really brings it home). <br/><br/>Like ""Dredd"", ""Jack Reacher"" is a thoroughly pleasant surprise of 2012 ... and probably the last we'll see of both. <br/><br/>7.5/10"

","I cannot seriously believe my husband made me sit through the whole movie. We had plenty of giggles throughout but they were for all the wrong reasons. The script was so cheesy I almost thought it was a spoof comedy. Tom Cruise must be really desperate for work. It's as though the scriptwriter watched every bad movie ever made and combined all of the worst lines together with using every drama stereotype ever invented. I can only assume that Tom Cruise has roped in all of his scientology friends (yes, I left the capital 'S' off on purpose) to give this movie good reviews as it's the biggest pile of pants I've seen in a while. Comparable only to the likes of Troll Hunter and The Wolfman. Do yourself a favour and avoid watching this movie. Take up knitting or scrabble or anything. Whatever you do, it would be much better use of your time."
"loco_73","Null","18","32","27 January 2013"," Jack Who?
","If ""Jack Reacher"" was supposed to start a new movie franchise, well this effort was the wrong way to start it! I think that in a world defined by James Bond on one hand and Jason Bourne on the other, ""Jack Reacher"" was meant to fall somewhere in-between. Unfortunately that was a mistake and part of the reason that the movie failed to catch on at the box office.<br/><br/>Instead of trying to perhaps fill-in or bridge the gap between Bond and Bourne, Reacher should have inhabited its own space and stood apart from all the other franchises! The movie veered from the serious to the silly quite often, with some scenes sprinkled within that defied explanation through their stupidity and cringe inducing awkwardness.<br/><br/>I have not read any of the Reacher novels, but am aware enough of the physical description and attributes of the lead character, to realize, as have apparently many others, that the role was miscast, perhaps fatally so, in so far as this movie goes. The height, weight and physicality of the character not only serve the character in a visual, descriptive manner, but is also part and parcel of who the character is! So when Tom Cruise got his hands on the role, fans of the novels were enraged and newcomers to Reacher's universe were miffed to say the least. Apparently the only one who has not fazed by all this was the author himself, which leads me to surmise that he was therefore submitted to some kind of Scientology ritual...to ""cleanse"" away any doubts or opposition, that and a healthy amount of money! <br/><br/>If my understanding is correct, Jack Reacher is a world-weary guy, exhausted by his past and very uncomfortable with his present. The man is supposed to be a hermit, not that you would know it by watching Cruise...fumble his way across the screen!<br/><br/>The storyline is interesting enough, but in the hands of this director and this actor it assumes with ease the mantel of mediocrity and boredom. Rosamund Pyke is the only one who is given anything remotely resembling an interesting role. The other one, strangely enough, I found any empathy towards, was Alexia Fast who played Sandy, the young woman used to lure Reacher into a trap. Besides that I did not give a rat's a** about anyone else, including Reacher.<br/><br/>I will go all out and say that this movie fails on many levels, acting and directing being the main ones, but the overall bad vibe I got from this movie comes directly from Tom Cruise himself. He should have never been cast in this movie! Jack Reacher is an interesting character and there are sure enough worthy movies in that budding literary franchise to be churned out, is just that Tom Cruise should not be a part of it!<br/><br/>If any other studio decides to take another chance on Jack Reacher, and I hope they do, a better decision making and planning process as to screen writing, casting and directing should be in place to ensure that next time, if there is one, the movie has a better chance at succeeding!"

I was most impressed by the acting of the James Burr. His acting was the best in the whole movie and i hope a bright career for him.

","If you can get over the fact that Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher in stature (in the novels, the character stands out in a crowd, at 6'4' and 240 lbs.), you will enjoy this film. It has a well crafted plot, is expertly filmed and edited, and resists the typical over-the-top shaky-cam effects we see far too often in such movies. I almost didn't go see this film based on many negative reviews I'd read on Rotten Tomatoes....I'm very glad I decided to see it after all. What a pleasant surprise. I believe the political biases of many reviewers turned them off...if you don't believe justice should be merciless and swift, you are probably going to have a problem with this film.

These shortcomings are apparent in the fighting scenes, you have to believe in the old Hollywood artistic licence.<br/><br/>As an action thriller the inspiration is a film such as Bullitt. This is a thoughtful film, relying more on brains as well as brawn.<br/><br/>From early on we know who the killer is, it is more a case of why and who is behind the conspiracy.<br/><br/>The film has plenty of sly humour, nasty villains, hard edged action and Rosamund Pike's cleavage which displays its own acting ability.<br/><br/>Director Werner Herzog makes a chilling villain and Cruise the investigator is believable even if Cruise the pugilist may not be."
"KieronJT","7","9","14","7 January 2013"," An old school detective thriller
","Jack Reacher is not hero, or so he would have you believe. He's a loner and he's old school. He travels from town to town, presumably via bus as he has no passport, nor does he have a phone or any other form of communication. He's a bit like Chuck Norris really, you don't find him he finds you, he can beat five guys up and barely break a sweat and he has a very strong sense of right and wrong.<br/><br/>Now the trailer for Jack Reacher does slightly deceive the audience into thinking this is an action film, it does have action but it's actually more like an old school detective thriller, playing out at times quite slowly. As I say, Reacher does have action, just not a whole lot. This is fine though as the time in between the action allows for both the story and characters to breathe. The story is essentially quite simple, a sniper takes out five seemingly random victims with seemingly no motive or cause. Of course our hero soon gets involved and things start to unravel.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is very good as Jack Reacher, the whoop de doo caused by fans of the books over Cruise's lack of height never plays into it. He fully takes on the role in every department, playing a smart, charismatic, brave and even at times very funny Jack Reacher. The main villain The Zec, played brilliantly by Werner Herzog, is a very imposing character and sticks in the mind, which is quite something as he is only really given two scenes to make his mark. Jai Courtney, as secondary villain Charlie, creates a menacing character also, using his physical presence to intimidate those around him.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is a film and a character that stays with you long after you've watched the film. I saw it last Tuesday and there are moments I still think of now, the extremely loud car chase, the take down of five thugs, the initial sniper attack and the moving part where you we are told just how innocent the victims were.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, I would quite happily watch it again and I would definitely recommend it. There are sixteen other novels ready for the sequel treatment, I just hope we don't have to wait too long to see the next instalment."

","This exceptional movie is a tribute to the awesomeness that is Tom Cruise. It is a movie about a god, a defender of humanity, guardian of justice, stimulator of the unsuspecting vaginas, protector of the universe, and overall a nice simple guy. In the span of 130 godly minutes, we observe this lonesome former military medal-crunching genius hero emerge from his life of simplicity in order to solve a seemingly straightforward crime. An experienced womaniser, amazing fighter, exceptional driver, excellent sharpshooter, and overall a nice simple guy, Jack Reacher uses his photographic memory and almost metaphysical reasoning skills to uncover an evil conspiracy. In the end the truth prevails, the innocent go free, the guilty go dead, and the lone mysterious stranger rides in the sunset, fighting the evil wherever it may be. If you thought this movie is about Tom Cruise overcoming his middle-age crisis, you were wrong. Its about Tom Cruise spreading his testosterone in a 130 minutes of pure visual ejaculation, whilst us viewers are left on our knees, humiliated and humbled by what can only be considered as a tribute to the ultimate human being."
"davideo-2","9","10","16","22 July 2013"," Intelligent blockbuster that strikes the right balance between brawn and brain
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>A group of people are seemingly randomly targeted by a roof top sniper, and it doesn't take long for the powers that be to point the finger at former war veteran James Barr (Joseph Sikora) who asks for the help of only one man: Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), a man with much specialist experience who officially doesn't exist. Initially, though, he seems convinced of Barr's guilt, with only determined young attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) fighting his corner. But as she and Reacher dig deeper in to the circumstances surrounding Barr's arrest, they uncover a tangled web of conspiracy that puts them both in the firing line.<br/><br/>I've never read any of Lee Child's 'Jack Reacher' novels, but it's testament to what a dedicated fan base they must have that there was much consternation at the lead role being given to mega star Tom Cruise, who apparently was unsuited to it on account of his miniature size, with the novel version being notedly taller. While it's understandable the fans might be up in arms at something like this, it might have been a shame if someone else had been given the role, because this is one of those roles where Cruise steps out of that 'movie star' persona his name always seems to generate, and is genuinely rugged and convincing in a strong, silent type role that requires him to be one of those 'outsider' types who's more of a force to be reckoned with than anyone could let on.<br/><br/>While with Cruise involved it inevitably becomes about spectacle and scope, Jack Reacher is still an intelligent and intricate adventure, full of twists, turns and red herrings, that doesn't play out the way you expect it to and is all the more of a thrilling experience because of it. In the midst of it's intelligence, it also aims to be relevant and topical, with references in the story to rooftop snipers and unbalanced war veterans, which are probably very much hot potato matters in American society today. While catching us out with this unexpected depth and substance, director Christopher McQuarrie, who's behind the camera for the first time again after twelve years since 2000's Way of the Gun, never lets up of the thrilling action, including at least a couple of exciting car chases, the odd injection of exciting hand to hand combat and a neat little shoot out battle at the end.<br/><br/>While fans of the books may have quite a big thing to nit pick about, the casual viewer will be in for an explosive, thrilling ride that also has the good grace never to insult it's audience's intelligence. ****"

","Jack Reacher, from the get go, is an engaging movie. As someone who had developed a distaste for what Tom Cruise had been doing over the last few years - the direction his career was going in - and his relationship to Scientology had soured me on his work. All of his characters bore the bulk of the film, and for a while it just wasn't working. They were vehicles for his persona. Movies like 'Valkierie' (although historically interesting)seemed to this reviewer that Tom had bitten off far more than he could manage.<br/><br/>For the latter reason I was delighted to see him play character parts such as the Senator in Robert Redford's last movie, and bit pats as a record executive who could really dance!!! I can't remember the film's name at the moment..<br/><br/>I've actually met Tom briefly, and Nicole Kidman when he was married to her, so yet again, I've looked at Cruise movies through the brief moments I had speaking with both of them - with my colored glasses. Kidman was petrified, and the conversation was about Scientology - which I have zero interest in. He's a charming man, but I had prior experience with Scientology which left me immune to his lure.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is such a good film because Cruise plays against type. The film is NOT about him, nor would it suffer if he made a premature exit. I'm pleased to say that Cruise seems to have found a way back in from the cold shoulder Hollywood has been giving him. Specifically Sumner Redstone so many years ago. <br/><br/>This is a thrilling suspense piece with Cruise playing an ex-military cop, and his performance is most understated for a change. He's also looking much older - minor observation. This was compelling, and fascinating to watch. His past characters were taking all the weight of the film on his shoulders from the start. This one has you guessing what kind of man Reacher is, and when makes him tick. It develops the character nicely, whilst leaving an aura of mystique so you are left with questions about him which are not answered all the way through! Thankfully Reacher is anything but transparent: previous recent Cruise roles were painfully so.<br/><br/>A welcome return to films which are not mere vehicles for his movie stardom. Great script, written and directed by the same guy - produced by Cruise, which means he's willing to take creative chances, and delegate artistic responsibility. Jack Reacher was a bit of a Cruise renaissance picture for me. I enjoyed it immensely, and I hope to see Cruise continue to challenge himself in this similar vein."

It gets him into trouble and fights, makes him a suspect and limits his options on the clothes he wears. Tom is very poorly cast for this role.<br/><br/>Secondly. Jack is a taciturn character. Tom's attempt to portray this just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I can understand the high ratings that people who haven't read the books give this movie, as Lee Child's story is excellent and makes a great action movie.

Almost all of the action scenes that the so called (short stature) action hero, good old boy Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) was in. The plot was thin, and the schlock was thick. Tom was leaving an unbelievable (and I mean that it was unbelievable) trail of chaos and death behind him, as easy as I can slice through butter. I almost fell asleep around the 30 minute mark.

","I will begin by saying that I have read all Lee Child's novels and even if my idea of how does Jack Reacher look is questionable because subjective, the fact remains that Tom Cruise doesn't have the look or the behavior of Reacher. He is a skilled actor, no doubts about it, and he could play a similar character, but half of the image of JR consists in his appearance and Tom Cruise isn't even close to have it. The other weak point of the movie are the insane dialogs especially those at the end of the movie. Phrases like ""Now what"" or ""Where are you going now"" or ""What shall do without you"" (as examples) at the very end of the movies are good examples of C-rated movies from the 70-80's, but don't have a place in a high speed action-thriller as should have been ""Jack Reacher"". Dear dialog writers, don't underestimate the audience by writing such idiotic remarks. The only goal achieved in such cases is that the whole impression of the movie is spoiled with three or four misplaced unfortunate phrases. After all this, I can say that the movie is a typical American action-thriller, not bad at all, but has nothing to do with Jack Reacher books or characters. Real shame for all Lee Childs fans."

Unfortunately, it appears from what was released in movie theaters that whoever cast this movie did not actually read any of the books, or alternatively, Paramount thought they knew better than the author? The Jack Reacher character is about 12"" taller than Mr Cruise, blond haired and very intimidating. I found the movie destroyed just about every aspect of Jack Reacher's published character. Consequently,I found the film very disappointing as I believe this movie should have been the start of a string of Jack Reacher box office smash hits.

","1st watched 12/25/2012 – 3 out of 10(Dir-Christopher McQuarrie): Disappointing retread of a vigilante-style cop movie with Tom Cruise producing and starring, and again showing me that when a star gets too involved in a project it goes to his head. Cruise stars as the lead character, Jack Reacher, who is a former military intelligence person who doesn't go by the rules when going after his prize(aka. Dirty Harry, Charles Bronson in a bunch of movies and others). The interesting part is that it takes forever for us to understand that this movie is a retread of those types because of it's mystery story approach as we try to determine who's at fault for the initial shooting, and it's consistently confusing us all the time(which for me—was not a good thing). There are some good chase scenes and, of course, lots of rough violent scenes(I'm amazed this movie got a PG-13 rating because of this). Considering this was released shortly after the Connecticut school killings and being about a shooter of innocent folk just walking about around Pittsburgh – it should be box office poison, but from the ending it appears Cruise is attempting to have sequels but I personally don't think this is going to happen, or at least shouldn't."

He orchestrates a good fight, but I don't find him believable. And my GOD way, way, way too much dialogue. The only character believable was Robert Duvall as the crusty retired Marine. The chase scene in the tunnel looked really over rehearsed when you could see the oncoming cars spaced at just so intervals.

Action films live or die by their own set of standards, and as long as they make you smile more often than they make you roll your eyes, it's a win. I'd call Jack Reacher an easy success on that scale. Aspects took me back to the days of Bullitt and the Dirty Harry movies, which seem to form this film's pedigree.

","Jack Reacher is entertaining and a solid film. It is a crime drama genre with some action and a little more humor. It is a story driven film with enough character development to make sense, but leaves some mystery about the main character Jack Reacher to keep it interesting. Having not read the books it is based on, the story was well done enough that I would want to see any future installments of the series. While the lead actor, Tom Cruise, is believable in the role he would not have to continue playing the lead character to keep the story interesting. He added to the film and made the character believable but the character Jack Reacher is interesting enough that other actors could do a decent enough job, as it is seen in the James Bond franchise. <br/><br/>It is worth adding that Tom Cruise did such a good job in the role it was possible to forget who the actor was, and enjoy and believe the character; though the character was given some of Tom's charisma, and it did work for the character. <br/><br/>As a whole, the film is reminiscent of a high budget TV crime drama but in movie form. The action scenes are there to drive the story along and not over the top but kept down to earth (i.e. obeys the laws of physics) as much as Hollywood can. It has a few plot twist in the revealing of the crime mystery. The acting is believably good (Robert Duvall is noteworthy in his small role that could be argued he equaled or did better than Tom Cruise's performance). Rosamund Pike also did a good job acting and making the character work for the film. The directing, cinematography, editing, soundtrack, and screenplay writing are all above average and better than the sum of their parts. Meaning there is positive synergy at work. It is refreshing to experience a film out of Hollywood that keeps me interested the whole time and not critiquing it during the viewing.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone who likes the crime/mystery drama genre or who just likes the actors involved. It is entertaining, engaging, and a good 2 hour 11 min of escapism."

How they ever thought they could put some of the more intricate (and less believable) plot developments and awkward twists of the novel is beyond me, but they did try.<br/><br/>There is a funny scene where Tom leaps out of his Camaro and joins a bus queue before the cops get there, the other bystanders helping him avoid detection when the cops do show up. Aside from that the only believe able part of the movie is the realistic sound that the assault rifles make during the battle scenes towards the end.<br/><br/>For even an average movie I normally watch completely focused. For this one I cooked a roast chicken, put together some shelves and tidied my living room. I'm writing this during the final battle as well. I don't even care about the end..."

","Robert Duval, what could you have been thinking when you signed on to this project? Couldn't you see all the holes in the plot? About as many holes as several assault weapons could put into the several cars Reacher drove. But you signed up for it anyway. All right. So, what can any true fan of the Lee Child series say about this first (probably not the last) cinematic episode in the life and times of Jack Reacher? Well, anyone who had never read any of the Reachers might think this was a good action film. And it was. Lots of shooting. One lengthy example of the requisite car chase (Reacher after the bad guys, cops after Reacher), lots of screeching tires and smashed bumpers. And several hand-to-hands with Reacher just demolishing up to five bad guys at a time. All in all, then, it was worth going to see, especially if you hadn't already read the seventeen novels in the series. But I have read them, and I just couldn't force myself to see in Tom Cruise the Jack Reacher I know and love. Just not tall enough or big enough. Maybe I'll get over that after I've seen more of the inevitable sequels. But next time, whoever writes the screenplays, please don't leave unexplained the motives of the bad guys; please don't insert any needless comic bits like the Three Stooges bathroom scene wherein two bad guys try to beat on Reacher with a baseball bat and a crowbar, succeeding only in whacking each other; please don't feel that your audience needs to see a female lawyer's boobs hanging out; please don't include any conveniently located large chunks of concrete behind which Reacher can take refuge from the bad guys' bullets; and don't, please don't, invite Robert Duval to play the comic sidekick to Tom Cruise, or, I guess I mean, Jack Reacher."

","This is one of those beautiful action + investigative thrillers that strikes the golden ration of the right amount and action and drama. There is not stereotypical Hero-Heroine relationship.

I was prepared for more than necessary action in a tom cruise movie, but boy I was mistaken, this one was well made. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

"willebruce","7","9","17","12 May 2013"," Very good movie, surprising.......not a critic
","I don't have to use big words or sound like a movie critic wannabe to say that this was a very good movie. Why do we watch movies? For entertainment. And Jack Reacher was entertaining. You may think Tom Cruise is a wacko and you're probably right. But that's due to what he does off-screen, not on. He's a great actor and plays Jack Reacher the way an action hero should be played. Perfectly maybe. I read the negative reviews although I thought that the movie would be a bomb based on the previews alone. Well, the reviews were worse. And they were wrong. As were my initial reactions to the previews before seeing this movie. It's not typical Cruise as far as blockbusters go, but it was good, very good. I won't mention a single scene in the movie, but you should definitely see it. I will leave it to the imagination. One thing I will say is that it was similar to Collateral, if I were to compare it to any earlier Cruise flick."
"Deserie212","1","20","45","2 January 2013"," Runt As Reacher
","I wrote to Mr. Child before the movie was released after I found out that TC was cast to play Jack Reacher. (Too bad I was not consulted beforehand.) I expressed my profound dismay that an arrogant runt was playing an unconceited giant. Mr. Child never responded, but his assistant tried to assure me that Mr. Child had every confidence that TC would do a good job and make a convincing Jack Reacher. Trust me, if you are a big fan of Lee Child's Reacher novels, you will die and be in Heaven for a thousand years before any such conviction takes hold. I have reviewed the box office results since the movie opened and I could not be happier that the movie is doing poorly. May this be the last of this travesty. Creative casting may be okay for a satire, but this purported to be a serious action/drama. Let's get real!"

","I am a huge fan of Lee Child and Jack Reacher, the book series. The story itself was great, the movie was just okay, and the casting of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher was extremely bad. Those of us who have read the series know Jack Reacher, and Tom Cruise doesn't even come close.<br/><br/>This movie is no reflection of the books, which are terrific. But the movie just barely scratched the surface. The characters were glossed over and most of the movie centers on Cruise trying to be Reacher - he never quite comes across as believable. <br/><br/>Rosamund Pike is beautiful, but flat as the character of the defense lawyer. No personality...<br/><br/>Very disappointed - if they ever make another of these books into a movie, I hope they have a better candidate for the title character. Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher, end of story."
"ragingbull_2005","5","5","8","17 June 2013"," Cruise as Reacher? You gotta be kidding me
","This review is written from the point of view of someone who has read the book before watching the movie and is a big fan of the Jack Reacher series of books by Lee Child.<br/><br/>""How to screw up a book in two hours?"". This could have been the alternate name for Jack Reacher, the motion picture based on the book One Shot by Child.<br/><br/>I know it is very difficult to incorporate all the details of a five hundred page book into a two hour long movie. But, to chop off the important parts and to reveal the main culprit, who is disclosed during the last 50 pages of the book, in the first two minutes of the movie, is plain idiotic. It changes the book from a whodunit and makes it more of a star vehicle for the actor/producer of the movie Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>Talking about Mr. Cruise, not only is he physically dissimilar to Jack Reacher (6 feet 5 inches, chest 50 inches according to the Reacher's CV , given before the beginning of every book), he just doesn't look comfortable in the part. Reacher is a loner, an ex-military cop who you don't want to mess around with and who spouts just about the coolest one-liners in recent memory. Cruise looks ill at ease and I felt like laughing out loud in scenes where he is shown threatening people with grave body damage if they don't do as he says.<br/><br/>However, for those who haven't read the book, this is a better than average movie. The book is dumbed down for the audience in its adaptation and the pacing doesn't allow the viewer to think too much. The action scenes look a bit unnatural because of Cruise's built. However, the twists, as they are, keep coming thick and fast.<br/><br/>In the acting department, besides Uncle Tom, there is the brilliant Robert Duvall in a very good cameo act. His presence on the big screen uplifts the viewer because it is clearly visible that he is having a ball in his role.<br/><br/>The direction by Christopher McQuarrie is competent considering this is his first movie after a gap of twelve years. It is the screenplay, written by Child himself along with McQuarrie, which really keeps this from becoming a great mystery movie.<br/><br/>This would be enjoyed by fans of Cruise. Those of Reacher should stay away.<br/><br/>Watching this has made me realize how much I have missed Reacher during the past month and has increased my craving for his latest book, A Wanted Man."
"obrofta","8","8","15","29 December 2012"," Better Than Advertised
","I just read a review from a Tom Cruise hater. I got to admit, I think Mr. Cruise personally has an ideology, which is difficult to understand. Perhaps, that makes him misunderstood. However, as an actor, I find him first rate. In Jack Reacher, Mr. Cruise sells us early on on who he is in this movie and why the character Jack Reacher which was created is believable. Tom Cruise has been selling us on his athletic ability and hand to hand fighting skills for years now. This hater calls him a ""munchkin"" no doubt because of Cruise's height of 5' 7"". But we know there's men in the world smaller than Mr. Cruise who could kick almost anyone's keister.<br/><br/>Like the MI series, this action movie has it's contrived moments. No doubt our hater probably laughed through Cruise's last fight scene, not because of the action, but a decision Jack Reacher makes right before the fight scene, which is unbelievable. Then again, we have to remember ""suspend disbelief"" some otherwise we don't go see a lot of these movies.<br/><br/>It was good to see Rosamund Pike on screen again. She has a good screen presence albeit a stiffness no doubt coming from her stoic English roots. I couldn't tell whether that stiffness was a result of her lines (screenwriting), the directing or her acting. She did seem to loosen a little at the end of the movie, and was part of a expertly written, directed and acted scene which will move you ... if you have a heart.<br/><br/>Another disturbing part of the haters message was the response from the IMDb audience. Over 70% responding to the review thought it was helpful. Good grief. What does that say about what is going on in our country. Do we really have so much hate? The movie is getting okay reviews 7.3 at this time. However, the movie is somewhat poor attendance, which is also indicated by the number of IMDb users who have rated the movie. I wonder if, from a marketing standpoint, using generic names like Jack Reacher and John Carter make it more difficult to sell to the public. Weren't we all asking, ""Who is Jack Reacher,"" when we first heard the title? Don't listen to haters. If you like Cruise or action films, go see this one. You'll be glad you did."
"spookyrat1","8","3","4","1 October 2019"," Jack (Wayne) Reacher: Rides In and Rides Out!
","Jack Reacher is a very entertaining adaption of Lee Child's novel One Shot and good introduction to Child's iconic character of the same name. I very much liked the way director/writer Christopher McQuarrie through judicious and economic editing, introduced and backgrounded Reacher in the first act, at all times faithfully adhering to the template of Reacher, as outlined in the long-running and internationally successful line of books ... except for one crucial aspect.<br/><br/>Yes, the elephant in the room is the contrast of the literary Reacher's physical size and appearance, as opposed to actor Tom Cruise's relatively diminutive dimensions. In this case size does matter, as Reacher's size and physical abilities and attributes are somewhat metaphorical in depicting the force of nature and barely disguised almost superman aspects of his persona. Without a doubt, accomplished actor that he is, Cruise grasps the psychological make-up and enigmatic social behaviour of Reacher extremely well. But with his movie star charisma and 5 foot 7 inch height, he was never really going to convince diehard Reacher fans of a physical connection to the character, though he gives it his best shot (pun intended) in both this movie and the sequel Never Go Back.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that for any future instalments, even Lee Child, who was initially quite buoyant and positive about Cruise's casting, has admitted, will be dependent on a new actor taking over the role. My personal choice for a very long time, has been Arnie Hammer. I think he ticks just about all the boxes.<br/><br/>At any rate having led the elephant back to his enclosure, I can reiterate that this is a good movie; well-directed with a fine cast and an intriguing storyline. Rosamund Pike and Robert Duvall are the stand-outs in a quality support line-up and both demonstrate notable chemistry in their interactions with Cruise's Reacher. The John Wayne western style references are obvious in Reacher's entry into the narrative and his exit along the motorway sunset towards future adventures, not to mention his propensity to take the law into his own hands, to achieve what in his eyes, is a fair and just outcome.<br/><br/>Though both Reacher films feature well-choreographed and realistic action scenes, only One Shot, really highlights that other really important part of the Reacher character; his great detective skills, which are a fundament of the books. So appreciate Cruise's game efforts in this, his first of two Reacher outings. But be prepared for some future casting changes which, as a big fan myself, will hopefully enable Jack Reacher to continue to forge ahead into the cinematic universe."

I will not even try to say who should have played his character because no actor exists at this point. They would have to find someone and teach them how to act. I watched this movie the first time and fell asleep. I tried to watch it again but it was just too boring and slow. I did not like the leading lady. I like that actress in other things but there was no chemistry between her and the leading man. To this day, I do not even know what this movie was about. It had action scenes but it was like just watching action scene clips. In the Lee Child books, the Jack Reacher character ""thinks"" the script. It is a first person narration in his head. This does not compute to the screen. It was not done well. The Director did not get the gist. Try again - maybe on the next one because I ensure you they will try to continue to make these movies. If you want to know Jack Reacher, read the book."
"TdSmth5","8","4","6","29 June 2014"," A thrilling thriller
","A sniper kills 5 random people. Fingerprints lead the police to the shooter, some army guy who doesn't say anything when interrogated but requests someone named Jack Reacher. And surprise surprise Jack shows up. He tells the guy's public defender that he knows the sniper who committed crimes while deployed, killing an armed forces team that engaged in serial rape. Reacher himself was also armed forces but went off grid when he returned.<br/><br/>During transport the suspect is beaten into a coma and can't sat anything. Jack starts investigating. At a bar he's approached by a girl and her brothers threaten him. He beats them all up. Jack knows that the girl was planted and that the goal was to take him out. Jack is also being followed wherever he goes. Meanwhile we learn a bit about the villains and the main guy, some former Siberian prisoner who chewed his frost bitten fingers off to avoid gangrene. <br/><br/>Jack's only lead is the girl and through her he finds some other guys who try to kill him. Then the girl is killed. Jack and the defender realize there's someone on the inside tipping off the bad guys and that the suspect is innocent after all. The defender looks into the victims and realizes they're not that random after all. Jack of course reached the same conclusion somehow. He looks and finds one of the suspect's friends. It all ends in a confrontation in an office near a mine.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book so I can't compare the movie to it. The movie is very good, the story intriguing and interesting. Jack as an investigator seems to have sixth sense for things. And he's also physically unbeatable. Yet played by Cruise he doesn't want him to appear invincible or invulnerable. Cruise also plays some things for laughs and you can almost see him grinning on the inside. He creates a good chemistry with his leading ladies and it's no different here with Pike. As with most complex and mysterious stories, there are some potholes and unanswered questions. Still the resolution is satisfying albeit unnecessarily physical. Some interesting things are said about war but the movie doesn't go deeper. Jack Reacher is a thrilling movie that has strong franchise potential."
"JaydoDre","8","4","6","28 June 2014"," Really interesting film with a wide mood range
","The last movie I saw before this one happened to be Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol and the problem I had with that film is that it was kind of dumb. The center was on the awesome action scenes and everything else was filler. Jack Reacher on the other hand may not necessarily be a super smart movie, but I was surprised to find in it a relatively interesting and intelligible detective story instead of an over the top action movie I would normally expect Tom Cruise to star in.<br/><br/>The main issue I have with this film is the dialogue. Some phrasing sounded artificial, cartoony even, like something someone wrote for an episode of CSI rather than something a real person would actually say. I think that might have been intentional. Sometimes it would fit the stylistic approach of a comic book that this movie was slowly beginning to take as it was progressing.<br/><br/>Either way, the rest of the screenplay was quite good. The story was not predictable and it grew at just the right pace. The movie had a low-key small-scale provincial feel to it, which I at first found disappointing, but this small scale gives the story room to grow, twist and turn and so it does. Some things you can see coming but others not. There are a few scenes in the film that, for just a second, deliberately make you presume the wrong thing. I have not seen a good detective story in a while and this is definitely one.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher, a guy who comes in when a murder suspect asks for him by name, and Jack is an interesting character to base a movie around. Jack knows what he is doing; he is intelligent and has some fighting skills thrown in for good measure. However, he is not invincible and does make mistakes. Also, his moral fiber is a little twisted. This brings realism to his character. Also the character is not revealed all at once but slowly, as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The story lost me a little with some of its weird decisions and a few unanswered plot questions, but overall I really liked the mixed tone of the movie.<br/><br/>It has different vibes flowing through its veins. It has some really dark streaks but also some comedy, sudden slapstick comedy even. It has action and car chases but also some slower investigation work. The music at times sounds like it's from an adventure movie. It is an interesting chameleon.<br/><br/>Also unusual are the morals this movie wears. I already mentioned the somewhat dark main character, and there are a few dubious decisions this character makes, which other good characters then accept. At the same time the bad guys are not vilified to the extreme and some people you expected to get punished do not get punished. I am not complaining. I loved it.<br/><br/>In another movie, such a wide palette of tones, characters and morals would not have worked and the film would have felt all over the place and disjointed but in this film it works. This was a dark yet fun movie and different from anything I can recall seeing in the last few years."

","Warning: This is not your typical Tom Cruise film. If you were expecting an action ride with impossible stunts ala Mission Impossible then you will be mistaken. But I guarantee, you will not be disappointed there is plenty of action in this film. It is just more of a detective story than any other Tom Cruise film.<br/><br/>Opening with a particularly frightening and suspenseful sequence filmed through the sniper's eye, the first act of the film has a very heavy atmosphere. We are introduced to our main character through series of lines stating that the government, police, nobody knows anything about Jack Reacher. They can't find him, he shows when he wants to be found. As if on cue Reacher comes inside the room. He is at first reluctant to help but he finds that there is more than meets the eye to the shooting of five random citizens. What comes next is a thrilling ride filled with great fist fights, shoot-outs, amazing car chase and the quarry-set finale is the icing on the cake. What truly stood out to me was the bathroom fight which brilliantly mixed violence and humor. I am sure that this scene will go down in history as one of the funniest fights ever.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is as usual very believable with his tough guy persona. He gives a marvelous performance but that isn't very surprising as I was sure Cruise will be amazing. I have never read the novels (but I sure am going to after watching the film)so I can't compare with the books. Robert Duvall has little screen time but you can clearly see how much he is enjoying his character, throwing funny lines here and there. He was truly the highlight of the scenes when he was on screen. Jai Courtney is great as the villain's chief henchman, can't wait to see him as John Mcclane's son in the next Die Hard film. Rosamund Pike ,who has previously played a lawyer in Fracture, gives a good performance but she is mainly here as the eye candy and she does that very well. In most scenes that she is in you get quite distracted by her beauty. The cameraman sure knew how to capture the best of her.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie, mostly known for penning the scripts to The Usual Supects and Valkyrie, has a very steady hand as a director and delivers an amazing old school crime thriller which can boldly stand among other classics of this genre."

As it is, it drifts through formulaic scenes and never gets near to making you care about the characters. It may have been slightly novel 30 years ago but is now so dated and predictable. It's a little like an episode of a poor TV series with identical story lines churned out every few days. No twelve year old should take their parents to see this and I suspect any self respecting 12 year old would have better things to do. (If only there was a rating code to indicate this, 12- perhaps).

","I'm not sure which is more disturbing, how bad this movie was or those who rated it above 1 star. There can only be one reason for this. Medical marijuana. They were all stoned out of their minds or 15yo boysbut even kids have seen enough movies by that age to know better. A Lifetime movie of the week looks like cinematic magic compared to this sad tale of an aging star looking for one more round of glory. Knowing the insecurity of TC, clearly he hired writers to come into IMDb and write reviews for probably 500 a pop. No drug could impair someone to write such dribble like, ""Cruise is back on top"" or ""Best action movie ever."" Only TC would think 22yo women are ga-ga over his character as a 50yo actor! I kept thinking to myself, what are these women drooling over as Cruise walks into a bar or restaurant? He isn't 30 anymore! He is as old as these girls' father! Just pathetic.<br/><br/>Seriouslythis is a BAD movie! Very bad movie. Bad. Bad. Bad. There is no excuse for this kind of thing. We have over 80 years of filmmaking behind our belts. If you rent any film noir movie from the 40's it is 100x better than this movie. If you rent the TV series Mission Impossible from the 60's, select any episode that was written and filmed in about 10 daysit will be 100x better than this movie. Go watch an episode of Everyone Loves Raymond and it will be better than this movie. Pet your dog and you will have more satisfaction. Did I mention how bad this movie was and is? This movie reflects the arrogance and death of Tom Cruise. Only someone who had this amount of control over a movie could screw it up so badly. If this was a TV series, then it might be acceptable because in a TV series you don't have to create character plots and build believability. This movie acts like we all know the relationships between key characters. They just ""get into it"" and it does not work. You have to really have a good script and performances to pull that offthat ain't happening here. Any episode of Kojak from 1974 makes more sense than this movieand that is from someone who has never seen Kojak! This movie makes the same leap of faiththat the amazing performance of Tommy C will transport you to movie nirvana. Tomword outit ain't 1995. You're proverbial star has burned out. The couch jumping and crazy CScience crap only made you less marketable. Heck, I thought War of the Worlds was bad and that was the beginning of the end for you bud.<br/><br/>I have not read any of Child's books and thought at first the badness of this movie (I want to keep writing the word bad) was because the Tom Cruise fire has burned out significantly over the past few years. That had to be it right? Maybe it was the fact that Rosamund Pike who looked to hot in Fracture back in 2007 aged so much? She was 5 months pregnant with her son Solo when she completed filming this piece of crap. Why hire a pregnant woman in an action movie? Maybe it was the terrible acting and writing? I figured this nightmare of a bad movie was going to kick in gear. It did not. It got worse! Tom Cruise is dead. His career is over. He had a good 25 year run. Made way too much money and seems like a pretty sad guy who can't admit he has a problem. Tomyou're 50 years old. It's over dude. Go fly your planes and read some L. Ron on the toilet. Waityou will bleed MI movies into the ground. Why? They suck as well. Just let it go TCand go back to your birth name, stop dying your hair, fix that huge nose and read a book.<br/><br/>With the cable TV shows from HBO and others making most movies seem blah, Tommy's bad acting is now really exposed. I do not see this guy gaining any new ground as an older actor. He doesn't have the appeal. When you tried so hard to be a serious actor and your fire burns out, you have no place to go. Stallone created a caricature of himself in The Expendables. What does Tom do in 2020, make a spoof of Jerry Maguire? How about an updated version of Top Gun where TC plays grandpa of his hot shot grandson? In case I wasn't clearthis movie is HORRIBLE!!!!"

"caseymoviemania","2","12","26","29 December 2012"," Casey's Movie Mania: JACK REACHER (2012)
","When the trailer for JACK REACHER was debuted online, I have to say the marketing team does a great job promoting the movie as a refreshingly low-tech crime thriller, which is a welcome change-of-pace from the usual genre you've seen nowadays. In fact, the trailer almost led me to believe the movie is going to deliver a muscular cinematic experience especially with the always-reliable Tom Cruise playing a bad-ass character. But upon finally watching the movie, it is clear that all the trailers are misleading and JACK REACHER is actually nothing more than a wannabe crime thriller trying so hard to look cool and pulpy at the same time. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, who last made his only directing effort in 2000's underwhelming THE WAY OF THE GUN, fails miserably to bring Lee Child's much-beloved Jack Reacher novel series into a worthwhile big screen adaptation.<br/><br/>At the beginning, the movie opens promisingly enough: A crazed sniper guns down five seemingly random passerby across from the Pittsburgh Pirates' PNC Park. That scene alone is certainly an unnerving experience because it coincidentally mirrors too closely from the recent Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Connecticut.<br/><br/>So far, so good. But what is supposed to be an intriguing mystery quickly nosedives into a series of awfully pedestrian narrative structure. Soon after the killings, Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo), who is in charge for the case, manages to gather enough evidence to suggest that this senseless act involves an unstable ex-military sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora). James is immediately arrested and brought in for questioning. During the interrogation by Emerson and DA Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), James writes down on a piece of paper that reads ""Get Jack Reacher"". The mystery man named Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) turns out to be a former military investigator who had went exiled following his service and he is notoriously hard to track down. But out of nowhere, Jack soon shows up on the scene and he claims he has no idea why James would ask for him because he hardly knows him at all. However, he starts to help Alex Rodin's daughter, Helen (Rosamund Pike), who also happens to be a district attorney, to gather clues for the case. When Jack is assaulted in a local bar, he begins to suspect that someone is determined to hinder his investigation. As he gathers more clues, he subsequently discovers that one of the five murders wasn't random after all and suggests there's a bigger conspiracy theory involved, while he has a reason to believe that James is being framed after all.<br/><br/>Somewhere in between, there's an interesting whodunit especially the way Jack and Helen slowly pieces out all the puzzles involving five random strangers' life before their eventual death. Also, the movie is blessed with McQuarrie's lean and fuss-free direction particularly when comes to staging some effective action scenes. Midway, there's a pulse-pounding 1970s-style car chase throughout the night streets of Pittsburgh town. That scene alone is tautly framed without the usual shaky-cam aesthetics or fancy visual-effects tinkering -- just clean and direct. You will also admire the fact that Tom Cruise did all his own stunt driving during the car chase sequence.<br/><br/>Despite those flashes of brilliance, JACK REACHER remains a huge disappointment. On the surface, McQuarrie seems to be smart enough to favor the kind of captivating direction that evokes the 1970s visual and narrative style, but his overall execution is disappointingly bland. Not to mention, at 130 minutes, it's certainly overlong to justify this as a coherent whole. The pace is awfully sluggish, and McQuarrie doesn't seems to have a clue when to push the right direction between action and dialogue scenarios. In the end, the movie is too talky for its own good until it becomes a butt-numbing experience to sit through.<br/><br/>As for the acting department, Tom Cruise has that typically charismatic presence to satisfy casual viewers. Likewise, he looks good when he plays an action role but in JACK REACHER, it's a different story altogether. You see, Lee Child's character is supposedly to be 6'5"" tall with a hulking appearance. With Tom Cruise playing the role (he's only 5'7""), he clearly doesn't look the part (even though Lee Child himself favors him a lot). And no doubt, Tom Cruise is fatally miscast for the role. In fact, apart from the vastly different appearance, he doesn't look convincing enough as a cold-hearted man who takes the law in his own hands. The way he threatens the bad guy on the phone where he says, ""I'm gonna beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot!""sounds less of a mean guy than a parody of such character. Rosamund Pike, who plays Helen Rodin, is also laughably bad. She spends most of her time looking bug-eyed or trying to get the viewers' attention with her low-cut tank top. As the main bad guy, casting veteran filmmaker Werner Herzog is an inspired choice. Earlier in the movie, there's a shivering scene where he explains to a person how he used to chew off his own fingers to avoid gangrene when he was in a Siberian prison camp. Herzog would have made into a memorable villain, but McQuarrie fails to capitalize his potential.<br/><br/>JACK REACHER is clearly a missed opportunity. Any chance of progressing this further as a proposed franchise looks slim to me. A proper reboot with the right actor is the best choice to make this right. Till then, I have to say that JACK REACHER is one of the worst movies I've ever seen this year."
"TommyRafiki","6","10","21","28 December 2012"," Another forgettable action film starring Tom Cruise.
","Jack Reacher starts off promising, with a wonderful opening scene. Unfortunately the rest of the film continually deteriorates from that point on, never living up to the first scene. <br/><br/>As far as I am aware as well they seem to have gotten the character almost completely wrong, including physical appearance, and therefore alienating the audience from the book straight off the bat. Picking Tom Cruise was in my opinion the worst decision for this film; along with everyone else he gives an average performance, and not one you would expect from this A-List line- up. <br/><br/>This is a very sub-par action film, and although watchable is most certainly not memorable."
"kgprophet","5","14","32","21 December 2012"," Does Not Rise Above the Chaff in this Crowded Genre
","With Tom Cruise attached to this straight genre film, I figured that there was an intelligent script that attracted him to the project. Alas, it feels more like just a paycheck film. This is a middle-of-the-road uninspired production with no real flair and no standout performance by Cruise. Most supporting actors fair even less. All due to a traditional character structure, with familiar subplots. Worse is the dumbed down exposition. Way too much time was spent spelling out this story, such as the unlikely match-up of the district attorney prosecuting while his daughter is defending the alleged sniper. If this was to be a truly intelligent thriller, the script would not have given some obvious clues to the audience early in the film. Nothing is original in this detective whodunit. Without giving anything away, the sniper's face is presented to the audience at the beginning of the film, and we see that in fact it is not the man arrested (and tortured) by the police.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is supposedly a man with a clean record, but takes part in vigilantism. His actions are very visible and seems to want to simultaneously hide and be very visible at the same time. So I felt confused as to what my expectations for this film were. It is certainly not a tough guy action film, even though it is written that way. There are only a handful of action set pieces involving a shoot-out or a car chase. It wasn't much of a whodunit since we are presented the villain in the opening scene. There are some adequate thriller elements. The real motive for the shooting does provide possibilities for intrigue, but this is mishandled. Which brings us to Werner Herzog, which other reviews acclaim as a enigmatic bad guy. I wasn't so struck by his persona. He certainly had a hard luck story that makes you cringe, but again goes nowhere.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike, the defense attorney, is supposed to be the possible love interest and foil for Reacher. After all, why would she waste time following around this loner who has no current credentials? And, Reacher admits that the defendant was capable of losing it. Here is another moment where the script could have soared. The film could have examined the questionable innocence of soldiers becoming mentally disturbed from fighting in Afghanistan or Iraq, where soldiers in real life snapped and went on shooting sprees. Instead, it plays it safe, turning our seemingly trigger happy defendant into a war hero because his shooting spree happened to take out some terrorists in disguise. This is way too convenient and telegraphs too much to the audience.<br/><br/>My expectations were forced to be lowered at this point. Although is supposed to be a mystery where we are given dramatic clues and a trail of detection is spelled out, there is too little to chew on. Again, a smarter thriller would have interwoven a little more doubt into the motives of the characters. Maybe there was another motive behind the D.A.'s daughter working on the defense? Maybe another detective's motives could have been explained, and help me understand the fear in his eyes. All this seemed to be be heading to an obvious conclusion, and all we are left it is how entertaining is to get there. I like Tom Cruise, and although it is not cool to like him, he still can star in a blockbuster that bring in boxcars of cash. He succeeds by doing a fully expressed performance of Tom Cruise. I liked his mix of serious and goofy in the last Mission Impossible movie. I also liked the mix of superiority and vulnerability too. This is what is missing in the Tom Cruise in this film. His voice never switches into high pitch whine mode, his eyeballs don't start to bulge out in the face of danger. Instead he is man who is resigned to play out the tired bar fight as a demonstration of his badassness (yawn).<br/><br/>This film fails on many levels trying draw the audience into the mystery, and any sense of danger only comes to a half-boil. I think it was a mistake to make Reacher so invincible. One scene that is prominently featured in the movie trailer is a moment where Reacher tries to hide from a police dragnet by mixing in with a crowd. I honestly find that highly unlikely. If you witnessed someone fleeing a high speed chase, would your first instinct be to help him? Especially without knowing anything about this man? He could have just murdered a bunch of people. That made no sense at all, but looks good in a trailer.<br/><br/>I am left to believe the main interest for Tom Cruise to appear in this run-of-the-mill film was so he could recreate his own ""Bullitt"" car chase. In fact there are some identical moments between the car chases, include sideswiping, and of course the distinctive sound of a big block engine. I certainly am not urging them to make this into a franchise."

I've read all the Reacher books. It's obvious that whoever casted Tom Cruise has NO IDEA his personality, looks, size, or actions. Jack Reacher looks more like a Tom Selleck type. Harrison Ford or even Kevin Costner would have worked better. Tom Cruise is way too small in stature and weak looking. They need someone who is a ""man's man."" John Travolta would have been a wonderful choice. I just wonder what Mr. Lee Child thought of Tom Cruise. Hopefully, if they decide to make another movie about Jack Reacher they'll read the book first and give us someone more believable."
"MovieloverIreland","5","9","19","27 December 2012"," ""BIG"" shoes to fill
","As a big fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series of books I feel qualified to voice my disdain for this movie. I've no problems with the plot, action or supporting characters but I've a big problem with little Tom Cruise playing the 6 foot 5 -fifty inch chest title character. The whole joy of reading the books came from knowing Reacher was a giant bad ass whom most men could look up to, a guy who would always do what he deems as justice but Tom Cruise just can not be that, not now not ever, he isn't Reacher.<br/><br/>I cant remember the last time I was so disillusioned after seeing a movie, Spiderman 3 comes close. I hope they reboot this series in 5 to 10 years with Chris Hemsworth but until then I am done with Lee Child, he has lost a big fan for insulting his fans and giving his approval for Cruise to make a joke out of a great character.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it has a Bullitt style car chase which wasn't even in the book, in fact the book version of Reacher rarely drives anywhere, he admits to not being a very good driver yet here we see Cruise driving around like Days of Thunder 2. Admittedly that chase is the best part of the film only to be ruined by Reacher merging into a crowd of onlookers and those people helping him hide from half a dozen cop cars. Reacher could have been an escaped lunatic or serial killer and the guys in crowd help him hide, I mean what the heck?, <br/><br/>Speaking of Days of thunder, Cruises co star in that Robert Duvall shows up to help Cruise in the finale. Robert Duvall is always a likable presence and here is no exception I've stopped referring to Reacher now as this movie should be called Tom Cruise instead, Cruise storms a quarry to defeat lame henchmen except Jai Courtney who gives a promising performance.<br/><br/>Only other plus points was a very menacing alley scene where The Zec played nicely by Werner Herzog gives a minion the choice of death by execution or chewing his own fingers off and be let live.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike is just an exposition character and a plot device to move story along, I notice that she's two inches taller than Cruise in real life yet they have them same height or Cruise slightly taller in scenes together, if the filmmakers were so conscious of that then why not have Cruise wear shoe lifts so he wouldn't look so tiny in the scene when the five guys call him out to lay a smack down on him.<br/><br/>Alexia Fast plays a character called Sandy and I found her scenes with Cruise to be very engaging especially the bar scene where Cruise insults her leading up to the street brawl. Some great dialog in that sequence.<br/><br/>Overall I can not recommend this to any Lee Child fans and for anyone else .well just imagine if Hugh Jackman was Jack Reacher. Now that's what id pay to see.-"

","It was a great thing someone took me to this movie, because it is not worth the ten dollar ticket. I found the plot to be very redundant and dried out, it seemed to be a movie I had seen before. Jack Reacher as a character seemed alright, he wasn't a God figure-- that's the best part about it. <br/><br/>Yet, Tom Cruise's portrayal wasn't praise worthy, and it wasn't bad at the same time. The best way I can describe it is that he was there. Much like a quote from Drake and Josh, ""What's acting-- You show up, say some stuff, and go home."" When I see a movie... I don't want the main character to just be there. I'm probably not the only one. <br/><br/>The lawyer, investigator, or whatever the blonde was... She was just plain annoying. I wanted her to just have a breakdown and tell Jack that she could handle it by herself. Seriously. Grow some. <br/><br/>There were some good parts, but I found myself dozing. After reading there is a book series, I can probably say I'm not receiving the full experience. Overall, this movie is one I'd buy in the discount bin in Walmart, or watch on TNT on a Saturday morning."

I'm not really a purist by any stretch; I'm all for changing the story up a bit to keep the movie from being too predictable, but TC is not a convincing Reacher. Tom Cruise is best when he's playing Tom Cruise, which is definitely not needed here. As for the rest of the cast, they were all pretty good, most notably Alexia Fast as Sandy and Rosamund Pike, whom I have always liked, as the defense attorney Reacher ends up working for. Werner Herzog should have had more screen time. The bad guy Zec is one of the most frightening bad guys I've read in a long time. The writers should have read the book a bit closer, because there was much more material for them to use. Robert Duvall was his usual curmudgeonly self and Richard Jenkins was equally good as the play-it-safe prosecutor. All in all, this was an OK Tom Cruise movie, but a very bad Jack Reacher movie. The next time, cast someone who can see over the steering wheel without needing a pile of phone books."

","I didn't realize I'd already read the book until the film started. I read a lot of crime novels and whilst One Shot had been one of the more memorable ones, Jack Reacher as a character, had obviously not stood out for me and I hadn't retained a picture of him in my mind -- certainly not one that was as inflexible as those on here who have rushed to trash the casting. So TC as JR did not bother me at all.<br/><br/>Time limits meant that the book needed to be condensed. I think they did it well but inevitably some of the detail gets lost and with it a certain amount of suspense. Still it was well made and above average for the genre IMHO.<br/><br/>The main point in reading crime fiction is to solve the mystery and I already knew the solution so it was a pretty pointless exercise watching the film of the book. However, If you are one of the gazillions of people who haven't read the book and aren't bringing their preconceptions to the table I'd say watch it and enjoy.

Although some clichés were used, I never felt it was clichéd.<br/><br/>This film kept me on the edge of my seat, and wanting to find out what was the ending. 10/10...

But one can argue that not killing the bad guys will be the clichéd moralistic view."

","After seeing the negative reviews on IMDb I was worried. I'd never read any Jack Reacher books nor did I even know who the character was. It was Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise, but he's an action star so as far as I was could tell mostly fitted the part. But I was however never really convinced he was a homeless drifter with nothing to lose. He was far too intelligent, eloquent and clean cut for that. I find it hard to believe he spends his life off-the-grid sleeping inside dumpsters.<br/><br/>It's a fairly decent thriller. It is far from the best thriller ever made, but it more than held my attention. Some reviewers would have preferred an unknown to play Reacher instead of Cruise, but I don't think the movie is that strong by itself enough to survive with a lesser known actor. And no, I don't think Liam Neeson would have done it either. He plays over the top characters: Arnie without the puns. Cruise is a better fit than Neeson.<br/><br/>It's not Bourne, and the truth is I'm relieved for that. There are far too many Bourne knock-offs out there these days. I feel like something a little different. It has action, but it's interspersed with some fairly clever plotting. There are some profound little speeches hidden in this film, like the one on what freedom really is. Reacher is an interesting character who I wish they spent more time exploring<br/><br/>Car chases are far too overused these days, but this one was well shot.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty much what you would expect. There are some lines that weren't well delivered: Perhaps what someone would write down, but not the sort of thing they would say out loud. Rosamond Pike was gorgeous to watch, and Werner Hertzog seriously creeped me out.<br/><br/>When the plot was revealed it was quite clever and entirely plausible, though it's unusual to find a movie that doesn't involve world domination. I guess that's a pleasant change.<br/><br/>It kept me entertained. The actors were good and the twists were well received. It could have been better, but it's also better than just watchable. 7 / 10."

","Look, I'm not sure what all the anger directed at Cruise is about; can you not have fun making a movie anymore? Yes the beginning of it plays out like an old episode of Miami Vice, with Cruise instigating gaping jaws and wet panties from every woman that sees him. If I made a movie tomorrow I would do the same thing, because I could. That is also the beginning of the movie, the body of the film by far and large is an extremely well done mystery/thriller. <br/><br/>I think an easy comparison would be Shooter with Marky Mark. There is a large scale conspiracy plot, a retired military specialist who is somewhat of a disconnected and eccentric personality, and as the story moves on some people get their asses whooped, a few more die. The villain is James Bond quality and Reacher himself a mixture of Jason Bourne and Kwai Chang Kaine. The action is swift and brutal when it happens, the banter from Cruise will make you laugh out loud, even though it's a little cheesy his charisma makes it work. <br/><br/>I personally found the movie to be extremely entertaining and recommended it to my friends, as I am recommending it to you here.

If the books are as exciting and imaginative as this film, I will rightly hang my head in shame.<br/><br/>One of the first things I uttered as I left the cinema was ""That might arguably be better than Skyfall"" Now having looked at the case I was possibly out of line, but this should be praised in equal measure.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's casting as Reacher was frowned upon by die hard book readers but he does an amazing job as a rough ex military cop here. Doing his own driving stunts and forever casting a rough look at enemies mixed together with great one liners makes Reacher an appropriate tough and clever presence to drive a great crime story forward.<br/><br/>The film opens with a sniper in a multi-storey car park taking out innocent people and only the district attorney's daughter believes the man is innocent. The balance of crime with drama and character conditions is well balanced, creating a flowing nature to the film and appropriately developing character agendas to maximise their beliefs and actions.<br/><br/>My favourite part of this film was the car chase.

Cruise doing his own driving mixes action and adrenaline fuelled realism to create a lively insert into the film when at the time it appeared no action was forthcoming.<br/><br/>This is no Die Hard.

In my opinion, absolutely the worse car chase scene ever even though there were some nice looking muscle cars. During the bath tub scene I thought I was watching a 3 stooges skit. This movie contains lots of nonsensical action which was somewhat amusing and more than a few funny one liners that had the audience laughing out loud.

I read One Shot again when I heard it was coming to the big screen. I was, of course, devastated when I heard Cruise was going to be Reacher. I never once said I would skip out because I've been looking forward to an on-screen version since I got hooked on Reacher. So I held my breath and said ""one for Reacher"" (I refuse to call Reacher by Jack Reacher).<br/><br/>What a great movie! I knew it was going to be good despite the size difference, but it definitely surpassed my expectations. In the end, the fact that Reacher was dropped to Cruise's stature made for more believable fight scenes.<br/><br/>The scars shown in the movie will hopefully be played out in a host of prequels and sequels. Just as Child wrote his stories in and out of order, I'm hoping that we'll see a franchise drummed out of previous and later novels.

I like Tom's acting (since Legend, mind you) but he is just not able to convey the silent menace that Reacher is. Reacher's whole problem lies in being too big. Never a great thing for an investigator, it is simply incredible to assume that anyone Tom's size is having a problem blending in. <br/><br/>That said, this particular film is so Hindi film like it is not funny. The third person description of Reacher's persona, the good guy shooter in the climax, the fistfight etc all reek of a machismo that this chap on the screen is unable to convince me he has. <br/><br/>The script is good, tight and even. shot taking is neither here nor there. And even if you can overcome your aspersions on the main casting, your will have to make an effort to ignore the quip-like dialogue. Reacher's not a man of many words but he is not one of smart quips either. Also, you will have to ignore the plastic tension between the defense attorney and her investigator. Pike's role as the defence lawyer has no highlights despite padded-up screen time. The only thing real is the black police officer. For once, a good fresh grim looking face. <br/><br/>Why did I bother writing this review. To show that once superstars get involved they can jack the best new franchise up. This was a big movie made small by the big star. Lee Child, Tut tut. Tom Cruise grow up. Or hire other actors if you are the producer too. Read my lips 'for me you can never be Jack Reacher'.

While Tom Cruise does a decent job with Reacher, the main problem with the movie is that the overly elaborate plot setup at the beginning can only offer a minuscule payoff at the end. The plot splutters and whittles out to nothing in the end making the whole movie feel anti-climactic and pointless.<br/><br/>The trailers for the movie are misleading. My first impression from the teaser was a Punisher sort of movie. My second impression, from the roars of the muscle car in the trailer, was one that of one of those Nic Cage action movies. It is neither. It's a stuffy cop/crime show movie at first and then a punch out, shoot out and car chase kind of action movie next (though its humble budget only allows for moderately wrecking of three cars with none exploding). Think ""Alex Cross"" kind of movie. <br/><br/>Jack Reacher is presented here as a sort of GI batman who is great at detective work, combat work and not bad at quick talking either; always there with a heavy punch or a witty comeback. The entire movie, plot and the characters just serve as the canvas to show off Jack Reacher's virtues. As Reacher says, ""he has nothing to lose or gain"", and so the Reacher we meet at the beginning of the movie is the same Reacher at the end of the movie and so the whole movie feels like one long introduction to the amazing Mr. Reacher. In fact, Reacher is vastly over-developed; things like being off the grid and unable to be contacted, or being an ex-military investigator where his every suspect was a trained killer, are superfluous to the movie plot at hand and just there for the sake of making Reacher look more awesome. <br/><br/>There is a passable low-budget detective action movie underneath all this. This detective story has the feel of an 80s action cop movie mixed in with the style of modern TV crime and legal drama but without any of the Mission Impossible style high budget action sequences. It's a pity the plot can't fully rise up to challenge Jack Reacher which might have made for a good movie. Although, there is engrossing half an hour in the middle of the movie when Reacher is searching for his assailants and the girl Sandy that shows a glimpse of what the movie could have been if the plot had been better.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Jack Reacher"" doesn't feel like a big action movie; the plot is small and riddled with logic holes and the story is driven by actions because it's the only way for the plot to move forward. But, the charisma of the stars pull this into something watchable. The cynic in me feels like this is a low-budget, low-risk test to see if ""Jack Reacher"" can be made to a Mission Impossible like franchise rather than a real movie that stands on its own two feet."

","The fans of Lee Child's books came out in force when it was announced to the world that Tom Cruise was going to fill the shoes of his much loved Character, Jack Reacher. Everyone focused on the physical size of Cruise being no match for the 6 foot 5"" character. What people forgot is that this is a movie adaptation of the book (One Shot), a retelling of the story for the visual medium of film. So it is fair to say the success or failure of Reacher lies with the main character and Cruise deliveries on every front as the drifter who has dropped off the grid, someone who has a healthy disrespect for authority but believes in right and wrong. In many ways the character feels like it would not be out of place in a western, as Reacher lives life his way, an anti-hero, a loose cannon that is as dangerous as he is unpredictable. Which makes the character perfect for a movie. Ironically larger than life in many ways, and the physicality has nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>The rest of this review does contain some spoilers, so readers beware.<br/><br/>The story opens with a random shooting that clearly shows the audience that the shooter is not the man who is arrested and asks for only one thing, Jack Reacher. It is clear he is a patsy but the film never really pretends he is involved (or even an innocent victim), as the mystery deals with not just who was the real killer, but also who was the intended target(s). The script is tight and well crafted by the very talented McQuarrie (Usual Suspects, Way of the Gun) and there are some real dialog gems in there that writers of the screen can learn a lot from. The story is a gamble in many ways (and not just the backlash over casting) as there is no real character arc for Reacher and no love interest, but the story is all the better (and refreshing) for it. It contains very little action, but what is used is cleverly placed in the plot that builds towards the climax. <br/><br/>As we left the theater myself and my wife had a conversation about Tom Cruise's more recent films. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, Knight and Day and now Jack Reacher and how he delivers pure entertainment to the audience. Movies with the re-watch factor. His films contain the right amount of character, action, plot, laughs and thrills to engage the audience from the first to the final frame. Giving the audience what they expect without phoning in a performance and collecting a pay-check. As an (indie) film maker myself I think his trick is simple, he's a lover of films doing what he loves, making films and it shows in the end product(s). For some reason (and I'm not sure why) Cruise is starting to remind me a little of Paul Newman as he grows older (not a bad thing).<br/><br/>The cast is very strong with Cruise carrying the film easily on his shoulders with strong support from Rosamund Pike, Robert Duvall and Richard Jenkins, with Jai Courtney being a name to look out for. I must admit I always feel a little at ease when I see Richard Jenkins is in a film as he is an exceptional character actor. The only issue I really had was to do more with character development of the man behind the man, The Zec, played by Werner Herzog. There has been a tendency since the Dark Knight to ramp up the villains and make them a little too larger than life (see Skyfall), to make them almost a parody of movie villains. Almost comic book in nature and here is doesn't really work, which could be as much to do with too little back story for the villain as much as too little overall screen time. But if a ""boss"" will someday make you chew off a finger to survive if you fail a task, he would surely become a victim to a stray bullet (or two) from his disgruntled employees/henchmen. (just saying).<br/><br/>Overall a entertaining and intelligent thriller to close the year that has restored my faith in ""bigger"" movies, as too many films have disappointed of late. Not that Reacher is a really big budget movie by today's standards, as you could make four Jack Reachers for one Total Recall (remake) and there is simply no comparison in terms of film- making. It is rare to leave a film interested to know more about the character and his other cases/adventures, but Jack Reacher will leave you wanting more and give you an interest in checking out the Lee Child books. I have never read any... yet."
"estebangonzalez10","8","6","12","5 March 2013"," Is Jack Reacher the new Mission Impossible?
","¨There's this guy, he's a kind of cop, at least he used to be. He doesn't care about proof, he doesn't care about the law, he only cares about what's right. He knows what I did. You can't protect me. No one can.¨<br/><br/>Jack Reacher was one of those films I went into with very low expectations, but came out pleasantly surprised with how entertaining the movie really was. Tom Cruise isn't one of my favorite actors, but I can honestly say that I prefer his mysterious, quiet, low key approach much more than his eccentric and talkative characters (like in Knight and Day). There is no denying his on screen charisma and he really doesn't have to do much in order for you to root for him and that is why I find his quieter performances much more thrilling and engaging. Jack Reacher has it all: it's action packed, it has thrills, mysteries, twists, and even some comedy. I was entertained much more than I thought I would be with this Tom Cruise vehicle. The screenplay was adapted by Academy Award winner, Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) from Lee Child's book One Shot. Although McQuarrie is known mostly for his work with screenplays, this is his second film as a director (the first being The Way of the Gun) and he does a great job with the action scenes here. I am not a big fan of car chases, I get tired of them very easily, but this film has one of the best vehicle chases I've seen since Ronin. The opening scene with the sniper point of view was also pretty gripping and inventive. I was really glad I got to see this film despite it not being groundbreaking or anything because it was entertaining. This mystery thriller worked really well thanks to some great comedic moments.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is a former military operative who has been living off the radar in the past year like a John Doe. He is the kind of person who can't be found, but rather he finds you. The movie begins with a deadly sniper shooting five innocent victims in the middle of the city. The police identify the alleged murderer as Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former military officer who claims to be innocent. Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) has a strong case against him, but all Barr says is ¨Get Jack Reacher.¨ Neither Emerson nor District Attorney Rodin (Richard Jenkins) know how to reach Reacher, but he shows up after hearing the news. He begins investigating the case after the defense attorney, Helen (Rosamund Pike), convinces him to look into the supposedly locked case. She believes like everyone else that Barr is guilty, but wants to save him from the death penalty. When Jack Reacher begins to investigate the case he finds some evidence that leads him to believe that Barr is innocent and that someone had a specific target in mind and wanted to make everything look like a random killing. While Jack begins digging deeper some men begin to follow him and try to scare him off, but Reacher is the sort of guy who always gets to the bottom of things. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise may have found yet another franchise in Jack Reacher as his character is very likable by remaining very quiet, mysterious, calm, but at the same time very tough. He is the sort of guy who seems to always be in control and in cool. There are also some very interesting performances here from Robert Duvall, Alexia Fast, Jai Courtney, and the great director Werner Herzog who have a supporting role. Duvall brings some comedic relief and has great chemistry with Cruise, while Herzog and Courtney create some interesting villains. The film runs a bit long and there is some problem with the pacing of the film at times, but the great action scenes make up for it. Jack Reacher has some very smart one liners and always answers with some sort of quick remark, which were the comedic highlight of the film. There is a bathroom scene that feels a bit off from the rest of the movie, and the action here is sort of cartoonish but it was also another one of the funniest moments of the film. Despite not being a huge Tom Cruise fan I really did enjoy this film and recommend it. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Spoiler - my review is full of praise.<br/><br/>Everyone loves Tom Cruise. Well almost everyone :p. And I love him too. He is good. Real good. <br/><br/>Jack Reacher, like almost all of Tom's movies is intense and full of word play. I hate the fact that I missed it on the big screen and ended up watching it on my tiny 32"" tele at home. Oh the horror!! Rest assured, if you miss a minute cause you have something on the stove or you had to get the door, you will be lost for almost the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Add defying-rules-of-nature action to the intense plot and the Sherlock kind of amazing powers of deduction and voila, you have Reacher at his best. <br/><br/>A movie pretty much fit for all ages if you enjoy murder mysteries. I can't wait to read the book it was based on. This is the first time in like forever, a movie has inspired me to read the book it was based on. <br/><br/>Bottomline - Kick back and relax with family and friends on a Sunday evening and enjoy two hours of intense concentration. :)"
"fawn_jane","8","4","7","28 January 2014"," Good but off-key in places
","I love Tom Cruise but he is badly cast in this role.<br/><br/>There is this one scene where he's standing around with his shirt off and the leading lady is like ""put a shirt on..."" as if he's this hunk who is pea-cocking around with his shirt off distracting her. In reality he looks elderly, he reminds me of a well-preserved mummy. Someone close to Mr. Cruise needs to let him know that all the makeup and plastic surgery in the world isn't keeping him looking young anymore.<br/><br/>That out of the way, it was a good movie. It was smart, had an engaging plot that was unpredictable. The only problem is that at moments somehow Tom Cruise's acting or something made him unbelievable in the role. The thought kept hitting me that he's just Tom Cruise playing a role. I can't put my finger on it, it was just a bit off-key."
"aeg1029","9","4","7","11 December 2013"," Jack Reacher review
","Jack Reacher was a surprisingly good movie! I have read the books, and Tom Cruise is not at all built like Jack Reacher, so I had reservations, but Tom is an excellent cast with his physical abilities, and the remainder of the cast is excellent! Robert DuVall is superb as the gun range owner, and the script retained the crucial elements of the plot, while trimming stuff that does not contribute to the flow. Looking forward to the newly announced sequel! Hopefully, they will cast this one as well and the script will be as well written too! Tom Cruise needs to have another series in his repertoire along with Mission Impossible to keep us fans going to the theaters!"
"richard-abeysinghe428","7","4","7","19 October 2013"," Excellent movie, but a bad portrayal of the 'Jack Reacher' character from the novel
","Good thing I hadn't read a single book in the Jack Reacher series cause the fact is this film isn't the best portrayal of the actual Jack Reacher character in the novels, which I've come to know quite thoroughly as I read all 17 novels in the series after watching the film. But therein lies my point: which is that the 'Jack Reacher' movie by itself stands strong, what with the decent script and solid performances from Tom Cruise & Rosamund Pike, an assessment I could present as an impartial judge having not read the book before watching the film. Most negative reviews are from readers of the novel & hence they are justified in criticizing the film as an inaccurate portrayal of the novel. But saying that its a stupid/bad film is wrong as its a pretty good movie!"
"catwoman1173","9","4","7","25 September 2013"," A hero for the thinking viewer
","Most people would compare the film Jack Reacher to Mission Impossible simply because it's a Tom Cruise film. This is totally unfair as they're miles different from each other. <br/><br/>If you are looking for lots of explosions, huge guns, hi-tech gadgets, robots, CGI and hot chicks, then Jack Reacher is not for you. This film and the Jack Reacher novels (by Lee Child) as well for that matter, are for those who are more intellectually inclined. <br/><br/>There is action, excitement, suspense, intrigue, twists and turns but interestingly, it's compact and contained. The protagonist, Jack Reacher, is like a tightly wound coil, able to spring into action when called for and like a brief but violent storm, subsides once unleashed. <br/><br/>The villains are atypical and their motives are unclear until towards the end. You are constantly guessing at who's who and what's what and why and I love that so much! It really draws you in and keeps you on your toes until the end. And when you are able to come up to your own conclusion and find that you're right, boy does it feel good!<br/><br/>Another thing that I love about the film is Jack Reacher's dark and dry sense of humour. When I watched the film, I was the only one laughing. I suppose not everyone understands the humour. It's so refreshing to see an American film and 'hero' able to take the mickey out of itself. I guess this appeals to my British background.<br/><br/>Anyway, like I said, Jack Reacher is not for everyone. This is a film for the thinking person."
"Uriah43","7","4","7","5 July 2013"," Suspense, Mystery and Action Throughout
","An army sniper named ""James Barr"" (Joseph Sikora) kills 5 innocent people at random in Pittsburgh. When he is caught and interrogated he writes down 3 words on a piece of paper: ""Get Jack Reacher"". Not long afterward he is beaten up while in police custody and lies in a hospital bed in a coma. Out of nowhere the mysterious man named ""Jack Reacher"" (Tom Cruise) appears and reluctantly decides to investigate the case on his own without the help or concurrence of the Pittsburgh police department. But as he continues he realizes that what should have been an open and shut case isn't necessarily true. Anyway, from an entertainment perspective this film is very enjoyable. Tom Cruise does an excellent job and the chemistry between him and Rosamund Pike (as ""Helen"") is definitely noticeable even if it wasn't actually realized. There is suspense, mystery and action throughout the film and I recommend it to those who enjoy movies of this type. Above average."

","Good action movie with a decent overturn, nice action scenes and a story that fits well into the genre.<br/><br/>But with some very welcomed differences when comparing with almost all other movies, action or not.<br/><br/>OK, there is a romantic couple, but even though it seems they like each other, they don't stay together in the end, and thanks for that fresh air.<br/><br/>The hero (Reacher) kill the bad guy in the end, avoiding an annoying prosecution and any chance of Zac getting away. If this is right or wrong it's up to you, but he did what thought was right.<br/><br/>Reacher just used a gun in two scenes, and because it was necessary. I'm not against weapons, but I'm against movies trying to brainwash us telling we need guns almost all the time and to solve every tricky situation we might get in.<br/><br/>And I liked very much the scene where Reacher talk about real freedom and points out some office workers. That was nice, because usually Hollywood tries to make us believe the world we live in is a wonderland, when we know nowadays it's just the opposite.<br/><br/>8.5 for all these reasons."
"josh-oliver-670-194472","8","4","7","27 April 2013"," Jack Reacher, one of the best thriller/action movies I have seen in a long time.
","Jack reacher, after seeing the trailer for this movie I noted it as a must see when it came out. Having not read any of the books, I went in open minded, I was not disappointed. I see this movie as a similar idea to Alex Cross, based on the series by James Patterson, only much better. Right form the opening scene of this movie, there was suspense, action and thrill. With out wanting to give anything away to those who haven't seen the movie, throughout the movie there were twists and turns that again built up the suspense and kept you on the edge of your seat. If I have one criticism, it's that through the middle the storyline went a little cold and only followed what Tom Cruise's character was doing. Although between these short periods the was no shortage of violence and action, topped of with a fast and exciting car chase. This though was all forgotten by the time the final battle begun. Endless gun shots and action and even a bit of a fright at the end. Now to clear up the issue of Tom Cruise playing Reacher. Personally i think Tom Cruise is one of the best actors in the world for these types of movies. Whether Tom Cruise is 6'5"" of 5'5"", it doesn't take away the fact that he did a fantastic job at playing him. Yes I know I haven't read the books, but I truly believe that once you get into the movie the last thing you will be think about is how tall Tom Cruise is! So overall. One of the best movies I have seen in ages. Kept you on the edge of your seat and wondering what was going to follow. I really hope they make more Jack Reacher movies, kinda like what they are doing with the Bourne series. This first up movie was a success and I have no doubt that the ones that follow will be too. Over and out."

","I have read every Jack Reacher book or story out there. I love them! For me they are better than candy. When I heard Tom Cruise was going to play the title role in this movie I was very disappointed. I decided 2 things: 1 - I won't see the movie and 2 - it won't spoil the books for me. I will still see Jack Reacher as the towering, powerful person Lee Child portrays in the books. So, this morning I was flipping the channels and saw the movie on FX. I figured - why not give it a few minutes? Maybe it isn't as bad as I thought. To my surprise, it was even worse than I thought. In the 5 minutes I watched, Tom Cruise walks into a bar and towers over the other people in the bar. How? The dude is 5'7"" - the only bar he can ""tower"" in is a hobbit bar. Then he promptly annoys a little girl who's big, bad boy friends take Jack outside to teach him a lesson. Really? Then Tom Cruise proceeds to beat the smirk out of the 5 opponents in one of the cheesiest fight scenes I've ever seen. (I don't want to compare any other movies to this one so I don't offend them). Bottom line, too bad. I would've loved to see a good Jack Reacher flick. I guess it isn't going to happen."
"rooee","4","7","15","30 December 2012"," Reach for the star vehicle
","This is the first of a potential franchise, based upon the page-turners by prolific British author Lee Child. Based on the novel One Shot, Jack Reacher opens with an apparently psychotic sniper spree, which turns out to be part of a broader mystery, to be investigated (in his own pugilistic way) by the wandering title character (Tom Cruise), along with the lawyer (Rosamund Pike) who'll be defending the accused.<br/><br/>The plot is a procedural join-the-dots job, whose preposterousness starts amusing but becomes wearying. As is often the case, the tiny details (usually involving Reacher's photographic memory) are more interesting than the big twists. At 90 minutes, this could have had some of the rampant energy and briskness of a film like Salt. But the script is cripplingly talky, directly at odds with the self-proclaimed pragmatism of the titular hero. There's a great-looking car chase to relieve us from the reams of discursive dialogue, but it comes to nothing much, feeling forced like that strange airport action sequence shoehorned into Casino Royale.<br/><br/>Worse, entire scenes drop dead before our eyes. There's a moment where Reacher confronts Sandy, a vulnerable girl (who'll test the 12A certificate by getting brutally punched out, much like the opening of Christopher McQuarrie's last film, The Way of the Gun), and it feels like we have to wait an eternity before she gets to the point... only for Reacher to return for yet more chat. And then there's the moment when Reacher gazes into an office block and makes an ear-rippingly pretentious speech about how the little people are trapped, and if they could live their life again, they'd live like him. You mean live a nomadic existence, building no intimate relationships, killing without mercy and constantly on the run from the law? No thanks, Mr Reacher.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there's a reasonably exciting final shootout, admirably filmed in medium shot and not edited to a state of incomprehensibility - a rarity these days. And there are sold supporting turns from David Oyelowo and the ever-reliable Richard Jenkins.<br/><br/>Other performances don't land on two feet. I was looking forward to Werner Herzog (as baddie ""The Zec"") showing up and injecting some campness into proceedings, but the great director is not a great actor, and it sounds like he's reciting from an earpiece. Rosamund Pike, a decent actress forever slumming it, seems to have been instructed to wear a permanent rabbit/headlights expression.<br/><br/>And then there's Mr Cruise. I kept looking at Jai Courtney (who plays the hotshot Charlie), and wondering, with his superior height and brooding, thuggish demeanour, whether he would not be a more logical choice for the brawny giant at the film's stony heart. Instead we get Tom Cruise, ball-busting blokes and seducing women with his mere presence, at the centre of ""A Tom Cruise Production""."

","I never read the book (s) so I can't write about how closely the movie followed the author's original work. My review is strictly from an entertainment POV. I enjoyed the movie and will recommend it to friends. As a movie ""snob"" I am a harsh movie critic and believe most of the movies today are just junk formula movies or remakes of remakes. So I would tend to think the Jack Reacher character could be a fresh addition to the current movie market. Unfortunately, I think Cruise should have produced this movie and not played the lead role. Like Liam N., Tom C. Is getting too old for these types of roles. Additionally, Cruise does not portray this character with enough intensity and is not believable as a highly trained military expert. Of course I do have some bias since I totally enjoyed the action packed, fast paced Bourne series. In the fantasy world created by movies and books Bourne would kick Reacher's behind."

","This movie tries to reach new heights but It sadly doesn't come close to it. After last years resurgence of Tom Cruise thanks in part to Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Paramount decided to take a script written by Christopher Mcquarrie and run with it, giving Tom Cruise the new term December's king. Thus Jack Reacher is released and suffice it to say two lightning in a bottles is not possible. First lets say that some of the action in this movie is fun, and entertaining but for the most part this is not an action movie, but a center piece on letting Tom Cruise play and outsmart the people that he goes after. It's not to say this is a bad movie, just not a very good one. The plot feels plodding, most of the characters seem wooden or are left with not much to do and the twist are so easy to figure out and so sloppily placed that it runs down a movie that should and could've been something unique and possibly fresh. Now I must note that this film, within the first 5 min sets up a scenario, due to recent events, might hit a little uncomfortable in the chest. Be warned that it will probably bother you a little like it did it's just coincidence and know that paramount is handling this movie the best way they can, with there marketing. From that I would recommend seeing this if you want a throw away movie, don't expect to see logic or excellent character study in this movie.

This movie, however, was bad enough that I felt I had to leave a review just to warn people off it.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, its not that I feel the movie did the book a disservice, I dislike the movie solely on its own demerits. I don't believe in any of the characters, everything from the cheesy one liners to the badly choreographed fight scenes was so unbelievable that the whole movie lost any credibility even as a story and became unwatchable.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie"
"darkpool","8","6","13","12 May 2013"," A taut, action thriller that delivers.
","It seems fans of Lee Childs' Jack Reacher novels are not too impressed with this offering.<br/><br/>I think it is a simple matter of viewing it through the prism of expectation, instead of seeing it for what it is.<br/><br/>As a viewer unencumbered by any expectations I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. (So much so that I am looking forward to now reading the novels.)<br/><br/>In my eyes Tom Cruise was excellent in this, portraying the world weary Reacher perfectly. (As an aside, I am kind of over people panning Tom Cruise movies just because they are, well, Tom Cruise movies. Objectively speaking he has had one of the best runs of successful movies and been at the top of his game for the past 25+ years, so, well, get over it.)<br/><br/>As a movie Jack Reacher is a taut thriller and much grittier than you would expect. Jack Reacher is a hard man when he needs to be.<br/><br/>The film has excellent pacing and plotting and the acting all around is top notch.<br/><br/>I have not heard much comment on it but Jack Reacher also has one of the better car chase scenes ever filmed.<br/><br/>All round an excellent, solid gritty movie that does what a good movie should. Draw you in and entertain you all to hell."

","I watched this movie twice; the second time it took three hours. I had to stop the action frequently to take notes and consider how some of the scenarios fit into the flow of the story. With thrillers like this one, there's often some plot hole or element that doesn't make sense and affects the credibility of the story. Try as I might, I couldn't come up with one here. The writing was flawless as every base was covered in explaining how four random murders were used to cover up an intended one. That's not to say that this is something that could ever have happened for real. Jack Reacher's (Tom Cruise) analysis of the random murder victims depended heavily on some improbable coincidence, but he acknowledged as much with victims Nancy Holt and investment banker Sawyer. Whether he was right or not about their having an affair had no bearing on the outcome of the story.<br/><br/>The thing that intrigued me the most was that whole business about the 1968 quarter with Barr's fingerprints on it. Like Reacher, I kept wondering why Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) dumped the parking meter to find it, even more so than the alleged shooter using the meter in the first place. The only way for it to make sense was because Emerson knew it would be planted there by his accomplices working for The Zec. Man, I get a kick out of that name - The Zec. Werner Herzog was a perfect choice to portray that character. With the false eye he looked like a Zec, no question about it.<br/><br/>For Tom Cruise, this was a far cry from his Charlie Babbitt and Jerry Maguire days. I actually liked him here, playing against type as a former military investigator with a no nonsense approach to solving problems. The fact that he was too smart here, along with his prowess as an indestructible fighting machine, might be the reason so many viewers find his character a little too unbelievable for the story, and I guess that's fair enough. But then again, it is only a story, which I thought was plotted out incredibly well.<br/><br/>Earlier I mentioned that I couldn't think of anything that didn't work in the picture. Now that I think about it, there is one thing that seems impossible to imagine. Can you really bite off your own finger?"
"hnt_dnl","9","3","5","7 July 2014"," Surprisingly entertaining, provocative film!
","My instincts told me to completely ignore this movie! I was sure that JACK REACHER (2012) would be a dud. Not so much because it starred Tom Cruise (I actually like him, see my reviews of his movies, most of which are very positive), but just I thought the title itself was misleading, making me think this was going to be some insipid, mindless summer action movie with corny one-liners. Nothing of the sort here! <br/><br/>The film starts off with a literal bang, as a mystery sniper kills 5 innocent people in a square in downtown Pittsburgh (the film's setting and actual shooting location). The police immediately connect the dots and arrest a prime suspect named Barr (Joseph Sikora), a disturbed military veteran suffering from PTSD. All evidence points to him committing the crime, so the police detective in charge of the investigation Emerson (David Oyelowo) and the district attorney (film veteran Richard Jenkins) try to coax a confession out of him. Barr's only response is to write on the confession ""Get Jack Reacher""! The 2 men brainstorm to try and find him, but he finds them.<br/><br/>Into town struts the film's title character, exquisitely brought to life by Tom Cruise. It's amazing that after such a variety and eclectic collection of roles in his now 30-year career that Cruise can so effortlessly essay a character like this, different from any other he's played before. I was certain that Reacher would be the typical Cruise cocky, smarmy character that he would do in roughly every other movie in the 80s and 90s, just an older version! But I was wrong. <br/><br/>Now while Reacher is certainly a smooth operator and tough guy, Cruise also imbibes the character with great subtlety, intelligence, and class. Scenes that I expected to be totally cliché were presented in a very unique and interesting perspective due to clever dialog and nifty fight choreography. Not to mention there were really good actors in the supporting roles that gave their characters enough dimension so they didn't come across as the typical throwaway summer action movie boobs. In particular, I'd say my favorite supporting character was Sandy (expertly played by Alexia Fast), who had a couple of great scenes with Reacher that helped give the film it's heart. <br/><br/>Rosamund Pike had a huge role in this movie as well. In fact, she actually may have had equal (and dare I say more?) screen time as Cruise. She played attorney Helen Rodin, who is defending Barr, but thinks he is guilty, so she is trying to get his sentence reduced from death penalty to life in prison. I found the dynamic between Cruise and Pike to be very refreshing. Although there were hints of sexual attraction, it was mostly downplayed to keep their relationship on a purely professional level. I was sure they'd be jumping each others' bones at some point in the proceedings! Additionally, the legendary Robert Duvall has a welcome extended cameo role and he of course makes the most of it. <br/><br/>While the film has all the requisite elements of a summer action movie, it is surprisingly fresh in a lot of ways and turns the typical clichés found in summer movies on their heads with clever, convincing dialog, an involving storyline, and one of the all-time greats Tom Cruise carrying the show!"
"RDGferrari-1","9","3","5","15 June 2014"," Very Good Starting Point
","Just to start, I am an absolute hardcore fan of the Jack Reacher series. I've met Lee Child and received his autograph on more than one occasion. The book that this movie is based on, ""One Shot"", is my favorite Reacher book. The question is was I upset when Tom Cruise was cast? I'll admit I was...but I also understand Hollywood where when they say a movie is BASED on a book as opposed to being a live action version of the book. This movie is simply using the story line from the book and not trying to completely create the world of Jack Reacher. Once people realize that maybe they'd enjoy it more. We always need to go see a movie that is based a book we love with an open mind. Otherwise you get the close-minded (see what I did there?) people who take it as a personal attack that it's not exactly like the book. <br/><br/>The movie itself honors the crime thrillers of the past with how it's filmed. This is not a Michael Bay style film where everything blows up every other second. Cruise manages to play a good concept of the character while obviously not being 6'5"" and 250lbs. He's been around a while and knows what he is doing. He and Robert Duvall make a great team again and Rosamund Pike is, in my opinion , the perfect cast for Helen Rodin. <br/><br/>This movie makes people think. Is it exactly like the book? No it is not. Is that a bad thing? In this instance, no. If you know nothing of the books, watch the movie and enjoy it. If you are a fan of the books, remember it's BASED on the book, not an exact copy."
"g-bodyl","9","3","5","14 May 2014"," Very Good Action Film!
","Jack Reacher is an modern, above-average action thriller that is really gripping and intense. Based off an enormously popular series, I feel like the film gave the series justice. It has plenty of action throughout the film, but this film sets up the action nicely with some characterization which gives us reason why we should side with Jack Reacher. Regarding the action scenes, there are some moves here that I have rarely seen in other action films so that adds some bonus points.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie directed a film about a former army police officer named Jack Reacher who stays hidden unless he wants to be found. When one of his army fellows is convicted of random murders and calls out Reacher, Reacher realizes the guy may be innocent and now he's out to clear both of their names.<br/><br/>On the contrary to what people are saying, this film has a great cast. People are hating on Tom Cruise because he's a short guy, unlike the Reacher in the novels. But they both have wit and determination in common and that is the main thing. Cruise is a perfect choice for this role. Werner Herzog, known as a director of many documentaries, really does his baddie role quite well. Robert Duvall has several wonderful scenes here and he still retains his sharp wit at his older age.<br/><br/>Overall, Jack Reacher is a great action thriller. It may even make you think for a little bit, since this film is smart. It's one of the better action films of 2012 and not only it kicks lots of butt, but it's very suspenseful. I would welcome more of these Reacher films with open arms. I rate this film 9/10."
"JohnnyPHreak","9","3","5","13 May 2014"," Tom Cruise kills it as ex-Military cop Jack Reacher
","Advertisements and trailers can ruin films more so now than ever before. With teaser trailers, full length, TV spots, much of the film can be displayed for the viewer. But because of the way these trailers are cut, it could give the viewer the wrong way to think. Jack Reacher is a film that suffers from the wrong advertising. Banking on mega star Tom Cruise as the lead, the film was portrayed as a normal Tom Cruise action vehicle. Even fans of the book series of which I am were upset that Tom Cruise wasn't the right person to play the part. The most popular reason was he was too short. Reacher is a tall hulking man in the books. <br/><br/>To my delight and not popular opinion Jack Reacher plays out much more like the books than a normal Tom Cruise action film. First and foremost this film is written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects, The Way of the Gun) A film of this nature need a director who could balance thriller with drama and a bit of action. <br/><br/>That's where his film flourishes. This is a mystery thriller with a touch of action. There's no real heavy gun fire until the end and one car chase in the middle. This films lets the characters have most of the screen time and keeps the story going. Tom Cruise is fantastic as Jack Reacher. Hes a hard nosed, take no prisoner, intelligent ex military cop who always has a plan. <br/><br/>This is one of his best performances in years. And I've read he had a lot of fun playing the part. I'd love to see more Reacher films. Rosamund Pike is good but her chemistry with Cruise is when she shines. They play off each other well, with their characters searching for the same answers in totally opposite ways. Richard Jenkins gets to chew some scenes but it's the famous Werner Herzog who steals scenes as one of the films villains. He's terrifying, creeping and intimidating. Robert Duvall shows up in a great extended cameo with all his scenes with Cruise being just pure movie gold.<br/><br/>The action is shot tightly with the two hand to hand fights being the showcase. But the film is more about the characters and trying to figure out this extremely complicated story, This is a different type of action film with more focus on story and characters than big budget action sequences. Jack Reacher is a film that has to be seen because it pulls the viewer in all the way to the final credits. With the news that Cruise is taking his Reacher director to Mission: Impossible 5 has me thoroughly excited."
"Stormchaser99","Null","3","5","15 October 2013"," A good action film
","First of all this movie adapts every aspect of the reacher novels but the portrayal of Reacher And believe me i've read all the books from Lee Child. Cruise may be a suitable choice for action flicks but his physical appearance isn't enough to represent the actual character from the novels. How can you expect him to be a guy who's almost 6 1/2 feet tall?<br/><br/>That's being said the film doesn't disappoint in my opinion. It has a decent story. Acting is good. Cruise may not be that tall but he's done a fine job as an ex-military police officer. Rest of the cast is alright by me. Action scenes are well done. Specially the fight with some thugs outside the bar, it's purely Reacher's style. But i can't say i'm satisfied with the climax. It wasn't thrill enough for me. I'd say director went with the old style there. Of course it's just my opinion and You might actually enjoy it.<br/><br/>One of the best action flicks of 2012. Worth a watch if you are into action films. For all Tom Cruise fans go for it you'll love it. if you are a die hard Jack Reacher fan, well, you can still like it, that is if you forget Jack Reacher's physical appearances for the time being.<br/><br/>I'd give 7+ since i'm a fan of both Reacher and Cruise."

","If I could give this one half star, I would.<br/><br/>Lee Child writes a terrific series of Jack Reacher novels. Unfortunately, this movie does NOT reflect that. Miscasting is the biggest issue. Jack Reacher is 6'5"", big, and very intimidating. Tom Cruise is 5'7"" (probably in heels) and couldn't intimidate my 6 year old granddaughter, let alone any man bigger than 5 feet tall.<br/><br/>To have him play the part of an ex-MP, and supposedly an expert in firearms, hand-to-hand combat, former sniper, etc., is ridiculous. In fact, I would say this is a very good farce. Reminiscent of Dean Martin playing Matt Helm many years ago. I laughed through many parts of the movie as I found Tom Cruise ludicrous. I finally gave up and walked out in disgust.<br/><br/>Redo it with Liam Neeson, Steve Austin, Duane Johnson, or Vin Diesel as Jack Reacher. at least those guys are intimidating. <br/><br/>People not grounded in reality and Tom Cruise fans will undoubtedly like it."

","There seems to be two camps of response to this film: those who have read the novel 'One Shot' by Lee Child and have trouble with the casting and those who come to the film without knowledge of the 'character Jack Reacher. Not having read the book this viewer found the film intensely engrossing, full of smart dialog form writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, and a finely tuned cast of actors who get the opportunity to strut their stuff in this story that seems far shorter than the 130 minutes of the film. Tom Cruise may be short in stature at 5'7"" but at age 50 he is in fine shape, performs all his own car stunts (which are excellent and harrowing), and at least for the novice he does 'become' Jack Reacher.<br/><br/>Briefly, the setting is Pittsburgh, PA and a professional sniper (an exceptionally fine Jai Courtney) shoots dead five seemingly random people. The police quickly capture on James Barr (Joseph Sikora), arrest him, interrogate him (by DA Richard Jenkins and his cohort David Oyelowo and the DA's lawyer daughter Rosamund Pike who seeks to give Barr a fair trial): Barr declares his innocence and his answer to his question of is he guilty is his writing 'Get Jack Reacher'. Barr is beaten unconscious in a van on the way to jail and is comatose. Jack Reacher, ex-military investigator, (Tom Cruise) who despises Jack Barr from their shared military history appears and the action begins. Reacher is only too willing believe that Barr did the crime he's accused of. But when Local criminals try to take out Reacher, he decides to give the case a second look. Soon he's unraveling a much deeper conspiracy.<br/><br/>In addition to the actors mention, there are several excellent cameos by Werner Herzog as a Russian ex-prisoner who knows about survival (he chewed of his own fingers while I prison to ward off gangrene from frost bite), Alexia Fast, Josh Helman, Vladimir Sizov, and Robert Duvall. The story is rich in innuendos, insights into corporate greed and threats form outside sources to take over the country, and some serious chases both by car and on foot. The brilliant cinematography is by Caleb Deschanel and the atmosphere is greatly enhanced by the musical score by Joe Kraemer. But this is a Tom Cruise special and he proves he can still rule the roost as one of the top action heroes in the business. For this genre, this is a fine entertainment. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","We've all seen these type of action-packed detective movies before; watching Jack Reacher reminded me so much of the typical action films of the 90s, such as The Fugitive or US Marshalls. Yes, there is action: Jack Reacher has quite a few cool fight scenes, some shooting, and one car chase scene (probably the most real-looking car chase I've seen since Bullit). However, the action never seems to take the front stage: it's the characters and the mystery story that does.<br/><br/>The story for this film starts off looking like a standard, possibly predictable, affair: a crime happened, police catch a suspect, and you start to get the feeling that things won't go all that simply. What really makes the story unique is that it throws in a totally random element: the Jack Reacher character, who's not really involved with the law at all, but is sent in to investigate and deal with bad guys in his own lawless manner. It's especially interesting that this character is basically a ghost, who can effectively disappear in a crowd and fall off the grid at a whim. The film itself seems to question, who the hell is Jack Reacher? but by the end, you get a good feeling for the answer. With a few major plot twists and good supporting characters, the film does rise a little above and beyond the average police-detective-movie fare.<br/><br/>This film uses some good photography, which features some interesting camera angles, but is mostly pretty plain and straightforward, like most other movies of this type. Editing is good. Acting is generally good, although I still see Tom Cruise as being just more of the same in this. Writing is good. This production uses fine-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music sounded good at times too.<br/><br/>Recommended for fans of the genre.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)"
"JohnRayPeterson","8","5","11","21 April 2013"," Plays like a novel, an action novel
","The popular Lee Child character has finally come to the screen; but as I understand it, Tom Cruise diminutive size (like many action actors though) does not match the novel's character Jack Reacher. So, for those who are not yet familiar with the Jack Reacher series, this won't be a starting negative. To enjoy movies, music and books, one had better separate the creative artists and actors' personal lives from their characters, otherwise life in the arts world will be a bitter series of disappointments. That being said, this movie is packed with twists and turns punctuated by action we've come to expect from Cruise films.<br/><br/>When one looks at his filmography, you get a sense of the genre of stories Cruise likes to get involved with, Lions for Lambs being an exception (good movie by the way), in that he indulges his passion for driving fast and picks characters non too common and bigger than life. He has made few films that weren't commercial successes. This film is again on the mark; the chase scenes are great, the fighting well choreographed and the dialogue is above reproach. The cast is excellent; well, I have a positive bias for Rosamund Pike and Robert Duval to begin with so pardon my expletive.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to all that are not afflicted with the traits I mentioned in the first paragraph."
"silver_wolf15","Null","5","11","19 April 2013"," Better than the reviews let on.
","I have to laugh at the critics that tear this movie apart because of its shallow story and cheesy one-liners. Newsflash folks: the Reacher series is not War and Peace. The books are full of macho stereotypes and cheesy one-liners, and I love them because of that. They are fast paced action novels that take a day or two to read.That's it. I think the film does a wonderful job of bringing the attitude of the books to life. <br/><br/>Now to the subject of Tom Cruise playing the lead role. After I saw the movie, I went on to read most of the books. I do not envision the character as Cruise as I read; the physical characteristics are just too different. What Cruise did do however, was bring the humour and personality of Reacher to the screen. Love or hate Tom Cruise as a person, he's a hell of an actor. <br/><br/>So if you're looking for a emotionally engaging and plot driven movie, take a pass and watch Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. However, if you're in the market for a fast paced action film ala Dirty Harry, then Jack Reacher is for you. And if you're one of the people that hate on Cruise because he's not 6'5 and 250 lbs..get a life. We're lucky they didn't cast Steve Austin or Dolph Lungdren for this kind of action role."

","I have read all 17 of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, and while I was skeptical about Tom Cruise's ability to fill the bill, I think he did an excellent job and the movie was very enjoyable. I could have done without the car chase scene, but I was amazed to see how well the strong character of Reacher and the suspense came through.<br/><br/>This movie would have been a blockbuster if it had been released in September rather than December. To have it released soon after the Sandy Hook shootings, and as the gun control debate rages on, doomed it at the box office. While I still consider Lee Child my favorite author and his Jack Reacher character the best ""knight errant"" of all time, this dooms the Jack Reacher character as he now stands for the future, and unless Lee Child changes horses or remakes Jack Reacher over, it may doom Lee's writing career as well."

","Jason Bourne is a bit erratic and so is James Bond.Not every year brings one of their adventures and thrills to the screen.The number of fantasy adventure and comic book franchises continues to multiply, not always with good results.So there exists a space for a crime fighter who is endowed with the charm of Bond and the superhuman level of training of Jason Bourne. Enter Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher, based on series of bestseller novels by Lee Child.He is an army investigator who decided to quit and became a phantom.He cannot be found unless he wants to be. When 5 people are killed in a random shooting which obviously has been carried out by a person of sniper level capabilities the police act fast and mine the crime scene to nab a suspect.The case against him appears hermetically sealed.His fingerprints,DNA,shell casings everything matches.The district attorney has a big reputation, the files he picks up to prosecute have a 100% conviction rate and the accused often take the choice he gives them – the chair or life.<br/><br/>The suspect this time does neither.He asks for Jack Reacher and in walks Tom Cruise.He wants to be found this time, and turns up very punctually indeed.He informs the investigators that he knows the suspect from the days in service in the gulf.The suspect is indeed a trained shooter and went crazy at the end of his service and shot a few people to scratch his trigger happy fingers.He was let off partly due to Jack Reachers intervention who made a pact that he would be contacted if anything went amiss in future.Reacher examines the evidence and is puzzled, everything fits in too neatly but the modus operandi is at odds with the suspects military training.He would have done it in an easier way, and certainly would not have left the crime scene a goldmine of evidence.Its almost as if he wanted to be caught! We meet the idealist defence attorney Helen played by the beautiful Rosamund Pike. She too is convinced of his guilt but wants to keep him off death row, she has bones to pick with her dad who is the district attorney played a bit unconvincingly by Richard Jenkins, otherwise a superb actor.<br/><br/>With this set up we follow the duo on their race to unravel the truth and suddenly the case does seen as straightforward.The action follows the well trodden path of hunting down an elusive mysterious evil character with obscure motives and the hero acting against his training and impulses to save the damsel in distress.The great German director Werner Herzog and veteran actor Robert Duvall provide some solid character to the film in two small but entertaining roles. What they are up to is not my business to disclose here. Tom Cruise occupies most of the screen time in a performance that is at best a mixed bag.He tries to appear mysterious and trying to exercise tremendous self-control in not revealing his superlative mental and physical prowesses.His turn in Michael Mann's Collateral as a ruthless killer worked better, here in Christopher McQuarrie's lesser hands he loses focus at times.It must a pain being Tom Cruise, with endless divorces and getting remarried to approved brides ""arranged"" by the Church of Scientology. Jack Reacher is an interesting attempt at selling Tom Cruise as a vigilante type ex cop with the killer instincts of Jason Bourne.He neither has the charm of Bond nor the conflicted character of Bourne.Neither does this work as an extension of his Mission Impossible Ethan Hunt character armed with sexy gizmos and feathering incredible stunts.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about this film is the atmosphere it invokes, there are no smartphones in sight and without the few dated cellphones the film could as well have been set in the eighties or even seventies. The black cop who is working the case appears like a seventies Sidney Poitier kind of character down to his suit.His air is that of a racially oppressed soul from the sixties and not a police detective in contemporary America.It is this sense of an unglamorous time and space, which the current lot of films have abandoned, that gives the film its uniqueness. Most striking of course is the crime itself, we seen ordinary people through a rifles telescopic viewfinder.The viewfinder tracks the subjects at random and suddenly five people are dead in what appears chillingly like the many random gun massacres which have happened in the past year in America.The film establishes another kind of potential gun criminal, a crazed war veteran who is trained to kill and cannot do without it.That the kind of weapons used in the army are available in Wall Mart is clearly asking for trouble.<br/><br/>The clammy dialogues are another area where the film slips up, you can literally see the screen writer scratching and rewriting the dialogues which appear forced at times.The film draws to a satisfactory close, albeit without a kiss for the girl from Jack Reacher.Watch it if you need a regular dose of crime thrillers. McQuarrie who wrote the brilliant film The Usual Suspects and some not so great films, is a competent director and creates a timeless atmosphere starting with the great opening sequence but needs to deliver more. I suspect with the number of tickets Tom Cruise is selling, Jack Reacher should be back, maybe with another director.As the tagline goes ""The law has its limits.He does not."""

","I gave the movie a 7. It's pretty good or even a very good movie - if you've not read the books. I haven't read through all the reviews, I guess more of Lee Child's fans have wined already. But there's still the fact that the producers let a midget (Tom Cruise in comparison) portrait a giant. If you've read the books you'll know that that Jack Reacher is a heavy, very tall 6'5"" (1.96 m) muscle bound giant, far from Tom Cruise 5'7"" (1.70 cm). It wouldn't matter that much if the books hadn't put so much weight in the physical appearance of Reacher.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've always imagined a taller Jason Statham as Reacher.<br/><br/>Cheers"

","This is a Tom Cruise vehicle to show him shooting, fist fighting, driving in a car chase etc. Often his vehicles work as in the MI series. <br/><br/>But in this movie the story is silly and not very interesting. The story is bad often boring and meaningless or disgusting. The editing and directing is confusing and abrupt. The casting and acting are bad. Rosamund Pike has a rather expressionless blank face and comes across as cold. Even whie being held captive she looked like she was going to a PTA meeting. NO fear or anxiety on her face at all. Tom tries to be a cool guy but he looks to old for the fist fights gun fights car chases etc. The worst part is when Jack Reacher threw down his gun to fight the bad guy by hand while a hostage was waiting for rescue. <br/><br/>This is a waste of time. A bad novel made into a bad movie. Shouldn't have been adapated for the big screen.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time."

","Released within days of the Sandy Hook massacre, this opens with the apparent random shooting of innocent people by a lone gunman in a car park. At the very best, that's tasteless in the extreme. The 'hero', Jack Reacher, then sets about beating up and killing bad guys. Shooting is too good for one, so he throws aside his automatic rifle and stamps the man to death. The film ends with him executing a crippled, unarmed man. I'm no prude, and like an action film as good as the next man, but the theme of this film played down to the very worst of American culture. It celebrates violent death. At one point Reacher tells the bad guy he's no hero, and I have to agree with him. He's a psychotic killer, although, of course, he only kills bad guys.<br/><br/>This is quite aside from the ridiculous miscasting of Cruise in the role. At one point the detective asks a receptionist if anyone is staying there who could kill a girl with one punch. She singles out Cruise's room. Why? He may be a fine actor, but does he really look like someone who can kill with a single blow? I feel dirty for having sat throw this."

","I haven't read the Reacher books yet but I am about to, dad is a big Reacher fan and he did say he was a little disappointed that Cruise was chosen as Reacher. But his opinion changed after seeing the second trailer for this film. I have been looking forward to this movie for quite a while as it does look really good from the trailers. After seeing it I feel it was a good movie, but for me it was a bit slow at times when he is gathering the evidence. The action sequences in this film are done really well and are very believable. I thought the car chase was outstanding and for me the best part of the movie. It was done very well with influences of the car chase in bullet, meaning no explosions just the car and the driving. Dad felt the movie was very good and he liked Cruise as Reacher, I also felt Cruise portrayed Reacher very well. But for me I felt that some of the characters could have been explained a bit more. I was asking myself at points in the movie what's his story, how does he fit in? Dad said it was very faithful to the book which is good. Overall I feel it was a decent movie, the story was good and the action was good but I felt at points it was a bit slow and could have had more depth in characters. I would like to see another Reacher movie and hope that they will start a franchise from it as I would love to see most books done as movies! A good solid movie which can be enjoyed by all the family!"

","It got off on the wrong foot, fans of the Lee Child novels were up in arms about the casting of Tom Cruise in the title role. He didn't fit the profile it was said, scorn was poured on the film, quite often by people who hadn't even seen it! So how refreshing to find that since I personally have no affinity to the Child books, and having never read anything by the author, I found a wonderfully old fashioned thriller.<br/><br/>Reacher the character is a damn fine creation, an ex military bad ass who doesn't get found unless he wants to get found. He gets involved with jobs that need solving, utilising his special skills to close out the mysteries. Here he pitches up along side defence attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) when an ex army sniper apparently at random kills five people and then mentions Reacher's name during interrogation. Cue twists and turns, rocks upturned for covert clues and a shady road to be trawled to get to the crux of the matter.<br/><br/>Cruise as Reacher is superb, where under the astute directing and writing of Christopher McQuarrie we are left in no doubt this is a cool no nonsense hard man, loved by the ladies and feared by not just the crims, but also the law authorities. None of which is overkilled, it's subtle in execution, McQuarrie doesn't need to turn his film into a blitzkrieg of CGI blunderbuss multiplex pandering. Action is smartly staged, the violence brutal without being course, while the story is delightful in how it gleefully wrong foots the viewers in plot dynamics and sly humour.<br/><br/>The deal is closed out via the sterling supporting turns to Cruise, with Pike, Robert Duvall, Werner Herzog and Jai Courtney adding considerably to this splendid Cruise and McQuarrie broth. In spite of divisive reviews and reports, Jack Reacher in filmic form has risen above that to become a success. Hooray! 7.5/10"

","JACK REACHER.<br/><br/>Yeah, JACK REACHER.<br/><br/>Speaking out this name itself makes me feel excited.<br/><br/>This action thriller has a very unique storyline which makes it worth not just one but many viewings. It has plenty of action sequences and plot twists which will not let you get up from your seat. Reacher is a brilliantly sketched character who will leave an impact on the viewer for sure.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise have always teamed up to deliver exhilaterating action thrillers. The recently released MISSION IMPOSSIBLE FALLOUTis the best example In JACK REACHER, which is a 2012 release, they have created a raging storm which will leave a solid impact in the aftermath.<br/><br/>All actors, including Cruise, have delivered top notch performances. They will be loved, hated and above all, remembered. Tom Cruise has turned out to be the definitive action hero in my eyes. This film just cements his image as an action hero, even more. An action hero, who is as intelligent as he is violent. <br/><br/>The action scenes are exhilarating and very realistic in nature. I rented this film on Google Play and liked one particular action sequence so much that I replayed it after the film was over. There are always some parts of an action sequence which keep sticking in my mind, and this film has many such shots. The opening action scene itself made me speak to myself, ""I need to buy this on DVD!""<br/><br/>It doesn't let down on the technical front either.<br/><br/>Just keep in mind that due to its watertight and complex screenplay, you will have to use your brains a bit. Just stay focused on the film and you will be treated to several surprises. This film is indeed a thinking man's action thriller."

","An ex-army sniper James Barr kills 5 seemingly random victims. The District Attorney's department seek a confession from Barr, but Barr refuses to accept responsibility and demands that the DA's department find Jack Reacher. Jack soon arrives on the scene and as he delves deeper into the case Reacher uncovers a much wider conspiracy...<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Jack Reacher isn't a particularly novel concept and it's also probably fair to say that it has lifted bits and pieces from many other conspiracy films. However, I have to admit that I did find it to be pretty entertaining; director Christopher McQuarrie does a nice job in balancing the story with the action set-pieces meaning that the film has no dull spots.<br/><br/>As an actor I've always found Tom Cruise to be rather hit-and-miss; he often brings a cocksure type swagger and arrogance to a lot of his performances which sometimes makes him a little off-putting to watch. He does this in Jack Reacher, but, ironically, I actually think that this performance served this particular film well (Jack Reacher seemed to have a 'not give a crap attitude' to everything so I felt that this approach actually worked in this film). The supporting cast all put in so-so performances with the possible exception of Werner Herzog (who has a rather chilling calmness about him which proves to be occasionally unnerving).<br/><br/>The weaknesses with this film lie with poorly developed villains and rather disposable victims whom it is impossible to care for or develop much in the way of sympathy for, but I have to give credit to McQuarrie for making this film mostly work and for providing me with a film that proved to be a fairly entertaining 120 minutes."

","I've got to award ""Reacher"" with a 2/10 simply because of the camp. After awhile, the movie is so bad that it's kinda good.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch because TC has a real presence on screen, and I think he very much knows that. What he doesn't know, and what makes him blind, is his vanity. No longer is he willing to take chances like he did in ""Jerry Maguire"". TC simply is not vulnerable anymore; he's here to save the world for all the little people. Period.<br/><br/>So he's 5'6 in real life and they need to shoot him from the ground up and won't do many side by side shots with him and other actors - so what - he's TC. So he has to have every woman desire him and pose with his shirt off in extra long shots while a woman much taller than him is forced to sit and ogle him on the bed, OK, fine. So he never gets nervous when surrounded by thugs who somehow magically turn into keystone cops as bullets are flying at his head. So what if the best sniper in the Army can't actually shoot Reacher. So what if one of the best actors of our time (Duvall) is told to come in at the end and play second fiddle to the great TC. It's a TC production, and it says that from the start.<br/><br/>All you need to know is that this movie was made for a twelve year old or, just maybe, by a twelve year old (guess who). If you don't believe me, watch the scene where the guy is being interrogated at the beginning and he writes on a piece of paper, ""Get Jack Reacher"". He writes this in big block letters for the camera so the audience can see it clearly and so the twelve year old watching can understand what's going to happen next. Oh, and when the camera shows the guy writing this prior, his hand is not tracing huge letters out on the page - he's just writing what looks to be small cursive, as any person would normally write.<br/><br/>I couldn't watch the end, but I'm thinking TC does something awesome there and his hair looks perfect, as it does the whole movie. Maybe a few more minutes of hero worship, I don't know, just thinking out loud now."

Towards last quarter of the movie dialog from Tom Cruise was reminding me of Liam Neeson in the ""Taken"" movies and any moment I expected him to say ""I will find you and hunt you down"",the plot had a familiar feel about it EG: We have the culprit and it's a open and shut case or is it? Enter Jack Reacher,then get the popcorn,get ready for the ride. If you are a fan of Action-Conspiracy-Murder Mysteries and most of all car chase scene's you will enjoy this film,I liked it enough and gave it a worthy seven.

I thought it was a good portrayal but I still think someone like Hugh Jackman ex. Wolverine would have been better.<br/><br/>As One Shot was the very first Jack Reacher book i read I was glad to see it on the big screen and I thought that up until the last 20 minutes it was very good.

The screenplay does not do any justice to the Lee Child's novel. I recommend everyone who saw the movie and liked it should read the novel if they have not done it already. <br/><br/>First the pace of the movie is too fast and it tries to cover lot of things in a very short time without any character development. Then some of the scenes like the bathroom scene lighten the mood but they are so out of character for Jack Reacher that it changes everything any reader knows about Jack Reacher. <br/><br/>The physical aspect of Jack Reacher is as much important as his detective skills. He is someone who prides himself that no one has been able to break his nose but guess this aspect due to the casting of Tom Cruise had to be changed completely.<br/><br/>The Character of Jack Reacher had the potential to be in the league to James Bond or Jason Bourne but sadly it will go down just another character like Alex Cross"

Reacher is a person who would not hesitate to put his neck for justice but one may wonder why here he is on defence side. Jack Reacher movie was based on novel 'One Shot' by Lee Child. The main character was brilliantly portrayed by Tom Cruise and I would not hesitate to say that he did his best in bringing the character to live. I do understand if the fiction novel's fans vehemently disagree and in fact, some gave negative review on Cruise playing the fictional role as Jack Reacher. My disagreement to them is that even though Matt Damon who was terrific in Bourne series, he is considered timid to my perception of Jason Bourne. I read the third series of Ludlum's Bourne Ultimatum after watching the movie. But in my mind, Matt Damon never replaced my perception of Jason Bourne who is also the dark side of David Webb.

","Tom Cruise as an action hero works. The movie contains all the elements for a good action crime movie. Tom Cruise is the star (it's also his movie). He does it all, and does it well. The story is intriguing although a bit contrived and after a while Tom Cruise's anti-hero persona begins to become over baked, but not to the point where it has to be tossed from the oven. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, especially Rosamund Pike who plays the principal female lead. Now, the idea of framing a patsy to a crime is hardly an original one, but this movie manages to apply this formula with good results. There is one chase scene that is especially entertaining. Everybody is chasing everybody, like something out a Keystone Kops movie. But Tom Cruise turns in an energetic performance which keeps the movie together. Robert Duvall is also in this movie and his performance is, not unexpectedly, excellent. He is a great actor. There's a lot of impressive panoramic shots of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where the story is set. Although it's not an earth-shattering major motion picture, the movie entertains and that alone is reason enough to watch it."
"Robert_duder","9","5","12","28 December 2012"," A well made and fascinating flick that keeps you entertained beginning to end
","First of all I have to say how sick and tired I am of hearing from the people that didn't like this film about how Tom Cruise doesn't fit the physical description of Jack Reacher...GET OVER IT!! I have not read any of the Reacher books, although I may start now, but I promise that I couldn't care less whether Cruise fits the physical description of Reacher and Lee Childs doesn't either (supposedly.) When you start to dissect this film and you're sitting there being completely and utterly entertained beginning to end, you see a sheer brilliance in the film making and an incredibly unique experience that will thrill movie goers. Consider this part mystery, part thriller, part 70's Grindhouse, part dark comedy, part action and romantic tension and you have everything you could possibly need to make an outstanding first rate film. They probably did take liberties in creating the film version of Jack Reacher but you have to sometimes and I completely understand wanting more from your favourite literary character but give this film a chance on its own merits and you'll be completely entertained. For the most part it is receiving very good reviews and for good reason. The action scenes at times feel a little forced in order to keep the pace going but still perfectly executed. Reacher is a complete bad-ass and you will root for him at every turn. He's dark, mysterious, angry and brilliant and he makes for a unique and entertaining hero.<br/><br/>I've never stopped liking Tom Cruise as an actor. I think he embodies Hollywood stardom and has for decades. He is easily one of my favourite actors and I couldn't care less about her personal life or religious beliefs. I think he gets a lot of bad press but he performs on screen with very little ego. Becoming Reacher for him is flawless. Delivering his darkly comic one liners is easy and flows for him. The dialogue in this film is so witty and clever and the banter is almost too fast to keep up with but its so easy for Cruise and he nails this role and leads the cast to epic conclusion. Rosamund Pike in many ways feels like a ""Bond"" girl to Cruise's Reacher. She's beautiful and her reactions to things are almost campy (many things in the film are purposely campy but I'll get to that in a moment.) There is absolutely no doubt that the director carefully plans camera shots to revolve around Pike's cleavage and body and face to sexualize her and yet the character is not overtly sexual. The tension between her and Cruise is brilliant and yet they never actually solidify any romance. It keeps the tension throughout the film. Richard Jenkins is a great character actor and he has a decent role as Pike's DA father but the role is small and he barely gets any good lines so he is sort of left in the dust in an otherwise dialogue-smart film. David Oyelowo is decent as the detective butting heads with Reacher. He delivers a lot of monotony to the character so he certainly doesn't stand out amongst a strong leading cast. Legendary Hollywood actor and director Werner Herzog is the perfect villain. He too comes across as a ""Bond"" type character and my only regret is that we don't see more of him. They sort of leave him a little underdeveloped but he is still a brilliant and downright evil villain. Jai Courtney is his number one man and our sniper. He plays a great role and the perfect adversary to Cruise's Reacher. Their fight is epic and they both play a key role in a truly outstanding car chase scene (the best I have seen since the Bourne films.) Robert Duvall makes a late in the movie appearance in a great Hollywood legend type cameo and him and Cruise are terrific opposite each other. Duvall is used just the right amount.<br/><br/>I would go so far to say that director and screenplay writer Christopher McQuarrie has created one of the best films of the year, at least the latter part of the year. Is it perfect? No. There are some less than stellar supporting performances and the very quick banter takes some getting used to. However, consider that he created a film with some purposely campy content, a film that is literally funny throughout and yet never takes away from the intensity or the darkness or the action. I think he pays homage to the drive in action films of the 70's and 80's and delivers some incredible cinematography. Parts of this film will make you feel like you are watching Dirty Harry (a great compliment in my opinion,) but then the film also feels a little like a good old fashion Schwarzenegger movie, or an old school mystery detective film. The movie goes through so many different iterations of genres that you will just find yourself completely entertained and that is the goal. The film is so smartly written. The constant back and forth and the way Reacher does his investigating is just a blast to watch. The film is fun, action packed (albeit the action scenes feel a little forced at times), sexy, savvy and the perfect movie theatre experience. Cruise fans can rest easy because this is him in top form. I hope it does well enough to warrant sequels because I want to see Jack Reacher again!! 9/10"
"GManfred","Null","4","9","21 June 2013"," Good Action/Mystery Movie
","Really enjoyed ""Jack Reacher"", even though I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan. I haven't read any of the books but to my mind he did a fine job as Lee Child's omniscient superhero. A friend tells me that in the books he is supposed to be much bigger, and Cruise is on the small side, but it didn't matter. He is surrounded by a very good cast, including Rosamund Pike, Robert Duvall and, especially, the great Werner Herzog.<br/><br/>Although there is a pretty high body count, the emphasis is on a mystery that, at first glance, isn't much of a mystery. A former Army sniper is accused of a random shooting in which five people are killed. He calls on Jack Reacher, who appears mysteriously, to aid his cause. As you can probably guess, things are not what they seem.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with director McQuarrie, but he turns in an excellent job of moving things along - there is precious little downtime - and allowing the mystery to gradually unfold without a lot of contrived confusion. There is a thrilling car chase and along the way several baddies get their comeuppance. Does it all hold water? Don't be a killjoy. My headline says it all. If you get a chance and are a fan of this genre, rent it and watch it."

Robert Duvall as usual made the most of his scenes and the interaction with Cruise was great.The movie flowed with great action, a terrific story and superb entertainment throughout. All the normal ingredients for a great flick are there, cops, corruption, mystery and intrigue. Once again, Tom Cruise has reinvented himself to prove his critics wrong.

","I've heard the grousing from those who had read the book first, and all I can say is, I'm glad I didn't. Unfortunately for them, that doesn't reduce my enjoyment of this film. I experienced it as a very enjoyable film gently advocating a certain philosophy of justice. No, really, to my mind this is a gentle argument despite the violence in it. <br/><br/>The idea that Jack Reacher is not one to let the bad guys play the system is not immediately apparent. What you first see is an extraordinarily observant and highly skilled investigator. It's only after a series of perilous events that his intolerance for poor organizational outcomes is revealed. While we're contemplating outcomes, check out the villain's management techniques when Werner Herzog, as Zec, has to discipline one of his henchmen. It's truly one of the most memorable cameos I've ever seen. My wife who is hardly the violent sort enjoyed every minute of this movie which makes me think there are no real gender issues here.<br/><br/>I very much appreciate getting the best ideas of a good novel without having to trudge through the wordy details. (I don't enjoy reading fiction much. I'd much rather see it on the screen, interpreted in a fulsome and honest way as here.) Cruise plays Reacher to the hilt though I understand that physically he doesn't really make you think of the book's Jack. That doesn't really matter as Cruise is fully in tune with the book's message and delivers it passionately. I can only hope this movie leads to a franchise for him as I'll certainly see it on the big screen next time ahead of its DVD release."
"gstepup","8","4","9","4 February 2013"," Tom Cruise overcomes miscasting and adds JACK REACHER to his rich repertoire of diverse roles
","(SPOILERS!) JACK REACHER. A private investigator (they used to be called P.I.'s in the old days) named Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is reluctantly called in by a pretty defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) to unravel the mystery behind 5 seemingly random shootings. But Reacher finds out the accused guy, Barr (Joseph Sikora), is the trigger-happy Army soldier who was responsible for several shootings but got away with it. And Reacher, who was also previously in the Army as a criminal investigator, has vowed to put him away for life if he catches Barr doing it again. As layer by layer of this crime story unravels, we find the pretty lawyer, Helen Ronin, actually going against the grain -- her father (Richard Jenkins) is the D.A.! And Reacher himself is such a shady character both Ronin and her father, at odds with each other from the get-go, try to dig for skeletons in Reacher's closet. Is Barr guilty, or is he just being set up? Throw in for good measure a police detective (David Oyelowo) who has his own secrets and the guilty sniper himself, Charlie (Jai Courtney)... as Reacher and Ronin delve deeper, somebody is willing to murder again and again.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie is the brilliant writer behind 1995's THE USUAL SUSPECTS (a favorite of several cinephiles I call friends); 2000's THE WAY OF THE GUN; 2008's Tom Cruise Hitler-themed film VALKYRIE; and 2010's Angelina Jolie/Johnny Depp whodunit THE TOURIST. McQuarrie writes convoluted plots well, and let's see how his two upcoming Tom Cruise films will fare (supposedly a TOP GUN SEQUEL, and MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 5 in 2015). But with JACK REACHER, McQuarrie (who wrote AND directed) again amazes us with his skill of crafting a film with seemingly easy plots that quickly unravel and exposes truths and untruths in startlingly compelling manner. I'm sure if JACK REACHER, based on the Lee Child novels, had a secondary female role, McQuarrie would have been up to the task and weave it in seamlessly.<br/><br/>Lee Child fans are quibbling about Cruise's (mis)casting, pointing out such specifications as ""he stands 6'5"" and weighs 250 lbs..."" but Cruise is such a magnetic movie star that you find yourself being drawn in... in fact, much as others would dismiss this as just another Bond/Bourne wannabe, McQuarrie has crafted a worthy thriller, with only two setbacks: (1) as character study, JACK REACHER fails to give us insight into what makes Reacher tick, how was his past like (an in-passing dossier narration by Ronin and/or the D.A. father doesn't count!), and (2) the chemistry between Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike, the sexual tension is there, but is left obliquely hanging in the wind. Pike is lovely (never more so in WRATH OF THE TITANS) and her characterization, strong, isn't a mere decoration or caricature of a lady lawyer, and I don't know if in the novel ""One Shot"" Reacher and Helen have a bed scene, but the film's last third leaves you thinking it's like a Charles Bronson dramatic thriller but with Bronson ignoring the delights of, say, a Lee Remick or Jill Ireland. I say this without being a male chauvinist pig, just my usual hopeless-romantic self.<br/><br/>Robert Duvall, all of 82 (an a renowned Argentine tango aficionado), and esteemed film director Werner Herzog, 71, add welcome brio as an ally and a heavy, respectively, while TV star Alexia Fast makes her mark as a wilful nymphet who meets a grisly end. Cruise tries to give a different spin to such a character as this, although on the printed page it could be not much different from his signature Ethan Hunt, or the Jason Bourne/James Bond cornucopia of indestructible secret agents, and because of McQuarrie's able pen and direction, succeeds (nitpicking critics be damned). The supporting cast, especially Courtney and Oyelowo, and even a trio of young goons, are also up to par. All through out the action never lags, although McQuarrie and cast have chosen to paint the film as a character study with a relaxed pacing and layer-by-layer exposition.<br/><br/>Kudos to Joe Kramer's throbbing music; also, Caleb Deschanel photographs JACK REACHER glossily. As a footnote, I've been seeing the trailer of JACK THE GIANT SLAYER (directed by Bryan Singer of X-MEN fame), and I can't wait to see how McQuarrie has penned the characters of Jack, the princess, the townsfolk and the giants."

","I was pleasantly surprised about how much I liked this movie. I went in and picked between this and Django. I saw the previews and it looked awesome. All I can say about this movie is, it WAS awesome. Worth spending the money and going to see in theaters. With the sound effects it really comes through on the big screen. <br/><br/>Guns, Action, Muscle cars. What else is there not to like. It was action packed and suspenseful. The mystery to the movie kept your focus and it had a good ending which is hard to find now days. The quality of the movie was very good and you can tell they wanted to make a great action movie. Highly recommended it. It's a movie worth buying and having in your collection. I think it's one of the best movies out there since Sky fall. If you go and see it, you wont be disappointed."

","Following the massacre of five seemingly random people, a former military sniper named Barr demands to speak to ""Jack Reacher"". The District Attorney (Richard Jenkins) and the lead Detective (David Oyelowo) meet the mysterious Reacher, a former Military Policeman who has dropped off the grid for the past few years but reappeared on the behest of Barr. Reacher works with private attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) to find out the real question: is Barr actually guilty, or the pawn in a much larger game?<br/><br/>""Jack Reacher"" is based on an excellent book series by Lee Child. ""One Shot"", this film's premise, is actually the ninth book in the series, but had one of the most intriguing premises to make a movie on. Tom Cruise produced the film, and under the direction Christopher McQuarrie we have an action blockbuster that doesn't dumb itself down and keeps the audience asking questions as the intelligently-laden suspense slowly provides answers. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise tends to play effectively the same role whenever you see him in a movie, and here he does a great job playing Ethan Hunt's stunt double. Reacher is very smart and uses his military experience to put together realizations no one else would be able to. Cruise is funny and relatable here. It may be one of his best performances yet, especially in an action film. <br/><br/>Rosamund Pike is as gorgeous as she is a good actress. Here she is tasked with making conclusions at the pace of the audience, and looking great opposite Reacher (no question as to either of those abilities). The only problem with her character is the lack of much character development. She is the leading lady and that's sadly the extent of her role. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is a truly eclectic mix of actors you wouldn't expect to see together. The director Werner Herzog plays a murderous mobster Siberian who spent time in the infamous gulags and was forced to earn his name of ""the Prisoner"". Robert Duvall plays a former Gunnie who befriends Reacher and helps with the investigation. Jenkins isn't in the film much but is as good as he always is. <br/><br/>Problems come through where they typically do in an action movie: the script. The Prisoner's connection with the mystery is never laid out in a clear way; we are forced to make a lot of our own conclusions, none of them it would seem are correct. Barr's connections and the reveal of who is ""in on it"" don't hang together as well as they should. But none of that really matters. <br/><br/>""Jack Reacher"" is an intelligent, comedic, always interesting action movie that kept my attention, and for that I am grateful."

","When I first heard about the movie I wasn't anticipated at all, especially the title. I have never heard about the book either that the movie is based on, as I watched it I wasn't really to excited at all. As the movie pass about 30 minutes the story started to get really compelling and my likeness to the character that Cruise is playing is increasing. I have to be honest there were moments that looks a little bit cheesy to me, but they were cured thank to Tom Cruise.The story and plot is different to what I thought it should be, a very nice touch especially the ending which leaves me wanting more. The acting by Cruise is excellent as always, I was quite surprised to see Robert Duvall, and Rosumand Pike's acting was great. If there is a sequel I would be looking forward to it, it is a great movie to watch for the holidays for people who loves action and a bit of mystery."

","I went to see the new Tom Cruise movie: Jack Reacher. Like the Mission Impossible movies Tom did not disappoint for action, but unlike those action movies, Jack Reacher proves to be a ""thinking man's movie."" Lots of twists and guessing, right up to the last minute (The story follows through and feels like you're reading a great novel!) And best of all, for me anyway, was identifying with the character Jack Reacher: you could say that, in a way, I want to BE Jack Reacher, a man with only one shirt of his back, no car, no weapons, no toys, no nothing, just free to jump on the next bus already. There's a point where he directs the audience's attention to the offices across the street, and we see ourselves, doing what we do every day, whether we enjoy doing what we do or not, we are there come 9am and we are there come 16h49. Robert Duvall, a now very old Robert Duvall comes into the story late, but brings an endearing part.... and some great humor. It's been a while since I've heard collective chuckles in a cinema. And last but not least Tom Cruise sets the hearts (and other places in us women) on fire as he sometimes can do.... he certainly has Bond-girl Rosamund Pike hot under the collar. But of course, his character is like Superman, comes only when he is needed and never ever has romantic liaisons, no matter how much he is attracted to this sassy lawyer. (Pike) So I guess Jack Reacher will be back? I certainly hope so."

If the reviews are any indication many are going to the movies expecting perfect works of art. What happened to going to the movies with a blank slate and just enjoying the movie for entertainment's sake? Heck yeah, the movie isn't perfect. Yes, this is not Cruise's finest work. Yes, there are plot holes big enough for that gigantic dump truck to fit through. And, yes there are moments where the action is incredibly improbable enough for the viewer to have cause to choke on their popcorn. But, so what? The movie despite its imperfections was fun to watch and enjoy for what it was- an action-filled suspenseful drama. The kind we expected to see as teens when we went to the movies on Saturday afternoons to be entertained. In this movie was lots of action, suspense, sexual tension between Cruise's character and the gorgeous lawyer, great villains, and good wins out over evil. Sadly,you must be a hopeless cynic if you did not enjoy this flick. Too many these days are in a frenzy to analyze a film to death and show themselves to be film critic wanna-be's. We commonly call those kinds of people ""Haters."" Relax people, just sit back and enjoy this movie sole as entertainment."

There was some pretty bad acting on Rosamund Pike and Richard Jenkins part, silly plot twists, and conclusions that were drawn with no evidence to support them; and Tom Cruise was just being his typical Tom Cruise self (I really wish he did more interesting roles more often, he really is a good actor when in the right situation).<br/><br/>Oh, and as the title mentions; I never read the book, but I have heard descriptions of the main character from it. In one of the most bizarre pieces of dialog; some of the characters in the movie are clearly describing the physique of the Jack Reacher from the book and not the Tom Cruise version...why something like that would be in the movie is completely beyond me."

No. Does it matter that this role is interchangeable with his Mission Impossible character? Not really. <br/><br/>It's too bad, because Jack Reacher, as characters go, is unique.

","Tom Cruise... Like all his other movies manages to create a character that gives the sense that originality still exists. Although he gives the sense of the know-it-all guy that plans to save the damsel in distress, he does so through justification. If there's one thing I know about Tom Cruise, it's that he gives more than a hundred percent for each character he portrays. This movie is gripping from beginning to end and is one crazy fun filled ride that is sure to capture your attention once the beginning credits start to roll. The idea of conspiracy is a story that will never cease to amaze as long as it is executed properly and this movie does just that, along with the help of cinematography to reel you into a story that is sure to delight even those who thought they never would've liked it to begin with. For me, it is impossible to hate a Tom Cruise film. Now that aside, the movie is definite must watch and I would recommend this film 10 times out of 10."

After the honey-moon of the first 30-45 minutes I expect an intelligent plot to develop. An intelligent plot consists of a developed protagonist, antagonist and reasonable conflict. Jack Preacher lacks all three. After an hour I started wondering ""what's the point?"". Finally, they bring in Robert Duvall in the final act. I found myself thinking that they brought in a big name actor to save the film. This movie is over-rated at a ""7"" and the story is lacking. Motives are lacking.

Over all an enjoyable movie, that you will not regret spending 2 hours to watch. Did I mention, it had some clever sarcastic funny bits? Miss Pike, in my opinion, did the best acting over all.

It's a fine line. The movie has a good set of icy-cold villains as well to boot. They are well conceived and played well by Werner Herzog and Jai Courtney. The movie also has some well choreographed fight scenes to add to the action. Some solid entertainment and recommended."

","Right from the outset, you can tell Jack Reacher is neither original nor particularly unique: a mystery thriller, albeit on grander scale than your average independent film. I watched my version expecting what the trailer promised, a simple, high-budget, enjoyable action romp with Tom Cruise. What I got was a world better. The writers have employed a traditional 12-chapter mystery formula which works wonders and manages to keep your interest piqued from start to finish. <br/><br/>Jack Reacher does fall short in the villain department which is occupied with some uninteresting thirty-something Americans who do all the dirty work for their Russian kingpin boss. There are a few clichéd scenes, but this can all be forgiven thanks to the carefully layered mystery and solid performances from the main cast.<br/><br/>Grand set-pieces and gritty action further add to the thrill value in Jack Reacher. The opening sniper scene is particularly tense and intriguing, though you will be torn trying to choose a favourite set piece as the film is riddled with memorable moments and enough action to satisfy even the most stubborn Die Hard fan. The film is well-cast, and despite a laboured American accent Rosa Pikes is suitable as the starry-eyed solicitor assigned to defend the accused. Tom Cruise, as always, does his typecast performance well and injects his character with enough humanity for us to understand and appreciate Jack Reacher. Go, pay the $15, and enjoy Jack Reacher for what it is. You won't regret it."
"davidgee","7","4","10","29 December 2012"," Ethan Hunt recycled
","Fans of Lee Childs's long-running thriller series went into a hissy fit when vertically-challenged brunette Tom Cruise was cast as six-foot-plus blonde super-hunk Jack Reacher, but - hold your horses, guys! - little Tommy does a decent enough job of 'morphing' - one could even say recycling - his Ethan Hunt persona into Jack Reacher.<br/><br/>Reacher is a kind of freelance vigilante called in by hotshot lawyer Rosamund Pike whose client is the fall-guy for a 'spree' shooting in Pittsburgh. Reacher quickly carves a swathe through assorted thugs and corrupt cops. The tone of the film is oddly low-key, but writer/director Christopher McQuarrie shoehorns in a series of violent fights, car chases and shoot-outs which add a jerky momentum to the movie.<br/><br/>There's no chemistry between Pike and Cruise (to be fair, the plot doesn't call for any), and the bad guys have been recruited from Rent-a- Thug with Werner Herzog slipped in as their leader without any motivation that I could fathom. Robert Duvall almost steals the movie in a cameo role as a shooting-range owner. The lack of back story to both Reacher and the villains leaves a gaping hole in the plot. Ultimately, like the MISSIONS IMPOSSIBLE, this is simply a vehicle for Tom Cruise. Luckily for us, he seems to have a bottomless supply of on screen charisma which allows him to slip into a role that is more than a little reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's nameless avenger in those early spaghetti Westerns.<br/><br/>If there are to be sequels (Lee Child has written more Reacher novels than Fleming original Bond stories), Jack Reacher will need to have some flesh added to his well-toned bones. This is better than some of the weaker 007 movies but it is nowhere near as edgy and suspenseful as any of the Bourne franchise."

","I did not have great expectations from the movie when I walked in to the hall. But, after watching the movie I was impressed on a lot of factors. This one is an action movie outright with murder(s) mystery thrown in. I felt the action sequences in the movie (although set-pieces here and there) were executed very well. Tom Cruise as the Military Cop 'Jack Reacher' gives a rather subdued performance that really bodes well for the character as well as the movie. Rosamund Pike as the Defence Attorney for the accused has also done well. The supporting cast of Jenkins and others give a very good support and thrust to the storyline to have it race forward.<br/><br/>That brings us to the Screenplay and Direction. That's both by Chris Mcquarie. I felt that the humor-laced screenplay was pretty good. As a director, Chris tries to ensure that the story moves on in a steady pace although we (as the audience) get the jigsaw puzzle figured out somewhere in the middle of the movie. Slick editing and good cinematography ensures that the audience interest lingers on.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie given the way Cruise portrayed the character of 'Reacher'. Guess that we've more in line in terms of sequels as this happens to be a home production of Cruise.<br/><br/>My rating would be a 7 out of 10. Regards, Ganesh."
"rochelle-rochelle","7","4","10","28 December 2012"," Car Chase Scene Worth the Price of Admission!!!
","'Jack Reacher' is a action-filled thriller with a lot of humor and an ending that alludes to a sequel. A military-trained sniper is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and it's up to Jack Reacher to find the truth.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher, however, to me it just looked and sounded like a continuation of his military lawyer role in 'A Few Good Men'. Tom Cruise knows how to make good movies, be he just doesn't know how to absorb himself in a character to make us forget it's him playing a character. He won't be earning any Oscar nods for this role or film.<br/><br/>Jai Courtney is a name you should familiarize yourself with because he was convincing as a cold-blooded villain who really seemed to enjoy being bad. Werner Herzog, the master villain, is chillingly amazing and will terrify you to the bone without him even saying a word. Rosamond Pike, who plays Helen, doesn't bring much to her role except a heaving cleavage that is hard not to look at when on screen.<br/><br/>All the action and fight sequences will leave you laughing, which is their intent. However, the car chase scene is absolutely amazing, chilling, jaw-dropping and will have you on the edge of your seat until the ultimate conclusion which is hilarious!!! A black extra at a bus stop adds the cherry on top of this wonderful car chase scene. He doesn't even say a word, yet he made the end of that scene amazing! That scene alone was worth the price of admission! <br/><br/>If you are looking for a fun thriller with minimal cursing, no nudity, a lot of action and humor peppered throughout, then this film is for you. The opening scene of the film is not for children because it is rather violent, and then later in the film a ""rape rally"" event is mentioned (but not shown). Younger audiences may not understand that term, so be ready to explain it. There are several fight/action sequences that might scare younger viewers, but that older audiences would enjoy, even laugh at, but that's also something to consider when bringing kids to this movie.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie that should be seen on the big screen with a killer Dolby stereo surround system so you can feel the vibrations from the Chevelle in your seat during the car chase scene."
"dbranan","8","4","10","28 December 2012"," Much better than I expected!
","I never expect much from a Tom Cruise film. Actually, that's not true. I always expect it to be a Tom Cruise ego stroke-athon, and in that respect I was not disappointed. In every scene where Tom walks into a crowded bar or store or whatever, it seems clear that every woman has been given the direction to point an ""I want you"" look at Tom. Perhaps this is just the natural response to Tom's manliness; perhaps he exudes great wafts of pheromones that women can't resist - I admit that I don't actually know. OK, I got that off my chest, now let's get to the movie.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I really liked this film. The acting and character development is uniformly good, and particularly so in the case of David Oyelowo - I'll have to go find some of this guy's other films. Even the villains are pretty well developed instead of just being disposable generic bad guys. Werner Herzog is excellent as The Zec, and I just wish Arnold Schwarzenegger would take a cue from a fellow European septuagenarian and pick a few roles that are age-appropriate for him, (Werner is only 5 years older). Rosamund Pike is excellent in her role and perfectly cast for the part, in my opinion. I just wish she would get past her distinctly noticeable reluctance to allow her teeth to contact one another when she speaks - it's really distracting. <br/><br/>But what really sets this film apart from most of what I've seen this year (or in the past few years) is the fact that it has a discernible plot that isn't full of logical holes and discontinuities. Oh, there are a few - it isn't perfect - but it's a distinct improvement over such films as the recent James Bond outing (see my review). It's even better (story-wise) than the Bourne movies, in my opinion (although it can't touch the Bourne Identity for sheer intrigue). I've seen other reviews knocking the lack of ""action"" in this film, but I thought it was balanced perfectly with the dialogue and story development. The action served the story, rather than just being there for it's own sake, as it seems to be in most ""action"" films of the past few years.<br/><br/>So, if you like a good action film that actually has a plot and some solid acting, go see Jack Reacher. If you can look past Cruise's palpable narcissism, you'll really enjoy this movie!"

","Either the intention was to give us some serious comic predictability or the pastiche of caricatures just didn't hang together as they made it. Rosamund pike is laughable - how could a lawyer be so dense about even basic investigation and suffer from a total lack of any initiative. Between that, her sponge roller hair clapped to her head and the over enunciated husky voice with her teeth almost not in properly made her character idiotic. It just wasn't even an old fashioned PI moll part either she either can't act well or the script and direction didn't do her any favors. Those scenes where she rolls her eyes like nookie bear made me laugh out loud. The close character scenes are painful and the baddie scenes again gave me much mirth. A 10 year old boy couldn't have made up such clichéd nonsense. The car scene was well done as was the two thugs foiling each other in the house while trying to get jack ( there had to be two ). Cruise Was watchable but the film is stilted and has every two dimensional crime thriller scene imaginable. I don't buy the nods to older movies such as Dirty Harry, it's not good enough for that, the direction is average and it amused for all the wrong reasons. Dim stuff."

The dialog and scenes were contrived. Maybe the director intended us to laugh. At best there was only a glimmer of real connection between Reacher and Rodin. I was Disappointed that the film didn't utilize Pike's talent.<br/><br/>One of the suspects is Police Commissioner Rodin, Helen's Dad (Richard Jenkins). But, the movie also Fails to utilize Jenkins' talent (Indie film The Visitors, or comedy Step Brothers).<br/><br/>On the plus side, the clues are interesting along with Reacher's insight and keen observations regarding deciphering the clues. In addition, there is a halfway decent car chase, although most action film fans would probably prefer the car chases in Bullitt (Steve McQueen, 1968). Reacher does contain some amusing scenes with aging rifleman Cash (Robert Duvall). But...<br/><br/>In my opinion, in total, Nothing new here. Same old, same old.<br/><br/>On the other hand, my college roommate Jeff thought Reacher was entertaining. Though he admitted he had no expectations. Needless to say, it's difficult to undercut zero.<br/><br/>My son Michael, 14, liked the movie too. He thought it was interesting, cool and he liked the action/fighting scenes. Okay Mike, but we really need to see some more action/adventure movies.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Wait for cable.<br/><br/>Instead, take a good look at Director Christopher McQuarrie's The Usual Suspects (1995). Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne deliver sterling performances, and the suspense boils through to the credits.<br/><br/>If you like action/adventure and Rosamund Pike, go with James Bond's Die Another Day (2002). Or if you like the classics, try Pride & Prejudice (2005).<br/><br/>If you're a Tom Cruise fan, then Risky Business (1983) is your ticket. Or perhaps the Mission Impossible movies.<br/><br/>If you like Richard Jenkins, go for The Visitor (2007). This great Indie film offers terrific insight into New York City culture and illegal immigration.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher Recommendation: wait for cable, or not.<br/><br/>Arthur VanDam, film critic and author"

","It's always nice to see Tom Cruise appear in an action movie. While he's no Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson, his performance alone makes this worth watching. It's refreshing to see that he and lawyer Helen have nothing more than a professional relationship, something that's not in the movies too often (or maybe I have a bad memory). Also, the character of Sandy is nonessential to the movie. They first meet in a bar, but so what? If there was a point to this so-called meeting, I must have missed it. Robert Duvall has a thankless role as a gun shop owner, and one of the characters (whose name I won't spoil), I'm sorry to say, is yet another of Hollywood's good guy-turned bad characters.

"zardoz-13","8","5","14","23 December 2012"," Good 4 A Cruise or 2
","I enjoyed the new Tom Cruise thriller ""Jack Reacher,"" but I'm not a big Tom Cruise fans. Since I rarely have enough time to read the right stuff, I haven't perused any of the seventeen Jack Reacher novels about a former U.S. Army investigator who roams the country like a lone wolf. Sounds to me like Cruise is searching for another franchise to topline. Award-winning, international bestselling author Lee Child is an interesting fellow himself. Actually, his real name is Jim Grant, and he was born in 1954. A former Granada Television producer, he hails from Great Britain, but has since moved to America. He acknowledge that Cruise look nothing like his literary character, but he has praised this cinematic adaptation. Chris Hemsworth, Dwayne Johnson, and Liam Neeson might have been better in the titular role. Nevertheless, this intelligent but contrived murder/mystery couldn't have been released at a worse time. It will be interesting to see how major Hollywood blockbusters about gun-toting heroes fare in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. The worst thing you can say about ""Jack Reacher"" is that it is a gritty but formulaic police procedural with murky bad guys conducting calculated criminal acts. No maniacs break into schools and murder innocent lambs. As entertaining as ""Jack Reacher"" is, this Paramount Pictures release doesn't surpass other Cruises epics, such as ""Collateral,"" ""Top Gun,"" ""Mission Impossible 2,"" ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol,"" and ""The Last Samurai."" Basically, ""Jack Reacher"" qualifies as an energetic, above-average, but predictable murder mystery. Tom Cruise and his leading lady Rosamund Pike kindle little chemistry. At an imposing 130 minutes, ""Jack Reacher"" couldn't have made time for a romance between the itinerant hero and the district attorney's virtuous daughter. Several scenes are questionable, and some things just don't seem right. Happily, ""Jack Reacher"" boasts more hits than misses. A restrained Cruise appears to be channeling Paul Newman with his laconic performance, but ""Jack Reacher"" isn't a role that fits him like a glove. Basically, this Spartan, low-key thriller could have used a rewrite or two to enhance it. Moreover, if screen veteran Robert Duvall—long past his prime—hadn't shown up for the bullet-blasting finale, ""Jack Reacher"" wouldn't be worth jack. Comparisons between the film and a synopsis of the novel indicate writer & director Christopher McQuarrie hasn't deviated drastically from the source material. Consequently, ""Jack Reacher"" amounts to an origins epic. Cruise plays an enigmatic individual, not unlike the Jim Caviezel character John Reese in the CBS-TV seriesn""Person of Interest."" Resourceful guys like these two live off the grid. The chief difference is Reacher shuns the kind of support Reese has in the form of computer genius Harold Finch.<br/><br/>When a deadly sniper guns down several people in broad daylight without warning in Pittsburgh, the local authorities get a break and capture the unsuspecting gunman. The local District Attorney tries to bully a confession out of their suspect, an ex-Army sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora of ""Safe""), but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he asks them to contact Jack Reacher. Before his case comes up for trial, Barr is badly beaten up in prison and his life hangs in the balance. Out of nowhere, Jack Reacher materializes with everybody least expects him. Reacher talks with the D.A., and later with Barr's attorney, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike of ""Die Another Day""), who has taken the case against her father's stern advice. Repeatedly, Reacher assures Helen that he is not a defense witness. He explains to Helen that Barr left the Army after going on a shooting rage. when he didn't have a chance to rack up any kills in his combat zone. The more that Reacher investigates the shootings, the more he comes to believe that Barr is a patsy. Nothing that the real shooter did corresponds with anything that Barr would have done based on his military training. Before it is over with, our hero reexamines the casualties of the massacre and finds the answer to a cover-up that looks like it goes into the highest levels of law enforcement in Pittsburgh, the Office of the District Attorney.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, ""Jack Reacher"" isn't a high-octane actioneer, but it is both believable and complex. McQuarrie keeps our hero jumping through flaming hoops throughout most of the action. An exciting, urban car chase with Cruise actually behind the wheel and a no-nonsense street fight enliven the action when a variety of characters aren't conferring about the business at hand. Among film geeks, Christopher McQuarrie is known as the guy who wrote the classic thriller ""The Usual Suspects."" Not only did McQuarrie not adapt Lee Child's crime thriller about a mysterious ""Lone Ranger"" type who spurns all twenty-first century conveniences to solve crime, but he also directed it. McQuarrie proves once again that he is a better writer than a director. Some scenes play better than others. The supporting cast, including Richard Jenkins as the District Attorney and David Oyelowo as a Pittsburgh detective, are good. ""Jack Reacher"" is worth seeing at least once in a movie theater."
"centralbeerangi-307-394889","8","5","14","23 December 2012"," More to this than meets the eye
","Here is a unabashedly geeky review of the movie that I enjoyed tremendously. <br/><br/>This film--and I mean film--is lean and brutal. It has been criticized for being predictable and fans of the Reacher novels have decried the choice of Cruise to play this character on screen. The main complaint about Cruise is that he does not fit the description of Reacher in the novels. I believe that both criticisms are unwarranted--you may of course disagree.<br/><br/>First, the story. As far as the story is concerned, this not a mystery which is solved in the final reel. It was not supposed to be one either and so I am not sure about why some people are unhappy about the plot. All the cards are placed on the table about 70 percent of the way in and I had no issues with that at all. <br/><br/>Director/screenwriter McQuarrie has done an excellent job of structuring the narrative and filming Cruise in such a manner that I loved the ""predictability"" because the film does a great job of setting up the bad guys that you are just itching for their comeuppance at the hands of Reacher--and the film delivers this in full satisfying measure! This action film does not wimp out in the climax and the on screen events are completely consistent with the remainder of the story. <br/><br/>As for Cruise, well he has toned up and looks mean and moves very fluidly and I had no problem accepting this guy was a brute force with tremendous intelligence --not to be trifled with. The genius of the film is that the director and the ace cinematographer Caleb Deschanel (the father of Bones' Emily) have composed every shot featuring Cruise to maximize his on screen presence: they shoot him ground up; they swoop down from the top; the camera swirls around him and even in medium shots they shoot Cruise to fill the wide screen. This is so well done, I was not the least bit concerned that Cruise, physically, is not the man described in Lee Child's novels.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, there is not a single jitter shaky cam shot to be seen (at least that registered to my mind). Wow! How refreshing. To add to this bounty, here is a rare (for today when everything is digital) example of filming on film using an anamorphic lens (i.e. CinemaScope). To me it was obvious that a great amount of thought had gone into framing of the compositions. Full use is made of the widescreen aspect ratio. And unlike what happens in numerous ""Super 35"" films, this director does not crop off heads at the forehead in close ups!<br/><br/>The result? A gorgeously ""filmed in Panavision"" action thriller. Mr. Deschanel's (he has filmed the Patriot and the Natural and other good looking films) lensing here is a sight to behold: warm colors, sharp focus, and a steady image where you can see and relish the film makers taking you for a ride. Kevin Stitt's editing is also noteworthy (he did Mel Gibson's Payback an underrated action movie leaving aside Mr. Gibson's personal issues). The action scenes are cut to thrill and not disorienting in the least. The car chase is one of the best edited sequences I have seen in recent years. I say this not because the stunts are eye-popping but because you know exactly what the hunter and the hunted are doing or are trying to do at each moment of the chase.<br/><br/>So what we have here is a lean to the bone (crunching) tale, with brutal bad guys who are over matched by a relentless foe who is able to match their brutality measure for measure but one whose moral compass is unwaveringly pointed in the direction of justice, fairness and right. So its a fantasy, no question, but a highly satisfying tale: Well told, well filmed; well acted. I got my money's worth on this one."
"noczkus","8","5","14","21 December 2012"," Fun film, Some may say generic, yet I say well executed
","Please don't hold the idiot from Minneapolis review as holy scripture. He hates almost all the films that have come out this year. No need to explain the plot, it's based of the book One Shot by Lee Child, I'll just say that it gets the job done and you've probably seen it before, yet maybe not quite like this. I must say going into this film, I had no expectations but after just seeing it I can safely say I enjoy it. Here's why I like it. The film strays from being a blatantly stupid Action FIlm instead takes a mystery approach. The main character played by Tom Cruise is an anti-hero with side of bad assery. Rosmund Pike is hot. Hardcore violence. The few actions scenes are very well directed(Car Chase especially). Lot's of good dark humor. My main problem is that this film doesn't bring anything new to the genre, but at the same time, I'm glad it incorporates the best of past films to come before in way that homages those works. Another problem I had was with Werner Herzog, he's a really dopey villain but John Mcclaine's son is cool. There are also some moments where the audience will probably face palm and say ""really"" but I was able to overlook these parts. One can knit pick this film if they wanted, the material is certainly there. My advice is to go into this movie in hopes of finding a gritty yet enjoyable mystery. Don't take it too seriously, Don't take it too lightly. Enjoy. Enjoy."
"griffolyon12","8","5","14","22 December 2012"," Pulpy and Fun
","Jack Reacher is a pulp action movie in the vein of 1970's Steve McQueen. There are car chases, mysteries, and a slightly more gritty view of everyday life. In Jack Reacher, Tom Cruise portrays the titular character, and while I have never read the books, so I cannot say I agree or disagree with some critical statements that Cruise is far from 6' 5"" and blonde, as a moviegoer I felt that this was Cruise's best action performance in years. <br/><br/>I actually buy Cruise as Reacher, an uber-smart drifter who can give Sherlock Holmes a run for his money, with the physicality of a bar brawler. Reacher lives a life of freedom, no home, debt, or ties to society, he just travels from place-to-place, often using a fake identity wherever he goes to right the wrongs of justice. A former military police officer, Reacher may be the true supercop, he's almost superhuman, but there and again, that is what makes Jack Reacher pulp. If you have never enjoyed characters like James Bond or Sherlock Holmes, then you will not enjoy Jack Reacher, but if you do love the aforementioned characters, or at least similar characters, then you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>Based on the ninth novel in Lee Childs' Jack Reacher series, One Shot, Jack Reacher comes to Pittsburgh to clear the name of a former military sniper who was set up for killing five people in cold blood, but Reacher, being the supercop that he is, manages to uncover a conspiracy behind the killings. The mystery behind the sniper and the conspiracy that unravels from that, are the best parts of Jack Reacher. The movie is suspenseful, almost Hitchcockian at times, in particular the sniping sequence, where we see the crosshairs, we know what will happen, and we're on the edge of our seat just waiting for him to fire.<br/><br/>Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie proves he has great cinematic chops. In particular, I was in awe of the first ten minutes, where there is no dialogue of any importance, but all visuals moving the story forward. We learn everything we need to know about the case of the sniper in these shots, gathering all of the evidence and discovering who Reacher is all via the shot design and the exquisite editing. Though, even for the brilliant piece of pulp entertainment that Jack Reacher is, with the exception of the Jack Reacher character, the majority of the other character's in Jack Reacher are stock lawyers, DAs, gangsters, and corrupt detectives, in particular the villain portrayed creepily by filmmaker, Werner Herzog. The connection between Herzog's character and the shootings is never fully defined, leaving me confused when Jack Reacher and Herzog's men showdown in the final thirty minutes as to why I should care. And as for Rosamund Pike's character, Helen, why does she start the film dressed conservatively and suddenly at the midpoint of the movie, she's wearing such low cut clothing it's distracting? There was no discernible psychological change in her character as to why she'd change the way she dresses everyday? Perhaps this was a mistake in the costuming department, or maybe McQuarrie just succumbed to the urges of his inner twelve- year-old? I guess we'll never know.<br/><br/>Still, even though Jack Reacher falls into some of the common trappings that these kind of pulp stories can, I really love the character of Jack Reacher, and enjoyed Tom Cruise in the part. Featuring one of the most pulse-pounding car chases in recent movie history, and some occasional humor that comes from Reacher's analytical mind often pointing out human flaws, Jack Reacher is a fun movie that any fan of these kinds of stories will enjoy, and I for one would love to see a sequel.<br/><br/>I give Jack Reacher an 8 out of 10!"

","This movie was so predictable that for me, it took the entertainment out of it. I was really hoping to be proved wrong, but that didn't happen - no plot twists here. The big chase scene was just mailed in, the fights boringly executed and ridiculously staged, making them more funny than a contribution, especially the final big fight that I suspect was not meant to look ridiculous. Really, there is not much to recommend this movie - I wish I had my 130 minutes back. Full disclosure: I'm not really surprised to say that about a Tom Cruise movie, I watched it more to see Duvall's contribution. Unfortunately, his part in the movie was small. I've spent more time than this movie was worth, but I wanted to give people fair warning."

Jack isn't a friend or a defender. He believes that Barr is guilty. Even his attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) believes that he's guilty.<br/><br/>This is some good tense storytelling. And they've got a pretty great car chase to boot. I love that the chase slows down and takes a pause. I like the tension is allow to built up as he slowly drives down an alley. It isn't just one long constant bang them up chase.<br/><br/>If there is a problem , there is a small weakness in either Tom Cruise and/or Jack Reacher. He does this all-knowing pause in every conversation to create tension, but it's an old cliché. There is so much quiet mannerisms in his performance that it's becomes tired. I get that he's the strong and silent type. Sometimes an exposition just need to go quicker. Sometimes he should get it over with. At over 2 hours, it's too long for a relatively simple story. They need to tighten up a lot of dialog to speed things up. And the final fight drags on a little too long. Even with this minor problem, I still consider this one of Tom Cruise's better films lately."

Having read ""One Shot"", I knew the outcome before watching the movie, but yet I was still on the edge of my seat and biting my nails. Some people felt this movie was a play on Tom Cruise's ego. Obviously, they are not familiar enough with Reacher's character to know it's not about his ego, but rather his calm, cool and straightforward way of dealing with life. I would definitely watch this again."

Once the viewer accepts the story as a blend between fantasy and book versions of Jack Reacher, he'll be able to enjoy it, in spite of its being too unlikely, almost as Mission Impossible.

","The gruff loner who rides in, cleans up town then rides off again, the spunky heroine who ends up a damsel in distress, the innocent man framed for a crime he didn't commit, sinister cover ups, a ruthless 'cattle baron' after his own version of manifest destiny backed up by his smiling killer Right-Hand man whose deadly pissing contest with the hero ends in a mano-a-mano under the pouring rain, an apparently random massacre designed to take out one specific target, a parlour game of 'guess the traitor' from a list of equally shifty authority figures, the salty old Indian fighter who can still fire a rifle real good, the tart with a heart of gold who comes out for the hero in the end,bullet spattered final battles in a night time quarry. Car chases, fist fights, shoot outs, foot chases, every Thriller/Western cliché is present and correct here. <br/><br/>Based on one of Lee Child's popular pulp novels, it's a mixture of very old and familiar ingredients, nothing new or original here at all. However the real power of a joke, song or story is in the way you tell it and that is where the film's real strength and pleasure lie.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie moulds what could have been just another generic thriller of the week into an entertaining and gripping ride down this familiar territory with real class and style. One key to its power lies in its deliberate retro vibe, taking all its cues from the tough mean thrillers of the 1970s. Right from the chilling opening sniper sequence (evoking similar moments in films like ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Two Minute Warning"") to the extended car chase between a Chevy Chevelle and an Audi RS6 through a deserted city centre with no music save the revs and the tyre squeals, through the minimal strings and bass score, down to the 'natural justice' code of the hero who lives by a definite morality that exists beyond niceties like law and evidence and includes summary execution and vicious beating of wrong doers, it takes us back to a harsher, crueller time where brutality, hopelessness and nihilism was done with effortless style. In fact it is just the sort of movie John Frankenheimer might have made now had he not passed onto the great beyond.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has been criticised for 'not being the character in the books', and that may be true, but he uses his film star power in the same way Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Charles Bronson and their contemporaries did back in the 70s to ground a movie in just their presence, distracting us from the sometimes unpalatable and even overtly Fascistic things they do with their easy charm and store of goodwill. Cruise has played tough guys before, and though he may not be the Schwarzeneggerian figure of the novels, he is a good enough fit. It's nice to see the lovely Rosamund Pike headlining another major movie after last years ""Wrath of the Titans"", having been a fan of hers since her fresh from drama school breakout in ""Die Another Day"" ten years ago, and I hope we'll be seeing more of her soon. Though not spectacular, she makes a good heroine and co-protagonist here. Richard Jenkins as her father is also good (another actor who lights up a movie) as is David Oyelowo as the cocky detective in charge of the investigation. Jay Courtney makes for a fine strong right hand, cruel and cold blooded in the service of his master, and physically menacing as well, he is a perfect antagonist for our Nietzschian hero. Alexia Fast as the tart with the heart of gold is memorable, both sexy and vulnerable, you end up caring for her fate. The strangest casting call is of course the legendary director Werner Herzog, who's 'cattle baron' villain is cruel but also very wounded. In keeping with the current trend, he is not evil per se but made what he is by the cruelty and horror inflicted upon him, having turned himself into a man of ice in order to survive the Soviet concentration camps in Siberia, and thanks to Herzog we can still see the soul buried beneath the snow.<br/><br/>The film, as you would expect is very violent and brutal, and it can only have been Cruise's star weight that got the movie a PG-13/12a certificate given that is on a par with any of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. Avoid if squeamish (saw a few eyes covered up in the audience) and don't bring the little ones!<br/><br/>There are many more Reacher novels, making this a potential franchise spinner for Cruise to go alongside his long running ""Mission Impossible"" series. Though he may be considered a fascist vigilante by many, Reacher is the sort of hero we look to in these troubled, frightening times, strong, uncompromising, who does 'the right thing' by bypassing all those fussy little niceties like rights, law and civilized values!"

","I think that director and writer Christopher McQuarrie did a pretty good job on this film, although it is nowhere near the excellent writing that he produced for The Usual Suspects (one of my favorite films). I think that the difference was that in this film there was no element of surprise. I figured out the whole film before it was revealed on screen. And if I figured it out, I know that Emma did since she is more analytical then I am. I have to say that although I was ahead of the film a bit, I still enjoyed seeing it play out. Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is an ex-military drifter who apparently shows up whenever there is injustice with regards to another ex-military sniper. Jack teams up with Helen (Rosamund Pike) to confirm that what happened is the truth and ends up getting more than he bargained for. When I first saw Rosamund on screen, I thought it was Jenna Elfman. They look incredibly alike and I am sure that I am not the only person who thought that. Anyway, Jack seems to get some level of support from unexpected characters. One of those characters is Cash (Robert Duvall) who adds a little comic relief to the film. Emerson (David Oyelowo) heads up the police force, while Rodin (Richard Jenkins) is the District Attorney and Helen's father. There is a sub-story about the volatile relationship between Helen and Rodin. Every time I see Richard on screen I can't help but think about the HBO series Six Feet Under where he played a dead guy. This film had some disturbing violence in the wake of what happened earlier this month. There was a time that the powers that be stopped promoting this film (and for good reason). After you get passed the initial scene, the film tells a pretty good story. The action sequences were really well orchestrated and did add a bit of excitement to the film. I do want to say that Tom plays a lot of these types of characters and I think that I like it better when he steps out of the box a bit, like he did when he was in Rock of Ages. There are a lot of really good films coming out during the holiday season and I am not sure if this is a ""must see"", so with that being said, I am giving this film an amber light."

","I briefly dipped in the infostream the day of the Boston bombings, looking for a specific thing; sure enough, within hours there were calls of conspiracy, and of course chief among them cries for a 'false flag'. This right here is why the detective film matters to me, we are all detectives in life looking to apprehend governing truths which is a fundamental attribute of mind. It seems nothing can happen without it affirming the story of who you are. The political aspects are of little interest to me. <br/><br/>So a good detective film to my mind is one that attempts to shed light into how much of this apprehension of truth is mind itself. The Long Goodbye is near the top of my list of great films, next to several noir. <br/><br/>So this isn't for me, in the sense that there is no study in perception, just a plot. At best, it tries to sketch a political landscape: the soldier was manipulated, one of police or DA is in on this but not both, the bad guy is a corporation but headed by an ex-gulag prisoner exploiting holes in the free market. Our guy can straddle the law, because he's pursuing what's right, existing mysteriously outside the system. <br/><br/>It is all entirely too clean, for instance we follow the idealist lawyer as she pieces an 'objective' view of the victims of a mass shooting, the idea is that bodies are not crime statistics but had a life out there. See the shots as we glimpse into these lives on the day of the shooting, all clean and bright, all framed like life insurance ads. All were good folks being brave that day, striving to be better. But no, the sleuth reasons that two were having an affair, and even this subversion of fundamental goodness feels fabricated and squeaky clean. <br/><br/>What seals the deal for me is Cruise and his character. Both entirely too smug, but this is not the ironic Phil Marlowe effect where the cocksure PI thinks so far ahead he possibly invents part of the case, the joke being on him. Reacher simply has the answers, he is without flaw or irony. And he has the chiseled body of the action hero. There's even a scene, tangential but indicative of sensibility, where he poses without a shirt on next to the attractive lawyer, but instead of seducing, being so above it all, he tells her to go. <br/><br/>So here's a film that similarly has all the answers, but none that explain beyond the superficial mugging. It's a silly film. <br/><br/>At least Herzog seems to know this, playing up the voice we know as narrator of a cosmic creepiness."

","You wouldn't believe Tom Cruise is 50 years old after you watch this adrenaline-pumping, car-smashing, action thriller worth a wonderful watch! The performances & the direction are the two best things in Jack Reacher.<br/><br/>Except for three sequences which made no sense at all to me, I enjoyed the partially-defined plot. Screenplay is good and the sound effects just add the spins up. Action stunts are very good and so are the fights though there is suspicion mounting over the origin of these sequences. Rosamund Pike is genuine while the supporting cast is average in portraying their characters. I should mention Rovert Duvall for his stand-off act.<br/><br/>A story slightly different and difficult to construe, Jack Reacher makes an enjoyable watch with many things left to viewer's imagination including the main plot point. And the climax made the lead character go haywire & stereotyped. Locations are good and some things reminded me of the DIE HARD series. Yet, the humor involved, I personally believe played spoilsport with the genre.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Even if you are not a TC fan, watch it for the chills.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

He shows up and is asked by the defense attorney Helen (Pike) to help her investigate the shooter he knows so well. After Reacher begins to dig what he finds makes him think the shooter is innocent. The problem is no one else does, and some want to get Reacher out of the way. I'm not sure what I really expected to see when I sat down to watch this, but I got something much much better. I think I expected another generic action movie, this is more of a mystery type of detective movie. That said, it is also a fantastic movie that keeps you guessing the whole time. I loved almost everything about this, the only complaint I had really is Tom Cruise. To me he really just didn't fit the part, but other then that this is a great movie that is very much worth seeing. You really aren't sure who to trust and who is pulling the strings. That makes the movie that much more fun to watch. Even for someone who isn't a Tom Cruise fan this is very fun to watch and his best movie in awhile. I highly recommend this.

","Now I know certain people who are totally against this movie. Purely on the basis that Tom Cruise is playing a character that supposed to tower above everyone and have blond hair. And even though I've not read the Jack Reacher books, I have to agree with these fans. Cruise producing the movie and just sticking himself in it instead off someone who would perhaps be better in the part, is rather annoying. But outside off this, is the film any good? <br/><br/>""Jack Reacher"" works quite well as a thriller I suppose, and one that I actually found pretty shocking for a 12 (PG-13). It doesn't really have enough action though to please ""Mission impossible"" Cruise fans, at which it is aimed, and as its already annoyed fans off the book, its hard to see the film pleasing everyone who seeks it out to watch it.<br/><br/>Still, the stories pretty good and that's what a good movie should always have firmly in place. Especially when its based on a best seller. Will still no doubt watch the inevitable sequels that will follow. So its a pretty good movie in its own right I guess."

"team-26","4","4","11","6 January 2013"," Poor rendition of the book
","Please be warned - this is not really faithful to the book, and it is certainly not faithful to the character of Reacher. As a film it's okay - formulaic, no surprises, passes two hours that would have passed anyway. Unfortunately this films comes with a ton of expectations from people who loved the books. The first problem is with Tom Cruise - he is not physically imposing enough to play Reacher (who is 6'5""). Acting well (and he does) isn't a substitute. And then there is a scene when he has the drop on the principle killer - and he throws down his gun to have a good old-fashioned fist fight. This is SO contrary to the Reacher in the books who views killing as simply a job to do - and to be done as quickly and easily as possible. He would simply have shot the guy. Putting down a perfectly good gun is something the real Jack Reacher would never do. What was Christopher McQuarrie thinking?"

","Why do you read reviews? I like getting an idea if I should consider a movie from a random comment, if it strikes me, I'm more inclined to give it a go. But really I write for myself, to see if I can get a clarity about the time I spent watching a movie that moves me. I can usually find a good line or scene that is original and that can be enough. In one scene Jack says, ""How many wish they were born, knowing what they know now, ask yourself, how many would do things the same way all over again and how many would live their life like me?"" The movie is full of ""thinking"" commentary, do you think? All the time. The movie asks questions about how we live our lives, make our choices and consider the next move. The logical questions, that I didn't consider makes me want to read Childs more. Makes me want to be clearer about choices I have to make vs. no choice in the matter. Highly recommended for the raise of an eyebrow, a shirk from the desk sergeant, evil vs bad choices are displayed with such skill I just have to say something, tell a friend, talk about the insinuations.

"stephenrtod","8","4","11","2 January 2013"," Surprisingly Excellent
","John Wayne always played characters from the persona of himself. Whether he was ""Big Jake"" or an African big game guide, Wayne was himself. Tom Cruise has been bruised for 30+ years for doing just that. One magnificent scene in ""Cocktail,"" another short scene in ""Valhalla,"" and his role in ""Tropic Storm"" demonstrate that the man can act. Not to mention his acting in ""Magnolia."" I think Cruise embodies the spirit of Jack Reacher in this movie. Translating print to celluloid is going to disappoint purists. I based my career as a language arts teacher, in large measure, upon using film clips to bounce my students' perceptions and critical opinions off the text. That strategy overcame immaturity, ADD, ADHD, chronic fatigue and other forms of resistance to pedagogy at the time. So, yes, I expect that a producer, director, screen writer and actors and actresses to interpret the literary work; in fact, I like to see different renditions of the same essential story. Isn't that what we continually have done with Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Chekhov and other master writers? There is certainly more to life and art than mere cloning.<br/><br/>I thought that Cruise brought a pensive intelligence to the character of Reacher. Richard Jenkins, Robert Duval and Rosamund Pike know how to let a moment simmer, not overplay it.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were realistic. Even though I expected them, saw them coming, they were creative, believable, explosive, emotionally- intriguing.<br/><br/>This is a movie I'd like to watch again after I've had time to assimilate it, process it, reflect upon it, but next time with the subtitles on, so I'll garner more that I missed when I was mostly privy to the ocular proof and not catching the auricular reassurance of nuances I missed or minimized.<br/><br/>I'd like to see Cruise do more of this series. I could not help wondering how much different the movie might have been with a Dolph Lundgren commandeering the title role. I'd love to see that interpretation, too. Different is often intriguing.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is now 10 years younger than Paul Newman was when the two of them made ""The Color of Money."" There was a chemistry, a magic between the actor born in 1962 and the one born in 1925 then. They both loved racing cars. I couldn't help but notice some slippage in the driving sequences this time. Apparently, Reacher was a little rusty not only at the shooting but, moreover, at the driving.<br/><br/>I look forward to the manner in which Tom Cruise and every other actor and actress continues to challenge and stretch their talents and abilities in the future.<br/><br/>I got the strong sense from all of the artists on screen that they really meant every word, every gesture. They became the personages they were portraying on screen.<br/><br/>There is also a strong part of me that enjoys seeing miscreants, jerks, perverts, punks, and sadists get what they have coming to them.<br/><br/>This movie did a good job of achieving that goal."

","Loved Jack Reacher. It's part mystery, part thriller, and part action flick. It's gritty and well-made with brilliant acting by Tom Cruise and slick cinematography. I never read the novels, so I don't have the baggage of the character's imposing height in Lee Child's books!<br/><br/>It was a delight seeing Rober Duvall in a small but key role and the lead actress Rosamund Pike did a fine job although her character could've done with additional depth and nuance.<br/><br/>The only real part that I disliked is a couple of silly moments of near-slapstick humor, but otherwise, this is a terrific start to the franchise, and I hope this is the first of many Jack Reacher movies."

","The plot of this movie was for the most part, very well written -- they just should have got someone else to play the lead besides Scientology Man.<br/><br/>The whole movie is basically stroking the dudes ego of how strong / fast / cool he is...it's just so 70s ""detective"" tacky-like. Now I'm not saying that this type of thing doesn't actually work sometimes, even in modern films -- but Tom Cruise can NOT pull this off.<br/><br/>He's a nut-job off set and every time you hear someone in the film say ""Jack Reacher"" in the movie, like he's this living legend who's stronger and faster than everyone else in the world, you are just thinking in the back of your head; ""wait, that can't be right, they're talking about Tom Cruise..."" Denzel Washington -- yeah, he could pull off something like that. Even Leo DiCaprio. But NOT Scientology Man. Just doesn't do it for me -- especially the bar fight scene.<br/><br/>If it was 5 guys vs Tom Cruise IRL in a bar fight, Mr. Cruise would get his ASS KICKED. The movie just does not work to personify this guy who IRL is the total opposite of his character in the film.<br/><br/>I'm not saying he doesn't act it -- he acts very well -- it's just you can NOT ignore his public / private life when you take into account his acting...it's just not possible. It's worth noting that for whatever reason, I don't seem to have this problem with the MI films. Maybe they are just written to be a little less egotistical / mythical for the main character. <br/><br/>The acting from the rest of the cast is OK -- it's not spectacular, but they get by. The action scenes are very, very well shot and coordinated -- as you would expect at this level of budget.<br/><br/>So -- is it worth seeing? I say yeah -- it's worth it; it's a good story and it's way better than a lot of other movies that are out right now. Just don't get too caught up in the dreamy eyes of Scientology Man and expect him to come flying in wearing his cape to save the day -- because in the end, it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Take sherlock holmes with RDJ -- he has like all the powers in the world in those movies -- he can think and fight his way out of anything; but he pulls it off because he's an awesome guy. <br/><br/>I particularly like the review that says ""Tom Cruise is NOT Jack Reacher."" -- that says it all right there. He's just not. He's a scientologist and he likes to pack fudge, but he's NOT Jack Reacher."
"freemantle_uk","7","4","11","28 December 2012"," The American Sherlock Holmes
","In Hollywood's eternal quest to find potential franchises Paramount have turned to Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. Spanning 17 novels, the ninth of the series, One Shot has been adapted as a starring vehicle for Tom Cruise, much to dismay of the series' fans. But Jack Reacher ends up being an enjoyable crime-thriller, even if it does have some faults.<br/><br/>In Pittsburgh a sniper seems to randomly kill five people outside of PNC Park, the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The police and DA Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) quickly find a suspect, a former army sniper, James Barr (Joseph Sikora) and the evidence against him is staggering. But when former army cop Jack Reacher (Cruise) shows up and starts to investigate he believes that Barr is being famed, despite his dislike for the man, and stumbles on a wider conspiracy.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is basically a modern American version of Sherlock Holmes, particularly the modern version given to us by Warner Brothers and the BBC. Reacher is a man with great foresight that can see clues, characteristics and patterns no one else can. He sees the faults and questions everything that is put in front of him and comes up with a logical conclusion. Like Sherlock, Reacher is a loner and focused on solving a case. Rosamund Pike's character, defence attorney Helen, act as Reacher's Watson as she plays her role of assisting Reacher, even if he has an ulterior motive. Whilst Reacher and Sherlock are social outcasts, Reacher is a drifter, someone who does not settle, a loner and more darker, brooding character who has a ruthless edge.<br/><br/>One of the biggest complains of the film before it was even released was the casting of Cruise as a character that is describe to be 6ft 5in. and over 200 pounds. But he pulls off the role well, having presence when one screen, showing he have the action chops and it is entertaining to see someone fight dirty. Jack Reacher is also surprising funny with Cruise being supplied with some excellent lines and with his comic timing gave Reacher a dark wit. The only real problem with Reacher was that he felt too much like a superman and no one was able to match him in a fight. He was able to beat up numerous opponents that were armed single handed with ease. I know he is a top military officer but there are still some limits with what he can do.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is Christopher McQuirre's second film as a director and does a decent job. The action was well handed, from the fights, to the final gun battle and an excellent car chase which should remind you of the car chase in Bullitt. There is a hard hitting edge to the film, from guys getting hit in the testicles, Reacher getting hit in the back of the head with a baseball bat and Reacher shoving his thump in someone's eye. The action is well shot and edit, you can easily tell what is happening and it pushes what can be done with the PG-13 rating. In the UK the film was slightly cut to earn a 12A rating. The opening sequence in was filled with tension as a we look through as we see him prepare his deadly action, seeing it through the viewing scope as he picks his targets. McQuirre also borrows some techniques from Sherlock Holmes (2009) and CSI as we see alternative sceniros and looking at the evidence, but takes a deliberately less flashy approach.<br/><br/>Whilst the film is solid it is not without problems. It's running time a bit too long and it could have been trimmed: particular because it felt like the novel had more subplots but cut down when in the film when they should have been removed from the film. The other major problem was the lack of motive for the bad guys whose big plan was to protect their dodgy construction deals: it's a bit of a disappointment, especially when you consider the backstory of the main bad guy. Finally the dialogue did offer a bit too much exposition at times, feeling a little too forced.<br/><br/>One final minor point the musical score did sound very much like the music in the excellent PS3 game Heavy Rain. I just wanted to bring it up.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher as a whole is entertaining enough film especially when the action kicks in, but it was a little unsure on whether it wanted to be a crime-thriller or an action-thriller. Jack Reacher himself is an American Sherlock Holmes with daps of Bullitt and Dirty Harry. It's worth a rental or stream."
"rgkarim","8","4","11","23 December 2012"," Cruise on Over And See Mr. Reacher
","You've seen him take on Impossible Missions. He's been able to master the art of the samurai and battle the tyranny of a corrupt empire. This man has even survived an alien invasion while babysitting a bug eyed little girl. Yes, he's Tom Cruise the man who seems to be a big contender for leading male roles. This weekend Mr. Cruise stars in another movie, one that involves him wearing more clothes and drinking less booze. Yes my friends, he has traded the shirtless role of Stacy Jaxx, for the incredible mind of Jack Reacher, which is the name of the movie. What were my thoughts on this movie? Please read on to find out.<br/><br/>The trailer didn't make me too excited about this movie since it painted Cruise as the same character he has played in just about every movie. Now this may not bother you, but for me I've gotten a little tired of his calm, creepy, calculated demeanor that lacks any expression of emotion. In Jack Reacher though, Cruise's demeanor actually is a strength that gives the protagonist just the right traits to be likable. For those who haven't read the books, Reacher is sort of a loose cannon detective/soldier that uses intellect, rational thought, and intense training to uncover the truth. Of course such qualities require a dryer character instead of an energetic idiot. Does this mean that his character is boring though? On the contrary, Reacher is actually a character almost everyone will like due to his many qualities. He's very blunt when it comes to speaking the truth and has no fear telling others what is going on in his head. While some may find it rude, most of the audience and I found it funny due to the timing and delivery of the lines. Even his facial expressions are funny, not because they are goofy, but because they are realistic reactions to some of the situations he faces. <br/><br/>However blunt humor and witty dialog isn't the only quality of this character/movie that was enjoyable to watch. The story itself is interesting and provides a good mystery that many movies have been lacking as of late. Again assuming you haven't the read the books, the plot starts off with a horrible killing spree that seems to set up the villain of the story. However, I was fooled and instead it becomes a mission to discover the motif of the crime and leads to a much deeper rabbit hole. To help uncover the mystery, Reacher's character is used to analyze the various parts of the city, attempting to discover clues that were hidden in plain sight. What I liked best about this, was it wasn't some random discovery of clues like Scooby and the gang can find, but instead Reacher goes to the scene takes the info collected and expands on it. The connections and concepts he finds are rather impressive, and were details that I had trouble seeing. Plus, for once I found this story to a more unpredictable, constantly turning a new direction that wasn't too radical of a turn. As Reacher continues to piece the puzzle together, the world continues to grow and incorporates more of the characters into the story, who used their skills to further expand the plot. This involvement and integration is something I love to see done in a movie, as it provides multiple opportunities to develop the main characters and keep them diverse and interesting. <br/><br/>Yet detective work and crime solving are still only a few pieces to Jack's complexity. Although he stalls casual and calm during most of the movie, there is a hidden beast within ready to break free when the time calls for it. Of course this means some action is involved when the aggression is unleashed, but this doesn't mean we get into a kung fu fury. Reacher does have some moves, but his opponents are fairly untrained in the self-defense arts and fall within a few seconds. While this isn't bad for this movie, fans should not expect much from fist to fist fighting. Instead Jack's action skills involve using speed, intelligence, and guns. While these scenes aren't nearly as fast or detailed as other action films, they are still quite enjoyable and good support for the story. Fans will find themselves tied to the action to determine how the outcome will affect the story. These scenes are still exciting and suspenseful, but may still be a little slower for the action cravers that are out there. Yet something many will appreciate is that for the most part these scenes are real. When a person gets shot, they don't stand perfectly straight and keep gunning, but actually have to favor one limb or go into hiding. Now some of the car chasing is still a little far-fetched, as how many impacts can one car take before it no longer moves. Still the action is fun, relevant, and has some laughable moments from Reacher's nonchalant attitude. <br/><br/>I'm impressed with Jack Reacher and happy that my initial doubts were misplaced. I believe that many fans will enjoy this adaptation to the book series. Cruise really brings the character to life and Reacher's multiple qualities drive the story and keep it decently paced. Yes there are a few things that may have been edited out to make the film a little shorter, but this movie is a pretty strong one in my books. I suggest this one be seen in theaters either by your self or with friends. However, should you not have time to see it definitely catch it later on Netflix/Redbox. Here are my scores for the movie: Action/Crime/Thriller: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","11","22 December 2012"," Adequate genre yarn brightened up by Duvall's riveting appearance
","Tom Cruise plays a familiar genre vigilante hero in the habit of taking the law into his own hands when the law doesn't deliver justice. In this movie, however, there is an interesting twist. As the story unfolds, he finds out that the villain he is going after turns out to be a framed victim.<br/><br/>Let's start from the beginning. We witness a sniper executing with icy precision a shooting of five apparently random victims. Later when we see the apprehended suspect Barr in the police questioning room, it is a different guy, who, at the end of a 16-hour questioning, only scribbleds 3 words: get Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). Intense record searching only finds that this deadly war veteran has completely vanished into thin air in the last two years. When Reacher finally shows up on his own accord the situation has changed. The suspect is in a coma as a result of assaults by fellow prisoners. Anyway, Reacher intimates that he is here not to help but to ""bury"" Barr who got away with murder (literally speaking) while in service.<br/><br/>The key players on the side of the law are police inspector Emerson (David Oyelowo), district attorney Rodin (Richard Jenkins) and defence lawyer Helen (Rosamund Pike) whose modest aim is not to have Barr acquitted but just avoid the death sentence. One little complication is that Helen is Rodin's daughter, rebellious against her father's somewhat dubious practice of only prosecuting cases that he is sure to win, putting personal success ahead of justice.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short, Helen somehow manages to hire Jack as a private investigator and the two gradually come to the realization that Barr has been framed. The development pretty well follows the predictable formula of one clue leading to another, a process spiced with some brutal fights and exciting car chases, with a couple of deaths thrown in for good measure (one guy chose to be shot rather than bite off his own finger as a gesture of repentance). The grand finale is, again predictably, the rescue of a damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Cruise can deliver Jack Reacher while half-asleep. Pike gives a good shot at her rather unimpressive character. Last seen in ""Killing them softly"" spending most of his screen time talking to Brad Pitt's character in a car, Jenkin, a most in-demand and very good actor (nominated in Oscar for Best Actor in ""The visitor"" in 2007), has even less to do in this movie.<br/><br/>But just as you start to wonder if you should have used the admission price on a different choice, you happily see that you are at least getting your money's worth with a somewhat brief, but absolutely riveting performance by Robert Duvall. He appears close to the end, as an ex-marine sharp shooter Cash (now operating a shooting club) who helps Reacher out in the final set piece. One example will illustrate my point. Perched on a slope waiting for the bad guys, Reacher asks ""Can you take them out?"" You would have expect some sharp retort such as ""Not if I'm a lousy shot like you"" or some such quip. But no. Without missing a beat and without as much as a small hint of a sneer, Cash simply says ""You mean to dinner?"" The line is not bad at all, but it needs someone like Duvall who delivers it in a way nobody else can."

So I've discovered the Jack Reacher is a popular pulp character with many followers. I also notice that most of that fan base seems to reject the casting choices for the movie adaptation. Point taken but even if I disregard these cautionary details, I'm still left with one word in mind: lame. Lame scenario, lame acting (despite the delicious cleavage, Rosamund Pike gets my nod for most ditsy performance in a recent big-release film), lame chase scene, lame final shoot-out.

","Jack Reacher is a movie about an ex-military cop (Reacher) who gets involved in a murder case when he sees the news about 5 random killings that have been committed by an ex-military sniper. Upon arriving at the D.A.'s office, however, he's slightly confused as he learns that the suspect has actually requested for Reacher to be brought in to help him. Reacher sets out to prove the suspect's guilt though, but as he does he starts to learn that there may be a lot more to the case than what first meets the eye.<br/><br/>If you enjoy good old-fashioned cat-and-mouse action/thriller's then you won't go far wrong with Jack Reacher. The action in the movie is really very good, and quite often suspenseful, but it doesn't have as much as what I initially thought judging by the previews I saw. However, while that sounds like a complaint, it's not because this is a movie that doesn't have to rely on having non-stop action scenes in it to make up for a ridiculous or non-existent plot i.e. Fast And The Furious.<br/><br/>If I did have one main complaint, it would be the end fight between Reacher and Charlie, but I guess I can overlook that as the storyline, while confusing if you're not paying attention, is generally really good and it's this, along with all the other action, that keeps the movie ticking along nicely.<br/><br/>While the book die-hards will probably moan about the decision in having Cruise play the part of Jack Reacher (in the book Reacher's 6ft 5, 250lb), I think he pretty much nails it. Ever since the Mission: Impossible films Cruise has always managed to bring a believability to the action characters he's played, and he pulls off the fight/action scenes so well. Jai Courtney is also really good as Charlie, the main 'bad guy' who is so relentless & vicious you don't mind when bad things happen to him.<br/><br/>All in all, Jack Reacher is a movie worth watching and I definitely recommend it."
"johnsondccato","10","2","4","17 October 2014"," Great and action movie.
","I was not expecting much from this film going into it, but I have to say I was really impressed with it. The action, the plot twists and the characters were great. Count me as part of the crowd that thinks Cruise makes an awesome Jack Reacher. The whole ""but he's not 6'5"" argument doesn't hold water, IMO. Badasses come in all shapes and sizes. Besides, as in most of Cruise's films, the viewer can't easily tell that he isn't a large man as described in the novels by the way they cast the other actors, etc. It's really a non-issue.<br/><br/>And it was nice to see Hollywood get more realistic fight scenes in a film for a change. I don't recall the particular martial art that they had Cruise train in for this role, but it seemed pretty realistic to how real street fights go down and the appropriate defense responses for such fights.<br/><br/>I rarely want to view most films for a second viewing, but I look forward to watching this one again."

","Jack's last name Reacher tells you all. Man can reach to anyone or anything. This movie kept me focused all time, and I was guessing what is going to happen next but I couldn't. <br/><br/>I think that this movie sends a message that doing right, even sometimes not caring 'bout law at any circumstances, is a right thing to do. Also, you can see how old people on significant positions are living and working in habits. For example when Helen says to her dad that she's in danger, and he thinks all the time that she's acting, because he's her father who knows best, and his job also is to know everything and he doesn't have clue what happens with his daughter and how much weight she has on her back.<br/><br/>So watch this movie, I'll give him 9/10.. 7.o is funny grade."

","As a book this story flows incredibly well moving from chapter to chapter which warrants a much better rating, but as a movie it doesn't translate well enough scene to scene. The story had lots of action, was entertaining thanks to some bumbling scenes and comedic quips but there was a lack of any real thrill. Any situation our hero was put in failed to deliver that suspenseful feeling of ""what would I do or how would I get out of this situation"" because without a doubt Jack Reacher will skillfully exceed the challenges of any event.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars as ex-military cop Ethan Hawk in a... wait... make that Jack Reacher, but just as impossible to believe is that one hit from anything short of a wiffle ball bat wouldn't topple Tom let alone a blunt wooden object to the back of his head. Cruise relies heavily on his demeanor to sell the character, which he has the talent to do, but in the world of on screen bad asses I'd rate him just above Jack Black in Nacho Libre.<br/><br/>Another miscasting award for this flick was that of co start Rosamund Pike. Her best attribute is in the way she looks at the the actors which admittedly she has the skill to put the viewer into a trance that will make you stop thinking of reasons why she's not a good actress. I'm curious how she passed expressions in acting school but I imagine it would be something like this... Show me: Love: O_O Fear: O_O Sadness: O_O, Hate: (_ (. There has to more style and charisma to acting than just a pretty faced, groggily eyed look to the side of the camera.<br/><br/>Overall though the movie wasn't a waste of time. It was a good story and (as long as you're not looking for anything intellectual) entertaining enough to keep you interested."

","This film is just plain dull, boring, uninteresting and cliché. I was expecting something at least with action scenes in the level of Transporter, that was a typical action flick. But Jack Reacher didn't offer nothing. It's bad.<br/><br/>The style is very peculiar, though: it sounded like a film-noir in some parts, with Reacher playing the detective and seeking answers about the murders depicted in the film very beginning. OK, fine. But quickly, one of the various problems in this film became noticeable: the dialogs. <br/><br/>It was so dull and cliché(i mean, the kind of dialogs that are overused in films such as the aforementioned transporter and the expendables) i started wondering why i didn't walked out. The one liners were also ridiculous and totally dull and unrealistic. Examples are quotes like 'You don't want to do that' and 'I'm sorry but i can't help you' are frequently used by our dearest protagonist Jack Reacher.<br/><br/>The logic used by Jack works even when it's impossible to assume something at all. Example: there is a part where he quickly assumes that a bunch of amateurs 'assassins' were hired to 'terminate' him. The viewer has no clue at all about that until the middle of the film, yet he is sure about that since the beginning, what obviously does not make any sense.<br/><br/>Ah, and there is obviously the 'chick' indispensable in any action film nowadays. You don't even need to watch the film to know what always happens: bandit kidnaps girl intending to kill the hero which will obviously will rescue the girl. Even if he claims that himself is not a 'hero', his behavior and actions tell the opposite, as we can see.<br/><br/>K would talk about the acting, that is horrible just like everything else in that film, and also would talk about the boring car chases and the horrible action scenes, but i don't think that is worthy to spent anymore lines reviewing that film. Just avoid it. 4.2/10"

","Jack Reacher is definitely not a must see. In my opinion it tries too hard to create a thrilling and intriguing atmosphere. It let me thinking always a wanna be thriller. The sequences are built sometimes too slow paced. Then certain key scenes let some questions opened that I don't want to spoil out here. The car chase was pretty nice and the fight scenes were funny where I had to laugh very loud. Werner Herzog was really scary. Tom Cruise did no doubt better movies in the past for example in the Mission Impossible parts. <br/><br/>Watch instead the millennium trilogy from the writer Stieg Larsson. Especially the Hollywood version The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. My vote reaches 6 out 10. Too overrated here."

Cruise was subtly funny in a Mission Impossible kind of way, there was major violence all through out the movie but it was almost comical, made me laugh when I felt like I shouldn't be. It had every cliché you can name, including th epic final fight scene, where they both throw away there weapons to battle hand hand to combat. But, this clichés worked in this, movie. It delivered in entertainment value, it was humorous and action-packed. I bet this has a low rating because of the shrewds who hated it for all the reasons I just loved it.

","For a movie of this type and with Tom Cruise in it, I had initially expected more from the movie. That being said, don't get me wrong. I am not saying that ""Jack Reacher"" is a bad movie, it is actually quite entertaining. However, yes, there is a however to this movie, the movie was fairly generic and never really peaked at a solid climax.<br/><br/>The story is about a former military sniper who shoots five civilians in broad day light, and attorney Helen (played by Rosamund Pike) is put on the case to defend the sniper. However, a mysterious stranger named by his full name at the confession of the sniper is drawn into the case; Jack Reacher (played by Tom Cruise). Helping the attorney, things start to become complicated as they delve deeper into the case.<br/><br/>Story-wise, then ""Jack Reacher"" was entertaining, but never really offers any great twists or turns to the storyline along the way. It just trotted straight ahead, which tended to make the movie a bit too single-minded and predictable at times. But still, the movie was entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was great, and why wouldn't it be with the people hired for the various roles. There were some pretty good talents on the cast list.<br/><br/>For a crime thriller, then ""Jack Reacher"" didn't really offer anything innovative or groundbreaking. So don't expect to be blown away - unless you were one of the five random victims of the sniper.<br/><br/>There was just something universally fundamentally missing from the movie to make it that much better and stand out from the many others of its kind in the crime thriller genre.<br/><br/>I am rating ""Jack Reacher"" a 6 out of 10 stars.

","Apart from the movie a few good men, this was a nice twist to the detective genre's. Tom Cruise plays a man called Jack Reacher, a once highly decorated soldier in the army who had enough of the bureaucracy red tape which leaves political officials in the clear when creating black operations that leave innocent people dead. In his defiance, he often took demotions during his clashes with his superiors until he finally quits the military to become a wandering lone wolf persona. A man who does not like the fact that people who do evil things can get away with it. During his excursion on the run he witnessed a news report about a man who seemingly killed five random people. In his earlier career as an officer, this was a tell tale to one other named Barr that if he did something horrendous again even after his release that Jack would be coming after him to set Barr straight with a bullet to the head. But as with all slam dunk cases, this one had too many perfect set ups to allow Barr to die in the chair, or spend his last days in prison. Jack through his relentless investigating, and his partner Helen (Rosamund Pike) dig up new clues as to why the five random people died needlessly. Through every turn, this film had quite the twists especially with Emmerson. A cop who in a way helps Jack in the case, but at a distance. Yet for all of Jack's pursuits his ability to close this case was drawing nearer when another part of the plot entered by the name of The Zec (The Prisoner). A man who spent nearly all of his life in a Siberian Prison Camp. Now this was the confusing part, why or who was this man in the first place? Why was Barr the one being the patsy? And why was a company which was to be sold held on by a woman who hated the company in the first place? What has that got to do with The Prisoner Zec? Did he own the company? Was he a senior share holder? Who stood to make money out of it? Although the movie did have some nice twists, it would have been better to know these things as well. I gave it ten out of ten stars because of the build up to the architect of the shootings. But to be honest, I would have liked to find out why the company was so important to those involved. What was the company for? Who other than the woman who owned it had more to gain? Why was it necessary to blow her away? It was still an open case movie even at the end for me since we didn't find out why. If there is a new movie coming, it would be nice to see bits of the first movie being closed."

","Movie adheres to Lee Child's formula of presenting facts and data; giving you a few seconds to analyze; then having Jack Reacher interpret them for you. Sure, lotsa shooting and fighting, but the real interest is in Reacher's unraveling and reversing the obvious. Reacher very much an older TV series Equalizer or Lone Ranger: no connections, no relationships, just sorta appears, sets things right, and rides off into the sunset. The outcome of the sexual tension between the buff Jack and buxom Helen unexpected. The empty parking garage, streets during car chases, positioning of cars in the tunnel, elevator, courthouse, stereotyped. Example (spoiler?): How do the two bad guys lug a comatose Helen from the elevator through the ground floor of the courthouse with no one noticing? And we never do find out why the ""mole"" became a bad guy."

","As condescending as it sounds, that summary title really is the best way I can describe how I felt about Jack Reacher. It's an enjoyable episode of Law and Order with a car chase and a gun fight thrown in. I hesitate to call it an action movie because the car chase and gun fight really are the only action sequences. The rest is a sort of noirish police procedural... a very straightforward bad guy vs good guy kind of deal. <br/><br/>The strange thing is while Tom Cruise didn't feel big or imposing enough to play Reacher, this film also didn't seem big enough to hold someone like Cruise. It's a strange dynamic and it doesn't spoil the movie in any way, but all the way through I couldn't help but feel like I was watching something that wasn't quite spectacle enough for a celebrity of Cruise's status. <br/><br/>Still, it's a rock solid thriller, with a dash of cheesy superdetective thrown in.

","After a shooting where five people are killed by an ex-Army sniper, former Army investigator Jack Reacher (played by Tom Cruise) appears in order to take justice in his hands. However, as he and the defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) investigates to be certain of the sniper's guilt, things are not as clear-cut as they seen...<br/><br/>An action thriller rarely employs originality, and often comes with an abusive number of absurdities. Yet, it usually ends up satisfying our common taste for action-packed cinematic features, which is why the genre is still as strong as ever. 'Jack Reacher' is just like that; not original, a little more on the absurd/unrealistic side, but those are easy to overlook thanks to being very fun to watch.<br/><br/>Despite all his crazy, fanatical, Scientologist persona in real life, Tom Cruise has made a career through sheer charisma and it shows. He is fun to watch in action, even if he is not the best actor around (and he is far from it), and his stunts are always somewhat believable. He lends much charisma to his character, and that is what makes this film work above its flaws.<br/><br/>Werner Herzog is pretty good as a villain, even if he gets little screen time: he looks truly menacing, and you can't shake the feeling that he is going to turn into a cold-blooded maniac any moment. However, that is hardly acting: Herzog is like that, so he is pretty much playing himself. Robert Duvall plays nicely his supporting role (I didn't even know he would be in the film), and most of the other actors are quite solid.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I found Rosamund Pike to be quite bad in here. Her facial expressions are almost comical when they need to be serious, and she barely manages to make her character work most of the time. She is somewhat attractive at times, though, which makes her somewhat acceptable.<br/><br/>The action is quite good, if at times rushed, and the plot tries to be smarter than the average actioners through a series of twists/mysteries that feel forced at times. Overall, however, it does not disappoint in what it sets off to do.<br/><br/>'Jack Reacher' is based on a book series, so it could end up as a new franchise. I don't really think it could work well; Cruise will probably end up replaced, and without him this is likely to fall in the same abyss that Jack Ryan did."

Only thing I was made aware of, that the original Reacher is actually bigger. But then Tom Cruises Hollywood status might make up for his lack of height (not that most people actually notice he is short, because filmmakers tend to film him appropriately, so it won't be obvious to the viewers).<br/><br/>Apart from that, the story is pretty decent and the actors are good enough, even though people who have seen their fair share of thrillers will know where this is heading and what twists and turns this will take. Still it is fun and that does not only include a scene in the crowd and a hat involving Mr. Cruise aka Reacher, which you might have already seen in the trailer.

It's a thriller, with some good action scenes. Some people say there are a lot of cheesy lines and jokes, but I thought the humour was well placed, and it made you like Tom Cruises character right from his first scene. You get good car chases, fights and shoot outs to make it a great action movie, but not so much that you lose out on a story. <br/><br/>I've seen some awful movies lately, very cheesy, poorly scripted movies (example- the newest Die hard- so disappointing!!) , and I consider myself a picky movie critic.

I guess it is more to do with my ready image and not with Tom Cruise's actor skills. I wasn't able to shed this feeling of strangeness until the end, thus my disappointment. Otherwise the movie is enjoyable, fast paced and everything you would expect from a good action. All actors performed well, specially Rosamund Pike, who is young and very promising.

The characters are well defined, the acting is good and the plot and story are both thrilling and believable, with just the right amount of violence and special effects. Somebody actually took the effort to direct the drive scene based on the muscle car that Cruise was driving: powerful, noisy, it's back going all over the place from poor handling.<br/><br/>Rarely these day have I seen a direct and effective thriller of such a good quality. Yet, when you see the trailer, you hear the horrid tagline with 'Reacher will reach you' and read the even worse tag from IMDb, which makes Jack Reacher sound like a superhero, you see that Tom Cruise is playing the lead role and that it is all based on some pulp books that sound a lot like comics, you can't help thinking the movie will suck, and that is making a great disservice to a film that was clearly made with care and effort.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean it is a masterpiece of cinema, mind you. The ending is horrible. You can feel the Hollywood corporate stench on you, soiling all the good from the rest of the film. Also I thought Rosamund Pike's character and acting were taken from some male fantasy of the subservient woman, ready to accept her place beneath the great man. And the black guy... worse actor of them all, yet the starting scene, when he appears with his gun in his hand, trying to look all confident and dangerous... what a joke.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a movie worth watching, even if flawed.

","I put my cards on the table. I am a big fan of the books and was horrified that Cruise, who I have despised since ""Top Gun"" got the role. So many other actors would have had a better look and not a big stretch to play the stoic personality of Jack. It was as bad a casting as ""Mission Impossible"", but as with it, I decided to watch with an open mind. While the casting failed, for me, in MI, Cruise's small stature and bloated ego was not as notable in JR. They must be learning something in camera shots or with costars to keep him from looking like a smart ass little kid. However, they could have done a better job of making him look like a man who drifts from town to town with one shirt and a toothbrush, no comb. The GQ look was a bit much, muss his hair up or something, but I digress. Like Jimmy Johnson's, that will never happen.<br/><br/>I rarely like a movie after reading the book but this was an exception. It was well done, kept me absorbed and the 2 hours flew by. Good action, likable good and bad guys and a fitting ending. And amazingly enough, Cruise's ego didn't dominate as in MI, TG and many of his other action flicks. The literary JR, while physically imposing, is highly intelligent. Cruise did that well and above all, he played it understated as it should be and was one of his better efforts. So, hopefully, if this becomes a series of movies and someone else isn't cast, Cruise will follow the same formula."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","4","27 May 2013"," 'Reacher' combines thriller and action tropes to create something a little fresher
","A man who doesn't play by the law when it comes to delivering justice isn't an original idea for a main character, and Tom Cruise is far from an original action star, but somehow ""Jack Reacher"" doesn't suffer too much from being stale.<br/><br/>Lee Child's book series appears to be a good fit for film by combining two traditional genres into one seemingly unique hybrid. ""Jack Reacher"" weaves together a traditional thriller structure with climactic points of physical, ""Bourne""-like action. The heart of the story is a mystery, but its fuel is the brutal hand-to-hand combat sequences.<br/><br/>Based on the Reacher novel titled ""One Shot,"" the film centers on the horrific murder of a handful of civilians in Pittsburgh by sniper rifle. An ex-military sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora) has prints are all over the crime scene and the prosecutor's office believes it has an open-and-shut case. Instead of confessing, however, Barr tells them to ""get Jack Reacher."" The next day he is assaulted while in custody and beat into a coma.<br/><br/>Reacher (Cruise) is also ex-military, investigating internal crimes. He's a drifter who never leaves a trail unless he wants to be found. And sure enough, he shows up at the D.A.'s office right on cue. He eventually strikes a deal with the attorney defending Barr's case, Helen (Rosamund Pike), who happens to be the D.A.'s daughter. He becomes her chief investigator and like that he's off gathering evidence, though he wants Barr to be guilty as much as anyone.<br/><br/>We know from the film's excellently chilling opening sequence that Barr is not guilty and that a much younger man (Jai Courtney) actually shot those civilians and must have wanted to frame him for some reason. As the mystery unravels, Cruise as Reacher collects badass points by taking guys down at every turn until he finds the truth.<br/><br/>Better thrillers with less obvious twists and more satisfying endings have definitely existed, and plenty of better action movies have graced the silver screen, with Cruise himself even starring in some of them. But ""Reacher"" still offers a satisfying watch for genre film fans.<br/><br/>Reacher has a distinctive personality as a character. He has a sharp sense of humor that writer/director Christopher McQuarrie expertly translates (I assume), a man whose intelligence and no-nonsense animalistic side appear constantly at odds with one another. Some folks will become fans of the character very quickly, while others will at least be piqued. Cruise is normally an odd choice when you want someone imposing, but he add a foot to his height in his performance alone.<br/><br/>McQuarrie makes an impressive directorial debut. The imagery and some of the storytelling devices elevate ""Reacher"" above your typical thriller. The quiet opening sequence plunges you right into the story and creates an emotional investment in wanting to know what happens, even if how it all happens isn't ultimately that satisfying. McQuarrie set his bar really high with his Oscar-winning screenplay for ""The Usual Suspects"" and his other projects haven't measured up, but he might have found a good vehicle for his talents. His rumored attachment as the next director of the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise has my approval to be sure.<br/><br/>It's Cruise's show, but Courtney shows potential as an action star and Pike proves why she needs to get better roles. Helen is a part that could've been played off as more of your typical ""female criminal justice system person in over her head"" character, but Pike blends a good deal of resolve in with her fear. She's no Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, but ""Jack Reacher"" is no ""Silence of the Lambs.""<br/><br/>Although his screen time is comparable in terms of how little of it there is, Werner Herzog's villainous character is far from Hannibal Lecter too. It's fun seeing him in a creepy role like this, but he proves to be a waste, and Robert Duvall comes in late in the game too as a bizarre character that strikes me as someone from the book(s) McQuarrie wanted to include. <br/><br/>The script wants to establish Reacher as someone who is not your typical hero, someone you don't always find yourself rooting for at every turn because some of his decisions are rash and frankly, not satisfying from an entertainment perspective. To do so, the film doesn't deliver certain satisfying conventions we associate with action films and thrillers, yet there's little doubt that fans of both genres will be curious to see if Reacher comes back to the screen in the near future.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","This is a really good film in it's category. I have not seen as great quality action movie as this one for a while. It is smart, fast, entertaining, has a good flow, a bit of humor and no dull moment or WTF moment. It never feels like directors/producers are lazy and talking the viewers as fools, creating some garbage with the only purpose to make money. Well-worth watching for 2 hours of pure entertainment. It delivers where it counts and Tom does a fine job and not overacting it. Perfect movie to watch at home on a rainy night with a few friends. I definitely hope for more Jack Reacher movies to come as long as they keep up the quality. Enjoy!"

","One of the challenges to adapting a book to a screenplay is that the action descriptions in the book allow detailing how 1 guy can take down 5 others in a street fight. When filmed, the fight may take place in 30 seconds and hits take a half second. In the book, the fight techniques are described in pages of detail.<br/><br/>Another challenge is that although the Jack Reacher books are fun, the villains can be a bit James Bond cartoonish. On screen, ""The Zec"" appeared forgettable. We ignore this in the book because Reacher's experience is what where the excitement is, but on screen, the script writers should have developed that character more. I cared more for when horny teenagers were knocked off in Friday the 13th than I did for these villains.<br/><br/>Next, the chase sequences in the film were more Mission Impossible than the undercover-vagabond that Jack Reacher is. Tom Cruise is known to be a great car driver, but Jack Reacher rarely gets behind the wheel. The charm of Jack Reacher was lost as the film merged with other Tom Cruise, er, vehicles.<br/><br/>Which leads us to something others have said here: Casting Cruise as Reacher. Reacher's attractiveness to the ladies stems not from James Bond style and charm, but rather raw muscle and height with him being smarter than he looks.<br/><br/>Now that's all the bad news first. The good news is that much of the philosophy of Reacher and his way of thinking was represented in the film, albeit subdued by the action sequences. The story was reasonably well represented. What makes a Reacher novel fun to read is following along with Reacher's mind as he solves the mystery so some of that would be lost in trying to read this novel after seeing the film. But (most) other Reacher novels are of similar quality or better than the source material for this film. So use this film as a gateway to the Jack Reacher universe."

","Jack Reacher novels are a throwback to the old pulp western novels of 20th century, about the quintessential loner accidentally thrown into a situation in the American Wild West. To be honest, I didn't know about the novels before there was a big brouhaha over the casting of Tom Cruise as the titular character, because true fans of the series didn't like the fact that Reacher was 6'5"" and Tom Cruise 5'6"" (allegedly). Apparently cross-height casting is problematic only if the guy is shorter than the character (remember Hugh Jackman being cast as the ferocious Wolverine, who is, according to the comics, 12 inches shorter than Jackman). Just to make sure I wasn't going to be unfair to the character, I went to the local library and read Killing Floor, the first novel in the series. And I was floored. I would finish 6 more, more or less in sequence, including One Shot, on which the movie is based, before actually going to watch the movie. I totally understood why the fans were clamouring against the casting. Jack Reacher is a massive guy, and a big part of his personality and interpersonal communication, including tactics, negotiation and body language is tied to this physicality. Yet I could not point out an actor in mainstream Hollywood who is capable enough to convey this character. Clint Eastwood in his prime, absolutely. Chris Hemsworth? He doesn't have the intensity or enough acting talent although physiologically he would be accurate. Timothy Olyphant definitely has the acting range and physical dimensions but he wasn't known much outside Hollywood and the studio maybe didn't want to risk a franchise on a talented but relatively unknown actor. So we are stuck with Cruise, for now. I don't mind, I like him, and he is a genuine action star.<br/><br/>One Shot is a great pulp thriller. Jack Reacher, the movie, though, isn't a great pulp movie. It is definitely enjoyable though. The problem with action movies these days is convoluted storytelling, clichéd storylines, predictable twists and turns and most importantly, stupidly directed action sequences. So if you went in expecting the usual fare, you would be thoroughly disappointed. The plot has been condensed and several of the side characters have been cut for the movie. It makes sense from a storytelling perspective as those arcs, though adding richness on paper, can distract on screen. So this movie is a condensed version, focusing on few characters as they go about trying to decide what to do with James Barr, a shooter who is accused of killing five people, who asked for Jack Reacher as his only request. Reacher comes to town entirely on his own volition, as this is a character no one can ordinarily reach on their own, and surprises us with the statement that he is there to punish Barr, whom he knew from military service. Barr had gotten away with a crime that Reacher had investigated, and he had warned him that the next time he did something, Reacher would personally be there to ensure he was punished. The DA, the Detective and the defense attorney try to figure out what to do, Reacher decides to leave, but an unprovoked attack on him has Reacher thinking, and ultimately deciding to stay and investigate further.<br/><br/>This is more of a cerebral thriller, and the usual Michael Bay-esque explosions and shaky-cam fistfights have been replaced with realistic action sequences, including an exhilarating car chase and a funny bathtub fight sequence. They are placed well enough in between Reacher untangling the mystery one-by-one, with some wonderful old school investigation on the field.<br/><br/>The direction is wonderful, and this is obviously where Cruise and McQuarrie's enormously successful collaboration started. There are bits and pieces of wonderful comedy and sharp writing, some of them borrowed from Lee Child's book, sprinkled throughout the movie. Tom Cruise beings his famed intensity to the role, trying to convey the Reacher of the books to the screen. He nearly succeeds too. Physical dimensions like height and muscularity are some things that cannot be helped beyond a certain point. Richard Jenkins, a seasoned veteran, and Rosamund Pike, play the father-daughter attorneys who are caught up in the case. David Oyelowo, who plays Detective Emerson, delivers an excellent performance and is one to watch out for. Robert Duvall and Werner Herzog, titans of the industry, have interesting cameos and Jai Courtney makes a good antagonist.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Very good mystery-action thriller with smart writing, snappy dialogue and well-done action. Worth a watch. Twice, if you're into cerebral pulp.<br/><br/>STRAY OBSERVATIONS:<br/><br/>If only Tom Cruise was 5 inches taller.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike is lovely. Just like Tom Cruise, it seems like I've been watching her in movies all my life, and she still looks the same as she was when I first saw her in Die Another Day."

","28 December 2012. Jack Reacher is one of the few movies which upon reflection was worse then when it was experienced. The plot flaws abound in the movie which detract from the movie and some of the scenes were over the top in a bad way. Nevertheless the movie sustained its consistent suspense and reached levels of intense emotional outrage in a good way. Finally, the ending of the movie was admittedly slick and emotional appealing.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. However, (1) the idea of the deliberate assassination of one person cloaked in the apparent random deaths of three other innocent people doesn't ring true because it was much more reasonable to believe other less drastic means would have been likely available to achieve the outcome sought. (2) the idea of a second shooter positioned so far away from the first shooter would have been technically impossible to cover up through ballistic testing and it would have been at least more reasonable to have had a second shooter positioned sufficiently close to the first shooter to take ballistic testing into account. (3) the bumbling second lay attack in the bathroom with Reacher in the bathroom scene was over the top dumb and not really believable, even to the point where Reacher is caught off guard so easily and then as fate would have it, avoid further injury with so many accidental misses. (4) the Reacher and assassinate hand to hand combat scene was also pretty lame not just for its fight scene, but for Reacher to just not shoot the man. (5) Robert Duvall was just too lucky because the better assassin was mysteriously out of the picture too long and never himself attempted to take out Robert Duvall, (6) Reacher's ability to shoot the investigator hiding behind the defense lawyer was just a script device, at least Reacher would have been better off just taking his time and shooting through the hole his eye had looked through.<br/><br/>Other movies more technically pure and also as action appealing are The Shooter (2007), The Specialist (1994), Enemy of the State (1998). The Pelican Brief (1993) has the same intensity and consistency in action and conspiracy."

","A mysterious hero, somewhat nameless, with no past, and about whom nothing is known, except for his military record - how many times have we read about this baseline?<br/><br/>Five persons are killed to masquerade one death, I'm pretty sure that I have read, and seen this elsewhere (last I can remember, it was an episode of 'Elementary').<br/><br/>An elderly actor unmistakably unsuited for a role definitely made for someone younger. This is not ageism, but this is becoming like the joke Bollywood keeps on making by having 50+ actors playing the lead along with half their age female co-stars, while ironically playing a male protagonist who's supposed to be younger, much younger in the movie. I mean, this is like having Fassbender play Solomon in '12 years a slave', it just doesn't fit.<br/><br/>Then, there's a car which suddenly stops working during a chase, probably why some people call this movie realistic because a car can stop in a movie as well. Oh Lord.<br/><br/>We also have supposedly serious, secretive crime syndicate with far reaching hands reduced to a bunch of men fighting on a construction ground - how much serious can that be? I can understand that they might have underestimated Jack Reacher, but come on, they were more like vagabonds from the street when it comes to convincing the audience about the austerity of their organisation.<br/><br/>And wow! Suddenly, we have the lone wolf who finds himself in need of a much older man whom he just met, to fight along his side, even if he's a trained army cop cum ghost, who has managed to live a solitary existence, as a shadow while doing his stuff.

"Hey_Sweden","7","0","0","24 August 2018"," An interesting, if imperfect, murder-mystery.
","Tom Cruise gets to play a different sort of badass in this initial film adaptation of the work of Lee Child. Jack Reacher is a former military man who, after mustering out of service, deliberately fell off the grid and became something of a mystery man.<br/><br/>When a young sniper (Joseph Sikora), himself ex-military, takes out five supposedly random victims, he leaves enough evidence behind to ensure that he is soon caught by police. At his questioning, he does not speak but merely scrawls on a sheet of paper, ""Get Jack Reacher."" And so Jack shows up in town, and is drafted by defence attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) to serve as a sort of investigator. What the two of them discover is that things are naturally not all that clear, that there are layers to this story and twists along the way.<br/><br/>One misgiving that I remember viewers had at the time was that Cruise seemed to be miscast, that he was not how author Child had originally envisioned the character. But give Cruise credit; he knows how to work that movie-star persona and create a ""hero"" who lives in a somewhat grey area, morally. He's not the Dudley Do-Right type. But Jack sticks around when he realizes how complicated and untenable the situation is getting, and is a man of his word.<br/><br/>The story is certainly entertaining, if not all that satisfying; for the most part, it's lacking in truly compelling villains. If you're anything like this viewer, you probably watched this because the legendary character / highly esteemed filmmaker Werner Herzog plays the main bad guy. But the script doesn't give him much to do that's interesting. He does have one great scene where he shows an underling how many digits are missing from his hands.<br/><br/>Still, it's Herzog and Robert Duvall (who turns up late in the story as a crusty but reliable old firing range owner / operator) who lend some gravitas to the proceedings, along with an appealing performance by the lovely Pike, and solid work by Richard Jenkins (as her dad, who happens to be the district attorney) and David Oyelowo (as a police detective).<br/><br/>The action scenes are certainly adequate, and some moments are played with a definite amount of humour. The plot isn't fleshed out that well, but it does touch upon some provocative themes, such as life for some soldiers during and after their service.<br/><br/>Reasonably slick filmmaking helps make this entertaining. And some people may appreciate this being the kind of feature that is violent without containing much in the way of gore.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","I'm not familiar with the Lee Childs' novels on the Jack Reacher character but I do remember the media hoopla over the rather diminutive Tom Cruise being cast as a plus 6' male. The other just-as-important matter for consideration is whether he can carry off such a tough-as-nails persona. I know you could argue that Ethan in the Mission Impossible franchise is similarly indestructible but I don't think even that characterisation calls for the sheer cussedness of Reacher here and in the end I think he falls short (no pun intended).<br/><br/>The film starts off with an intriguing set-up as a lone assassin, in a scenario too sadly familiar from real life, ruthlessly guns down five apparently random people. However a series of perhaps too obvious clues leads to an ex-military marksman being arrested for the crime who breaks his silence only to reach out (sorry!) for Reacher to come to his aid.<br/><br/>From there though it goes down a rather predictable set of paths which I personally doubt would be as written in the novel, like the way Reacher takes down five toughs sent to scare him off the scent in the now familiar ninja-style from any number of Marvel / DC movies or even TV series or the inevitable car chase through the night streets of Pittsburgh. I had also guessed the killer's M.O. too although there's a satisfaction of course in so doing.<br/><br/>I also felt that the conclusion in the driving rain as Reacher, with the unlikely help of mean and ornery target range owner Robert Duvall faces off against the Mr Big, his right-hand man and assorted henchmen, as you'd expect taking them down one by one until there were none as the saying goes. Personally I felt a little awkward seeing Duvall's trigger-happy character being lionised as he was, in this day and age.<br/><br/>In the final analysis I felt I'd have probably preferred to read the source novel more than watch this Hollywood blown-up version. I was entertained but too many of the situations and characterisations seemed hackneyed, repetitive and derivative for me to really savour what I had hoped would be a grittier detective drama and not just the outsized actioner it proved to be in the end."

","The film opens up like ""Basic"" with one man requesting another. A man (Joseph Sikora) is accused of random shootings. The evidence is overwhelmingly against him. In Iraq he was a sniper. Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) arrives as a brash and cocky individual, a role Tom Cruise has perfected. Jack is elusive. Eventually he takes on the task as the lead investigator for the accused. His lawyer (Rosamund Pike) happens to be the daughter of the prosecutor (Richard Jenkins). As Jack investigates, things are not what they seem which draws us into the story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the mystery is short lived as clues come too fast. It then resorts to an us vs. them with a car chase scene that lasted way to long for this type of crime drama. The script was otherwise well done. Acting was as we would expect from the cast. Makes for a decent rental. There could be a Jack Reacher sequel, hopefully with some complexity. This is another film shot in Pittsburgh, the Hollywood of the East.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb, no sex or nudity. Some spicy language and sexual references."

","I like Lee Child's books and have read most of them including the one that led to this film - One Shot.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a decent yarn, with plenty of action, the odd improbable conclusion drawn from nowhere and some decent, if not outstanding acting performances. <br/><br/>My only problem with the film is that Tom Cruise is such an unlikely - and unbelievable - vigilante / trouble shooter.<br/><br/>The books give the impression that Reacher is a huge, hard-nosed guy.

","Jack Reacher stars Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher and is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who has written Edge of Tomorrow as well as the highly acclaimed The Usual Suspects. The film follows a shooting in which Jack Reacher must discover the real culprit of the crime. The film begins with your usual clichè young, handsome shooter who wears dark sunglasses. This clichè approach to gangsters and mafia and shooters are old and frankly worn. That being said, this is the only overly cliché film which doesn't particularly have much impact on the overall film apart from the antagonist who's a German, ate off his fingers and has scars all over his face and body. The action and uncovering of information that Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike (who plays Helen) undertake is incredibly interesting but is contrasted with high-paced action and battle scenes, with a spectacular finalé battle, which is done extremely well. But most importantly is the resolve Reacher holds. It is what we want from all our action heroes: just shoot the bad guy and quit with the small talk finally.<br/><br/>The film has a great atmosphere (particularly in this final battle scene) which creates a dark and gritty feel. The film itself, is too long, though, with the film seeming to drag through some sections, with Tom Cruise being the only one to give an above average performance, whereas others overact or just don't give a great performance."

Ill try to explain why. <br/><br/>The movie starts off with a sniper shooting, 5 seemingly random people get killed. They arrest James Mark Barr and it is pretty obvious they got the wrong guy. Lucky for the guy Tom Cruise (Jack Reacher in the movie), whom is hired by the defending (female) attorney is there for him to rescue him from either death row or being imprisoned for life. So this is where the movie starts off, and it is a pretty decent action movie with a nice plot (which is way better than you would expect at the beginning of the movie), some decent villains, and a cool sniper battle. <br/><br/>So what do I hate about the movie? Well Tom Cruise's character to be blunt, you just want him to die at the movie because this guy is full of .... Like in: 'look at me, I am so awesome'. If this would be normal life, this is the guy you want to punch in the face.<br/><br/>There are a couple of scene's where you think C'mon! He would not do that, that's way too cheesy...

"Floated2","4","0","0","30 July 2017"," A mix of action films into one
","Jack Reacher starring Tom Cruise sees him playing the title character in this mystery, spy action thriller. Having no knowledge of the novel series, one could not compare Tom Cruise's performance to how the character in the novel is supposed to be depicted. <br/><br/>Although, in presence I may agree with several critics and fans of the novel, that he may have been miscast. His performance seems to be lacking in any spark and he comes off as too unenergetic and not as mysterious or silent as he should have, according to some others. Though perhaps with another leading man as the title role, this film would not have been as successful.<br/><br/>The story isn't too bland but it seems like a recycle of many past action thrillers we have seen already. There is the typical scene plot with the female lead being hostaged by the villains than the lead has to come and save her, then killing the villains. It has all been done before many times, and it was very predictable in here. <br/><br/>The mystery is only for the characters in the film having not sure what is going on, but we the audience already known everything which leaves little suspense. The running time is 130 mins and feels like it. Another thing with the film is that at no point we feel that Jack Reacher is in real any danger, and they make him completely invincible. <br/><br/>Despite some decent action scenes, Jack Reacher isn't as fun as it should be. It's more of a serious toned film and with Tom Cruise's presence it comes off as awkward and quite silly. Jack Reacher is no Jason Bourne or James Bond"

","Some moments stick, most do not.<br/><br/>The one individual who makes Jack Reacher worthwhile is Werner Herzog. Playing a Gulag survivor, he channels up all the bone chilling eeriness of the best Bond villains, while being an authentic human being. He has limited screen time, but he makes you wish he had more.<br/><br/>And then there is Tom Cruise. The coming of age star does a more refined version of his 'posing for the camera' style of acting. His depiction of Reacher wanders back and forth between broody and completely carefree relaxed.<br/><br/>Director Chris McQuarrie handles the movie with likewise inconsistency. He ping pongs between realism and gimmick from scene to scene. There are two or three fisticuffs scenes that are as cheesy as Steven Segal movies, while other talkier scenes resemble John Le Carre material.<br/><br/>Macquarie stages a good car chase to kick off the last act; one that is more streamlined and coherent than most other car chases. It ends in a laugh as Reacher disappears into a crowd in a fashion that only Cruise could get away with. Then comes the big climactic action piece on a construction site. It is endurable until we come to that typical moment where Reacher and another ruffian decide to drop their guns and punch it out (cue eye roll)<br/><br/>By trying to please intelligence and non-intelligence simultaneously, Jack Reacher turns into a confused movie. Its sole achievement is getting a performance out of Werner Herzog."

","With outstanding scripting and direction from Christopher McQuarrie, ""Jack Reacher"" is a well-paced thriller with a fine assortment of roles led by Tom Cruise's title character.<br/><br/>A world-weary loner, Jack Reacher is a semi-retired veteran of the twenty-first century wars, but is a patriot always willing to serve his country in noble causes. After a horrific shooting of civilians in Pittsburgh, Reacher shows up at the conjunction of the Monongahela, Ohio, and Allegheny Rivers to track down leads.<br/><br/>Reacher works closely with a female defense attorney played by Rosamund Pike, who is representing a former army sharpshooter accused of the crime. Reacher instantly smells something fishy, and begins to weave together a conspiracy theory about an innocent man. There is a romantic undercurrent in the relationship of the attorney and Reacher that never blossoms in the film.<br/><br/>A number of the supporting roles are memorable, including Alexia Fast's character Sandy, who should have listened to Reacher's advice to get out of town. There is also Robert Duvall in a star turn as the crusty, old ""Gunny,"" who comes to the assistance of Reacher. The villains in the film are interesting in the sense that they are complete studies in evil, yet we never clearly learn the motivation for their heinous acts.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is in the carefully constructed plot with interesting details and a good assembly of characters.

","Since I recently saw the sequel in the cinema I thought it might be best to see what the original movie was like. As it turned out it the are nothing alike (with the exception that both star Tom Cruise as the title character). Sure, both of them have a mystery that needs to be uncovered, but this film is much more of a detective film than is the sequel. Also, the film is set entirely in Pittsburg whereas the sequel seems to go all over the place (and even has Reacher traveling in a plane, something that apparently he isn't suppose to do). Sure, Reacher in both films is a bit of a tough guy, and also a loner, but I felt that this film was somewhat more reflective of what the character was suppose to be like.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film is set in Pittsburg and one day a sniper shoots a number of people in a park by the river. He is then caught, and it pretty much appears to be an open and shut case. As it turns out Reacher had encountered this particular guy in Iraq where he has been arrested, charged, and then released, after shooting up some civilian contractors. The problem is that his lawyer doesn't really believe that he is guilty, and while Reacher is pretty much convinced that he is, as he begins to dig deeper he realises that there are a number of things that don't make sense (such as why he shot from where he did) and that there are much more sinister things going on.<br/><br/>One of the major differences is that the only reference to the army in this film is that Reacher, and some of the other characters, were once soldiers, but in the main the film really deals with civilian life and the soldier's reintegration into that life. Mind you, it isn't necessarily about how demobilised soldiers have difficulties readjusting to civilian life, and we do note that our sniper spent the entire war watching soldiers through a scope and never actually taking a shot, but as it eventually comes out reintegration is not a problem (though can be used to cover up more sinister plots). The reference regarding being a sniper who never fired a shot is to another film – Jarhead. There was a similar theme there (and we see this in Three Kings as well) – the soldiers were trained, and went to war, and never fired a shot. I don't think this is necessarily the case in the Iraq War, but the suggestion is there.<br/><br/>Don't expect a huge amount of action in this film, though Hollywood, of course, has to throw in a bit, especially at the end. This is more of a detective film, with a lot of mystery, and a few twists, thrown in. Mind you, unlike the sequel, which I eventually worked out what was going on before all was revealed, this was a little more difficult (though there were some hints dropped about the place). They also play around with the sexual tension, though there seems to be a lot more in this film than in the sequel. Once again Reacher is portrayed as the loner, the drifter, that really can't connect with people. However he is described as a ghost, as somebody who doesn't want to be found, but if he wants to be found then he will find you – this is why he goes everywhere by bus namely because buses are anonymous.<br/><br/>Oh, they did have a bit of a car chase, and an interesting scene where he was hiding from the police. It felt a little unrealistic, but then again you can't have the main character arrested before he has solved the mystery (and if you do you have to provide him with a way to be able to get out and wrap everything up satisfactorily). Mind you, nothing is ever all that simple in real life, but then again this isn't real life, this is Hollywood."
"ThomasDrufke","7","0","0","8 July 2016"," Life or Death
","Tom Cruise may very well be the one man left in Hollywood who commands the top spot in the box office opening weekend. Unfortunately, Jack Reacher didn't reach that feat, nor did it probably deserve to. But it's far from a weak spot in Cruise' long history of brilliant action fun.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher stars several Oscar caliber actors including Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, David Oyelowo, Robert Duvall, and Werner Herzog. All of which provide fine performances. But if we are being honest, Cruise is having by far the most fun here. Reacher is a slightly more brutal and definitely cockier version of his now classic, Ethan Hunt character from M:I. Now over 50-years old, I'm glad he still loves delivering those cheesy punch lines as much as he is doing insane stunts.<br/><br/>The film itself definitely takes itself a little bit more serious, however, which is where it runs into a few problems. Although I think Christopher McQuarrie's directorial effort for M:I 5 was impeccable, he has trouble balancing the tone and pace of this particular film. At times, it claims itself to be a serious and even tragic espionage thriller. But the final 30 minutes completely forget about the grounded tone and let Cruise loose on one of his bone-crushing Mission Impossible action sprees. I just would have liked a bit more of a happy medium between the two.<br/><br/>With that said, the brilliance of the film lies within all of its espionage and mysterious elements. Way before Cruise throws a single punch or shoots any bullets, I was sucked into the mystery the opening presents. The opening segment, along with two other extended sequences, are impressively done with absolutely no dialogue, yet you understand exactly what's going on. McQuarrie's directing talent really shines there.<br/><br/>Much of the rest of the film's fun comes from some expectedly great supporting performances from Duvall and Herzog. Both have minimal screen time but they nonetheless steal every scene they are in. There's without question fun to be had with their roles and the film itself, but I can't help but think some more time in the writer's room could have helped polish the film a little. There weren't any particular moments in the film I disliked, but the cohesiveness just wasn't present.<br/><br/>+Cruise at his best<br/><br/>+Fun supporting performances<br/><br/>+Eerie tone in the first half<br/><br/>-Too action heavy towards the end<br/><br/>-Tonal issues<br/><br/>7.6/10"

","Jack Reacher (2012): Dir: Christopher McQuarrie / Cast: Tom Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, David Oyelowo, Werner Herzog: Revenge action thriller where its anti hero takes the law into his own hands when the system fails. Five random people are picked off by a sniper. A suspect is in custody but rather than own up to the crime, he requests Jack Reacher who knows his background. Reacher shows up to investigate the crime while leaving everyone scratching their heads with regards to his ability to remain unreachable particularly within any search engine. As Reacher discovers clues and makes clever speculations, there are thugs sent to prevent him from discovering the truth behind the shootings. This is all very clever but intermixed with mindless action, some of it exhilarating such as a long speed chase by cars and police, and some of it plainly over the top such as a climax that has that too simplistic revenge solution. Tom Cruise plays off the grim determination of a guy out to prevent criminals from escaping justice. Rosamund Pike is effective as the defence attorney for the suspect in custody who is befuddled by Reacher's speculations while also watching her own back. Unfortunately other roles are the typical thug criminal types who are merely punching bags for Reacher's rage. Action fans will no doubt enjoy the chaos presented here but others may seek out action fare with a heightened substance. It is certainly a step up for Christopher McQuarrie who previously made the mediocre film as The Way of the Gun, which doesn't reach as high as Reacher. Score: 6 / 10"

But at least his performance in this nonsense is better than that given by Rosamund Pike, which is awful.

","First of all I am not a native speaker :) Being a big fan of book series I went to see this movie with some doubts about Tom Cruise being cast as the main character and I am sorry to say I was right. While Tom is a good actor he just is not Jack Reacher material. I kind of felt sorry for him. He made Jack look kind of sad, weak, somewhat lost etc. And he was just talking too much. I've imagined Jack as solitary no-nonsense man , strong and self assured and I just did not see those qualities in Cruise. It kind of ruined this movie for me. They should have cast Ray Stevenson instead ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829032/ ) That would be Jack Reacher I could buy ;)"

","Enjoyed this movie on a few levels. Fun movie, good escapist movie, Cruiser leaving the smile home (I'm so tired of it), the twists and surprises, the appearance of Robert Duval brought gasps from the packed house (priceless stuff, his scenes with Cruise brought back memories of Days of Thunder), Rossamund (nice rack, couldn't take my eyes off it)good acting in a difficult role, the comedic lines to give the suspense and tension a rest (brilliant). Now my minuses: Low-budget picture that owes its ""8"" rating by me due to the solid writing,directing, and acting, crappy car chase scene, and clichéd bad-guys. Billed as ""A Tom Cruise Production"" (is that why the budget is given as $50mil, did Tom get $25mil of that?)Oh yes, where did Tom get the haircut?"
"jake-179","5","4","12","26 December 2012"," Not good
","Not a great movie. I had high hopes, I really liked Tom Cruise in MI: 4 Ghost Protocol. That was awesome. I guess I was hoping for more awesome Spy action. But this movie was a let down. It was almost good. But, as usual, Tom Cruise along with shoddy direction made this movie more irritating than entertaining. Tom Cruise is not a good choice for this role. Should have been somebody rough around the edges. Not pretty boy Tom Cruise playing a tough-as-nails Army investigator. I think Dwayne The Rock Johnson would have been better, or somebody like Arnold in his prime. That would be cool. But 5 foot 7 inch Tom Cruise as the ultimate tough guy? No. And the movie is really long. Something like a full two hours. Over long if you ask me. And the direction was slow paced. This felt more like a 1980's style made-for-TV movie than a block buster action flick. <br/><br/>Now there are two good reasons to see the movie: Alexia Fast and Rosamund Pike. One word for two women: Hot! Especially that little hot number Alexia Fast. I want to see more movies with her in them. She looks amazing. Totally hot. And I have had a crush on Rosamund ever since I first saw her in Die Another Day. <br/><br/>The movie could be a good action flick, but the direction is just too slow. The pace is slow. It plods along and fails to get any real momentum. And the whole plot seems a bit trivial. Some kind of hostile take over of a construction company or some stupid thing. Boring. <br/><br/>Also, I have a message for Tom Cruise: Tom! Stop taking your shirt off! Tom has an awkward body and he is looking his age (50 years old!). He just looks out of shape and you can tell he is trying to hold in his gut and his man boobs are sagging almost as bad as Arnold's! It's just sad and ridiculous. Keep your shirt on, Tom!<br/><br/>Now for a little complaint about the end. Waring! Spoiler Alert! Emerson holds Helen hostage, hiding behind her with a gun to her head and a gun pointed right at the door to the room they are in, in the dark, waiting for Reacher to enter. He is completely hidden behind Helen. Suddenly, Reacher jumps in the doorway and fires one perfect shot and kills Emerson immediately. Uh, yeah, right. I don't think so. That was lazy writing. The writers couldn't figure out a cool way for Reacher to save the girl so they copped out. That bothered me. In that scenario, Reacher would have certainly shot the girl and probably gotten shot himself. <br/><br/>This movie is only so-so. Not bad, not great. If you want to see an awesome spy action flick, go see Sky Fall. If you have already seen Sky Fall, go see it again. It will be more fun than this movie. Looks like Jack Reacher was ""reaching"" for a better film. Too bad he didn't have longer arms."

","have been a massive fan of the Reacher books for years. when the film was announced i was very excited, and i was not disappointed when Cruise was given the lead role as i am a massive fan of his. i watched the film with an open mind, i loved it, Tom was great, forget the physical references to reacher in the books, toms character and acting comes through brilliantly, guys he pulls it off, Lee Child needed someone of this caliber to make it work, the adaptation of the book was very good.it was kept very close to the storyline in my opinion, good sense of humour throughout and the fighting scenes were pretty realistic as in not too much flashy crap like i have seen before in other films. the plot in the book is complicated but this film helps out all us slow learners. i honestly think you will enjoy it a lot."
"januaryman-1","8","4","12","23 December 2012"," Tightly crafted
","Don't believe the general tone of critics toward this movie. It is a tightly crafted, suspenseful movie that will hold your interest throughout.<br/><br/>No, Cruise isn't the six-and-a-half foot tall, hypo-pigmented Reacher of the book series, but he is a believable protagonist. To be honest, my vision of Reacher when reading Lee's books is closer to Cruise than Lee's description. Cruise is pushing the age limit for a believable Reacher, but he doesn't step over it, looking a very fit fifty. His portrayal of Reacher is actually a bit more palatable than the cocksure (and arguably obnoxious) Reacher of the books.<br/><br/>There is rapport between Cruise and defense attorney Rosamund Pike. A sexual tension was building between the two but it disappeared about two-thirds into the movie.<br/><br/>The set of villains in the movie is genuinely menacing. My skin crawled as they went about their dastardlyishness. Robert Duvall makes a brief but important appearance as a retired Marine.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is a violent film. Don't you dare take your kids to see it. There is a cringe producing sniper scene at the beginning of the film and a bevy of bone-breaking fight scenes, a car chase, and a climactic gunfight. I was struck by the use of what looked like an M-14 rifle in several scenes. I think this rifle was retired from standard issue for the military in general and especially for snipers forty years ago. This isn't a major point but struck me as odd.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is a good popcorn movie. It never fails to deliver action and has a pretty unpredictable mystery in the plot. I wouldn't mind seeing this as a cinematic series."

","I won't say that Jack Reacher is bad or unwatchable. It holds your grip till the midway and then the grips keeps on loosening after that. It's not the same like the other Tom Cruise movies where till the you hold up . Story is nice but not much gripping facts as you would see in other films. I would still watch the MIP series many times and held it refreshing but this was a one time watch. Nothing evident to grip you till the end. MIP series holds you with never forgetting facts and action. Here the story takes turns until you say what's next but that next comes to an end soon. Acting is commendable of Tom Cruise as always. If you like this, then you would probably like Shooter movie always. Watch shooter after you watch this. There is no team with which the lead role works. He works with a lawyer to find the facts. Relation of the character(Saviour and researcher)was quite good but yet it didn't look realistic it should be."

Jack Reacher is unusual action thriller which does not have universal appeal and will be restricted to niche audiences.<br/><br/>An ex-military sniper shoots five random victim at gunpoint. Case is passed onto homicide investigator Jack Reacher ( Tom cruise) who must work with lawyer Helen( Rosamund Pike)to solve the cold-blooded murder and motive behind doing this.<br/><br/>Directed by Christopher McQuarrie , Jack Reacher is an interesting thriller which is gripping and intense. The movie begins with random killing of innocent victims but as story unfolds , the murders are connected to each other. The movie is like reading a fictional thrilling novel where each page leads to new clue and suspect. Christopher does a good job in handling few sequences but still has a long way to go. He could made the movie more fast-paced. The screenplay is crispy but loose s the moment in the 2nd half. Editing could have been more tight. Same goes for action scenes. Cinematography is OK. Dialogues are punching. Tom Cruise lends himself into the character of Jack Reacher. He is mind- blowing when it comes to dialogues delivery. He will be well-liked by his fans for doing something different. Rosamund Pike does a very good job as rebellion lawyer and gives a good support to Cruise.<br/><br/>Overall , Jack Reacher is different action thriller which will be liked by Cruise's fan but it does have it share of flaw.

","I haven't read Lee Child's books but thanks to this film I'm already interested in finding more about Jack Reacher and his adventures as an ex-military cop seeking justice in his own terms. Jack Reacher is a witty, serious, strong and intelligent man who tries to solve a case involving a sniper responsible for shooting random people in downtown Pittsburgh. With the help of Helen Rodin, a young defense attorney they dig deeper into the murder case and discover something sinister and evil which is very shocking. The action scenes are incredible including the car chase in a classic '72 Chevelle. People who claim to be fans of the Jack Reacher books made a big deal when Tom Cruise was chosen to play the main character who happens to be over six feet tall and weighs more than 200 pounds. There is no actor in Hollywood who fits the physical description of Jack Reacher and only Tom managed to capture his essence in a very remarkable manner thanks to his unique acting abilities and talent."

But armed with quick one-liners, macho moves, and a charisma that breaks violently through the silver screen, there's nothing Reacher can't handle.

"The_After_Movie_Diner","8","3","8","8 January 2013"," Reacher best of winter season 2012
","Now, firstly, a couple of things: I have never read a Jack Reacher book and I was only excited to see this film, initially for 2 reasons 1) Action Cruise tends to be good Cruise and 2) Werner herzog as a Bond style villain with a comically milky eye. Apart from those things I had fairly low expectations and they were further lowered when I was set upon on Twitter and told that it was a load of old rubbish and I should avoid it.<br/><br/>Well I'll tell you the problem with Jack Reacher the movie and no, Lee Child purists, it has nothing to do with Tom Cruise's height you bunch of negative whiny bitches. The problem with Jack Reacher the movie was the marketing. As always marketing companies (who should really change their name to mismarketing companies or talentless hacks, they can take their pick) have fouled this up and advertised it as a relatively dumb action film. This is to do the film a disservice as it has a clever witty script, it trundles along at a decent pace, the performances are excellent and it's a good old fashioned pulpy, unpretentious, wise-crakin', ass-whuppin' good time of a conspiracy thriller. It has a twisty-turny-yet-fairly-obvious-if-you-know-how-these-things-go type story to tell and it gets in and out with no fuss. The action is good, clear, tight and to the point too with a great finale that manages to amuse, thrill and surprise in a satisfying way. In the shadow of the events recently in Connecticut it's a little tricky in parts because it does fall squarely on the side of the right wing where guns are concerned but, to be fair, that is hardwired into its western style, dime novel sensibility. Lastly the casting of Werner Herzog is a stroke of sheer genius, every word he utters (and that's not a lot as he doesn't have nearly enough scenes) is the sort of nonsensical yet deep sounding babble that drips from the Bavarian's lips as easy as if he were reading a shopping list. It's an absolute wonder to behold and, actually, a little went a long way where he was concerned, any more and it would've veered into really questionable and confusing Bond style villain antics and that would've derailed the simplicity and succinctness with which Christopher McQuarrie told the story.<br/><br/>The wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this, sorry if you didn't that is a real shame because this movie is fun, aware of its clichés but written well enough to not over play them."

","I had a choice between this movie and TCSM 3D and I'm really glad I pushed for Jack Reacher. An enjoyable movie, likable characters, and a well executed plot. You have to pay attention n this one, beginning to end. If you can last that long. It is a rather long movie so I suggest an earlier showing than 10:10 pm like I did. Tragic in some scenes, reminiscent of a few current headlines in our own country. Funny moments for sure, I laughed at the main character and his interactions with the henchmen and bystander on street. (not saying anything else so as to not spoil it for anyone). I isn't see much hype about this one before its opening, I think that's because of its release date coinciding with current events but it certainly was an entertaining movie in every aspect."

Here's some of my thoughts. There are no spoilers.<br/><br/>First off, I'd say I agree with the general critical reception: 4/5 stars. To me that means it's a solid movie that delivers at the high end of its genre. JACK REACHER isn't trying to be anything revolutionary, it's more the kind of action thriller audiences haven't seen for a while.<br/><br/>This isn't MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or even James Bond. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie takes his inspiration from action movies of the late 60s/early 70s like DIRTY HARRY (which has been name checked in a couple reviews already), BULLITT (for the car chase); and maybe another Don Siegel movie, CHARLEY VARRICK. The excitement here doesn't come from over the top stunts or huge explosions. Like the action movies just referenced, you thrill to watching a strongly defined protagonist outsmart, outfight and outmaneuver the bad guys."
"filmguru11","7","3","8","31 December 2012"," Jack Reacher on Cruise control
","Jack Reacher is based on the popular Lee Child novel 'One Shot', and follows the title character as he investigates the murders of five random victims of a sniper shootout. The movie begins with a sharp-looking sniper, selecting his victims through a sniper scope and then quickly eliminating them in one brisk shot. The police investigate and arrest the suspect, who they believe is the shooter. During his interrogation he says nothing, but on a notepad he writes 'Get Jack Reacher'.<br/><br/>The following scene has two police investigators reading up on Reacher with the conventional dialogue of a tough as nails guy, served in the military, brilliant investigation skills, numerous awards and the ever so clichéd, ""Can't find him, unless he wants to be found"". This marks the entry of Jack Reacher, portrayed by a younger (he is now 50) looking Tom Cruise with a broad physique and a no-nonsense look on his face, who's there to learn why the man he despises the most has asked for his help.<br/><br/>During his investigation Reacher learns that the killings weren't random and there is a much higher conspiracy at play. His shrewd detective skills and years of hardened military training ensures he leaves no stones unturned and takes on hired thugs, a brilliant thundering car chase sequence between Reacher and the assassins and outsmarts nearly the entire police unit to uncover the truth. The supporting cast although credible in their performances somehow fell flat and redundant half way through the movie. Rosamund Pike started off very motivating, but her character lacked the anxiety and urgency once the plot started to thicken. The addition of legendary German film-maker Werner Herzog as the film's spooky villain seemed quite intriguing at first, but he was reduced to nothing more than a shadowy figure simply lurking in the background. Although quite late into the movie, a magnificent special appearance from the seasoned Robert Duvall as Reacher's sidekick provided excitement and thrill to a climax that was quickly losing its momentum. Lastly, a splendid performance by Jai Courtney as the master assassin is proving he has the mettle to grab a foothold in Hollywood. He put up a tough fight against Tom Cruise in the finale and next spring he will rub shoulders with another Hollywood heavyweight - Bruce Willis in 'A Good Day to Die Hard'.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is Tom Cruise's show from the very first moment he enters the frame. His performance as the judge and executioner to those who think they are above the law pays homage to a modern age persona of Harry Callahan aka Dirty Harry. The film clearly does have its flaws with underused performances and unexplained sub plots, but these can easily be overlooked due to the movie's thrilling momentum and Tom's on screen persona. It's not the usual over the top movie audiences have come to expect from Cruise's previous films, but a rather down to earth execution makes Jack Reacher a first-rate action thriller."

The fights scenes on occasion seem borrowed from Jackie Chan. Things slow to a crawl when Cruise looks out the window and becomes philosophical. The movie suffers from the written and directed syndrome and feels about twenty minutes too long.<br/><br/>If you overlook the flaws, it's a good time at the movies.

Workmanlike in execution and adaptation by filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie is buoyed by the laconic, deadeye turn by his star who seemingly miscast (the character is a blind 6'5"" force to be reckoned with in the books) manages to rise above the otherwise corkscrew machinations for a relatively entertaining action derivative crime drama."

This is a good enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>First, I was ready to hate this movie. When I heard that Tom Cruise was playing Jack Reacher, I thought it was one of the worst casting ideas ever. I am a huge fan of Lee Child's books. I have read them all. Jack Reacher is physically tall man. And Tom Cruise just could not play that role. Now, I like Cruise's movies. I just did not think he could pull that role. Boy was I wrong. Cruise, while not as tall as Reacher, makes the role his own. I guess he knows a character he can play. He is not Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible here. He is Jack Reacher. The character is very true to the feel of the book.<br/><br/>This movie is well shot. Well acted, and has really good action scenes. It as has a surprise cameo deep into the movie. Rosamund Pike is solid in her role as is the rest of the cast.

","Lee Child's Jack Reacher is described as a blonde, so right away you wouldn't expect that role to go to a guy like Tom Cruise.

Cruise can do this sort of movie with his hands tied behind his back. He's a natural at this sort of thing, which at times makes this role seem sort of uninspired. But who cares? He's excellent here.<br/><br/>Based on the 11th book in the series, when five random people are sniped, a war cop named Jack Reacher (guess who), a mysterious agent who plays by his own rules, is brought from out of the shadows to solve the mysterious. The sexy British beauty Rosmund Pike stars as the lawyer defending the killer, who teams up with Reacher to solve this puppy.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher has its clichés, and I found bits and pieces confusing and predictable. But yet I found it irresistible. This is a good old fashioned whodunit with the entire cast having a blast while we try to piece this thing together.<br/><br/>There is a lot of characters to follow. But really this is a good old fashioned thriller. Thrilling, smart, and at times hilarious, it is all brought together by one of our greatest actors. Is this Cruise at his best?

Every character is two dimensional or less, and the set pieces are hackneyed clichés. The wrong way down a tunnel thing is getting very old after the twentieth iteration.I couldn't help wondering if Saint Thomas did his own driving stunts.

","There are those who say that this Tom Cruise movie should have been a ""made for TV movie"". But I am not one of those people. Tom Cruise is the best Hollywood actor of all time in my opinion. I have been a big Tom Cruise fan since Top Gun. Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher in this movie. He is literally hard to reach. Nobody can ever really determine what's going on with him. Tom Cruise is a detective kind of a guy in this flick. I love the way Tom Cruise acts. There are those who say Tom Cruise needs to keep on his shirt. Well, slap me with a crayon noodle and call me crazy, but I thought his build was good. Heck, if I look like Tom Cruise at 50, I will be happy! The scene where Tom Cruise pops out from behind the wall and perfectly kills the black cop was a little over the top. There are those who say the writers were lazy at that point but I think that Tom Cruise was just a good shot. The shooter (Charlie) played by the guy from Gladiator was really good in this role. Tom Cruise was very convincing when he had that telephone conversation with him. Tom Cruise called him like three times and during one of those times - he said ""I think I want to kill you"". Tom Cruise had a lot of tough guy lines in this movie, that's for sure. When Tom Cruise kept bringing up the quarter and the parking meter, I was confused. Why was he so obsessed with the quarter? The black guy at the end told Laura Dern that he had no choice. I was confused about that as well. What was the deal? Did Werner Herzog have his family held hostage or something? Tom Cruise told the black guy toward the end something about the quarter. I still don't get it. I also don't understand why Tom Cruise never did his famous ""fin run""? That's his famous style of running! But I do like how he fought those five guys in the street. That was classic Tom Cruise! ""Remember, you asked for this."" That was funny. It would seem that Tom Cruise has a ""certain set of skills"" similar to Jason Bourne and Liam Neison from Taken. That girl who played Sandy was very attractive according to my friend Jake. Yet I have never seen her before. Let's see, what else? I guess I will just say that the scene where Werner Herzog told that guy from True Blood to chew off his fingers was pretty original! Good going Tom Cruise! I have never read a Jack Reacher book and have no idea about him but as far as I am concerned, Tom Cruise IS Jack Reacher."

You can also feel same thing, if you watch trailer and expect some bursting action and hell of entertainment, but all you got is something between detective and action movie with really slow pace. <br/><br/>Yes, that same slow pace killed, in my opinion, one really great movie.

Generally, whole movie could be compressed in 100 minutes and we wouldn't miss a thing.<br/><br/>Something that was really impressive and very refreshing in this movie was, really intelligent dialog's and unusual approach to solving case, but all that looks more likely, thanks to book. Acting was solid and whole atmosphere was pretty mesmerizing, but my biggest complain is that mystery feeling is ruined in berry beginning. That same fact killed my satisfaction to find out what would happened when man who don't have anything to gain meat man who don't have anything to lose.<br/><br/>All in all, I would not say that I highly recommend this movie to everybody, but if you go, please don't go with high expectations and maybe, you will get some satisfaction.<br/><br/>Similar looking movie: Dirty Harry (1971) >> Acting factor:3/5 Fun factor:3/5 Plot factor:3/5 Art factor:2/5"

","If you aren't familiar with Tom Cruise by now, you've been living under a dumpster for the last 25 years or so. Probably eating out of it as well. So when I say Jack Reacher is another vehicle for Tom Cruise to play another variation on his usual smooth badass persona, you should know to what I am referring. If you don't, I'm sure that half eaten enchilada sprinkled with coffee grounds won't repeat on you, so go ahead.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher's plot is pretty tight: what seems at first to be a slam dunk mass murder case is thrown for a loop when the prime suspect asks the DA for Jack Reacher. And what do you know, Jack Reacher appears almost instantly to take up the investigation; nobody was able to contact him, but dangit, Jack just KNEW (a common side effect of his extreme smartiness which shows the audience that he's on top of everything already). Then, brushing aside multiple advances from every living female in the film , our hero proceeds to systematically take apart the perfect case against the suspect to reveal a much deeper motive behind the shooting: but now powerful villains are aware of Reacher's digging, and Helen, the plucky young female lawyer who hired him, is in danger as well. It's gonna take a whole lot of fistfighting and shootin' to bring the real villains to justice, and to showcase Tom's- er, Jack's, legendariness.<br/><br/>JR was done well, action hero clichés aside. There was a plot twist or two that kept me guessing 'til the end, reasonable acting, and some nicely drawn out suspense. The most impressive scene was the car chase at the climax -- I do believe that one set a new bar for movie car chases. Of course the gentlemen in the audience will not be immune to Helen's flaunted cleavage any more than the ladies will ignore Jack's gratuitous bare chest. And so the checklist of watchableness is complete.<br/><br/>One more thing: if you crossed James Bond with Joe Friday, could he beat Chuck Norris? Let's put it this way; Chuck Norris is the only living person who can punch a living cyclops between the eyes. Yeah, I didn't think so."
"quinnox-1","7","3","9","24 December 2012"," Not bad, DVD worthy viewing
","I thought Jack Reacher was decent entertainment, with Cruise doing the best he could as the main character, even though he was not really an appropriate choice for the role. I would have expected a gruffer and tougher appearing actor to have been Reacher, such as Jason Statham, for example. Tom Cruise is kind of too much of a ""pretty boy"" for the role, but at the same time he does try his level best as the character, and it's a good try at any rate.<br/><br/>One thing I appreciated about the film is the variety of locations in the scenes, from wide cityscapes to an industrial gravel pit site, to a gun range/store, there was always something interesting in the background and the movie moved along at a good clip, and didn't feel like its two hour running time.<br/><br/>I also liked that the movie didn't do the automatic cliché romance interest that might have been expected between Cruise's character and the blonde attorney character. Often times film makers will do a romance in movies in a seemingly lazy routine, but in this one they just completely refused to do that, which was a nice change of pace. This is workmanlike movie making and that is something I enjoyed. I also thought Robert Duvall's character was entertaining playing a former marine, as a cranky but lovable old man."
"dandavies-41848","2","2","5","28 August 2018"," Wrong man for the role
","This would not have been a bad movie, with a properly cast lead. This is clearly a vanity project, designed to make Tom feel better about himself. The lead character, Jack Reacher, is a very large man, trained as an MP to handle fully trained soldiers. Tom Cruise could not pull it off - the fight scenes looked silly. With a more suitable leading man, this could have been a good movie."
"quincytheodore","7","2","5","16 March 2015"," Slick performances, good amount of humor and smart plot make Jack Reacher a refreshing crime cinema.
","Donning another persona of a vigilante CSI, Jack Reacher, Tom Cruise makes a performance that is bordering on overly fictional, but at the same time charismatically intriguing. Jack Reacher is an action thriller, mixing crime investigation, punch exchanges and some suave driving sequences. In heart, it's heavily focused on a particular case, especially at the first half, people expecting Mission Impossible might not appreciate the intricacy. Action is quite good, more of a realistic scuffle than immense CG scenes, its crude feel has a unique appeal.<br/><br/>The story begins with a retired lone sniper, James Barr, who is allegedly fired on five random persons on broad daylight. When he's captured he asks for Jack Reacher, a former Army Military Police Major who once caught him in his previous spree. Jack is originally unwilling to delve into the case, but ultimately sticks around for the truth, or the dame. Tom Cruise is a good fit for the character, he has a calm and confident air about him, despite probably not as big as Jack Reacher should be. In some scenes he appears as an imposing figure without relying on his size, a somewhat serendipitous result of the casting.<br/><br/>Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) plays the damsel, barely sketching on the clichéd role but just not quiet. She's a self-proclaimed pacifist and a lawyer in defense of James Barr. Her role is adequately strong, although somewhat too over the top when she's surprised, and she practically is, most of the time. Warner Herzog (Zec) is grizzly daunting, he really sold the character from a dark place who has sacrifice more things that people are willing to save his life. Robert Duvall as Cash appears somewhat late in the movie, but he steals the attention with a brassy witty senior role, it's a shame he didn't get more screen time as the interactions between him and Tom are entertaining.<br/><br/>Dialogue is cleverly made and delivered, plenty of details but not veering off from mainstream audience. The action has some good moments, more importantly they are well structured to give increased tension as the story progresses. One particular scene from the driving is unpredictably original, although honestly could be too comedic. Camera angles that accompanied the action are accommodatingly focused, often providing clear perspectives so audience can appreciate the action even in faster pace.<br/><br/>Slick performances, good amount of humor and smart plot make Jack Reacher a refreshing crime cinema."
"allardbon","2","2","5","22 August 2014"," Very, very disappointing
","As a great Jack Reacher fan I bought the DVD of this movie to see my hero on screen. What a disappointment. Tom Cruise is -as many already mentioned- a total miscast, when you need a blockbuster-actor, Sylvester Stallone had even been better. But worst of all: every intriguing aspect that makes the books of Lee Child read-worthy is missing. Jack Reacher is a modern Sherlock Holmes, a loner, extremely well equipped for his task (seeking for justice), not especially pretty but trained, very strong and extremely sensitive to (visual) details. His force is logical deduction. The movie neglects this aspect in any way. That is a shame. Unbelievable that Lee Child gave his permission for this totally uninteresting commercial product."
"maineshep","8","2","5","24 September 2013"," Why a Brit actress?!
","This is my first review and a little late, but after watching the DVD, I wanted to throw out my two cents. I've read every one of Lee Child's books in his Jack Reacher series, and was one of those who was reluctant to see the movie, especially after hearing that Tom Cruise was going to portray the 6' 5"" Reacher on screen. However, Cruise always brings a presence to his films, and I thoroughly enjoyed this traditional action mystery (no CGI) when it came out in the theaters.<br/><br/>My one gripe is Rosamunde Pike. I think that she's a fine actress and obviously pleasant to the eyes, but why did the director choose a Brit instead of an American actress for this role?! She seemed to struggle through her dialogue with the American accent, and felt that it was the only negative aspect of the film. There are plenty of American women who could have done a very good job as Helen Rodin in this movie."
"ScarlettHaiku","3","2","5","23 August 2013"," If Only They Had a Different Actress...
","This movie wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't good. It COULD have been good, and maybe that's why there's a bitter taste in my mouth after having watched it. I'm a shameless Tom Cruise fan. I usually like his movies. And he's downright awesome in Jack Reacher. Rosamund Pike, however, was the squirrel that crawled up the backside of this movie and died. She always looked confused, enthusiastically overacted, and her mouth is wide open in 90% of her scenes. Seriously. Watch it for yourself if you don't believe me. I'm not sure if she is suffering from nasal septal deviation, if she can only concentrate when her mouth is wide open, if she can't bear the odor that's coming from the dead squirrel, or if she's simply a mouth breather. But I can tell you one thing: She made this movie a stinker. I winced every time she came on the screen, though I have to admit I chuckled at a couple of unintended humorous moments.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a nice time to pass the evening by. But if you're looking for the next nominee in the best actress category, look elsewhere."
"damjanraknic","5","2","5","27 June 2013"," Just plain boring and uninteresting
","What can be mistaken as ""cool"" and entertaining these days is beyond me, and Jack Reacher certainly falls into this category. Tom Cruise stars and gives a kind of robotic performance that borders on camp but is super serious at the same time. And that's the thing everything in this film has a tough outer shell, but underneath is well nothing, there's no filling.<br/><br/>The film is way to long for story that is actually pretty superficial and simplistic and some curious storytelling is in place here. The audience is constantly in front of the characters because we are given privy to the information that other characters need right away and this creates a sort of non-tension that makes me think it was a bad call. The way I see great detective films is, give the audience the same information as the characters and let them try to figure it out for themselves. The storytelling inertia of this film, and similar films is going to give the audience the answer and it discouraged me from paying too much attention to the details, of which there aren't many to begin with.<br/><br/>The story itself is well, basic and thoroughly uninteresting but attempts to be controversial in certain aspects and that just took me out of the immersion wanted by the filmmakers. This type of film also asks viewers to forgive too much of camera movement and therefore characters tend to be wherever the plot needs them to be at that moment, but that's not even my biggest gripe.<br/><br/>The film is just boring and uninteresting, and no amount of Tom Cruise beating up people and being a stone-faced bad a** can get me to like this. Sorry."
"r_samani","5","2","5","16 June 2013"," More than casting
","The issue about the film is more than simply a complaint that Tom Cruise does not LOOK like Jack Reacher. As an avid fan of Lee Child, I was really happy to hear that they were planning to make a film. Of course there was concern about the choice of actor, but rather than getting annoyed I decided to watch the film regardless. I mean Tom Cruise is really an exceptional actor and as Ethan Hawke in the MI franchise shows really what an outstanding action actor he is.<br/><br/>However as Jack Reacher - no sorry. This is not about simply the fact that he is not Big, and I don't buy Lee Child's reasoning. The size of Reacher is so central to the books, that if you are watching the film without reading the books then you are missing really the point of Reacher. If you watch say Faster with the Rock, you get a feel for what an imposing character in the book can actually achieve.<br/><br/>I know this may seem pedantic, and if you are watching Reacher without the books as a guide I am sure you will enjoy it. However, personally I find it difficult to enjoy the film without constantly complaining about the casting, and even question whether the books are now tainted (overreaction? more than likely....)"
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","5","9 January 2013"," The start of a new franchise?
","I haven't read any of the 17 Jack Reacher novels written by the British Jim Grant under the pseudonym Lee Grant, so it was no bother to me that the 5' 7' Tom Cruise did not match up to the 6' 5' character of the books. Whatever one says about Cruise, he is still looking good and has genuine star appeal. <br/><br/>Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie has produced a fast and often violent film with implausible plotting but pace and verve. From the tense opening segment of a sniper attack in Pittsburgh, this is a work with style if little substance, aided by some good support performances from Werner Herzog and Robert Duvall. <br/><br/>Like a Clint Eastwood character in the likes of ""High Plains Drifter"", Reacher appears from nowhere and disappears to nowhere, but Cruise and Child are no doubt hoping that this is the start of a new franchise and, in sheer entertainment terms, I wouldn't mind a return."
"TheSquiss","4","4","14","31 December 2012"," If this was based on Lee's 9th novel, how bad were the first eight?
","Back in 1997 Lee Child published his first Jack Reacher novel, Killing Floor. I read it, was mightily unimpressed (you'll love it if Dan Brown's literary prowess rocks your world) and forgot he existed. Then Lee made it big. Very big. He sold the rights to his ninth (were the first eight no good???) novel, One Shot, and the world went nuts over the casting of 5'7"" Tom Cruise to play 6'5"" giant Jack Reacher.<br/><br/>Cruise's height is not an issue, so if you're a fan of the books quit your whinging. Cruise is a big enough star to fill Reacher's boots and the problems with this film have nothing to do with the actor's stature. It's just not a great film.<br/><br/>If you're looking for light, easy, disposable entertainment that won't require you to engage your brain then Jack Reacher may suffice, if you've already watched Seven Psychopaths, Skyfall, Tower Block I'm sure you catch my drift.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is a war veteran with no past, no driving licence and no way of tracking him. He's a shadow and he'll contact you if and when he wants to. When James Barr is accused of randomly shooting five pedestrians, he says simply ""Get Jack Reacher"" and as DA Rodin (Richard Jenkins) and cop Emmerson (David Oyelowo) are attempting to work out why and how to do just that, in walks Jack Reacher. Over the next two hours or so he and prosecutor Helen (Rosamund Pike), who happens to be Rodin's daughter, attempt to prove Barr's guilt (or innocence, depending on which side you sit). While Helen attempts something vaguely resembling intelligent investigation, she recruits Reacher as her investigator and he favours the results gained by beating the crap out of people and we're supposed to believe he doesn't want to use such methods and is really a sincere, thoughtful bloke who wants to be left alone. It's about as convincing as James Bond being a secret agent but telling everyone who he is – just a great deal less entertaining.<br/><br/>It's plinky plonk filmmaking again; all rather predictable and convoluted and I rather lost interest part way through and opted instead to count how many times the bloke in front checked his mobile phone (eight times) and the man behind farted (only twice but they were truly horrendous). Earlier this year, Cruise gave us Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol. It was far-fetched, well crafted and very entertaining in a way Jack Reacher cannot hope to attain. It's all so wooly, has little pace and lacks anything to really compel the viewer to engage with it.<br/><br/>There are some fine touches including the stunt in the trailer where Reacher abandons the car and a sequence that establishes who, how and when each civilian was murdered, but at the heart of Christopher McQuarrie's second film as director (after The Way of the Gun) is a couple that has less on-screen chemistry than Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in Cleopatra (i.e. not much!). If McQuarrie can't be bothered to hire a convincing actress or cast two stars that spark together, I can't be bothered to persuade you to watch his film.<br/><br/>Why would you when there are so many others out there? It's been reported that McQuarrie, who also wrote Jack Reacher, and Cruise will reunite for Mission: Impossible 5. Let's hope it's the McQuarrie who won an Oscar for writing The Usual Suspects that turns up and not the one who gave us the worst Tom Cruise film this year.<br/><br/>It's not awful. It's just not terribly good and, for all its flaws, Skyfall is by far the better option for simple entertainment that's still on general release.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"

James Barr (Joseph Sikora) is promptly arrested as all of the evidence points to him.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is an ex-military policeman who shows up to bury Barr to keep a promise he made based on Barrs previous crimes.<br/><br/>Reacher discovers that all might not be as it seems and uncovered a twisted plot to frame Barr and the motive behind it all.<br/><br/>Robert Duvall plays the role of Cash, a retired marine who runs a shooting range. It was good to see Cruise and Duvall on-screen together after ""Days of Thunder"".<br/><br/>The Zec (Werner Herzog) is the sinister villain who is so dark that in his past, he chewed off his own fingers. The Zec doesn't show mercy to anyone and does whatever it takes to survive.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is action packed which has Tom Cruise in his element. Cruise is performing his own stunts again including an 8-minute car chase. There is a lot of humour throughout the film most memorably the barrage of laugh out loud lines Cruise delivers just below the bar fight.<br/><br/>My only negative point is that the Snipers identity shouldn't have been revealed in the 1st scene. It would have been better to uncover it at the same time as Reacher. Not really an issue for anyone who has read the book, but would make the viewers that haven't more involved.<br/><br/>This film is not going to win any Oscars but it is put together really well and doesn't disappoint. I would hope that there will be further films to follow and Reacher takes over from the M:I franchise."
"aharmas","9","4","15","23 December 2012"," Another Cruise Surprise
","Tom Cruise takes on challenging projects. All I heard and read about was that he wasn't a good fit for the part because of the physical differences in size, height, etc., and by the time the film ended, I have to admit that I couldn't have cared less what the character looked like on the printed page. What matter was that Cruise carried the picture quite well, with sheer determination to convince the audience this was a man who was able to think independently and most importantly, that others should take seriously.<br/><br/>Cruise wanders into the middle of a conspiracy to help the authorities bring the guilty parties to justice. He becomes a crime suspect as the investigation deepens, and he has a couple of close calls as the film reaches its explosive conclusion. ""Reacher"" feels like a 70's thriller. It's intelligent, with enough intrigue and twists to make the audience think and keep us engaged. It doesn't talk down to you, is full of elaborate and unbelievable plot turns. It has the perfect balance of action with the terrific car chase and old fashioned ambush, and there are very intelligent conversations as he and his lawyer friend (Pike) figure what is really happening.<br/><br/>Cruise might not look like a young action hero anymore, but that hasn't stopped people like Ford and Neeson from scoring big at the box office, and now he is showing some strength in the way he portrays his characters. I'm glad they left out the romantic element, and we see more of a camaraderie or sympathy towards his female colleagues. There is a very touching scene involving a woman who tells him that she expects that kind of mistreatment, and we see through his eyes that he knows exactly what is happening.<br/><br/>Pike is excellent as the attorney who gets trapped in the middle of the conspiracy. She is strong but shows enough vulnerability to carry the final scenes. We are not witnessing the birth of a superwoman, but instead there is this modern, intelligent and analytical human being who knows the situation might be troublesome, but she won't run away or act like the typical damsel in distress.<br/><br/>I was particular impressed with the cinematography and the music. It validated my belief that Hollywood, when it tries really hard, is able to bring back an era, or the feel of one. Yes, we have cell phones here, but with the inclusion of the Camaro, and the way the camera zooms in and out of some alleys and the quarry scene, I felt like I was looking back at some of Friedkin's or Coppola's best dramatic work. There are scenes where you can almost feel the spirit of ""The Conversation"" come to life, and it is almost impossible to recreate that car chase in ""The French Connection"", but I had fun watching this tribute.<br/><br/>""Jack Reacher"" is a very good film, and I wouldn't mind seeing one or two more sequels in the series."

"mistabobdobolina","7","3","10","11 March 2013"," Solid action flick, no surprises.
","Jack Reacher is the kind of action flick that comes at once with few surprises and few let-downs. You know what you're getting in a hero like Reacher -- an Eighties-style above-the-law Steely Vigilante whose adventures provide only the suspense of wondering exactly how and when, not whether, he will outsmart the bad guys and mow them all down. Apparently Lee Childs even writes him as a massive muscle man, in which case the decision to cast Cruise was against type... but is also more in keeping with the sleeker modern action star. And unless you came to the film with a specific mental image of Reacher to measure him against, Cruise doesn't falter or disappoint.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there's something a little morbid about watching Tom Cruise as an action star these days, knowing as one cannot help but know that he's a religious nut who actually at some level *believes* all this about himself, that he's some kind of hero and saviour. Creepy as all that might be on the real-life level, though, it works for his acting. He sells the absolute sh*t out of a role like Reacher, committing to it like few other stars could or would, and he's damned entertaining in doing it. The action is solid and exciting all the way through, and even gratifyingly funny in certain spots (you'll see what I mean).<br/><br/>Jack Reacher features some other nice pluses, too: Rosamund Pike as an idealistic and dead-sexy defense attorney, Werner Herzog playing a super-creepy Russian (or Georgian) mobster, a nice cameo by Robert Duvall as an old ex-Marine sniper... it may not be Oscar material, but it's a perfectly solid action flick."
"JMHeebs","4","3","10","15 January 2013"," Well-grounded action, terrible dialog
","Jack Reacher has some serious problems in terms of writing, acting, and direction.<br/><br/>If you were expecting a fun action movie based on the previews, you should be aware that this film has perhaps 2 or 3 action sequences in it, and plays out much more like a mystery thriller. The problem, however, is that while 80 to 90% of the screen time is devoted to dialog, that dialog is very poorly written, and even more poorly executed.<br/><br/>The plot holds up on its own, and while the action sequences are few and far between, they are very well done - in a sort of gritty, more realistic style than we've gotten out of Hollywood as of late. There is no shaky cam here. The final action sequence is particularly enjoyable as it is well-structured and laid out before it is set into motion, and never gets out of hand or over the top.<br/><br/>However, the dialog is just so bad that it's hard to get into what's happening at all. Tom Cruise, who can be a very intense actor, is completely flat. Not once does he show any sort of emotion. This may fit his character to an extent, but all of the other characters are completely flat as well, which makes dialog almost unbearable to watch. Rosamund Pike is particularly bad. The dialog between her and Tom Cruise reads like a clichéd CSI parody. I'm not sure if this falls on the actors, the screenwriter, or the director, but at least one of the above seriously dropped the ball here.<br/><br/>This isn't a terrible movie, but it is definitely a disappointment."
"Troy_Campbell","8","3","10","3 January 2013"," Cruise nails it.
","When Paramount announced it was making a Jack Reacher movie with Tom Cruise in the title role, fan boys incessantly moaned and groaned he didn't fit the bill. In Lee Child's much loved novel series (now onto its 17th instalment with the 9th book, 'One Shot', being adapted here) the former U.S. Army Police Major is 6'5"", weighs approx 110kg and has dirty blond hair - none of which the Hollywood megastar matches. Get over it people. This is a fantastic action flick and Cruise absolutely nails it. Reacher's reluctant investigation into the cold-blooded murder of five innocent victims by a sniper, reveals him to be methodical, unwavering in his quest for what is right and downright vicious when backed into a corner. The no-holds-barred set pieces are shot with a grimy and surprisingly violent tinge by director Christopher McQuarrie - somehow becoming an extension of our enigmatic protagonist in the process - and the car chase is one of the best in recent cinema; the roaring engine of Reacher's stolen 1970 Chevelle, the immersive camera placement and the fact that Cruise did all of his own stunt driving make it unforgettable. This is an entertainingly ferocious film that makes up for its half-baked supporting characters and downfall in the thriller department with bone-chilling brutality, sporadic dry humour and a memorable lead turn by the 5'7"" Cruise. Time to move on fan boys."
"dev_alok","7","3","10","3 January 2013"," Good movie but not great
","I saw this movie in the first week of its release. I have not read any books related to Jack Reacher so my review is only for the movie. My general thought is that movie was nicely made and Tom Cruise did a good job. However, I felt that none of other characters were built properly in this movie to make it a great movie. Everyone in the movie is scared of the villain but I cannot understand why. Overall I enjoyed the movie while I was in theater but at the end I was left asking myself what was the point behind the movie. So good movie to see on a DVD if you have a few hours to kill but certainly not a movie for which you would want to make a trip to the theaters."

","'JACK REACHER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars as the title character from author Lee Child's popular book series about a former U.S. Army Military police major turned drifter investigator. This film is based on the 2005 novel 'One Shot' in which Reacher is investigating the shooting of five random strangers by an ex-military sniper he once knew. It was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (who frequently works with Cruise, having written 'VALKYRIE' as well as upcoming 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE' and 'TOP GUN' sequels). McQuarrie is a better writer than he is a director. He's written multiple films for director Bryan Singer, which have all turned out well, and has only directed one other film (2000's 'THE WAY OF THE GUN'). The film seems clever and somewhat thrilling but lacks the style of a seasoned director to really make it a worth while film noir action flick. <br/><br/>The film opens pretty disturbingly as five apparent random strangers are shot dead in a park in Pittsburgh by a sniper at a parking garage across the river. The police find more than enough evidence to link the shootings to a former Army sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora). Upon bringing the suspect in for questioning he asks for a man named Jack Reacher (Cruise). The DA (Richard Jenkins) and lead detective (David Oyelowo) investigating the case learn who Reacher is as he suddenly shows up. Reacher soon finds himself working for Barr's defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) as he discovers there's a lot more to the case than meets the eye. <br/><br/>A lot has been said about how Cruise doesn't match the height, build or general physical description of the Jack Reacher from the books and therefore isn't a good match for the character. I haven't read any of the books and therefore had no expectations for Cruise as the character. I do know that the author and many book fans are pleased with the result of Cruise playing the popular character all the same. As far as the film goes he's definitely one of the best things about it. He always makes a good confident action hero and here he definitely delivers what he's known for. Like I said the directing and overall style and feel of the film left something to be desired but the story is interesting and for the most part involving. Fans of Cruise should be pleased; although this isn't one of his best films he still does gives them what they've grown to want and love.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMIq71cWOY"
"richy1024","4","3","10","30 December 2012"," Mister I don't follow the Law? Mister maybe you should just not be so mysterious.
","Christopher McQuarrie revision of Lee Child's fictionalised tale One Shot sees Tom Cruise attempt to incessantly rejuvenate his independence from his private life with a character that narrowly matches our expectations of him. Mister, ""I am not a hero"" Jack Reacher (Cruise) is an intangible character with a vague, jerky background. Former martial, no long term residential palace and a solitary vest he washes each evening, Mister Reacher is someone who cannot be found, only he uncovers you. This is a man who fails to live by institutions, derives his own laws, but a little less enigmatic then he could be as once he appears he doesn't seem to depart again as expected by his fellow on-screen chums.<br/><br/>Lawyer Helen Rodin, played by the rather stunned looking and unconvincing Rosamund Pike, hires our elusive hero following a merciless sniper massacre on five citizens of Pittsburgh, due to her struggle to verify the purity of a man whose fingerprints and other contingent evidence on top of a request by the accused for the police to contact Reacher.<br/><br/>Despite the gravity of the plot, Cruise executes this routine with a slightly healthier approach than the ghastly efforts flanking Cameron Diaz twelve months ago, notwithstanding the customary tripe involving machine gun shells, a few left and right jabs and the humorous sexual symbolism of a man standing no taller than 5 foot 7 inches, not mentioning the anomalous inclusion of a fingerless Werner Herzog. Cruise's competency does shine above the rest, but poor casting and some examples of hopeless dialogue simply categorises McQuarrie's festive treat with a bad taste after two thirds of the reel. The movie does embrace a few instances of generating a brutal atmosphere which on occasion enlighten the insipidness of immeasurable cross-examination scenes and frail attempt at a rather precarious car pursuit. Cruise's career will never be refined despite his continuous self confidence. Name changers such as Top Gun, Vanilla Sky and the first Mission Impossible categorise the ambitious Jack Reacher as yet another collective to fill an empty space on the shelving."

","As my summary suggests, this movie was really bad. Amazingly bad. I didn't come into the movie expecting it to change my life, but I was expecting it to be halfway decent. How a movie like this gets made with such an awful script is to me, nothing short of astonishing.<br/><br/>I won't go into the story line, partly because this can easily be found in the IMDb summary, but mostly because it's so poor I have a feeling my description of the story will in fact be better than the movie.<br/><br/>OK, if it's not clear already, I think the script was written by hacks. Lee Child is involved, so for those of you familiar with his work, this should come as no surprise.<br/><br/>This movie is B grade ""straight to video"" quality. It's almost so bad it's good....but not quite.<br/><br/>In saying that, if this was directed by Tarantino it would be a masterpiece! Unfortunately it's not, and it's not.<br/><br/>1/10.

"NanoFrog","2","3","11","27 March 2013"," Several fatal Falws in this film
","This film has several fatal flaws: 1: Tom Cruise. I have never been a serious fan of Cruise. He seems OK for fantasy projects like Mission Impossible. Playing the big, hard, mysterious Jack Reacher is an impossible stretch. Absolutely one of the poorest casting choices ever made. He is adequate in this film, I can give him that...but Reacher demands something better. Child's has, I believe, deeply damaged his brand by endorsing, even bragging about, this incredibly poor casting choice. 2. the big chase scene with the cars. Reacher never had any big car chase scenes, but the director and whoever else just had to put one in, and a really pointless one that does nothing at all to advance the story line. This story in particular, was really great because it had so little car action in it. 3. Failing to follow the story. Reacher is such a compelling and unique character. The film here is just so generic, it misses so many of the great jewels of character that make Reacher such an interesting character. The film is presented in a dumbed down action style of film, when the original story is a smoldering mystery with really brilliant clues, conclusions and mystery solving. The director here failed miserably in that aspect of the nature of Jack Reacher. It is of course always a bitter experience when hacked together Hollywood producers attempt to make films of great books, but this one is specially bad, obtuse, dumbed down, not even close. The director could not even come close to Reacher's famous coffee habit, that part of the character being portrayed by Cruise with exceptional lameness. I can't make a good review of the plot and the cast, it was just such a hacked together film that it does no justice to Lee Child's great original story. Rather than watch this film I would advise the viewers to buy the book...there are even versions for readers. For iPhone and kindle users. As for the film, you will thank me later if you avoid seeing it."

Second...Tom Cruise has a huge schnozz (nose) almost the size of his ego...Reacher does not. In addition Cruise has teeny baby hands...Reacher has huge meathooks of steel.
And aside from the physical disparity... Cruise loves himself a little too much on camera...Reacher is a subtle, quiet, loner..not some pretty boy trying to act hard.
Reacher walks...everywhere....he doesnt drive...he rides (buses mostly...or he hitches).
He wears crappy clothes...not Tom Cruise movies outfits...and he puts them in the garbage when he changes outfits.
He hates cell phones.

"RJC-99","5","2","6","8 January 2014"," Where it's always 1959 and the knuckles don't come any hairier
","Admittedly, I watched the movie as sociological research. I wanted to see<br/><br/>a) what the Tea Party is filling its head with <br/><br/>b) how Mr. Scientology is holding up as a brand; and <br/><br/>c) the brilliant Werner Herzog showing these amateurs what's what<br/><br/>And I was not disappointed. Like all vigilante stuff, the film is at heart a right wing fantasy draped on the idea that the law is for wimps. It devotes lots of time in the second reel to lecturing us about how defense attorneys always let bad guys off. Wouldn't you like to frog-march those namby-pamby criminal-coddlers into the homes of the grieving families so they could be taught a thing or two and maybe even threatened with guns? If you bought a ticket for this, you got your money's worth.<br/><br/>There is a military theme, too, given less screen time but persistent and more important. It isn't quite what you'd expect from the movie's branding (fearless Cruise next to an American flag). In fact, without spoiling anything, I'll say the movie taps into popular discontent about the Iraq war. In the Reacher character, McQuarrie gives us an ex-soldier who, in a heartfelt if hackneyed speech, reveals he isn't sure his service was worth it. To Reacher, it doesn't seem that the freedom he spent years defending actually exists. Now, this was mildly interesting -- existential dread rumbling beneath the giddy bloodshed and maniacal beatings. I don't know whether it's true to the source material or an overlay by McQuarrie, but it certainly livened things up for me. Then, predictably, it was right back to the clichés. It must be a bitter pill for the director who, in another life, actually made a film of some merit in The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>Cruise inhabits his new post-matinée idol skin pretty well. The movie is at pains to tell us he isn't past it -- McQuarrie (at his star's insistence?) including a number of reaction shots in which every woman who sees Jack Reacher walk by swings her head and starts to drool. This is fairly desperate, and unnecessary. Cruise is at his best when looking troubled, worn out, unconvinced. Kubrick brought this out of him much better than anyone else, but Kubrick was stuck with the pretty boy actor. Years later, Mr. Scientology, famously battered about by real life in recent times, is convincingly unpleasant when allowed to be. The Lee Child readers seem troubled by the fact he isn't their dream of a 250-lb. ""killing machine,"" but as his face turns to leather Cruise has in him the potential to be the next Charles Bronson.<br/><br/>The most interesting aspect is the way McQuarrie has cribbed from 1970s Hollywood. It's kind of an awkward fit to the material. He has the look of the French Connection down in places, but not its soul; he isn't Friedkin and Cruise is no Hackman, and as for Lee Child... So, Cruise swaggers about sounding like a guy transported into the present from 1959 --conveniently enough, he's skipped every part of the last 50 years that didn't fit his True Grit world view. The anachronisms pile up: we have a woman defense attorney who is required to let her mouth hang slack as Reacher explains to her, scene after scene, how it's really a man's world and only he has the answers. And of course she'll need saving eventually. Here the movie reaches out to reassure 21st century males hankering for the good old days. Boys, it says, we're back in charge!<br/><br/>The one and only grace note comes when Herzog lights up the screen, albeit looking as if he'd just been decomposing in lye. As the brooding ex-Siberian prisoner who gnawed off his fingers to stay alive, he puts in an afternoon or two of acting that simply changes everything around him. One minute we are in a mostly-competent commercial vehicle meant to give a fading big star work in his declining years. The next we have this odd, hideous genius stepping out of the shadows like a latter day Orson Welles as Welles did when he'd go slumming in junk for pay. His milk-white eye hanging in a haggard face, and his nightmare voice, are the best parts of the film. I recommend fast-forwarding directly to his scenes."

","Tyler Perry as Alex Cross was lame but Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher is excellent. Sure Tom doesn't have that physical stature of Jack Reacher from Lee Child's novels and nowhere near as tall. But Tom Cruise really brings out that tough, charismatic, intelligent, suave and cool attributes so well for his character Jack Reacher I just didn't care. Tom really does steal the show in this one despite him being the main character. And his performance and the character Jack Reacher was more entertaining to watch compared to a character like Alex Cross...Well at least for me. And unlike the movie ""Alex Cross"" which should have made it straight to DVD or Blu-ray. This one has enough to be a theater film. This is actually a intelligent film, not the most intelligent investigation film I seen but has enough. And it's just entertaining to watch Jack Reacher handle certain situations mainly because he is somewhat of a anti-hero and it's cool to see him analyze kick ass and take names. Overall this is a entertaining and exhilarating investigation/action movie and worth seeing. Heck I might just watch it again and I rarely do that for investigation films.<br/><br/>7.6/10"

","So, I'm a huge fan of the Lee Child books and was very excited about this film. Don't get me wrong I didn't expect a perfect representation of the book or story, I expected changes/differences and plot points skipped for the sake of time. Nevertheless, I was excited. Until I found out a midget would play Jack Reacher (who is, in the books, 6'5"", 250lbs). I will say that the movie works as an action film, however if you've ever read any of the Reacher novels you will be disappointed. Not just that ReligiousNutjob (Cruise) doesn't fit the physical description, but he doesn't capture the character of Reacher. This could easily have become a series of movies about Reacher if it had been done correctly. Jenkins and Herzog were good in this film, and Duvall was brilliant. He must have actually read the book because he nailed it. Then again, he's Robert f$#@%ing Duvall."

","Really pleasantly surprised. I hadn't read the books before going to watch it, so i think i was a bit more open mined before going into watch it then other people, but always been a big fan of McQuarries lesser known film The Way of the Gun. I had my reservations about this film, but Cruise did a great job in it and was unbelievably bad ass in the action sequences. Now Cruise is a lot of things except being tall, as the key description of Jack Reacher being 6' 5"" tall is significant in the books. Despite the fan controversy, Cruise has played tough before, such as his great performance from Collateral. Cruise is perfectly cool and tough enough to carry the whole film, whilst being surrounded by a good supporting cast in Rosamund Pike, Robert Duvall, Richard Jenkins and David Oyelowo. Also always great to see the fantastic Werner Hertzog on screen. Wasn't blown away by Jai Courtney, but lets wait and see him in A Good Day to Die Hard.<br/><br/>It was Surprisingly violent for a 12A.

"devileye03","7","2","6","9 January 2013"," Tom Cruise going strong at 50.
","I haven't read any Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child. So I went for this movie just on the basis of the trailer and the impressive filmography of the lead actor. And I wasn't disappointed at all. Director Christopher McQuarrie who wrote 'Valkyrie' has joined hands with Tom Cruise once again. Jack Reacher is a kind of suspense, crime, action movie which I haven't seen for a while. Its a story of a crime investigator solving a case and finding the murderer of five lives. Tom Cruise as the lead is intelligent, confident, highly trained, ruthless, smarter than the cops and funny too as he never drives his own wheels. As the title goes, with every moving frame in the movie, the lead character gets more detailed, whether its the dialogues, some cut-scenes, his questioning about the crime scene and the motive behind it or just his impressive weapon skills. And Tom Cruise took this to his advantage and has given an admirable performance. Rosamund Pike is still as gorgeous as she was in Die Another Day. She has done a good act. Director Christopher McQuarrie has done a brilliant job. Special mention for cinematography by Caleb Deschanel, the car chase sequences are very beautifully captured and executed, so is the movie otherwise. The dialogues are really nice and keep the tempo of the movie. One of my favorites is the one also featured in the trailer, ""You think I am a hero? I am not a hero...."", very well executed scene. The action scenes are good and not unrealistic. The only negative thing I felt was a little less screen time for the villains and just OK performances by them. Its the last movie that I saw in 2012, its an entertaining movie and surely worth a watch."

It can certainly get carried away with itself at times and there are moments in the movie that felt a bit unnecessary, but for the most part this won't be a huge concern. Another fabulous performance is delivered by Rosamund Pike, she lives and breaths this character and is so believable, her scenes with Cruise are some of the movies highlights, the chemistry is evident throughout.

","This is very much a movie that balances between good, and wrong(note, not good/bad, because everything is done really well in these movies, the problem with the movie is that they made the WRONG choices).
I actually watched this movie before reading the books, and as I watched it, there was 1-thing that gnawed at me, Tom Cruise... is too short as Jack Reacher. And after reading the books, realizing that Jack Reacher is 6'05/250lbs(which is roughly my size, so I very much get the mindset), I appreciate the writing more(because even in the movie, I felt that Jack was too short as Tom Cruise(he acted like a giant, while being... Tom Cruise-size), without any hints, or suggestion to expose it).<br/><br/>But that's kind of the problem with this movie, and the next one, Tom Cruise is great as Ethan Hawke(MI), but he's not Jack, and he can't be, his physicality simply isn't the same(and in the books, Jack's size is a big part of his behavior), oddly enough there's 1 actor that is almost perfect to play Jack(Adam Copeland, also known as Edge-Rated-R from the WWE) he's physically perfect, and his natural personality is almost identical to Jack Reacher's(in Haven his Dwight was closer to Jack Reacher, than Tom Cruise was in Jack Reacher, and in Interrogation(a WWE movie) his character is almost 100% Jack)."

After about 1/3 of the movie, hubby hung in there like a trooper, enduring the badness while I jumped on IMDB and started reading reviews. I kept laughing out loud and hubby paused the movie while I read him some of the funnier comments. We were waiting in anticipation for the ""drink blood from your boots line"" since I had already read about it. It did not disapoint. It was as bad as we hoped it would be. We also re-watched the botched ""attack"" in the bathroom scene several times while cracking up at the slapstick comedy. How did Jack Reacher walk away after being bashed in the back of his head with a baseball bat? He sat in the tub looking up as if he had just had lunch! But I got two things out of it.

He is looking a bit older in this movie than his last few movies and I don't recall seeing that famous grin either. <br/><br/>So what I think happened was, a bunch of book readers were up in arms about Cruise's casting and slated the movie without seeing it, and a bunch of movie fans who probably never watched the movie slated it, because it was cool too. <br/><br/>I thought it was an enjoyable action movie.

"willcundallreview","5","1","2","13 November 2015"," A fairly average affair
","Jack Reacher is an action thriller based on the novel by Lee Child called ""One Shot"". It see's well Jack Reacher(Tom Cruise) and his quest to work out what happened in the events surrounding a massacre of innocent civilians in which the suspected gunman has asked for Reacher by name. The plot unfolds like the thriller it is in an extremely thrilling way but I did feel ultimately fails to be anymore than a basic movie trying to entice the viewer in with a complicated story. Now don't get me wrong I didn't think it was bad or anything but mediocre certainly comes to mind, despite decent performances the movie never truly advances to a satisfactory level.<br/><br/>Now Cruise is OK in the role as Jack, he doesn't completely own the role but nevertheless plays him out well and some of the stunts are pretty nicely done by Cruise himself. Cast such as Rosamund Pike and Robert Duvall appear and although Duvall is a welcome sight and good, Pike for me never quite gets going and the role is wasted on her. Werner Herzog makes a random appearance and he feels the most wasted, we never truly discover the character he plays and overall certain members of the cast can seem underused.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie directs and adapts the movie and does a similar job to Cruise, never quite owns it. His direction is steady and the film feels grounded in his hands but it does at times like I say feel over complicated, He really should have made an effort to further explain things. Having said all that McQuarrie still does an OK job and as said makes this grounded and manages to at least make the action partly exciting even if this lacks it at times. The movie could be said to be overlong but the 130 minute running time does start to tick down toward the end when the real exciting-ish parts come into it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something with Cruise that feels almost Mission: Impossible like then you may enjoy this, as said lacks a lot of action but this film isn't all about fighting etc, it's all about seeing what's going and why Reacher is needed. Tom Cruise produced this and one would think he saw potential in this similar to the potential he must also see in the Mission: Impossible movies, this fails to really capitalize though I felt on making it exciting and although never dull, it never feels like something you'd want to watch again soon.<br/><br/>So all in all a miss for me but only slightly, for sure will work for some and I would recommend it because this kind of movie swings both positive and negative. No one let down this movie, it for me just doesn't transition that well, acting is fine and directing too but maybe the novel works best on paper. I must also mention that this movie is oddly funny at times or tries to be a lot anyway, some of the jokes are pretty nicely done and the humour side is also sometimes incorporated into the stunts to make them seem more fun and less tense all the way through."
"troyputland","8","1","2","5 August 2015"," Fast paced action from McQuarrie.
","Jack Reacher upset the fans of the book way before its release date. Firstly, because the film's based on book nine, One Shot, of Lee Child's bestsellers, not the first. And secondly, Tom Cruise is nothing like Jack Reacher's supposed to be: tall, burly, very masculine. Placing this aside, Christopher McQuarrie's action is solid. The 'guess who' investigation focuses on the murder case and the lead investigator. Reacher is mysterious yet likable, intelligent and tough. An outsider who the women love and the men hate. He's called upon by the suspect of five random murders by sniper. He doesn't believe the suspect murdered these people. Reacher and defense attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) set out to uncover the truth. Cruise is no newcomer to this genre. Cruise swaps shocking stunts for raw energy. In one scene Reacher's in real danger, having us believe he is rather than think he'll escape unscathed. All aspects of Jack Reacher are executed with precision. There's no room for filler. The investigation is snappy, the action quick but memorable. Rosamund Pike adds emotion when confronting the deceased victims' relatives. Jack Reacher will gain new fans at the expense of its old ones. This is for the first-timers, not the old-timers."

"Vishal_s_kumar","9","1","2","22 June 2015"," Who the hell is Jack Reacher?
","Jack Reacher may a simply-titled tale of a quasi-mysterious lead procedurally solving a crime and getting his hands a bit dirty along the way, but behind the simple premise, and the even simpler title, is a layered and exceptionally well-constructed movie of the sort that really isn't made all that often, one that's as smart as it is slick, one that's as mentally engaging as it is outwardly entertaining. It's a picture that refuses to give in to too much convention, eschewing a typical blockbuster-fiendly approach for a style that's more substance-based than it is concerned with the raw entertainment value of the material, which only enhances the entertainment value at the end of the day. It's a smart thinking man's sort of film, one with robust and beautifully realized action supporting, not supplanting, a layered plot that unravels in a pure, well-conceived ""whodunit and why"" premise that's fresh rather than flawed, riveting rather than recycled. Based on the novel One Shot by Lee Child, the ninth in the ""Reacher"" series, the film adaptation surpasses all expectations and should, hopefully and given this film's success, clear the path for future Reacher installments in the near future. <br/><br/>Five people are gunned down on Pittsburgh's North Shore by distant sniper fire. They are long-distance professional hits carried out by a skilled marksman using an M1A rifle and precision self-loaded ammunition. When Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) pulls a quarter from a parking meter near the site of the shootings with a clear fingerprint on it, he believes he's found the killer. Pittsburgh police arrest an Iraq war veteran named James Barr (Joseph Sikora). It seems like an open-and-shut case when he all but confesses to Emerson and District Attorney Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), but rather than sign the confessional, he asks to see a man named Jack Reacher, a man Emerson and Rodin quickly learn is something of a ghost, a man living largely off the grid and who was once a decorated military veteran and a renowned investigator. The law doesn't even need to seek him out. Reacher presents himself to Emerson and Rodin and meets Barr's attorney and Rodin's daughter, Helen (Rosamund Pike). Reacher and Helen Rodin agree to team up, he looking into the murderer and she into the seemingly random victims. As their investigation furthers, they stumble upon a web of corruption and lies that extend well beyond the suspect. <br/><br/>Jack Reacher's command of the cinema medium and deep understanding of the subtly dramatic is showcased from the film's opening minutes and carries through right on to the end. The dialogue-free open, paired with deliberate, enticing, and anticipatory opening shots command the audience's attention and create more dramatic upheaval and emotional turmoil than often does a lesser-crafted segment that relies more on manufactured energy and faux drama over precision craftsmanship meshed with simple storytelling techniques. The opening sets the scene for an absorbing picture in which truths are revealed in a deliberate yet very well-paced cadence. One truth yields another, another produces more questions, a question might create an action scenario, and so on until the end. It's a story shaped by a keen dramatic style that keeps viewers guessing and never either ahead of or behind the characters. It's not so much that Screenwriter/Director Christopher McQuarrie (The Way of the Gun) makes the audience a participant in the film, but he rather unfolds the story in such a way that it remains even on both sides of the screen, one never in a different place along the story line from the other. <br/><br/>The film's opening act sets the dramatic dynamics for what's to come, dynamics that in lesser films would be considered adequate for the climactic resolution and revelation but that here are both only the beginnings of the story rather than its end. As the story furthers, the intrigue intensifies and the action slowly builds towards several remarkably staged action scenes that, like that effective opening sequence, take on a more cinematically reserved approach -- here without music rather than dialogue -- that actually heightens the anticipation and pure effect rather than diminish them. Whether a fistfight midway through between Reacher and two bumbling thugs in a confined space, an almost surreal car chase that rivals anything in Drive from a structural effectiveness perspective, or the climactic shootout that chillingly pulls the audience into the middle of a deadly firefight that shows the effectiveness of focused, hard-hitting realism in Action cinema, Jack Reacher often entrances its audience with its sublimely executed action, the perfect compliment to the film's nail-biting story and deliberate unraveling thereof. <br/><br/>Jack Reacher's blend of quality story and precise technical construction are accentuated by a fantastic lead performance from Tom Cruise. Although not the ideal physical manifestation of Jack Reacher based on the character's written description, Cruise does find the inner Reacher wonderfully, playing the part coolly and effectively with a strikingly efficient outward capability and inward mental prowess. Cruise's verbal quips and quick, on-his-feet thinking manifest naturally, defining the character perhaps even more thoroughly than the fisticuffs and gunplay. Reacher is a different animal than Cruise's Ethan Hunt, not quite so physically gifted as the actor's hallmark multi-film character but certainly someone capable of holding his own in a fight. Reacher is less a superman and more a well-rounded individual, gifted with powers of deduction, insight, quick-thinking, and capable physical stamina. It makes the character more approachable, and Christopher McQuarrie has built the film around the character's strengths rather than make him into some larger-than-life figure that would only yield cheap thrills and a subpar story. The character meshes perfectly with the film's adherence to realism and subtlety. Where the Mission: Impossible films may be more purely Hollywood, Jack Reacher works towards building a more realistic, this- could-happen sort of feel that's very much welcome in this age of cinema-in-overdrive."

","Nice one.. Outstanding movie...Like Tom Cruise what a man ...nice one I watched this movie on ptv sports what a movie, action is more then MI2 .There are, however, certain fringe benefits, most involving Werner Herzog and Robert Duvall. Playing a sadistic, one-eyed Russian mafioso, Herzog is as frighteningly crazy as Klaus Kinski. He's a tough-as- tundra survivor of the Gulag and known simply as the Zec (Soviet slang for jailbird). Not the kind of person in whose presence you'd risk saying: ""No zecs please, we're British.""<br/><br/>Duvall is characteristically excellent, bringing pawky humour and ill- concealed menace to the role of an ex-army gunnery sergeant. A sort of Colonel Kilgore in civvies, he runs a rural rifle range as big as a civil war battlefield. That really does bring us into the creepy world of American gun culture."

","Personally, I never read the Jack Reacher books. I do, however, understand that Tom Cruise does not quite meet the physical expectations set forth by the book. But I don't believe that makes much difference to the average movie-goer.<br/><br/>Let's get this straight: I LOVE this movie! Jack Reacher is artfully pieced together with added details picked up by the viewer with every time watched. I have seen this movie probably six or seven times and have still found little tidbits of foreshadowing and evidence of occurrences off screen that build the characters.

","When looking for something to watch the other day I found this one in the program tableau for Cine+ Premiere on CanalSat. Not a movie that had caught my attention before so I decided to have a go at watching it. I have to say that I have spent 130 minutes in worse ways. I found this movie quite good.<br/><br/>It is a pretty classical crime story where it appears that one guy is the guilty one without a doubt but the truth is of course a bit more complicated than this. So our hero, who just to complicate things storms onto the scene also being convinced that the guy did it, have to unravel how the real bad guys managed to frame the poor sod.<br/><br/>The movie is a fairly hard boiled crime story and a cross between Columbo, Dirty Harry and something else. It is reasonably intelligent, holds together without too many holes and quite well implemented. There is some decent good old detective work combined with a fair amount of action ranging from fist fights to car chases and shootouts. The major complaint I have is that Tom Cruise is really not the right guy for the role. He does not look half as tough as the character he is trying to portray.<br/><br/>Other than that it is indeed an enjoyable movie. It is perhaps more of a grandiose TV-movie than something you (or at least I) would go and watch in a theater (then since I got a proper home-cinema system I rarely go to the theaters at all any more anyway) but nevertheless quite likable."

","When considering some of Cruise's more recent action flick offerings, this one has to be categorized a step up.. one that seems to have surprised many reviewers. It's not it's a great movie, it is a bit too long, although to it's credit does not seem so, and the story is pretty nondescript. Let's just say it manages to stay out of its' own way, and does no real harm (how's that for a backhanded endorsement). The true reason it works to the degree it does is because of the cast.. especially Cruise and Pike. They both command audience attention and rightfully so, the parts do not require super acting skills, and we know they have the talent to handle these parts adequately. It's been quite a long time since I've actually gone to a theater to see one of his films, and this would be another where i'd not be inclined to spend that kind of money on. But seeing as easy as it is to watch again on the www, I'd have to say should I come across the title again, I would maybe give it another viewing."

It is an entertaining movie even if it is unrealistic. Of course the main baddies are Russian who knows what. The end where Jack attacks the bad guy is a little trite but again who cares, if they are are bad guys in the movies they deserve what is coming to them, right??

","Jack Reacher was nothing like I expected it to be. The previews made this film look like a comedy, featuring some bad ass cop that doesn't play by the rules. The film itself couldn't be more different from how it was packaged and I think that's why it didn't do as well as it could have at the box office. The character, Jack Reacher, comes from a series of novels and the film is taken directly from one of the books. Strangely enough, they didn't choose the first book written to introduce us to the character, but one written much later. Reacher has spent his whole life in the military and retired as a military police detective. He had enough of not really helping those who deserved help and went off the grid. Now, Reacher only shows up when someone is in need of his help and in this film, that person is a former suspect of his. Reacher knows the man is guilty, but doesn't think he'd do this horrible crime on his own and he goes to investigate. The film was fast-paced and had an interesting story to tell, but they don't let us figure anything out! Jack Reacher has all the answers and tells us everything we need to know and how he figured it out way before we did. I get it, he's some kind of police savant, but it really is frustrating. I love a good mystery and the allure is in figuring it out on my own, but this film never gave me the chance. Tom Cruise stars and fans of the book series were mortified by the choice of producers to have him star as Reacher. I don't care much for Cruise either, but the fans protest had to do with the book describing him as a 6'7 powerhouse. Well who would they rather have had play Jack Reacher, The Rock? This was a major, high budget film, and it needed a big name. Cruise actually does a decent job and was very believable, as was the story, but the one major drawback for me was just how little was left to the imagination."

","Casting Tom Cruise as 6'5"" Jack Reacher was undoubtedly a bad move. The books portray Reacher as a giant essentially, yet Tom Cruise was shorter than virtually everybody else in the film.<br/><br/>That said, the film was still enjoyable and it stuck fairly well to the plot of the original novel. There was a decent supporting cast overall, and Werner Herzog played The Zec very well, I thought. <br/><br/>I'm not sure who could have played Reacher better - though someone with a better physical description was necessary, really - but it's clear the film-makers went for the Hollywood option rather than going for a more suitable candidate to play the ex-MP."
"smatysia","7","1","2","20 August 2013"," Decent flick
","I thought it was a decent flick, neither all-action nor all-thriller. I acknowledge the brouhaha about the diminutive Tom Cruise playing the tall and brawny Jack Reacher. I have not read any of Lee Childs' books, so I am not very invested in that question. Cruise, for all of his off-set looniness, has that charisma, the star power, that overcomes any deficiencies in his acting. Robert Duvall played his stock character right out of Days of Thunder. But it is still pretty good. And Werner Herzog as ""the zek"" is sufficiently menacing and creepy. I was not familiar with Rosamund Pike, but was very impressed with her acting, and her beauty. I will have to look for more of her roles."

I have not read the Jack Reacher books but the movie made me want to read them. And we are not big Tom Cruise fans but we enjoyed him in this movie. Too many of the action movies have little plot or acting and rely on foul language and lots of sex to cover up for not having any content. Jack Reacher did not need to go that way; excellent plot and good acting."

","Tom Cruise really needs to stop making movies. This film has all of his typical clichés: Pithy retorts, self-righteous speeches, ""manly"" posing, etc. And the movie, story-wise, is just plain silly. I'd say more, but it's too stupid to waste the words. (I've never read a Jack Reacher story, but my husband loves them. Tells me that this is not at all a fair representation of the books.) So apparently, I have no choice. I have to give you the rest b/c they require 10 lines of text? Boo on IMDb. Anyway, let's see... there's a plot twist - although not exactly a surprise. there's the evil bad guy - but his story makes no sense and how he's connected to his henchmen or a plausible reason that he would be running around, killing people (kinda randomly offered). there's lots of violence. (Typical, i hear, for jack reacher books, but here, it comes across as manufactured. Like let's show the rock hitting the head or let's show a guy trying to hurt himself at the barrel of a gun, just for the sake of doing so. Doesn't add anything to the story's realism.) I'm perfectly happy to watch a movie that doesn't all fit neatly together; i wasn't expecting Shakespeare.

"ParanoidAndroid97","7","2","7","12 April 2013"," Tom Cruise plays a likable vigilante
","Jack Reacher, a cop for whom ends always justify the means, has 'I must be played by Tom Cruise' written all over him. The butt-kicking vigilante, similar in many ways to another Tom Cruise role, Mission Impossible's Ethan Hunt, is slick, confident, and merciless. And, although I usually find Cruise's acting and/or roles to be intolerably clichéd, I actually found myself quite liking his character here. As far as the rest of the film goes, it ranks somewhere between decent and good, with some typically unrealistic action scenes characteristic of films in this genre (when Jack is being fired at from all angles by a group of bad guys with submachine guns, there's always a convenient rock just sitting there for him to hide behind to save him being peppered with bullets) bringing down the film's credibility somewhat, some better scenes (such as his brawl with the hired thugs outside the bar) raise the entertainment level of this film to above average standard. Werner Herzog's chilling villain, known only as 'the Zec' adds a darker dimension to the film, while Jai Courtney and David Oyelowo also impress. If only Reacher had a slightly less generic love interest and had the identity of the sniper not been revealed immediately, therefore ruining the suspenseful element there could have been had it been kept a mystery, this film might have scored higher than 7/10."

","Have you ever seen someone who you know deserved to rot in jail get away with it? What if they somehow wound up committing the exact same crime? Could you let them get away with that a second time? I doubt it.<br/><br/>When we first join the characters, we find ourselves in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A sniper attack ends the lives of five seemingly random people. With an abundance of evidence against him, the police arrest and charge former Army sharpshooter James Barr (played by Joseph Sikora). Rather than confess and throw himself on the mercy of the court, the way District Attorney Alex Rodin (played by Richard Jenkins) and his lead investigator, Detective Emerson (played by David Oyelowo) would like, he writes ""find Jack Reacher"" on a piece of paper and that's the last we hear from him for sometime. Jack Reacher (played by Tom Cruise) is a former military police officer who served with distinction and all but vanished from the earth once he left the service. The D.A. and lead investigator ask how they're supposed to find someone like that and just as one of the characters says ""you don't find him, he finds you"" he shows up at their office. By this time, perhaps as a result of misconduct on the part of police and prison officials, James Barr is in a coma. His lawyer, Helen Rodin (defense attorney and daughter of the District Attorney played by Rosamund Pike) introduces herself to Jack Reacher and asks him to work as her investigator. Reacher tells Rodin how he and Barr first became acquainted. Barr, a sharpshooter who never fired a single shot during a battle scenario, has been trained for a task he was never ordered to attempt. He, out of desperation, kills several men who are completely unknown to him. As it turns out, those men were civilian contractors and Barr killed them as they were concluding a rape rally. Barr was acquitted and Reacher, certain he will commit a similar crime in the future, vowed to be there when he did.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call myself a Tom Cruise fan. I've seen films he was in that I liked (examples include A Few Good Men, the Mission: Impossible series, and Collateral) and I've seen him in movies I hated (Knight and Day, War of the Worlds, Vanilla Sky). I would consider myself a Rosamund Pike fan; however I have only seen two other films in which she appeared (Die Another Day and The Big Year). I wouldn't call Jack Reacher a masterpiece or some sort of reemergence of Cruise's career, but it was very entertaining and I'm glad I saw it. If you're an action fan, you should see it too."
"Blooner","8","2","7","21 January 2013"," Amazing action and direction, with great acting. Less than stellar writing...
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - Jack Reacher is based on one in a series of books by Lee Child, featuring the titular character Jack Reacher. Jack is a former U.S. Army Military Police Major who is enjoying early retirement in near paranoid solitude. When a sniper expertly shoots and kills five innocent people in Pittsburgh, the police are quick to apprehend a suspect. The man claims to be innocent however, and asks for Jack Reacher. Meanwhile Jack has seen the situation develop on the news, and travels to Pittsburgh to find out for himself what exactly has transpired. Although initially convinced that the suspect is in fact the killer, his investigation leads to more questions than answers The action in this movie is stellar. Immediately from the first scene – where we see the sniper's actions through his scope – it becomes apparent that 'Jack Reacher' takes its time. The over the top action so prevalent in today's movies is traded in for more realistic, cold and calculated brutality. The feeling of sheer tension when seeing the sniper choose its random victims through his scope, not knowing when he is going to pull the trigger, is quickly built, and unrelenting for a majority of the film.<br/><br/>This honest brutality is predominant throughout almost all the action. There is for instance, a truly great car chase scene reminiscent of Bullitt, where you are hurled into the dynamic thrashing of cars. No soundtrack, just the ruthless revving of engines, screeching of tires, and honking of oncoming traffic. Amazing mobile crane shots combined with long cuts show the action in all its glory and clarity. You won't find any cluttered and confusing fast-cuts which are so widespread in today's action movies, which give you a sense of action without showing you anything tangible at all. In this sense 'Jack Reacher' is a true breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>There is some good humour here as well, with some funny, sometimes surprising scenes scattered throughout the film.<br/><br/>The movie does have some serious shortcoming however. What it has going for it in terms of action and cinematography, it severely lacks in the writing department. Dialogue is often terrible, with one particular exposition-conversation being downright cringeworthy in its horridness. Awful lines like: ""I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot."" and similar are strewn throughout the film.<br/><br/>The story itself also has some questionable plot-points. Some 'reveals' are so incredibly evident from the start that I feel like the writers severely underestimate the intelligence of the audience, and simultaneously downgrade the believability of the movie's characters. Additionally it seems the writers could not contain themselves and had to write in the clichéd 'final boss' man-to-man unarmed combat, including the obligatory 'bad guy has a hidden switchblade'-scene and the mandatory heavy rain. This unfortunately somewhat detracts from the otherwise previously mentioned uncharacteristically amazing and realistic action.<br/><br/>I may be somewhat critical of the movie's shortcomings here, but please make no mistake, this is a great film! If you go to the theatre expecting a mediocre action-flick (as I was) you will be pleasantly surprised by its amazing action and more than decent acting. Just don't expect an enthralling thriller with amazing twists and great dialogue as well. For what 'Jack Reacher' is and is trying to be, it is certainly an excellent sample. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com"

What works for the movie Jack Reacher is the character Jack Reacher. Reacher is comparable to a Porsche. Reacher is a well oiled machine mentally, physically and spiritually. The character driven story revolves around how Reacher is always in control of situations, because Jack uses his wits before other means. A 3 D thinker who is one step ahead. The body and mind operate as one and his body with precision when needed. Interesting character who does not worry about the opinion of others and plays by his own rules.

The crime scene is strewn with compelling evidence, all pointing to a former army sniper, James Barr with a blemished mental health record. But the suspect emphatically denies all charges, thickening the plot by scribbling a loaded directive at the arresting officers: 'Get Jack Reacher.' 'Who is Jack Reacher?' This question gets asked a lot in the film, adapted by Christopher McQuarrie from Lee Child's novel, 'One Shot'.<br/><br/>Reacher (Tom Cruise) is already a man of myth, and not just in stature a military cop who is the best-of-the-best at everything he does. He is a canny street-fighter, a top-class marksman, and a brilliant investigator with a photographic memory. He can tell the time without looking at a watch and he can drive a car in reverse at Formula One speed.<br/><br/>Before anyone has time to react, Reacher arrives on the scene with the messianic swagger of an all-star quarterback. It is an open-and-shut case. But Barr named him for a reason. So, after making a deal with the defense lawyer Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), Reacher begins to dig deeper.<br/><br/>It is obvious that the alleged sniper, James Barr, is innocent and being framed because the film shows us the true killer at the very start. But, it is fun watching Reacher go through each step and shape this all out on his own. It is a challenge for the protagonist to figure out who is trustworthy, and who is working to frame Barr. The investigation zips by.<br/><br/>'Jack Reacher' does sport some terrific villains. It is great to witness director Werner Herzog's menacing, mannered performance as the Zek, a former Siberian prisoner turned bogeyman with a gamy eye and a taste for his own fingers. The Zek only gets two scenes but they are both awesome, as Herzog glowers in the shadows and at one point, demands that a henchman bite off his own fingers. ""You gotta be kidding,"" the henchman says, but the Zek is serious.<br/><br/>But aside from the bad guys and one intentionally funny fight between Tom Cruise and two goons in a bathroom, the pleasures are few and far between here.<br/><br/>For additional conflict in the plot, McQuarrie ensures that the alleged killer gets comatose, Helen is pitted against her father District Attorney Rodin and scenes oscillate between romance and professionalism between Reacher and Helen.<br/><br/>On the casting front, Werner Herzog as a cloudy-eyed, finger-lacking villain is barely in the movie, but registers diabolically. David Oyelowo as Emerson, Richard Jenkins as the DA, Rosamund Pike and Robert Duvall - all give strong support.<br/><br/>Action-wise, McQuarrie's direction is functional rather than memorable. He keeps the wheels turning though and delivers action set pieces with élan. There is one good car chase, a predictable but fair-enough ending, and a lot of soundtrack.<br/><br/>The screenplay is verbose and exposition-heavy in the first half before offering a degree of satisfaction towards the end. The conspiracy at the root of it all turns out to be rather humdrum and the plot delivers no surprising revelations. There are moments of good, dry humor. The film drags in the beginning and in the end, but the rest of the time, it is engaging enough."

","O-M-G!!! this movie gave me headache for how terrible it is!!! please, please do not watch it!!! The script is just unbelievably stupid, the acting makes you want to cry, the action scenes... well, there are no words really. I don't know all of the cast in this movie but some of them did try to be as bad as possible. I wonder if someone asked them to do that. And Tom Cruise, what the hell happened to him?! he has done good movies I think, was he drunk during this one or what!? how could he agreed to make this!? Overall you just feel betrayed by anyone who was in that movie or saw it, because someone should have warned you! if only someone would have warned me..."
"elizabethjsmith66","5","2","8","23 April 2013"," Reacher Failed
","Why call this movie Jack Reacher? For anyone who has read the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child, Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher. They have tried to emulate the clipped dialogue from the books and have made reference to Jack Reacher's analytical thought processes but it just serves to be a poor imitation of the real thing. I suppose the reason for using Tom Cruise in the title role was to assure a box office success. However, many who are familiar with the Reacher series will be as disappointed as I was with this movie. They should have called it Tom Cruise Fails At Attempt to Portray Jack Sreacher. For one thing he's about a foot shorter than the title character and that's one hurdle he can't jump over. Also I don't like his attitude in this movie. I don't think the Reacher character has the conceited egocentricity displayed by Tom Cruise.. Should have called it TomCruise Trying To Be James Bond And Failing Miserably."

","Well, what can I say besides I had very low expectations thanks to the critics of this movie. And guess what. I really enjoyed the movie despite that the Reacher character in the movie was not up to par with the book version as many of the complaints focused on. To be honest who really cares if the movie didn't follow the book entirely considering this is a work of fiction anyway. I enjoyed the fight scenes and the story was woven together nicely. The movie had some nice surprises too and wasn't too predictable like many lame movies are these days. In fact this movie had me guessing at some of the bad guys until they all revealed themselves. <br/><br/>I generally don't care much for Tom Cruise movies although Risky Business and Top Gun were actually very good movies and I did watch them. The Mission Impossible franchise was OK but felt they could have done more with it. The point I'm trying to get at was I enjoyed his Reacher character in this movie. I don't care if he wasn't 250 lbs and 10 feet tall as some of the critics expected. Cruise did a good job in my books for this role and I hope to see him play more characters like this. In fact I hope they make more of the Jack Reacher movies too. Considering the crud I've seen in the last 10 years this was a nice surprise. My only regret was missing the movie while it was showing in my local theatre. I had to settle for blu-ray instead. LOL"
"espiegle","8","2","8","17 April 2013"," I was surprised
","I have been a Jack Reacher fan for a lot of years. That said I was honestly disappointed when Tom Cruise was picked for the lead, Not that I don't like his work I just didn't see him fitting the character. But after watching the movie i have to say Tom Cruise played Jack Reacher very well, Cruise brought the attitude and style of the books to the screen. I don't think there is another actor that could have done it as well as he did. I enjoyed the entire story and i believe any fan who can let go of the obvious disparity between the physical description of Jack Reacher and Tom Cruise long enough to watch this will enjoy the story as well."
"krispy8","6","2","8","13 March 2013"," Decent suspense if not for some silly scenes
","Let me start off by saying I never read any of the books and I'm purely judging the movie based on its plot and delivery.<br/><br/>The movie was decent and it was a solid story and performance. The only thing that made it a little bit lower on my scale is the fact that they added a couple of scenes that didn't really fit in with the overall picture of the movie.<br/><br/>One, the bathroom fight scene where the two bad guys were accidentally hitting each other with their weapons. What the heck? Was that supposed to be intentionally comedic? It didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and it was kind of random that the scene was there.<br/><br/>Two, the car chase / bus scene. The rest of the movie is like a crime suspense thriller, and it was also kind of random how they had random strangers helping him evade the police. It seems like something you'd see in a light-hearted action movie like Spiderman or something, but it didn't seem to fit in this movie.<br/><br/>Anyways, overall the movie was still pretty decent and had some entertainment value, hence I give it a 6/10."
"aruk5","5","2","8","27 January 2013"," Tom Cruise Highly Unconvincing as Jack reacher!
","First of all let me tell you all I am a fan of Tom cruise! I watched some of his early films such as Top Gun, Cocktail as a teen and saw great potential in him (at that time) as an all time superstar and it's true to a certain extent. Even now in the 21st century he still manages to strike box office gold as compared to lots of actors who started out with him in the 80s and are nowhere to be seen today!<br/><br/>During his rise to super stardom from late 80s on wards he starred in some flicks which were box office mega hits but at same time managed to offend some people. Like in the early 90s he was chosen to portray Lestat in Interview of the vampire. Anne Rice the author and countless fans of the vampire series not accepting it! Later in the mid 90s he released mission impossible which was based on the hit series! The movie was mega hit but made many fans of the TV series angry? why (spoiler ahead)? Well in it he killed of the main character of the series Jim Phelps after making him the main villain and then made his character Ethan Hunt (who I believe was a secondary character in the series) the main lead in the rest of the series and since then it has been a one man show instead of a huge team effort as in the series! Then a few years back he was chosen to play a German Colonel in Valkyrie!!<br/><br/>So you can see Tom has a reputation for stepping into parts which quite doesn't match up to him and so based on this tradition Cruise managed to get yet another part which doesn't match him in anyway! Yes you guessed it - Jack reacher!<br/><br/>For those who didn't know Jack reacher is a character who appears in novels written by author Lee childs. Jack reacher's physical description is as follows:- 6' 5"" tall (1.96 m) with a 50-inch chest, and weighing between 210 and 250 pounds (100–115 kg). Now picture Tom Cruise in front of him! No way does he resemble him in anyway!<br/><br/>I don't care if Cruise is a major box office star and that his presence in movie adaptations of novels is sure to guarantee lots of money to the producers but that doesn't give them the right to destroy the feelings of millions of fans of a character who too spend their money to watch the movie! What shocked fans the most was Lee Childs himself giving the go ahead for Tom cruise to star in it! lee justified it by saying that having a major box office star will ensure the movie is seen by many? Huh? If that be true how come a movie like Harry Potter made billions with absolute newcomers in the cast (most of whom truly resembled the characters from the novel)! <br/><br/>Now for the review:-<br/><br/>The starting of the pic was very chilling and disturbing to watch. A man parks his vehicle in a multistory parking lot and takes out a sniper rifle and aims at some people sitting far by! I must admit this sequence was very disturbing to watch as we are shown the snipers viewpoint looking at potential victims! After sometime he shoots some random victims! later we see swat team members raid a house an arrest a guy and is borough to the station for interrogation! He writes down get me reacher on a paper! Know what I am going to stop here and not explain the plot further and just say that ignoring the fact Cruise played reacher, overall the movie is quite good and pacing is up to mark! Not many boring moments! A few scenes of violence and a sort of predictable climax! All in all great for a onetime viewing at best. Not much in it for repeat value!"
"BJBatimdb","6","2","8","9 January 2013"," Tom too short to walk tall
","I'm not an all-out fan, but I've defended Tom Cruise for years on the basis of great acting in movies like Magnolia and Rain Man, so I was prepared to suspend disbelief while he acted six foot five.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for the first time ever, his height bothered me. And the fact that it must have bothered him might explain why Jack Reacher pulls its punches on the the smart/funny front and descends predictably into a shoot-em-up. A more secure - oh let's face it, a TALLER - actor could have pulled off the Man of Mystery thing, but Tom Cruise JUST CAN'T. He has the look of a well-scrubbed, well-fed farm boy who's been working out in the barn, not a dangerous lone-wolf drifter, appearing from the mist to solve crime with his intellect and his fists. <br/><br/>Without that definitive central characterisation, Jack Reacher could only have saved itself with a cracking plot and sparkling humour - making Cruise taller with knowing wit. There are a few stabs at it, but Tom Cruise is out of his depth here and he's not even in the deep end. Instead he flails for the lifesaver of fast cars and big guns, while the plot is only workmanlike. His skills as an actor are redundant, and in their absence, he's exposed in the spotlight and found wanting by ten inches.<br/><br/>Everything else about the movie is standard fare. Rosamund Pike does her usual deer-caught-in-the headlights thing. To keep Cruise seeming sexy in the absence of sex, she's required to be a lawyer but with a very low neckline. More headlights-caught-in-the-headlights. It's distracting to everyone but Cruise, who's not tall enough to look down her cleavage.<br/><br/>I don't know how Lee Child handled the plot, but it's spoilt here by having the reveal right up front, which is an unusual technique when you then have Jack Reacher take 50 minutes to reveal what you already knew.<br/><br/>The action is generally poor, with Cruise looking dumber and dumber as the film goes on. He walks backwards out of doors into crowbars and chooses the loudest possible method of sneaking up on villains. More than once his well laid plans depend on slapstick crooks and trained killers who can't shoot straight. <br/><br/>Werner Herzog is a comic-book baddie who chewed off his own fingers to stay alive in a gulag. Not sure quite how he got into construction after that, but this part of the plot/motivation is so weak it's more like an afterthought and doesn't matter. <br/><br/>In smarter hands, even Tom Cruise could have made us believe he was Jack Reacher, by embracing his lack of height and making it work in his favour. But the flashy attempts to distract us from his stature only makes us think about it constantly.<br/><br/>The trailer-makers knew what the film should have been - a roller-coaster of thrills and laughs and original, quirky moments. Sadly, it's more like the teacups."
"ramnathbalaji","7","2","8","5 January 2013"," Plenty of promise. Does it deliver??
","Jack Reacher promises a lot. A bunch of civilians get shot. Cops arrest a suspect within hours based on evidence in the crime scene. Suspect doesn't talk but just sets the stage for the seemingly you-can't-find-me-unless-I-want-to-find-you hero to walk in to the case. What happens next forms the rest of the story. What is the motive behind the murders? Did the cops arrest the right suspect? Does the defense attorney have a hidden agenda? <br/><br/>Tom Cruise sleepwalks through his role. Casting is just perfect. There are enough sub-plots to engage the viewer throughout. But in the end you are left wondering if makers failed to capitalize on a great opportunity."
"sleej003","6","2","8","29 December 2012"," An amazing story line let down by terrible acting
","I was really looking forward to watching this film and to tell you the truth I was a little disappointed. Yes so the first scene was very cool and interesting and all the rest, and the crime seemed very well worked out. Everything was done for a reason and explained well. However, there were some things that seemed very pointless (such as The Zec killing one of his thugs) and sometimes things didn't add up. There was something extremely wooden about the whole thing that seemed very stiff and awkward. The acting was very monotone and normal, apart from Cruise who managed to save the whole thing by becoming Jack Reacher; somebody who was cold and calculating. The only thing that stood out to me was the superb car chase scene and then the final scene where Bars talks about Reacher, leaving the possibility of another film adaption of a Jack Reacher novel to come out. This film should have been brilliant. There were a few separate bits of pure brilliance but over all it seemed very wooden, stiff and awkward. Like the cast weren't there because they didn't 'become' their characters as Tom Cruise did, making them seem very odd. I was disappointed to say the least. I would give it a go anyway, if not for the acting then for the story line"
"octopusluke","6","2","8","25 December 2012"," Reaching for fifth gear, yet never getting out of Cruise control
","Disappointing us with his falsetto in the jukebox musical Rock of Ages, Tom Cruise returns with the action-thriller Jack Reacher; the first, and unlikely to be the last film based on Lee Child's bestselling crime fiction series.<br/><br/>Cruise is the eponymous anti-hero; an enigmatic ex-military cop using his brain, brawn and ego to bring criminals to justice. Whilst he may not have the blonde locks, towering height, or formidable muscle mass of Child's literary creation, the pint-sized patron saint of Scientology is strong here, adopting the same wit, surly demeanour and cocksure charisma which has made him such a bankable movie star.<br/><br/>After a six-shot rampage leaves five innocent bystanders dead, the hospitalised lead suspect begs the police to bring in the only man who can solve the case, Jack Reacher.<br/><br/>Soon enough, the nomadic Reacher arrives. Together with defence attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), a little digging turns this allegedly open-and-shut case into a Pandora's box of secrets and corruption.<br/><br/>Adapted/directed by Christopher McQuarrie – best known as the Oscar winning writer of The Usual Suspects – the embellished script allows space for the supporting cast to shine. Pike has great chemistry with Cruise from the outset, brilliant as the sexy-smart sidekick. Elsewhere, Richard Jenkins and David Oyelowo put in reliably good performances as the discerning detectives in the wings.<br/><br/>But the oldies really steal the show, with Robert Duvall as a brusque gun ranch proprietor, and German filmmaker Werner Herzog as the cartoonish villain, a glass-eyed Siberian war-prisoner called 'The Zec'.<br/><br/>Shot in a gritty, old-fashioned style, such a rough finish turns Reacher from a quintessential action man into a 21st century Dirty Harry; willing to break the law to catch the bad guys. His arrogance does start to annoy, but the bareknuckle brawls, throwaway one liners and a rousing car chase sequence keep us enthralled.<br/><br/>A scattering of good moments doesn't stop Jack Reacher from outstaying its 130-minute running time. Built on action-thriller clichés, the film takes itself far too seriously to be mindless entertainment; reaching for fifth gear, but struggling to get out of Cruise control.<br/><br/>More reviews at www.366movies.com"

"TheLittleSongbird","7","1","3","7 April 2016"," Very enjoyable film, with a few drawbacks but also a number of strengths
","Considering the mixed reception that 'Jack Reacher' has garnered, most of the critical external reviews have been positive or mixed feelings but it also received a lot of backlash from fans of the books, it was hard to say how 'Jack Reacher' was going to turn out.<br/><br/>When finally seeing it, the film is far from perfect by all means but to me it was not bad at all. In fact it was very enjoyable with a number of strengths. It's a very well-made film, stylishly and atmospherically shot with a neo-noir feel while there are some good use of locations and the editing is tight and crisp, making the action coherent and not resorting to the often seizure-inducing shaky cam technique. The music is energetic and haunting without being brash or overly-bombastic, with very effective use of silence.<br/><br/>Despite a few draggy and too padded out scenes (particularly the overlong and far too talky scene with Jack and Helen trying to piece things altogether) and an anaemic - due to the lack of tension-, anti-climactic and all too convenient ending, the story is paced very nicely and is always diverting. The twists and turns ensure some good tension and suspense and it never feels too predictable, hackneyed or convoluted. There's also the use of flashbacks to remind the viewer of anything important, thankfully they're not overused or repetitive. The action is exciting rather than overly-loud and generic with the right amount of chaos and urgency, like the brawl and the fight in the hallway. Character interaction is strong, with the central one between Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike having some nice moments, and Jack is a very interesting character.<br/><br/>Most of the acting is good. Whatever has been said of Tom Cruise being physically completely wrong (often described by detractors as one of the biggest miscasts ever), he still makes for a charismatic and intense hero that has steel in his eyes and plays it appropriately straight despite the campiness of some of one-liners. Am amazed at well he deals with the action, his energy and dexterity are enviable. In support, two fare particularly strongly. One is Robert Duvall, his role is quite small but he brings a very memorable curmudgeon wit. The other, and even more so, is Werner Herzog's spine-tingling villain, his story of how he came to lose his fingers is the film's most chilling moment. Richard Jenkins is strong if underutilised, likewise with David Oyelowo. The biggest surprise was Jai Courtney in the best performance this viewer has seen from him, unlike his awful performances in 'A Good Day to Die Hard' and 'Terminator Genysis' he actually isn't annoying and he has a personality too. 'Jack Reacher' starts on a wonderfully tense note too, so much so that one wishes that that quality of tension was there at the end, and while Christopher McQuarrie is a better writer than he is a director he directs more than serviceably here.<br/><br/>Sadly, there are drawbacks. Much has been said already in the review about the ending and some draggy pacing and padding, but another problem is the overlong length with some of the third act feeling forced dialogue-wise and bloated. The two biggest problems with 'Jack Reacher' are the script and (as much as I hate to say it) the performance of Rosamund Pike. There are some clever and funny moments in the script but the amount of times the one-liners were cheesy and forced and the film became too talky in a long-winded fashion were more numerous. Pike is a much better actress than she is given credit for, and she has given some good to great performances in good to great films (especially her brilliant performance in 'Gone Girl') and has even been a redeeming factor in mediocre/bad ones or heavily problematic ones, but her performance here is one of her worst in a role that wastes her. She is not helped by her character, who is bland and underwritten and it was like the writers couldn't decide what personality to give her and her dialogue is well below par and is frankly beneath Pike, but this viewer has never seen her look so stiff and bug-eyed (she has showed much more expression and range than here before, despite what her detractors say) and the performance was an uncomfortable mix of melodrama and phoning in.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while far from flawless 'Jack Reacher' has a lot of great things still and judging it as a standalone is very enjoyable. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox"

","I haven't read the ""Jack Reacher"" books, so I have no comments on how good I think it is as an adaption. As a movie, though, I thought it was great. It has a similar style to the Bourne films, but it still feels fresh.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, in my opinion, gives one of his best performances in this movie. He plays Jack Reacher with plenty of charisma and looks pretty convincing as a Chuck Norris-type figure in the action scenes. It also helps that his character was given a good amount of depth.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also very good. Rosamund Pike as Helen Rodin makes for an engaging character that is definitely tougher and smarter than most girls in the James Bond series. Richard Jenkins and Werner Herzog are also good in their roles.<br/><br/>The plot has a realism to it and can be thought-provoking at times. The script is quite good.

","When I head that Tom Cruise would be playing a 6 feet 5 inches and 250 pounds character, I knew something was amiss. And it was so distracting noticing the scenes where they tried to make Cruise look big, even though some other scenes showed his true height. Swaggering like a large man does not make you look large...<br/><br/>On paper, it was a hit movie. Big star (Cruise), talented co-star (Duvall), great screenwriter (McQuarrie), interesting European villain (Herzog) - oh and a series of novels that have sold tens of millions of books.<br/><br/>In reality, it fails in many directions.<br/><br/>The acting is wooden - Cruise has zero personality, as do any others - perhaps they have all reached their Scientology ""clear"" status?. The pace is tedious. Comedic touches felt wrong. The sexual chemistry was poorly staged and hard to believe -I don't think there has ever been a convincing romance in a Cruise film, not even with his former wife. The initial killings weren't impactful enough for me to have me emotionally hate the villain.<br/><br/>Spoiler: the bathroom fight was ludicrous. Three thugs sneaked up on our unaware hero, and he would've been dead except for half-a-dozen failed attempts to hit him. <br/><br/>If Cruise wasn't the lead, this film would have been straight to video. <br/><br/>On the plus side, the fight scenes and car chase weren't bad, and felt unique. The story was great, it was just told in a dull way... we knew almost everything prior to Reacher working it out. It was like an Agatha Christie novel told by a 4-year-old. <br/><br/>An average screenwriter could have done a better job than McQuarrie (writer of The Usual Suspects). Seemingly he is just a hack for hire these days, even when he is directing his own work. <br/><br/>To make it work they should have:<br/><br/><ul><li>rewritten the screenplay - had a hulking actor of Schwarzenegger talent or above to play Reacher - changed the lawyer to a male - shown Reacher prior to the get-go, his lifestyle - made the setting more rural, more small-town</li></ul><br/><br/>I didn't care for Reacher in this one bit.

","I have never considered myself a Tom Cruise fan, my movie collection however would suggest otherwise; I am going to use the excuse that he is a great presence in the genre I am more favourable to. This said it feels strange to me to associate Mr Cruise with the form of humour, as he commonly portrays the tough military character with a broken past of love. However in his recent movies I have found myself chuckling away at various sarcastic comments and sly jokes as Cruise dips his toes in the pond of funny, and there is continuous dipping of his tiny toes in his recent movie Jack Reacher, based on the novel ""One Shot"" by Lee Childs, where Cruise plays an ex-military man (sound familiar?) more specifically military police. Reacher is called in or rather turns up unannounced just at the time people need him, and becomes entangled in a defence attorneys (Rosamund Pike) attempt at saving a man, Barr (Joseph Sikora), who is apparently being set up to have shot a group of people; of which brings me to my first disappointment with the fact that the audience was shown right at the beginning who the real shooter was and knew it wasn't Barr (Sikora), opposed to leading the audience through a ""CSI/Who Dunnit"" type of plot which would fit in with the ""Law & Order/CSI"" type theme running throughout, showing how they figured out who it was and how they saw the evidence etc. I know what your thinking, ""So Tom Cruise has gone all mystery solving now and not climbing up buildings as a secret agent!"" Believe me when I saw the trailer for this movie my first thought was something along the lines of: ""Eurgh Mission Impossible as usual!"" But I will admit I was pleasantly surprised of this new genre twist Cruise has gone for, being that I'm a fan of ""Law & Order"" type TV shows. That being said there is still enough brawls and perfectly choreographed bone breaking and life ending fight scenes along with high-speed car chases with lots of drifting and damaging of very nice cars to satisfy even the die-hard action addicts among you.<br/><br/>So the plot centres around Jack Reacher (Cruise) and Defense Attorney Helen Rodin (Pike) and their attempt to keep suspect Barr from death row, of whom also is ex-military, their effort to save this man leads them obviously into trouble and set-ups as you can imagine, which lead to various fight scenes and manly stances from Mr Cruise. Reacher and Helen need to figure why this man was setup and who by in order to save themselves and Barr.<br/><br/>Mr Cruise clearly does very well in this action thriller and it was quite enjoyable to watch, what with the incoherent man grunting throughout the fight scenes and the obvious ""part of the contract"" scene where Tom Cruise has to take his shirt off at least once in the movie; along with that ""CSI"" feeling ""Oh! So thats how they did that."" However I wasn't without some disappointment hence why I didn't give it full marks. I feel the ending to the case of Barr (Sikora), was rather abrupt and although the bad guys were dealt with I was left feeling like justice still hadn't been served and that the criminals had just been given the easy way out, or the writers ran out of ideas!<br/><br/>Overall this was a good movie to sit and watch, I wouldn't pay to see this at the cinema again giving the high prices, but I may consider purchasing it on Blu-ray and DVD during the sales; as I thought even though this was slightly different to what we are used to seeing Cruise do it is still very much the same and hence this made it somewhat predictable. If you're a fan of the ""Mission Impossible series"" or action thrillers then I think you will find this satisfying enough to not walk out the screening mid-way through and are likely to purchase the Blu-ray or DVD when it is released."

","It took me until the final act, involving Jack Reacher teaming up with a comical, senile old dude to break his girl out from a shack in the middle of the night for me to realise: I am SO OVER Tom Cruise action movies. I mean, they all seem to follow a distinct pattern, and earn their star obscene amounts of money even though its the stuntmen that deserve all the kudos. Also, spare me another movie about 'The Outlaw With A Heart Of Gold'. And that 'Good Guy Turns Out To Be Bad' twist was old even before the hills came into being.<br/><br/>Still, it's not all bad. We get intense car chases, shoot outs and a nice bit of KUNG-FU FIGHTING going on (Apologies to Carl Douglas). It all feels slightly laboured though, as if everyone is going through the motions rather than enjoying themselves. It's the sort of movie where the feeling of déjà vu is all-encompassing from the get-go, and when it's all over you feed the goldfish, brush your teeth and go to bed, not being wiser or dumber for the experience. Or to put it another way, it's like going out with the first person who asks you: Catch it if you must, but you could probably do better... 5/10"
"twilliams76","6","1","3","7 September 2013"," Tom Cruise's BEST in at least a decade
","Those who know me well know that I am not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise and I can actually do without most of his movies. It seems as if Tom Cruise has at one time signed up somewhere to play a character that has been used interchangeably ever since in a variety of movies as he is oftentimes a tough-talking alpha-male with a chip-on-his-shoulder.<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is a perfect Cruise character as he is the SMOOTHEST toughest-talking, most alpha-male movie character to be on screen in months (he is also the film's title character and that could possibly be all that Cruise needed as motivation). Jack Reacher doesn't really have a chip on his shoulder, though ... his ""chip"" is more like a state the size of Texas.<br/><br/>Reacher is called to Pittsburgh to help investigate a multiple murder in which five random people were killed from a hail of six shots along the urban riverfront. A military officer is accused of the murders but Reacher knows the suspect is just a patsy which means he'll have to dig a little deeper to get to the truth and find what has been hidden and/or destroyed.<br/><br/>Not getting much help from the law (who actually believe Jack could be behind the deaths or at least knows something else about them), Jack teams up with the officer's lawyer, Helen (Rosamund Pike - Pride & Prejudice), and the pair follow evidence trails that lead to her father's corrupt office at the DA (Richard Jenkins - Killing Them Softly) and to other less-than-desirable individuals such as a sociopathic hit-man (Jai Courtney - A Good Day to Die Hard) and a secretive Russian mob boss (Warner Herzog - What Dreams May Come).<br/><br/>Jack always has something to say no matter the situation or surroundings (this kind of won me over) and he must always stay a step of others and his surroundings as his life and Helen's life are quickly put into danger. Figuring out why these five people were killed and what their unlikely link was might get Jack into trouble or killed ... Can Jack figure it all out before it is too late?! Jack Reacher has some good dialogue and it was my favorite thing about the film. Cruise oftentimes comes across as arrogant but here his character's talk backed-up his stance. Pike has little to actually do but I still like her as an actress and using Herzog in such a small role garners attention as he rarely acts on screen anymore. Jack Reacher plays its hand wisely and most of it works.<br/><br/>Director Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) has wisely crafted a film that makes one wonder and suspect and anticipate what'll come next. As much as I hate to admit to liking a Cruise vehicle ... I did like Jack Reacher and I could actually watch it again!"
"Padre78","3","1","3","28 August 2013"," a real let down for me
","One Shot' is my favourite book. Not my favourite Jack Reacher book. My favourite book. So when I heard they were not only going to be making a Reacher film, but making 'One Shot', I was ecstatic. Then I heard who would be playing Reacher and like 99.9% of fans I thought to myself, ""this must be an April Fool's joke. A 5'7"" skinny guy playing the hulking 250 pound, 6'5"" Jack Reacher? This can't be happening."" Sadly it was. And then the trailer came out and my worst fears were confirmed. Cruise was not being buffed up by any type of body suit, he wasn't being made to look taller with trick photography and he wasn't putting on the raspy 'animal-like' voice I always imagined Reacher to have.<br/><br/>Lee Child once made a great analogy to Jack Reacher. He said ""does anyone remember the story lines in the Dirty Harry Movies? Not a chance. But they sure as hell remember the character."" The Reacher books are about a single thing, and that is Jack Reacher. Don't get me the wrong, the stories in 90% of the books released so far are masterpieces and could easily be made into great films. But they still remain a vehicle for which Jack Reacher can thrive in. And the producers proved that they realised this (albeit very late in the piece) by renaming the movie 'Jack Reacher'. A little in-your-face for my liking, but I could see why it was necessary so I didn't hold it against them. However I did reserve my right to hold Tom Cruise's casting against them. And I was right to. Did Tom Cruise pull off the great character of Jack Reacher? Not in your life.<br/><br/>Cruise was cast badly, and then went on to play the role even worse. Not a great combination if you're an actor. Heath Ledger took the opposite route in his role as The Joker in Christopher Nolan's 2008 masterpiece ""The Dark Knight"". He was hugely criticised for being completely wrong for the part when he was cast and we all know how that turned out. Cruise unfortunately did not rise to the challenge in the same way.<br/><br/>For starters, I'm reasonably confident he was the shortest person in the film. Not one effort was made to make him look the least bit impressive stature wise. His haircut was ridiculous. He looked like a guy who goes to the hair salon twice a week for touch-ups. In fact Jai Courtney in the role of the Charlie had what I always imagined to be the perfect haircut for Reacher. Perhaps he would've been better placed in the role? Cruise's shoulders were not broad enough. At one stage a character asks ""I'm looking for a guy who could kill a man with one punch?"" To which he is directed straight to Reacher. Get real. Rosamund Pike was probably more likely to kill someone that way than Cruise. Cruise did not alter his voice one bit for the movie. This was a huge disappointment for me. I had really hoped he would do something like what Christian Bale did when he was in the Batman suit, only not quite to the same degree, but for the whole movie. Cruise sounded almost feminine performing some of the lines. Lastly, he kept bloody smiling (or smirking, whatever you want to call it). I was OK with him cracking the odd joke here and there, because Reacher can be a bit of a smart-ass, but he didn't have to look so damn proud of himself every time he did it. Reacher's an animal, 24-7, he (very) rarely smiles and he takes life very seriously man"

I found it very hard to connect with any of the characters, although all the performances were very good.

On occasion, Tom's been quite good, on occasion, you get the same 5 or 6 facial-expressions that he has been using for most of the films in his career. <br/><br/>Other minor objection is the somewhat typical deal with dropping all weapons and do the final fight hand to hand.

"tristintheshyman","4","1","3","10 June 2013"," Not as bad as most people have made it out to be, however not as good as some of the reviews suggest
","Overall, the movie was okay, not by any means the redeeming movie of Tom Cruise's career. He is simply not suited for the role. From what I have read in past reviews, Reacher is supposed to be tall, hulking, and ominous. Tom Cruise is petite, hardly built, and looks like a super model throughout the film. <br/><br/>Now we can get to the movie itself. First off, any action in the movie, is overshadowed by the ridiculous amount of dialogue in the film. Most of it is necessary to the storyline, I understand. However, the dialogue was boring and long-winded. They could have found a happier medium between action and dialogue. <br/><br/>The action (what little of it there was)seemed choreographed almost too well. The action( after the first scene) is also boring, and the scenes fall flat. Also , the dialogue was cheesy and there were so many clichés in this movie it was almost funny. I mean, for example, the criminals in the movie are portrayed as bumbling idiots with no plan. Also, on a smaller note, most wore black throughout. <br/><br/>The plot seemed convoluted and each ""twist"" in the plot seems cliché and overused and can be seen from miles out. Also,there were at least six good sized plot holes in the movie. For example (and this is minor compared to some)the scene where he steals the Chevelle, when he arrived at his suspect's house a warrant seems to have materialized in the glove box. Also, in a ridiculous coincidence, the suspect's mom, who sat on the porch, just so happened to be stoned out of her mind. She does not even check the piece of paper Tom has is even a warrant!<br/><br/>This movie's ending is not stellar either. The ending seems to leave us hanging, yet is very predictable and boring. And if this is an allusion to a sequel, please, for the love of God, do it better next time! <br/><br/>This movie is not, as some reviews say, a total waste of time, however. There are a few humorous one-liners in the movie, and there are some unintentionally funny one- liners during supposedly serious scenes. There is also a scene where he makes fun of a slutty waitress. That was probably the funniest scene in the film and probably the only one worth watching. <br/><br/>To summarize, this movie is not horrible, maybe a waste of time for the serious moviegoer looking for the next great thriller, and definitely not a movie worth sitting through the full 2 hours it takes to be completed."

"bkoganbing","6","2","10","27 December 2012"," A Grassy Knoll Scenario
","Tom Cruise stars in Jack Reacher who is like a modern day Simon Templar without the elegance. We're not sure just what side of the law our protagonist is on, he certainly dislikes being called a hero.<br/><br/>It is understandable that the debut of this film was postponed with the tragedy of the Sandy Hook school shooting as the film opens with just such a shooting from one side of the Allegany River to another in Pittsburgh. A loner ex-GI with a penchant for violence who trained as a sniper who it is broadly hinted has done similarly evil stuff in the past gets accused of a mass shooting where six people die. <br/><br/>There was a really good Law And Order episode where Sebastian Stan plays a high school kid who shot four people at random to cover up his intended target. That's what's going on here. And as investigator Reacher sees, there's a grassy knoll scenario being played here.<br/><br/>Cruise whose latest films have a decidedly more violent bent to them, seems determined to finally shake off that youthful image that has stood him in good stead with films going way back to All The Right Moves. He doesn't look like the all American kid in his Twenties, but as the male player with the surest box office draw he can't exactly transition to character roles the way others can. <br/><br/>One guy who successfully has is Robert Duvall who has a colorful and eye catching role as the owner of a rifle range whose clientèle has the key to this mystery. Duvall and Cruise are reunited from Days Of Thunder as Duvall serves as backup. Guys like the folks in back of the massacre are giving gun owners and shooters a bad name which is why he teams with Cruise. That is a message I'm not sure how it will be received in this climate.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike plays the attorney with father issues personal and legal who is representing the accused shooter. When your father is played by Richard Jenkins who is also the District Attorney those issues do tend to multiply. She's afraid of Reacher's own violent tendencies, but goes with the flow.<br/><br/>You can't tell about these things and certainly the Sandy Hook shooting throws a pall on this film. Still there's enough shooting, enough car chases to satisfy any action fan. And Tom Cruise's global legion of fans will have little to complain about."

","I have read and enjoyed most of Lee Childs 'Reacher' books. Like most people, I had a mental picture of Jack in my mind's eye, Tom Cruise is not it! As Tom produced it, I assume he can put whoever he likes in the part, was it just an ego trip that made him decide he was perfect for the part? the money? what? And we can only assume that Mr. Childs gave the go ahead, again, was it the money? Whatever the reasons a pretty boy actor, no matter how good, at 5' 7'' can't play a huge man of 6'5''. On top of that, the screenplay was a million miles away from the book, a cracker of a read, if you have not read it, forget the movie and read the book. If the movie had been made years ago, someone like Lee Marvin would have made a great Reacher, rugged, not too good looking and looks the part. Someone has suggested Ray Stevenson, an actor who also looks the part, good choice I think. The movie itself should be watched as an entertaining action movie, it's not at all bad, but it's not Jack Reacher. Will there be a franchise? I hope not!"

","I'll start by saying that I'm not a Tom Cruise fan. I am a fan of the Jack Reacher book series and that is the sole reason I spent time watching this movie. Casting Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher is just a cruel joke. Jack Reacher is 6' 5"" and 250 lbs. Tom Cruise obviously is not. While they kept to the plot of the book (for the most part), the acting wasn't very good. It wasn't much better than a made for TV movie. I kept wondering whether they should have cast Cruise with a troop of little people. If so , it may have been more true to the character (of course I jest). I just hope this movie doesn't turn people off to the book series. My advice, save yourself the time and trouble and read the book and skip the movie."

","Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie brings author Lee Child's novel One Shot to the big screen and then relies on Tom Cruise to push his weight around. A crazed sniper guns down five people at random on a Pittsburgh riverfront. Detective Emerson(David Oyelowo)seems to have a cut and dried case with enough evidence to implicate an ex-military sniper named James Barr(Joseph Sikora). As the gunman is questioned by Emerson and DA Rodin(Richard Jenkins), Barr wants to only speak to Jack Reacher(Cruise). Reacher seems to be a ghost; a former military investigator that has left no trace, falling off the grid. Reacher sees the story in the paper and shows up gathering clues to aid a beautiful and talented defense attorney Helen Rodin(Rosamund Pike), daughter of the DA. Reacher originally came to bury Barr; but wants to be certain of the snipers guilt or innocence. Reacher himself becomes a suspect in the unraveling of a growing chain of gang related activity. Even DA Rodin appears guilty; but guilty of what? There is plenty of violence, brutal violence. The only complaint I really have is there is no time for Reacher to get real close and personal with the pretty attorney he is aiding. This Cruise vehicle gets supporting help from: Michael Raymond-James, Alexia Fast, Vladimir Sizov, Werner Herzong and the ever impressive Robert Duvall."

","I would give it a 6.5. Action sequences were above average. A car scene was very well done. Cruise was convincing as a man who could do the things Reacher did in the film, on both intellectual and physical levels. He carried the movie on his back, in my opinion. Once past these achievements, the film suffered. Dialogue outside the action was unconvincing. People talked at each other to fill in the plot, or for no identifiable reason. Human connections were not genuine. The major failing was Ms. Pike. She did not look, act, or sound like an attorney at any point. After years of Law and Orders we all have an idea what a lawyer representing a client should be, even one as stunning as Ms. Pike. Whether it was direction or her own interpretation she came across as unreal in nearly every scene and that spoiled any chance the movie had to be truly good. That said, if you like action movies you could do worse. A lot worse."
"just_tere","8","1","4","5 March 2014"," Tom Cruise, while very good, is NOT Jack Reacher
","I've read about 15 Jack Reacher novels. Could say I'm a huge fan. When I'm ready to read the rest, I can borrow them from my public library's inter-library loan service.<br/><br/>Just as Matthew McConaughey is no Dirk Pitt, Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher. Other reviewers have pointed out the differences between Lee Childs's Reacher and Tom Cruise's Reacher -- the size difference is just too vast to overcome.<br/><br/>That being said, this was still a terrific movie. The action that I've come to expect from Reacher is solidly there. As others have pointed out, with Reacher, you don't need special effects -- the character is fully grown and yes, sneaky at times. His time in the Army military police gives him more of a background in fixing wrongs -- as in this movie. It starts out with one premise and ends totally differently, as Mr. Childs does in every Reacher book.<br/><br/>There were times, however, that I did find myself saying: there's no way Cruise could beat the jelly bellies out of the dudes he takes on,the way a 6'5"" Reacher could. His arm length just isn't there. That's what helps the ""real"" Reacher, his arm length is his best ally. I literally found myself not watching the movie so much as wondering which scenes Mr. Cruise was standing on a box for. Petty, I know, but as a Reacher fan (and as pointed out above, an obvious Dirk Pitt fan!) that's what I was thinking. Clever shooting of scenes and I'm sure boxes, helped Mr. Cruise make this movie believable as to his size difference.<br/><br/>Once I got past my pettiness of the wrong man, Mr. Cruise played a very good character -- the movie was terrific! Shows how THINKING rather than special effects, can make a movie for the ages. Admittedly, because of my disappointment in casting, I did not see the movie in the theater, I watched on Netflix. Normally, when watching a Netflix movie, I'll get up, get something to drink, put the dogs out, chat with my husband, etc. Not this one. I sat, riveted to my computer, until the end of the movie, and immediately ordered a much longer cable for between my TV and computer. This is a movie that needs the bigger screen. No interruptions -- my dogs wanted petting, they were put out of the room by husband (who refuses to watch movies for some reason -- and no TV either, NOT the man I married 25 years ago -- probably sick of the special effects, silliness, etc.). I was literally spellbound.<br/><br/>I agree with another reviewer, let's have at least one more Reacher movie, and yes, let's have Mr. Cruise play him. (But no more Matthew McConaughey playing Dirk Pitt -- he was grand in the movie, but he is seriously no Dirk!) I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater, with all the noise, etc. And once my longer cord gets here, I will replay it on Netflix and sit on my husband to watch it. As that may kill him, I'm glad that it won't take long until he is as entranced as I was."

(Camaro SS... gotta admit it was pretty bad ass car, which he unfortunately ended up destroying; yet another action movie cliché)<br/><br/>Basically Tom Cruise is a bigger badass than everybody else, and is a way better investigator than any other cop on the case. Oh, don't forget the crooked-cop-who-is-really-working-with-the-bad-guys cliché. The whole movie is designed make Cruise look like the biggest badass on the planet, pretty much.<br/><br/>Despite of all of this, I have to admit I actually kind of enjoyed the movie. I didn't go in expecting a masterpiece, so it didn't disappoint. Definitely better than anything with Jason Statham or Bruce Willis, at least. If you want a film where you can just chow down on a bowl of popcorn, turn off your brain, slam a few shots of vodka and have a good time... well, then give Jack Reacher a chance."

","I was glued to my seat all the way through. Unfortunately the glue may have ripped my pants as I abruptly stood up to eject the DVD and take it back to the store. Jack Reacher was the first movie in over a decade where I felt compelled to finish the movie. The first half of the movie was written like a masterpiece. A proper build up, a deep lain conspiracy where nobody can be trusted, and enough plot twists to make your head spin. But as the end approached, the dark and sinister plot to frame a marine sniper for random killings to cover the murder of one person, quickly turned into a quick gun battle and wrap-up that could've been written by a 13 year old. They left more loose ends than shag carpet. They skipped the trial of the suspected killer and voided the whole point of the antagonist. Even Rosamund Pike's character seemed confused by the end. She inquired about clearing Jack and Jame's name and Reacher replies with a one liner and bails. The wrap up scene was pathetic, there was still a mountain of evidence connecting Barr to the crime and almost no evidence connecting the Zec and all of the Zec's men to the conspiracy, and even if it did, they're all dead. This movie defeats it's own purpose."

And Jack Reacher ain't a handsome guy by any means. I figure the guy to play Jack Reacher would be Vinnie Jones.. if he could manage an American accent. A big hulking homely guy with an authentic military bearing. Jack Reacher was a major in the military police. You think handsome little runts get into that position.. forget about it. As Reacher says in one of the books, if you're going to go out and pursue and arrest some of the toughest hardest guys in the world, special forces guys and so on, stone killers, you must be tougher and harder. Period. Tom Cruise does not and cannot pull it off. That being said, if you are prepared to forget all about the Jack Reacher novels and just watch a typical Tom Cruise movie, it's okay. It's a sufficient time waster with a few good scenes in it. And the great Werner Herzog as a psychopathic bad guy is amusing.

That's not too bad"". But this, 7/10, seriously guys? I rated this 4/10. I have some reasons, but I guess that what bothered me the most was the acting: it was bad. So bad, it hurt my eyes. Jack Reacher is not only a big guy, but a very smart one too. And sarcastic. And scary. Tom Cruise failed at all of those things. He just can't be Reacher. He's not funny enough. He's not threatening enough. I was laughing all throughout the film, and for the wrong reasons. I tried to like it, but I just couldn't. Spoiler: There is a scene where Jack Reacher is calling Charlie and threatening to kill him. The way he does it is: he calls him, tells him he doesn't want to kill him. He hangs up. He calls back telling him he just changed his mind and wants to kill him. In the book; it was exciting, scary, funny and it kept my adrenaline rushing. In the film it was none of that.

I just think I had a misconception of the film before going in.<br/><br/>Cruise is the mysterious, effective Jack Reacher, a man who makes promises that he can and does keep, an amazing combat fighter and one just all around tough guy. And Tom Cruise looks the part. For all the hoopla about how great he looks turning fifty, this was no glamor part for him. He's not photographed particularly lovingly, which is right for the role.<br/><br/>Five people are shot by a sniper, and the police accuse an Army sniper with a similar history. The man is shot and in a coma, but he's able to write a name on a piece of paper: Jack Reacher. Reacher is a former Army criminal investigator.<br/><br/>Reacher shows up but he wants to put this guy away, as he once promised he would as the Army didn't prosecute him for similar killings. If this man, Barr, summoned him, he did so because he knew Reacher would find out the truth and do the right thing. In other words, this guy has been framed.<br/><br/>Reacher and the man's attorney (Rosalind Pike) work together looking at the victims and then trying to figure out who framed Barr and the real goal of the shootings. He realizes that these shootings were not Barr's m.o., and he soon finds himself the target of some very mean men.<br/><br/>This is a good story, but my kind of action story are the Mission: Impossibles, the Bourne films - I will be honest and say this one was too violent, too mean, and, dare I say it -- too realistic -- for me. I like my action couched with a certain amount of suspension of belief. You do need that here for some of the shootouts, though.<br/><br/>If this is your kind of action film, you will love it. It certainly has the acting, the production values, the hard, cold atmosphere, the car chases, the violence, and the blood. It's done very well. Being squeamish, I won't be watching it again."

","Reading some of the reviews I wonder what people were expecting...Its a hybrid action with elements of crime/thriller mixed in.

There are just some things I wouldn't do if I was the perps or Reacher.<br/><br/>SPOILER:<br/><br/>For people that complain about the end fight...About how ridiculous that Cruise couldn't be hit by the sniper...Let me put it this way, getting shot at by another sharpshooter will completely reset your priorities. The Gunny had all the advantages, shooting from the dark, while the Russian is nice and outlined for him on the ridge under the light, not to mention having lost his night vision while Gunny was compensating for it. Now try hitting a sprinting target at 150-200yrds in the situation he is in. However, what IS stupid is how they didn't turn the car into swiss cheese, with that many assault rifles, Reacher should be dead."

","DVD from my local library. I don't have any affection for Tom Cruise, the man and his politics, but I find that he makes really interesting action movies, like this one.<br/><br/>Here Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher , we gradually find out he was a highly trained military man and expert marksman, but over the past few years has dropped off the grid. When 5 people are apparently randomly shot and killed sniper-like from long range in Pittsburgh, a quick investigation points to a man who had gone berserk and killed 5 while still in the military. But the only ""confession"" he writes is ""get Jack Reacher."" Before they even have a chance to look for him, he shows up. <br/><br/>Rosamund Pike is attorney Helen who volunteers to try to get the man's life spared, partly because she knows her dad, Richard Jenkins as District Attorney Rodin , usually wins his cases. But Reacher sizes up the situation and comes to his own alternate conclusion, the arrested man was framed, he was not a good enough marksman to pull it off, plus clues seemed to be left simply to implicate him.<br/><br/>As viewers we can see in the opening scenes who the real shooter was, and it indeed was NOT the man arrested, but we don't know why he is being framed. That part of the story is revealed very gradually up until the end.<br/><br/>I happen to like movies, like ""Taken"" where a man with superior skills hunts down and gets all the bad guys. This is that kind of movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: In fact the 5 killings were not random, but made to look that way. Four were random, but one was targeted, a woman who upon the death of her husband decided NOT to sell their business as planned. The foreign business entity that stood to lose from this decision was responsible for her execution, and the collateral deaths. A dirty cop was involved in the ruse."

"Leofwine_draca","7","1","5","9 June 2014"," Pretty decent for what it is
","JACK REACHER has been praised by many as a particularly strong example of the Hollywood action film done right, and I can see why such comments were made. It's a breath of fresh air to see a taut and in some ways mature thriller free of overblown CGI action, although this pales in comparison to classics of the genre. The novel is adapted from a popular book by Lee Child, but there are major issues with the script.<br/><br/>One of the first problems is that the running time is way too long, and there's loads of padding which makes for some excruciatingly slow and talky dialogue scenes. The initial sniper scene is certainly one of the most arresting ways of opening a film I've seen in a while, but I can't believe it takes the main characters a full hour to figure out the truth behind it when I realised immediately while it was actually taking place.<br/><br/>The villainous plot seems to be part of some sinister conspiracy but it all feels rather lightweight and superficial. Certainly when things end up in a quarry at night it doesn't feel very wide-reaching or indeed connected to many things. Instead it smacks of low budget, a set-piece you'd expect from a Steve Austin-starring direct-to-DVD flick instead of a mainstream Hollywood outing. I wonder if it was because most of the budget went on Cruise's paycheque.<br/><br/>Cast-wise, much was made of Cruise's miscasting, but I haven't read any of the Jack Reacher novels so it's difficult to comment. However, I did find this one of his colder leading roles and his cockiness was a little wearying; certainly I preferred his roles in the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films and THE LAST SAMURAI. Rosamund Pike is a pretty face but a pretty poor actress, it has to be said, although Jai Courtney acquits himself well after a poor showing in the crashingly disappointing A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD. Werner Herzog's casting as the villain is just bizarre, but Robert Duvall bags a nice supporting role this late in his career.<br/><br/>JACK REACHER is an entertaining little movie at the same time it's simplistic and straightforward. The action sequences are well handled, particularly the mid-section car chase which doesn't disappoint. A good effort, then, but one which is too lacking to be considered anything more than an above average popcorn movie."

","Jack Reacher - I had been persuaded for a thousand times to take a look upon this movie. Of course, knowing Mr. Cruise as the leading actor, it's certainly not just an ordinary film. Plus, it was adapted by the One Shot book. Quite a masterpiece. What I love the most regarding this movie is, the puzzles and the intelligent mind of the investigator, Mr. Jack Reacher played by the man of Mission Impossible, Tom Cruise. I was looking forward for every moves and steps taken by Jack to be impressed. I think they did pretty well. The element of surprises was there but not enough. The time passed for more than two hours was spent worthily, but the plot just after the entire puzzles solved, which also involves the hunting of the main culprit was a little bit inadequate. Even the end itself wasn't good enough. It was worth for 3 and a half. Should be very recommended to be watched, but unfortunately, wasn't good enough for the satisfaction."

Reacher is supposed to be a big guy. Tall, heavy, muscled with a lot of confidence. Tom Cruise has managed to make him lose all that we love about him, and even gave him a sense of arrogance. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of the books: stay well clear of this, or have it buy you dinner first, as it will r*pe you without any lubrication while watching it.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of the books: Skip this just as well, bad acting, bad plot revision, poor movie.

Then again, he'd already pulled of greater an even greater casting coup in McQuarrie's Valkyrie (check him out as the German Officer Claus von Stauffenberg), so I guess this is no surprise. Furthermore, though I'll fully admit to not having read any of Jim Grant/Lee Child's books about Reacher; I've checked up with friends who have - and Cruise's portrayal seems rather glib to say the least.

","Lee Child's One Shot comes to the big screen with Tom Cruise playing the retired military police, Jack Reacher. Before I go any further, I have to mention that I have not read the book but believe me when I tell you that it ought to be ten fold better than what the movie was.<br/><br/>As with every other blockbuster Hollywood movie, I most certainly was looking forward to Jack Reacher and of course Tom Cruise's portrayal of the character. The storyline begins with the deaths of five people and the police zeroing in on Barr in what seems to be an open and shut case till the accused asks for Jack Reacher who turns up in the city not to save the guy, but bury him and get on with his (Reacher's) life. But things start to seem out of place and Jack decides to investigate further to find himself uncovering an intricate plot of 'epic proportions' (Read sarcasm).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Tom does his part. He blends into his character smoothly and does the job quite well. However everything else in the movie, to put in two words is; simply average. The plot stood thin and predictable coupled with some terrible acting performances and while our heroine/damsel in distress Pike's performance was nothing stellar, I cannot help but imagine how could the director go so wrong with this movie after having being involved in hits such as The Usual Suspects and Valkyrie.<br/><br/>To conclude, Jack Reacher did not live up to its hype and certainly did not meet the high expectations I had of the same. Don't get me wrong, Tom's a great fit for Jack Reacher but everything else is just too poorly crafted for my taste and those who find themselves in agreement with me."

The on-screen chemistry between her and Cruise worked great.<br/><br/>There were very realistic fight and action scenes. The actors didn't try to be supermen who could fight for hours without getting tired. No, they used brutal moves, which clearly took a lot of energy, and that made my respect for the director go up a notch or two.<br/><br/>To offset the grim action, there were scenes which made me laugh out loud.

","This was, much to my surprise, a delight to watch, not because of the Action conceit that this movie promises, but mostly, seeing Tom Cruise enjoying himself around such handsome male villains. One of the more exciting discoveries in recent years is the talented young Australian, Jai Courtney. The sexual tension between these two very athletic, very angry men with automatic weapons is palpable. They are each trying to emasculate the other, proving in the end that the Alpha male is, of course, Tom Cruise. The guns are dropped and fisticuffs ensue in Mr. Courtney's final scene -- this is one of the finer moments of male-to-male contact in recent cinema. It's the closest Tom will get to admitting that he enjoys the touch of male skin, and it is exciting to watch. Elsewhere, Ms. Pike needed someone to adjust the length of the belt on her short trench coat as she walked down the corridor, but otherwise, some strong male performances that make this a thoughtful, testosterone thrill ride. Clever casting with Werner Herzog and Robert Duvall as well! I'm sure they both enjoyed their Paramount paychecks, very much."
"bhaveshbhatia","7","1","6","7 January 2013"," If someone wants to look at a rough and tough action hero, then he must slip into hall for the action thriller Jack Reacher
","An old-fashioned guy, Jack Reacher loves to board a bus and reach his destination. He doesn't carry a mobile phone. He does not even care to load his wallet with credit cards. He is a real man having a muscular and robust stature. Tom Cruise surely has been able to do justice with the character of Jack Reacher, as explained in the novel One Shot by Lee Child. Tom Cruise is not a six feet five inches tall protagonist, whom Child has portrayed beautifully in the novel, but Mr. Cruise has successfully represented the tough and mysterious guy in the movie through his acting. As the story goes on the central figure of the movie is a military policeman who has got a wide knowledge about arms and ammunitions and is an expert in hand-to-hand and face-to-face combat. He is lonely and self-sufficient; utters few words and doesn't care to present explanations for his deeds. He doesn't care to jump in fire to get the mask of false, misdeed and deception peeled off from the mouth of truth and loyalty, and can go on fighting and struggling like a crusader to carry the holy chalice of truth in his hand. In short, Jack Reacher has been a figure of fantasy and attraction for ladies. <br/><br/>Action sequences of the movie are highly enjoyable and but not a very good thing about the thriller is that there are some unexpected and wrongly placed moments of laughter and cheese. The laughable sequence of Cruise's shirt-off scene cannot be said as very rightly and effectively placed in the sequence of the movie. Besides, Pike and Cruise are not getting together cozily for even a single scene where they can show off the thriller of the chemistry called love to audience. The scene where Helen (Pike) and Jack (Reacher) were in a room of the motel, discussing about their secret plan of tracking the actual figure behind random attacks, does not even portray Cruise as a flirt and lover of woman. The director seems to intentionally cut short any kind of Epicureanism for this American action thriller. But, Pike, Oyelowo as well as Jenkins performed satisfactorily for the thriller movie. Spectators are giving the director of Jack Reacher, Christopher McQuarrie a green light for directing and shooting the movie's sequel. The sense of mystery and awe has been well presented in the movie. Cruise has scored a terrific and dashing ten out of ten marks for his character in the movie as an action hero."

","OK say what you want about Tom Cruise but the guy can still make a great action movie and do it well at 50. Jack Reacher is an adaptation of a Lee Child novel about the ex Military Investigator/Drifter who lives off the grid. There are a series of these novels with Jack Reacher as the protagonist and they are quite popular. In the novels Reacher is a master investigator with a knack for solving tough cases and seeing the obscure clues in a case nobody else sees. He is also a physical marvel at 6'5 240 lbs who is a beatdownologist when the situation calls for it. Enter Tom Cruise all 5'7 165 lbs of him as the smooth with the roughness version of Reacher.<br/><br/>The film begins with and interesting but simple plot that that sparks the question ""Who is Jack Reacher"". It does well setting up and entrance for Tom Cruise to enter as a drifter who has no email,address,credit card,phone number etc. The only reason you know he exists is through a bank account where he withdraws his military pension from. The basic plot has the makings of a great whodunit ripe with misdirection and who can you trust and you prepare yourself to see how great of a detective this Jack Reacher is but....... the film focuses less on Jack Reacher the investigation and more on how perfect,handsome and cunning Jack Reacher and you kind of get the feeling that nothing bad will ever ever happen to this man because he knows everything and is one step ahead of everyone and if someone get the drop on him it doesn't matter because Jack Reacher can beat up anybody and everybody........at the same time if needed. The first 45minutes are great but then something happens after that and the film sort of becomes Ethan Hunt without the nifty gadgets. The film is less about jack Reacher the Master Detective and more about the Jack Reacher the strikingly Handsome Hardass who can slip in and out of society unnoticed....Riiiight. Because really good looking people go unnoticed all the time and seldomly grab the attention or gaze of others. The supporting cast includes Rosalind Pike as the love interest sort of who finds herself almost immediately attracted to Reacher. (See above about reacher being off the Grid). The Rest of the cast include veterans Richard Jenkins, Werner Herzog in all his disturbing glory as the protagonist, David Oyelowo who is turning in a nice career of late and Robert Duval who we haven't seen in a while. Overall the film is well acted but for me it became less a detective story and more a Tom Cruise fighting the bad guys movie . However the action scenes are terrific as always for Tom Cruise. This film almost gets there but never quite makes it however it was enjoyable. I give it 3 stars for it was entertaining and Robert Duval is awesome in it ;)"

Who wanted the building company, was it the German (prisoner) and for what reason? <br/><br/>The story is never concluded.<br/><br/>I would assume that this means there are going to be sequels to this film to answers questions that have arisen, I for one though am not hooked and will be saving my money."

I tell you this,i rated this movie by 4 and i was very lenient giving this rate,the film it's probably a 3.Poor acting(even Tom Cruise looks hypnotized),poor script and plot(some lines r really ridiculous and all the time you see things that u already know that will happen and you just wait...and wait..and wait...surprise me man,it's an action movie).I could sit down and write a bunch of reasons why this film is awful(and i mean it,literally,a bunch) but i already lost 2 hours watching it and that's enough!

","This was actually a pretty fair performance by Tom Cruise, however the plot and screenplay played to Tom's strengths. Newcomer Jai Courtney is an excellent adversary for Tom's character, equally smart and creepy, his performance is excellent. The writing was fairly enjoyable, enough twists and turns to keep one interested, and the dialogue was well written (with a few ill-fitting remarks). The story-line progresses at a nice pace, with enough action and suspense to keep the average male on the edge of his seat. There were some nice comedic moments, especially with the addition of Robert Duvall. Overall it was an enjoyable film, although I don't think I would have spent $40-50 to go see it in the theater. This is one that I would recommend waiting for it to come out on DVD. Unless you are a huge Tom Cruise fan, then you will probably enjoy it more than most."

","Jack Reacher (2012) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>A former Army sniper enters a parking garage and picks off five innocent people in Pittsburgh. Before he's beaten in a coma he asks that Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) be called in. Soon the drifter Reacher comes to the scene to help the man's attorney (Rosamund Pike) figure out why he did it but soon he realizes that there's much more going on. I've never read any of the novels that this character is based on so I can't comment on anything in regards to that but overall I found this to be a pretty strong film with a great story, great performances and some of the best dry humor you're going to see. I thought the story itself is one that was so good that you can't help get caught up in every twist and turn that happens. I found the first few minutes with the sniper to be very effective and everything that follows is just as compelling. I also thought the performances were terrific with Cruise leading the way with another excellent character. I really loved the dry humor that Cruise brings to the role and especially during a hilarious sequence at a bar. There's no question that the actor can handle the action scenes but he also excels at being believable as the character. I thought Pike was great as his co-host to the events going on as was Richard Jenkins, David Oyelowo and Robert Duvall. Legendary director Werner Herzog was the perfect choice to play his character as you believe everything he's saying he went through. The film also features one of the best car chases in recent memory and it might be the best since the golden age of the 70s chase picture. The only thing I'd say was lacking was the direction in spots because one wishes more drama was brought out of the material. It's such a great story that I think it could have been brought to even more life. With that said, JACK REACHER is certainly entertainment at its finest."

"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","1","14 August 2019"," Jack Reacher smoothly reaches for thrilling heights but is weighed down by a heavily condensed plot.
","As always, I have yet to read (and probably will never, let's be honest) Lee Child's series of crime novels featuring the titular drifter. However, I'm aware of the criticisms regarding Cruise's physical appearance and how he is nothing like the source material's description (which will be taken into consideration). But alas, I'm reviewing McQuarrie's adaptation, and it's enjoyably solid. It's what one would typically expect from a Tom Cruise crime thriller. Nothing more, nothing less. Based on Child's novel 'One Shot', a former military officer is lured into proving the innocence of a trained sniper who was framed for murdering five innocent civilians.<br/><br/>As standard and overwrought as the story is, approximately stretched out over two hours, McQuarrie's eye for stylish flair is what truly elevated the investigative thrills. From the midnight car chase featuring drifts aplenty to the bar brawl with bone crunching leg snaps. McQuarrie swoops in with the camera and envelops you in the gritty underbelly of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania through Reacher's perspective. Commencing with a breathtakingly harrowing sequence involving the scope of a sniper rifle, McQuarrie sets the brutal tone from the get-go, accompanied by Kraemer's intense score.<br/><br/>Then the plot begins to unravel with several meandering sub-plots and unfortunately McQuarrie is unable to bring the whole story together. The first two acts, mostly revolving around Reacher himself being framed for murder, was well constructed and exhumed Cruise's natural charisma, despite being alongside Pike's stiff performance. Then the conclusive third act in the quarry kicks into literal action and the investigative intensity dissipated instantly, essentially being substituted for an elongated shootout sequence with no real depth. Then you've got the Zec which under-utilised Werzog, the Lebendauer Enterprise conspiracy which was underdeveloped and the often heavy-handed storytelling, just in case audience members couldn't work it out for themselves.<br/><br/>So really, I yearn to disregard the third act. As the preceding two were exceptionally executed with a variety of light humorous moments (the bathroom brawl in particular) amidst an intriguing initial premise. Even when Reacher is mind-flipping everyone by asking intuitive questions that grant him the answers he desires (""Does Sandy work here?""), it's engaging enough to hurdle over the bumps in the road.<br/><br/>Just a shame that the longer the story stretched, the more convoluted and underdeveloped it became. Atleast this paved the way for McQuarrie to work on the 'Mission Impossible' series, that's the best outcome by far!"

As he and the attorney investigates, he finds that the truth is nothing like it seems.<br/><br/>Having watched the sequel first then ""Jack Reacher"", I can say that I like the sequel more. That is not to say I don't enjoy this first instalment though. The story of this film is intriguing and mysterious, with a lot of mysteries that requires a lot of detective skills to uncover the truth. I like Rosamund Pike's character as the lawyer, her strong presence is augmented by the memorable aftertaste of her superb performance in ""Gone Girl"".<br/><br/>I like this detective crime thriller.

","The thing is, I can't find anything wrong with this film. I thought, I can't give it a 10, but then, what's there to complain about? Nothing. I haven't read the books, so I can't say it missed the mark there. I was legitimately saddened and angry by one event in the film, but not to mean the movie had no reason to do it, I had just begun to care about the character, that's all, and angry enough to be entirely pleased with a decision Jack Reacher makes later on in the film. The thing is, again, that the sad event in the movie is in no way a ""just terribly off"" collision movie-wise with the marvellously funny moment my girlfriend liked so much. It all works very well, it has a great ebb and flow to it. Honestly, all these reviews in which they say Jack Reacher has to be like in the book 6'4"", 250 lbs. Don't they get it? It's a book, what do you have to do when there's no pictures? Make the guy 6'4"", 250 lbs, that's what. If the guy in Jack Reacher the movie was 6'4, 250 lbs., the character on screen would have been completely unbelievable, he would probably never have evolved as a person into the way he is in the movie. Cruise nailed the character perfectly. Everything action-wise is constructed and executed realistically and imaginatively for someone of his physique. And when it's funny, it is really funny."
"Reznik_T","8","0","1","14 October 2016"," Don't believe the haters, this is a lot of fun
","I went in to this movie not expecting much. People didn't talk a lot about Jack Reacher, and the reviews were mostly mixed or negative. Boy, was I surprised!<br/><br/>Jack Reacher is the best action movie I've seen in a long time, but not only that - it's also super funny. I think many of the reviewers/critics didn't get what this movie was going for with its cheesy dialogue, larger than life characters and over the top action. They probably didn't get the joke, and what bothers me, is that two years after this, John Wick was using the same premise (former soldier/special agent with unique skills singlehandedly putting down a dangerous group of criminals), and was a much less entertaining film (at least in my opinion), still that became an instant cult classic, while Jack Reacher has been dismissed and forgotten - undeservedly so. I'm afraid it mostly has to do with Tom Cruise's private life and scientology background, which would be a shame. <br/><br/>Jack Reacher is entertaining, smart, suspenseful, the action is fantastic, the performances (all of them!) are excellent, especially Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike, but the supporting cast as well. I haven't enjoyed watching Robert Duvall on screen so much for a long time, but Richard Jenkins, Jai Courtney and David Oyelowo also deserve to be mentioned.<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect. There was a 10 minute segment around halfway through the film when I felt like it was dragging a little bit, and there is a reveal that I thought was not handled very well. There's also some excessive violence and brutality in a couple of scenes, that rubbed me the wrong way, and didn't even fit the tone of the movie. Finally, towards the end there's a scene when Reacher kills a bad guy, but the scene is pretty badly edited, so it's hard to understand how Reacher could get to the guy the way he did (those who saw the movie probably know what I'm talking about). <br/><br/>Anyway, it's a severely underrated movie. Definitely check it out if you haven't so far!<br/><br/>8/10"
"Tweekums","9","0","1","27 July 2016"," A gripping thriller
","When a sniper kills five apparently random people the police quickly arrest ex-army sniper James Barr; the evidence against him seems conclusive however we know he did not do it! During his interview he says nothing but eventually writes ""Get Jack Reacher"". The authorities have no idea how to find the former army investigator but he soon finds them and initially he is convinced of Barr's guilt he has done it before in Iraq but got away with it. Reacher isn't keen to get involved but is eventually agrees help Barr's attorney, Helen Rodin, examine the evidence. Things soon convince him that Barr didn't do it; the evidence is just too good, Barr was never that good a shot and most importantly somebody is trying to block his investigation. The more he investigates the more convinced he becomes that somebody in authority is involved possibly the District Attorney who just happens to be Helen's father.<br/><br/>Having not read any of the 'Jack Reacher' books I can't say how close the film character is to the book character but judging solely by the film I found him to be a good protagonist; Tom Cruise did a fine job in the role. He is ably supported by Rosamund Pike as Helen; it was refreshing that their characters' relationship was purely professional and never looked like it might become a cliché romance. There is a good amount of action and a few twists along the way. Surprisingly, given that we see the killer in the opening scene, there is also a sense of mystery why did he do it? Why was Barr so perfectly framed? Who in authority is helping them? The action is nicely varied; we get fights, shootouts and a car chase and the story is interesting. The bad guys are suitably menacing; especially Werner Herzog's 'The Zec' in one scene he tells a failed underling that he will spare his life if he bites off the fingers of his left hand! There are some lighter moments; most notably a laugh out loud moment where too incompetent assailants attack Reacher in a bathroom. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody after a solid thriller with a good plot and obviously to fans of Tom Cruise."
"rmax304823","6","0","1","12 March 2016"," Mystery Cum Action.
","A man is laid up in a hospital bed, barely conscious, all signs pointing to his having been a sniper who killed four people at random on a Pittsburgh street. He's really stepped into it, though he can't remember any of it. All he can say is, ""Get Jack Reacher."" Jack Reacher is the drifter Tom Cruise, a combination of Sherlock Holmes and Superman.<br/><br/>The defense attorney, Rosamund Pike, locates him and hires him as an investigator, her intent being to prove that the accused shooter, Barr, is insane and so spare him the death penalty. Cruise does better than that. He proves that Barr is innocent and uncovers a corporative conspiracy run by the estimable Werner Herzog. Of course there are dozens of tense moments along the way, plenty of action, and numerous deaths.<br/><br/>As mysteries go, this one is kind of interesting, although Cruise's intuition sometimes resembles Lieutenant Columbo's in that it leads mistakenly to the correct conclusion. Example: Cruise considers the four victims of the mass murder and discovers that two of them had planned to meet at the spot because they were having an affair. ""So two of the victims weren't there at random."" Well, actually they were. They weren't TOGETHER by accident, but they were at the location by chance. In any case they have nothing to do with the incident.<br/><br/>Cruise's character is one of those unconquerable martial arts expert. His opponent barely lay a glove on him while he disables them at light speed or, when he's serious about it, breaks their necks. It was all nicely done by Matt Damon in ""The Bourne Identity."" A car chase at high speed is a requirement for any exciting movie these days. They all represent variations on a theme established in ""Bullit"" in 1968. Even the sounds of the full race cams are the same.<br/><br/>Cruise is taciturn, impenetrable, without a back story. As the author of the novel on which this story is based, Lee Child, has admitted, the character is an archetype long established in fiction as the mysterious stranger who rides into town and untangles the mess, and then leaves. It was presented superbly in ""Shane"" in 1952. I think F. C. S. Northrop calls this the high mimetic mode of narrative. The hero is better than the rest of us but still subject to the laws of nature. Hitchcock preferred to deal in the low mimetic with heros no better than the rest of us, who found themselves swept up in events beyond their control.<br/><br/>Bonus points for a director, Christopher McQuarrie, who refuses to surrender to the modern but unstylish tendency to wobble the camera during action scenes. Not a bit of it. The editing is fast but you can tell who's doing what to whom. Which, for some reason, reminds me that there are no sex scenes. Even THAT is a refreshing novelty these days.<br/><br/>The director does have a bent though, and it's conspicuous on those few occasions when he uses it. The scene opens with a person speak to someone behind the camera. We don't know who it is. The camera slowly moves around behind the speaker until the other person is revealed. Sometimes it works. ""Hey, that's ROBERT DUVAL behind the counter!"" Other times there seems to be no reason for it because the listener isn't a big surprise. The tactic doesn't make the viewer tense, just impatient.<br/><br/>As action movies go, this one stands up to the rest of the genre. I was sorry to see Herzog play a heartless heavy because he's such an innovative director himself, and a terribly nice guy in person."

I actually found it kind of dull and long winded, which is a weird thing to say about an action movie, but something was just off and it seemed to drag.<br/><br/>I've only read one of the Jack Reacher books and initially didn't care about the casting but what I found happened here was that this just became another Tom Cruise vehicle with him redoing his generic action hero performance and adding some bad one liners. What was up with those cheesy one liners anyway, very dumb.<br/><br/>What I do remember from the books was that Reacher read a bit like Sherlock Holmes, very smart, analytical and one step ahead of what's taking place. He was cool not a bully as Cruise came across here. The story/mystery also felt very 80's and wasn't even all that interesting, just your standard old school action crime thriller.<br/><br/>Back up cast included David Oyelowo, Richard Jenkins, Robert Duvall and Rosamund Pike as a sort of Bond Girl.10/27/15"

Or not. <br/><br/>The books are formulaic but interesting in a long airplane flight kind of way. Buy them at the newsstand before the flight and you'll finish before you land, leaving it in the seat back for the next passenger. <br/><br/>Jack Reacher in the books is basically a big, strong guy with a brain. He uses his imposing physical self to get his way and if that doesn't do it he beats people up. If that doesn't do it he uses his formidable brain. These qualities are the absolute core of the character and the story revolves around them. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise has neither of these things going for him. He's short, skinny and probably has somebody carry his scripts around for him. He also doesn't come across as a particularly brainy kind of actor or character. Missing these qualities but trying to put ol' Tom into the character of Jack Reacher is going to sabotage the entire storyline. And it did. <br/><br/>At no point did I see Tom Cruise as anything but a Southern California rich boy dressed up in a leather coat (to add a little bulk to his skinny frame). The story became increasingly unbelievable and ol' Tom got deeper and deeper into the 'are you kidding me' place where serious movies never want to go. <br/><br/>Take a plane flight and grab one of Lee Childs books, you might enjoy it.

Now Tom cruise is Jack reacher in this film and even though there was controversy over it I thought Tom cruise was great in this role. He was completely different to what he usually is, he plays a tough cop who doesn't care about anybody and is just around to do his job and nothing more. His character was clearly damaged and was really cool which definitely helped this film. Rosamund pike plays the lawyer that cruise works with and she is good in this film as well, her chemistry with cruise was fantastic and she was a good part of the film. David Oyelowo is in this film and I have been a big fan of this guy for this film and even though his character is pretty underdeveloped he did a decent job. I wasn't a huge fan of Richard Jenkins as the district attorney and don't really think he added anything to the film. Also the villains didn't come across as menacing as they should and it takes away from the film. People thought that the story wasn't going to be too detailed but it really was. It is actually a pretty clever film with allot of good detective and detailed scenes that make this film actually pretty interesting. I just felt that the villains schemes were not fleshed out well enough and the characters in general didn't really get fleshed out as much as I would have wanted. There was some good dialogue between cruise and pike which was really interesting and detailed but there was also some really bad comedic dialogue that took away from the film. The action scenes were great and heavy hitting but there wasn't too many of them. Also there are some really big tone shifts in the film that just confuse you.

But then the plot unfolds into an anticlimactic resolution. The story line is weak, sloppy, and unsatisfying. It felt like they focused so much on building the suspense, they gave little to no thought on how to drive it to resolution. The bad guy needs better motives. He didn't have much to gain for all the trouble that he went to. The action is at least better than the plot. It has its moments - car chases, gun fights, fist fights. <br/><br/>The movie is more like 5.5. It definitely doesn't deserve a 7.

The film is above-averagely (no, excellently) shot and edited in this regard (thanks Caleb Deschanel!), Christopher McQuarrie keeps things at a brisk pace, and of course for the precious minutes Werner Herzog is on screen it's electrified with his presence as a true horrific being - almost to the point, perhaps, where I was laughing to myself at just HOW EVIL this man is, The Zec = The Prisoner, as in Syberian prison.<br/><br/>But there's so much more time I wish he had had when it's mostly the Tom Cruise, who is fine, neither great nor bad, serviceable more than his usual charming self (it's like, we get it, you're a super-hero bad-ass, what else is there to you), and Rosamund Pike show. The latter has proved herself elsewhere to be a fabulous actress, full of vitality and old-school Hollywood power as a star and even with comic timing (Gone Girl and World's End specifically). Here, I blame the writing for just a very, um, 'okay' actress, more fit for a CBS primetime show than a big blockbuster.<br/><br/>If it's on TV it's not a bad watch, but I was glad to get Herzog with his glass-eye on a huge screen.

Yes, Reacher is analytical, but he is not monotonous, not without character, not wooden and dispassionate, not humorless. There is nothing likable about this characterisation of Reacher, where is the live free/carefree aspect of his character? Disappointing. And the ""he doesn't care about the law..."" monologue at the end, was that lifted straight from the Waterworld script? Was the entire film so poor in establishing the character that this was required, or did the director think the viewers so stupid that reinforcement was required by way of direct exposition. Sigh. I was really looking forward to this with fingers crossed. It is not terrible, but it should have been better given the wealth of material at their disposal. I hope it did well enough for them to have a second effort, to see if they can make it work. Cruise was OK, but I would rather have a Reacher film than an adaptation-to-make-it- work-for-Tom Cruise film. An opportunity missed. To my mind, Reacher was already such a strong character with a large and well established following that a ""star"" was not required to carry the film franchise.

He can take a book by Lee Child and make the action film he wants out of it. He can take the role a 6 feet 5 inches hero and tailor himself in it. He can afford beautiful and talented Rosamund Pike as a partner, and Robert Duvall and director Werner Herzog in the the veteran good guy and villain roles. And the result is pretty acceptable.<br/><br/>So, who is Jack Reacher? Ex-army investigator, a man hard to discover and trace to the point that some doubt he exists.

A man capable at any moment to fist-fight five tough guys, to put three bullets in the center of the target from any distance, to destroy the heavily arm need of armed bad guys. In other words - a super-hero.<br/><br/>No need to tell too much about the story. It's about an apparent clear cut case of mass killing in an American city that proves to be something very different that what you and everybody else in or out the film think excepting Jack Reacher, of course. Viewers get another well done action film, Tom Cruise does his job as an actor as we expect, Duvall and Herzog have fun and so do we as viewers. Christopher McQuarrie is a rather inexperienced director, this was only his second film, but producer and actor and superhero Tom Cruise trusted him with the new film in the 'Mission Impossible' series, so he must have been satisfied. So are we, if we look for good quality action entertainment from Hollywood."

","This was disappointing. Tom Cruise plays an ex-army investigator who gets embroiled in a conspiracy surrounding the apparently random shooting of five people.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays his part just fine. But the other characters are below par. Rosamund Pike is dull as the attorney that Cruise ends up working with. The man under suspicion of murder spends 90% of the film in a coma. And the most promising character, The Zec, the leader of the conspirators, barely gets a chance to make a mark, barring a gruesome scene dispatching of an errant foot soldier under a bridge.<br/><br/>The plot twist becomes obvious early so it's not really a detective movie. Instead it steadily turns into a straightforward action hero flick, culminating in a gun/hand to hand combat climax.<br/><br/>It was just about watchable but it wasn't great."

","Not sure if this review could be considered a 'spoiler' or not, I liked the movie but I also have a few problems with it as well. The movie was okay. Really didn't like the way they destroyed a Classic, Antique 1970 Chevelle SS. The other problem I have with the movie, in the books, Jack Reacher is described as being 6'5"" and 250 pounds with hands the size of dinner plates (so, roughly, my size; I'm a mesomorph and a 6'3"" 265 pound thespian). Thomas Cruise Mapother (his given name) is maybe 5'9"" and 180 pounds, the only reason he got the role was because he's one of the producers. I'd like to see the movie re-made with a larger actor playing Reacher (someone who's at least six foot), maybe me? If Jack Reacher was remade using the book title ""One Shot"" with me in the lead role, I'd do it for a HELL of a lot less than Tom did!!! Okay, that's it, now just waiting for the next Reacher flick. I'd also like to see movies made of the Mitch Rapp book series."

","Thought I'd try a blockbuster with good old Tom Cruise. Directed (and written for the screen) by Christopher McQuarrie, yes, the man behind the ingenious script of the classic 'The usual suspects' (1995). Only one time before did he direct a movie, a good twelve years ago, the rather enjoyable 'The way of the gun' (2000). In 'Jack Reacher' the 'gun' is an important player as well, by the way.<br/><br/>I have hardly kept an eye on Tom Cruise after his earlier work, in which I could at least admire his ample enthusiasm. I did see something here and there, but his enthusiasm has turned into something of a one-trick-pony thing with a high amount of testosterone. In 'Magnolia' that is exactly why it works, but just the other day I saw him once again in 'Collateral', and it was rather annoying.<br/><br/>'A Tom Cruise production' appears on the screen when 'Jack Reacher' begins, and that is pretty much the gist of it. The leading ladies (one upscale blonde and somewhat naive, the other a bit more seedy, dark-haired and even more naive) do not lead, but follow Tom, on their knees preferably. These respective quotes from the ladies are telling: ""Can you please put a shirt on?"" and ""Will you be gentle with me?"". Eventually things don't work out with either one; Tom, in the end, rather tussles with an able male opponent in a bare knuckle fight, reminding me of a certain South Park episode. But back to what's important.<br/><br/>What's important is that a(n action) film like this should be enjoyable, and that is barely the case. Just like 'The way of the gun' this one runs over two hours, and that can be a plus. Something of that old atmosphere from '70s thrillers comes to mind (McQuarrie is not afraid to introduce a new character after more than sixty minutes), much helped by the casting of Richard Jenkins, Werner Herzog (quite a revelation to me, he's a terrific baddie), Robert Duvall and David Oyelowo. Still I wonder why it is straight away revealed that the arrested man is really innocent (even if it is no surprise at all). And all in all, 'Jack Reacher' is very much 'The Tom Cruise show', that streetfight with multiple opponents being an obvious low. The fight in the bathroom on the other hand, was rather funny. The car chase felt like it could have been better, but it wasn't bad. The complex shootout in the end was quite good, too bad it had to be followed by that stale fight, pretty much in the dark as well.<br/><br/>Pluses and minuses, lots of them, so my rating ends up right in the middle; 5 out of 10. Could have been a lot better, though."

","There are some films out there that when they are playing you get so hooked into what is happening on the screen you don't move even though you agonise in absolute pain as your bladder threatens to flood the cinema you sit within and wait through gritted teeth as the credits begin to roll, then sometimes there are movies where no matter how many times you get up to urinate, buy a coffee, order some hot chips you can come back and know exactly what has happened without missing a beat. Jack Reacher is the later in the urinary events for my liking. I was so bored with the same formula being used once again, I was told it was an action packed who dun it! What I got instead was a pretty mediocre who gives a crap! I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, never have been, something about the guy just irks me to no end. Jack Reacher just enforced that even more for me, Mr Cruise was totally wrong for the role, using his batman voice did nothing to save the character at all. Now whether that's bad direction or bad acting I can't be sure, one thing I am sure of though, they wanted him to be a cross over character between the thinking detective and the ass kicking assassin Jason Bourne, neither have been pulled off very well, I'm sure Tom would leave this one off his CV anyway. The film started off quite well, one day a lone gunman stands in a parking garage and fires 6 shots over 800meters away. 5 people are dead but why? This is what the plot of the story is. The case is pretty much solved the police have footage, evidence and even a time stamped parking permit to charge the accused and best of all the accused an ex-military sniper shooter has done it in the past. When given an ultimatum about signing a guilty plea the accused writes one thing. Find Jack Reacher. Lickity split the next thing you know Jack Reacher played by Tom Cruise is on the scene and following the case himself, Jack of course is an old time war veteran superman star who saved one of the wars on his own and now has ensured he no longer exists to the rest of the world so he can live his life in peace. (Sound familiar?) So Jack teams up with Helen played by Rosamund Pike a solicitor who is trying to save the accused from a death sentence even though the case is pretty solid against him. What they find out turns everything they know of the case completely on its head, and so the real bad guys are hunted down with a few wrecked knees and car chases to keep the masses amused. You know the worst thing about this film, there was no motive, and nothing that was ever clearly defined anyway, no real reason as to why five innocent people were killed. Not sure what the director wanted for this movie but he really hasn't delivered anything other than a piece of dribble to satisfy the brainless of us out there who don't care for anything other than a bit of bang bang dead bad guys. Christopher McQuarrie both wrote and directed this film, so I'm guessing Tom didn't get much of a say in the going ons in this one like he has in other roles."

He's not over the hill just yet.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is that there seems to be too many dumb moments to overlook. I'm not sure if that's the books fault or the directors.

","Having read all of the Jack Reacher books, I really thought they would make a franchise movie series. The casting of Hobbit-sized Tom Cruise as the 6-5, 250lb Jack Reacher was the 1st indication that the ""franchise"" might be lucky if the 1st film makes any money at all. For that very reason, I waited until it made Netflix online before watching it. I'm glad that I didn't pay to go to the movies to see it, or buy the DVD. What a mess! The plot follows the book, which remains the best part of the movie. The mis-casting hurt the movie, as it's hard for the 5'7"" actor to be imposing and intimidating without the odd high and low camera angles, to hide the height issue. Add to that the stilted, choppy dialog and wooden delivery, and the early parts of this movie are downright hard to watch. Much of Reacher in the Child books is relayed by either what Reacher's thinking, or creative dialog. The movie had a hard time providing either.<br/><br/>I'm convinced that, should they make another Reacher movie with Cruise and the same screenplay-writer, I won't waste my time watching it, even on Netflix."

","Tom Cruise continues to play parts where all the attention is on him above and beyond everyone, exactly as he does away from the screen...remember him on Oprah's show? I found Cruise to be excellent in the movie Oblivion. That's because he mostly played as the only man and so could not show off his bravado and worship-me attitude. But in most of his movies, I find him offensive except in Magnolia, a 10 plus movie, where he shows hubris to the extreme but something happens later on...I don't want to give it away...that makes him likable. Back to Jack Reacher, Tom Cruise certainly Reaches into the viewers face and Jack's one's soul, proclaiming that he is the physical Transformer, impenetrable. I don't buy it, or the DVD."

","Well, of course any A list movie with such a cast and director will have all the basics down pat, except it's a soul-less, unoriginal product that doesn't elevate the audience, at least the thinking ones who appreciate something more than a macho violence fest. It is designed to appeal to the action movie crowd, you know the skinhead tattooed types at the gym or on loud motorcycles who haven't read a book since school stamped their parchment.<br/><br/>We have Cruise being Mr. Badass Bullet Chewing Ex Army West Point MP lifer Jack Reacher, who resigned from the Army and lives off the grid with just the clothes on his back. You'd think a lifer like him would at least have a duffel bag with a change of clothes and a toilet kit, but he shows up in Pittsburgh empty handed on a bus. At first he's there to help convict some Army killer he pursued in the past for some mass shooting that happened in Iraq. His character is such macho bs, and so worn out, but that doesn't matter to the audience who apparently need a really smart guy, who can figure all the angles everyone else missed and who can also kill 10 armed men barehanded. It is like Cruise got into character in some BS pseudo-artsy Jap gore fest like ""The Last Samurai"" and never got back to reality. Since Mr Perfect is also the producer of this as well as the man who turned Mission Impossible into another generic ultra violent chase scene thriller, I think Cruise really imagines himself as a Reacher clone<br/><br/>So of course, we know the shooter, or the guy we thought was the shooter, wasn't the bad guy. And we knew that one of the stuffed shirts we met in the beginning was prolly in the pay of the bad guys. And we knew that there was going to be tons of sophisticated weapons and fancy shooting, along with a chase scene involving every bad ass guy's wet dream, a 1968 Chevy Malibu SS 396 4 speed, driven by the master at everything who is, I guess, a good driver in reality. The common iconic 60s muscle car is a stand in for the lameness and unoriginality of the character and the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>There is a really bad guy, a Russian, natch, called the Zek, played by a German, Werner Herzog. He is really bad, like he chewed his fingers off to save himself in a Soviet gulag. Then I find out that the real target of this mass shooting, and the subsequent mayhem and expense to cover it up. was someone these ultra evil, ultra well financed guys could have dealt with in their sleep. It reminds me of using a shotgun to kill a fly.<br/><br/>I mean these evil guys are so bad, that when they paid some local not-so-evil hood to drive Reacher off by stomping him, which failed of course, the really evil people not only killed their local contact guy, but the five hapless petty criminals their local guy hired for a $100/piece. Heck, once they killed their local contact, there would have been no way for Terminator Reacher to trace it back. But the plots of movies like this are there mainly to provide the set up for the next set of homicides.<br/><br/>Then the movie had this old Marine - ""young"" Army guy bonding scene at a shooting range. The old guy was Duvall, wdf. Natch, once we got over his crustiness, you knew they would bond so well that after one meeting the old man would drive 200 miles to help the Terminator shoot all the bad guys dead in some night quarry construction site shoot out scene.<br/><br/>I hate using the term fascist, because it is so overworked and misused, as well as the two big heroes in the end were operating alone, not part of some storm battalion. But it was fascist, in that it espoused these ultra conservative, ultra macho military trained militaristic guys are the key to help us clean up society. For sure, we do need these types sometime, but in movies & TV today it seems the message we get is that this is the way to deal with all the bad parts of life. IT is all some Manichean struggle where soul-less, rootless good guys can waste all sorts of ultra heinous, well equipped and almost as competent bad guys then walk away for a good breakfast as Dennys. I know, this is just supposed to be escapist fare, but maybe we should ask ourselves if trash like this from A listers is causing so many people to be alienated and go over the edge. Yeah, yeah, 99.99% of the people who watched this won't do anything sadistic or insane, but what about that .01%?<br/><br/>PS: I just made the connection between this movie and some similar stinker set in Pittsburgh, ""Striking Distance"". That cheesy Bruce Willis, over the top macho action flick got more than its share of razzies from the fans & critics. If you take that movie as parody of its genre which it is, it is more palatable than this macho militaristic cowboy sadistic nonsense."

","I'm a casual fan of Tom Cruise, so I just watched this regardless. I didn't know much about the book, so I can't comment on how accurate it is to its source material. I thought it would be more action-packed - like a kind of vigilante going round seeking revenge on your general baddies. As it turned out, it's more like a cop movie (but without a cop as the lead character). What action there is is all right, plus the acting is fair and it is not hard to see that money has been put into this movie.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is an ex military policeman who's investigating a seemingly motiveless sniper who killed five apparently innocent civilians. No sooner is he on the case does he meet the unfeasible attractive attorney, played by Rosamund Pike. I found this aspect of the film the most far-fetched - you know instantly that she's going to be the 'will-they/won't they' love interest of the film.<br/><br/>From then on, the film follows a typical template for this kind of movie. It's played absolutely straight (a bit like the 'Bourne' films, but without the near-constant chase scenes all the way through) and it doesn't really add anything original to the genre of action/thriller movies.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a bit of a conspiracy thriller with a plot that slowly unravels, this isn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours (plus it's nice to see Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall sharing the screen again since Days of Thunder). If you can believe that every single female in American that meets Tom Cruise wants to bed him, whether she's twice his age of half his age, then you should find this enjoyable.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

(Rosamund Pike) Reacher is an ex-military police officer, who knows all about Barr. Barr was a sniper in Iraq, who shot three contractors, and got off on a technicality. Reacher thinks Barr is a nut, and wants to make sure that there's enough evidence to put Barr away for life this time, but when he's done investigating, does the evidence still point to Barr? <br/><br/>This movie has a good premise, but it's executed badly. Five minutes into the movie, the viewer knows exactly who the murderer is, and then there are a lot of unnecessary scenes, Tom Cruise acting cool with a girl much too young to be flirting with him, a fight scene where Cruise demolishes five people by himself in no time. Tom Cruise shirtless, showing his overly sculpted six-pack, Tom Cruise driving a souped-up car a la Steve McQueen in Bulitt complete with roaring engines, Tom Cruise putting three bullets in the innermost circle while target shooting, and finally Cruise's weird soliloquy about freedom, all designed to illustrate that Tom Cruise is the perfect action hero in a movie produced by Tom Cruise. At least he doesn't run in this movie, like he does in most of his action movies, Cruise is trying to reproduce A Few Good Men, but A Few Good Men is much more cerebral than this testosterone filled fare. There is a twist and a conspiracy in this movie, but that makes the movie worse,not better.<br/><br/>The acting is disappointing. Cruise starts the movie mildly interesting as the anti-hero Jack Reacher, but gets more wooden as the movie gets more predictable. Rosamund Pike looks like she's had multiple Botox injection. She has a surprised look frozen on her face, maybe she's shocked to be in an increasingly poorly made film, with a fading box office star. Robert Duvall is completely wasted as a gun-toting NRA poster of a character.

","Don't kid yourself. This movie has no surprises and is littered with moments of predictability and typical typecasting of characters. Half way through the movie one of our main protagonists backs off a bit and after being so fervent in her quest in the beginning of our story manages to undermine the credibility of her character. But with predictable fortitude she rallies. There is nothing new here and nothing really presented in a fresh way that would re-energize tired and worn out themes which could use with a bit of refreshing. We view the ever churning questions of fairness, individual rights, right to a fair trial, loss of civil liberties and lack of fair judicial proceeding in a way that isn't particularly fresh or interesting presenting itself in a rather mundane vigilantism with completely predictable bad guys and a very over worked story line. Nevertheless, this movie is rather entertaining. The acting solid if perhaps the dialog a bit assuming. And despite the stereotyping of our characters and the plot I still enjoyed this film. Rosamund Pike isn't given much acting room and Tom Cruise sticks to his formulaic mannerisms. Robert Duvall's character is not surprising either but his presence in the movie is still fun if not believable he still manages to make us want to set aside our disbelief considering the material he is given. Despite all these faux pas, this movie works. The actors/characters have chemistry and they bounce well off of their fellow actors. What a delight to have Werner Herzog play Zek (what an interesting play on the concept of freedom in a name, eh?)whose character I would have loved to seen fleshed out along with Cruise's and Pike's characters. In the end it does what a good, if not great movie should do...it entertains. Nothing too heavy here and nothing to fluffy either. A nice meat and potatoes kind of flick. A perfect after work movie on hump day. Not bad movie by any means and not great movie but it is good enough. Did I mention the '68 Camaro and Chevelle growl! What fabulous cars! And to those preoccupied with Cruise's stature get over it. The implication large and tall men are the only men who can play alpha male leading roles is ridiculous. Tom Cruise (though I'm not a fan) does more than hold his own as the lead character. I'll say it again enjoyed it. A bit of fun for a Wednesday!"

","Making a Jack Reacher film was well overdue but I was hoping for some of the essence of Reacher in the film.<br/><br/>The first problem was the casting. If you're going to cast someone for the role of a 210-250 lb, 6' 5"" killing machine, then Tom Cruise would be at the bottom of the list (just below Peter Dinklage).<br/><br/>The second problem was the script. They cut out 3 of the 5 main female roles in the film. One of the big things about Reacher novels is that the female roles have depth of character and are often given quite some heft. The 2 female roles in the final script were just the run of the mill dependent bimbos.<br/><br/>What on earth is a car chase doing in a Reacher story? He's a lousy driver.<br/><br/>They turned Barr's involvement on its head. This meant that Reacher's abilities as an investigator weren't explored. Neither did they show his one step ahead of the bad guy intelligence.<br/><br/>If I had been directing this thing I would have had a background narrator in the role of Reacher. This would have made the fight scene at the bar at least believable. An internal monologue would have made sense of that rather than Tom Cruise explaining exactly what was going on out loud. (Hardly the element of surprise) <br/><br/>The biggest problem with the script, though, was the ending. It had none of Reacher in it. Okay they might have had a problem with Tom Cruise killing a 6' 4"" Russian by crushing him to death and then cutting his throat ""just to make sure"" but the shear mean bad-ass nature of his methods weren't displayed in any way shape or form.<br/><br/>Other than that it was actually a decent action film, but nothing to do with Jack Reacher."

Beside the obvious problem of 5'8"" pretty-boy 50year-old Tom Cruise playing 6'5"" 250lb rough-and-tough mid-30's Jack Reacher, the fight scenes were more ridiculous and awful than usual.

The one annoying thing to me was too many camera shots of Rosamund Pike's surgically enhanced chest.

","I also thought Rosamund Pike had large breasts: most actresses are either without or under-endowed. Turns out she was five months pregnant by lurking City weirdo Robie Uniacke: he of the four previous wives, several of them much younger than him, including Ros. Tom Cruise produced this movie, which made at least $20 million profit, so hack writer Lee Child drew the crowds in for this ageing Hollywood hero, who doesn't seem able to lose money on pictures, an unusual quality. How he produces, reads and learns scripts while being dyslexic is something no one understands except him, and he attributes it to his Scientology. Go figure! Jack Reacher might be another multi-picture venture for Cruise, because age doesn't matter when you are an avenging angel. Of course, the end is the big disappointment in this kind of beyond-the-law fantasy, because all the bad guys are lying dead in the street. But this story has a good twist in it, and the villain has only one finger!"

","Not really very good for a number of reasons. Firstly, the casting of Cruise as Reacher is immediately flawed. Not only in height, but hair colour, build and charisma. Cruise is just playing Cruisethere's not differentiation between this character and Ethan Hunt, for example. Just think of Hunt as a drifter. Secondly, the chemistry between Cruise and Rosamund Pike is laughable. She's pretty hammy, too. She just seems to open her eyes wider if she's trying to look concerned. The villains are pretty lame, and Werner Herzog sounds like he's doing an Arnie impressionironic given that's how he really speaks! The action scenes were OK, if a bit vacant, the plot twists were predictable and the typically brilliant Robert Duvall – who is always watchable – is simply playing for laughs in a role you feel is far more fleshed out in the novel. I'm confused as to why they chose the 9th Reacher book to film as well. In my view, the Reacher novels would by far suit an HBO series. Still, far better than the other recent Cruise disaster that was 'Oblivion'. That was atrocious."

","Chicago. A sniper (Jai Courtney) enters a downtown high-rise and randomly kills of five people walking in a stadium park across the river. Afterwards the seeds of deception are planted, having ex-marine sniper Barr (Joseph Sikora) framed for the killing. Aware of the situation Barr has but one request: find Jack Reacher (played by Tom Cruise), after which he is brutally knocked into a coma by fellow inmates. Nonetheless Reacher, a seemingly elusive ghostly Reacher, an ex-military investigator reappears after two years of escaping the grid. Despite being an sworn enemy of Barr due to previous wrongs of the ex-marine, Reacher slowly unravels the truth behind the sniper attack. His only aide is Barr's attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike), as even within police ranks the conspiracy has dug in its claws...<br/><br/>Produced by Tom Cruise and directed by a relative newbie Christopher McQuarrie, Jack Reacher filters through as a reboot of sorts of the Jason Bourne franchise, albeit in this version Reacher does the chasing, and not the escaping. Equipped with unrivalled intelligence, photographic memory and apt to most military skills, such as hand to-hand combat or gun use, Jack is akin to godly. Here however the unsurpassed skill-set aren't owed to any covert human-enhancement programme, but due to a mix of genes and training. Now living a hobo lifestyle, Jack Reacher is a self-proclaimed wanderer, hiding from society at large, unless something or someone necessitates his reappearance.<br/><br/>Most of the time Jack Reacher works, even though the almost super-heroic traits of our protagonist does seem to become slightly tired and overused. The issue that probably works least is Jack Reacher's uncanny sex appeal, which brings a unwanted sense of ridicule - with the pheromones at work the movie would have worked well as an overlong Axe commercial. Not sure, if this was Tom Cruise working his ego, but it definitely brought out some misplaced highbrows...<br/><br/>Nonetheless, despite the expectations of a mindless action movie, placing its focus on brawns over brains, ""Jack Reacher"" offers several narrative surprises, weaving a well-thought out intrigue coupled with some witty investigative work by the contemporary Sherlock Holmes. It is undoubtedly a great pleasure to be able to engage into a movie and not have to question the logical connections made by the story. The actions of Jack Reacher never seem aimless and forced, but a meticulous pre-planned wholesome conceptualisation, much like with Jason Bourne's immaculate gift to slither through the tightest noose.<br/><br/>Soundly crafted some fault can be however placed on the underdevelopment of the enigmatic Zec (a chic appearance by director Werner Herzog), albeit maybe this was a purposeful attempt to not unravel too much details for planned sequels. Due to this however the final act does feel a bit stale, leading to a feeble emotionless climax, which lacks the intensity of a good ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"" showdown, as you never really care what happens to any of the enemies Reacher has to face (instead they are drawn like somewhat blank pages). Keep one eye open for a colourful, somewhat special small role of Robert Duvall, who truly makes his screen time a gleeful presence to behold."

","Jack Reacher was a fantasy. Barely would it ever happen, so why not have fun in its fictional tale?<br/><br/>Half the movie, we have super-soldier, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) in charge and smarter than the average bear. The other half, he has no idea what he's doing, getting himself into or a match for what he's opposing. Had they been consistent with Jack's methods, I might have been onboard with his plight. Sadly, they seemed to not know what kind of man this was and this translated in an unsympathetic audience.<br/><br/>Basically, Invisible Ultra-Ex-Soldier Jack is called back into the spotlight when a sniper takes out citizens in front of the Pirate's PNC Park in Pittsburgh, PA. (That's a lot of P's.) He's being summoned to investigate the so-called close'n'shut case against the shooter. And the defense attorney's career/life might be in question. Will they find the truth? Will Jack clear his name once accused? Will there be a sequel, like the novel series this is based on?<br/><br/>No. To the sequel question. This movie did not make the box office equivalent to necessitate a follow-up film. In good faith, I agree. While entertaining and somewhat interesting, it wasn't great or even really that good. Maybe the books are better, but sadly, I saw very little of substance in this character of Jack Reacher.<br/><br/>Now, I am a huge Tom Cruise supporter, despite a lot of people's objection to him and his old couch-jumpin' days.

"hbk_nwo33","7","0","3","27 August 2013"," The film shows potential to break the action mould, but only manages to be above average
","Jack Reacher shows a lot of potential to break the mould of action movies, but unfortunately fails to deliver a special experience. The opening scene is one of the best examples of the potential this picture had, but sadly it fell into the typical formula of the action hero. What you end up with is an above average action thriller that despite attempts to vary from the norm, ends up taking the safe road.<br/><br/>The film opens with a superb sniper sequence. The opening scene is eight minutes in length and doesn't contain a single line of dialogue. Nor does it contain any musical score, in fact no action scenes do here, which is a great touch for complimenting the stealth and no-nonsense approach of Reacher (and the villains) and is one of the things that actually succeeds in setting Reacher apart from the other action films out there. There are no opening titles to be found anywhere here either. We see everything from the viewpoint of the sniper, as we watch him set-up and then assess his targets, one-by-one before he picks them off in a professional fashion, missing only one of his six shots.<br/><br/>The next thing we see is the police collecting evidence that leads them directly to James Barr, a former U.S. army sniper. Case solved. Or is it? When asked for a confession Barr simply writes ""Get Jack Reacher"" which prompts the same response from the police as it does cinema goers, ""Who is Jack Reacher?"" A solid way to introduce Cruise's Reacher as a mysterious drifter, and it would be fair to ask the same question after the movie has finished. All we really discover about him is that he is a former policeman in the U.S. Army and that he isn't worried about operating within the law. Reacher also has an impeccable memory and attention to detail, as demonstrated by his knowledge of the police evidence. Perhaps keeping Reacher a mysterious figure was a good way to go, I haven't read the books myself so I am unsure if that is Lee Child's decision or the film taking a different direction, although with this being an adaptation of One Shot, the ninth book in the Reacher series, I doubt that the reading audience know as little about their leading man as the viewing audience. Not that a sequel wouldn't sort out that problem, as this particular story needed a lot of attention to the mystery as opposed to Reacher himself.<br/><br/>The mystery was a good one. There was a double-cross that was subtly hinted at throughout without making it obvious (Detective Emerson is always suspicious of Reacher, but that is always assumed to be because of his mysterious nature). The actual shooting itself was clever in its details, creating the perfect set-up, but a set-up that was too perfect to anyone looking past the obvious. The odd location choice to shoot from, the coin in the meter, the one 'missed' shot to leave evidence and most importantly, the appearance of a random shooting. Not only is shooting four random victims alongside your target smart, but shooting the target second rather than first is a good way to distract all attention from the target, as no-one focuses on the second victim. The sniper does line up his shot of the real target, the owner of a local construction company, with great delicacy and with more time than his others which isn't something you notice during the opening sequence but would notice on any second viewing after it was highlighted later on.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike's Helen Rodin is a good choice for the role of doubter-turned-ally, helped along by her chemistry with Cruise. The two seem to be flirting in every scene they're in. But thankfully, against all Hollywood tropes, there is no love story between them. Despite their obvious sexual tension (particularly from Helen's side) Reacher just struts off into the sunset, remaining a drifter, not needing to be anchored by the first woman he meets (like nearly every other action hero). This was very Bond-like, but actually better because instead of casual sex and then heading into the sunset, he instead just remains focused on the job and leaves. If you want to keep a character as a mystery figure that can move from location to location on a whim, that's the way to do it.<br/><br/>The films biggest drawback was the car chase scene, the biggest example of formulaic action as Reacher just races with reckless abandon, decimating traffic everywhere and executing more handbrake turns than perhaps any previous car sequence on the silver screen. A lot of them weren't even necessary and actually made his journey more difficult. The camera work for this sequence was unusual to say the least, with the drivers on the extreme left of the screen with the outside of the car and its wing mirror dominating the rest of the image. But perhaps the most frustrating part of this sequence was actually after he got out of the car, as it slowly drifted forward (which was a smart way to lose the cops) the queue at the bus station helped him hide. For no reason. They had witnessed nothing but the police chasing him, yet one man offers his cap and they all help him blend into the crowd to get on the bus. Completely illogical and unrealistic and I would be fairly surprised if this appeared in the book (at least with so little motive for the pedestrians) as the actual plot is pretty intricately designed for attention to detail.<br/><br/>Helen's immediate distrust of her own father felt unnatural too, considering that there were two people to suspect, yet the one she thought was the more likely of the two was her own father? It was obviously done as a red herring for the audience, but it made no sense for the actual character."

","Which clown decided to put Tom Cruise in a film titled ""Jack Reacher""? Tom Cruise can't reach anything. The guy's six inches. Seven inches tops. This puts most of the physical world outside of Tom Cruise's reach. Literally. Unless he's reaching for metaphysical stuff. Can Tom Cruise reach places with his mind? <br/><br/>Regardless, ""Jack Reacher"" stars Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher, an ex Army Major who specialises in kicking butt. His mission? Solve a mystery regarding the deaths of several men and women by sniper fire. The problem? The dude is short.<br/><br/>""Jack Reacher"" possesses one of the strangest opening acts in action movie history. Here director Christopher McQuarrie goes to extreme lengths to convince us that Cruise is an archetypal lone wolf, tough guy and one man army. The problem? The dude is short. When you need your camera three inches off the ground to make your tough guy look imposing, there is a problem.<br/><br/>McQuarrie then gives Cruise a series of one liners which are meant to sound witty and/or tough but which instead come across as being adorably silly. When a shop clerk asks to see some ID, Cruise offers to ""show him the inside of an ambulance"" instead. When a girl identifies herself as ""Sandy"", Cruise says ""so was I, last week, on a beach in Florida"". This is bad tough guy dialogue, the likes of which only a Clint Eastwood or Humphrey Bogart can sell. Why? Probably cos' they're tall.<br/><br/>Bizarrely, ""Jack Reacher"" stars Werner Herzog as its chief villain. Herzog's woefully miscast, and can't convey menace at all, but there's something fitting about the way his character's misfortunes align themselves with Herzog's own, wacky real life persona. Also co-starring is Rosamund Pike, who looks perpetually confused and seems to be participating in the cleavage Olympics. She sets up some of Cruise's more funny moments, in which the actor mocks his own vainglory. Elsewhere the film contains a number of good scenes, like an archetypal bar fight in which our hero ""steps outside"" to brawl with a group of hoodlums. The way Reacher dissects and works his way through an elaborate crime scene (five people were shot by a sniper alongside a river) is also interesting, though only in theory. The film later climaxes with a shoot-out at a quarry, and is bookended by two tasteless assassination sequences. In the first, we watch through a sniper-scope as a massacre occurs. In the second, Cruise assassinates the film's villain because turning up to court trials is apparently too much hassle. Like most action heroes, the guy's an extrajudicial badass, taking care of business then fading into the shadows. Like Nixon. Final scene? Cruise on a bus, about to beat up a punk for slapping a woman. The guy's a low-rent Batman, short bus and all.<br/><br/>6.9/10 – See Mamet's ""Spartan""."

","Based on the Lee Child novel One Shot, much has been said about the inappropriateness of Tom Cruise in the leading role of this movie, and I don't intend to go into detail here. But he is miscast, and badly: the role has several elements of the character from the book, and Cruise seems to miss just about every one. He can't do laconic - it comes across as smarmy; he can't do stoic either, it comes across as supercilious. And it almost goes without saying that he can't do suppressed violence as well.<br/><br/>(Potential spoiler following) But the biggest failing of the movie is in the opening few minutes, when it is made obvious who the assassin is. I got the feeling I was watching an episode of some trite TV detective drama from the 1970's, where the plot was given away in the opening scene so that the sole interest was whether or not the heroic investigator would solve the mystery in time to save the damsel. (There was always a damsel in these shows, and she became distressed at some stage. Always. Just like in this movie.) I marked the movie down because of this deep and insurmountable flaw, but there is some degree of ""but wait, there's more"" to the ways the movie fails.<br/><br/>The flaws go deeper still with what often happens when adapting a book for the screen - the dialog or background information that the prose supplies goes missing and the director or screenwriter fails to provide it for the audience. The Zec (the antagonist) appears very briefly and his motivations and history are covered just as fast. The same applies to Robert Duvall's character (Cash) which gets almost as much screen time as The Zec.<br/><br/>(Potential spoiler) On the subject of Duvall, he appears to have little interest in his role, and by the end of the movie, so too, the director, Christopher McQuarrie. At this stage Cash holds his gun over a rock, sprays bullets wildly, and somehow manages to injure an assailant a hundred meters or more away, and on the other side of a large quarry.<br/><br/>At this stage, I just wanted the episode/movie to end. Unlike the book, my disbelief was far from suspended - I take exception to lazy acting and directing. It treats the viewer with contempt, and I respond in kind."

He certainly fits my visualization of what Jack Reacher would look like. He has the closer height and rougher edge needed for the role. Schreiber has that look of a man who distances himself from the everyday commitments of home and family. If you fans out there are readers of the Jack Reacher series, let me hear your thoughts on this. Hope they make more of Lee Child's books into movies. Would like to see more movies from Baldacci, Vince Flynn and other mystery writers. Harlan Coben is another interesting writer who has some interesting characters and fun dialog in his books.

","Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is an off the grid ex military cop, who of course is a crack shot, ace assassin and general all-round hard ass. Hollywood fodder then. So far so cliché. Tom actually plays it well, calmly and consistently, but a little too human - a person genuinely like that would have fewer ""niceties"" that Cruise brings to the role - he'd be less gentile, a little more volatile. So in this the character doesn't quite sit right but Tom is good in the role... underplayed cool collectedness. The plot is quite smart, more like an episode of NCIS than a feature length film, but with good twists and turns as evidence is deciphered. Predictable a bit. The end is silly and a little all over the shop - to be honest. The acting is fine and I loved the Direction of cinematography's style and use of reflection and different camera angles. The replay sequences are a little too over simplification of the story (we got it without the demo) but I liked the overall feel of the film. David Oyelowo was under utilised against Tom Cruise, he's a great actor but was dwarfed in a production that felt a little like an advert for Tom Cruise rather than a finished ensemble film. It was a little too ""Hollywood"" to be an excellent action film - although there were moments of greatness; some of the fight scenes were gritty and awesome.<br/><br/>I like Tom Cruise generally, but he does tend to be ""Tom Cruise"" all the time... he can't step into a role and immerse himself. Compare Tom Hardy who disappears in a role. This was slick and good, but not enough of anything to make it great and other characters should have been given space to shine. Good but not great."

It is a 2 hour+ movie with nothing really carrying it through. The 3rd act is by far the best part as it really uses the most of what was good before.

","I had not only never heard of the source material when this film came out, but I had not even heard that there was such a film until it was suggested I go see it. I declined at the time but recently saw this on a plane. What I found was a perfectly fine thriller which builds nicely from a dramatic opening (made more dramatic for me since I have been on that very spot in Pittsburgh several times) and gradually unfolds to a neat conclusion with several decent set-pieces along the way. That said though, I finished the film with no real desire to see more from this character and with just the basic boxes ticked.<br/><br/>Part of the reason for this is Cruise. Talking to others after the film I found that there was controversy because he is apparently smaller than the character in the books but for me there was a much more important disconnect. Simply put Cruise doesn't fit the character he was playing and the dialogue consistently doesn't sound right coming out of his mouth. Cruise is very good at intensity in his characters but here the dialogue and the tone suggest a much more weary man even if he still has plenty of sharpness. The words say ""deliberate"" but the performance does not and it was really distracting to see Cruise in front of my eyes when my ears told me to expect someone else. This is not quite as bad but still similar in the action sequences, where he doesn't quite convince either. It is strange and generally I like Cruise for what he does, but here he simply didn't seem to fit.<br/><br/>In terms of the rest of the film though it still works. The car chases are good and generally the film has a physical edge to it where it doesn't feel like effects – it feels like metal on metal, not CGI. The plot unfolds pretty well and I was engaged by the story for the most part. The casting beyond Cruise is actually pretty good and it is a shame that more is not made of those they have. Pike is so-so but the film does a good job by having Jenkins, Oyelowo, Courtney, Duvall and of course Herzog in the cast; all of these men do their bits well and the only problem tends to be that they simply are not used often enough. Herzog in particular brings his unique nihilism to his performance and I would have loved to have seen him be menacing more. As it was, the film didn't quite make the most of the cast it had.<br/><br/>This is still a solid thriller though, with a decent pace and tone to it. Cruise is badly miscast and, while he still holds the screen, I never felt like I was watching a character so much as watching Cruise say the words of that character. The action is solid and the film is worth a look, but it never threatens to be as good as it could have been."

I have not read any of the books in what I understand to be a sizable series - but thanks to the excellent job by cast and crew – I at least know I enjoyed myself. This movie has all the elements of what I look for in quality movies – guns, explosions, chase scenes, bad guys getting their butts kicked, slim plot and a surprisingly awesome addition of late American Muscle tearing up the pavement (a sad side not - how could you ruin a perfectly good SS 396?) Did I mention this is also your classic struggle between good and evil (wait – is evil really evil?) Hmmmm, baffling. As always, I am always impressed by the awesome acting talents of Mr. Tom Cruise - if that is really your name? Hmmmm, puzzling. I really liked the story – it wasn't really in your face – well it was – but not as much as some of the other action-hero crap on movie screens lately. In action movies it is vital to have very shallow characters, an ingredient fully embraced in this movie. I mean they did such a good job keeping roles superficial, I was hoping Jack would take out some of the good guys when he was done with the bad guys. This brings up another enjoyable feature which was momentum. Oh – did you want time to take a breather? You do? You best not watch this movie then – from the first nut cracking kick to the last payback decapitation, the tempo was intense. Was this the best movie? For most – no. Was this worth my time – yes.

","I heard the news about this film that fans of the books were not all happy with the casting of the lead title character, I was willing to give it a chance seeing how much it was advertised. Basically in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania five people have been randomly shot dead near the North Shore Trail by an expert sniper, Detective Emerson (The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo) and the police quickly find and arrest the shooter James Barr (Joseph Sikora) who was in the Army, but he claims he is innocent, and says ""Get Jack Reacher"". Alex Rodin (The Cabin in the Woods' Richard Jenkins) is the District Attorney and is told that Reacher (Tom Cruise) himself is a former U.S. Army Military Police Corps officer, and now a drifter who stays off the grid and is only found when he wants to be found, but he suddenly turns out after seeing the news report about the shooting incident. The authorities refuse to allow him to see the evidence, but they let him see Barr who has been put in a coma after being beaten by fellow inmates, and counsellor Helen Rodin (Die Another Day's Rosamund Pike), Barr's defence attorney, wants to try and save him from the death penalty. She will allow Reacher to see the evidence if he becomes lead investigator, he is uninterested, confidentially revealing Barr went on a previous shooting spree in Iraq but was not prosecuted because the victims has committed major crimes that the Army wanted forgotten, so Reacher wants to take him down. He agrees to investigate the case if Helen talks to the families of the killed people, he finds discrepancies at the location, and determines the shootings must have been done in a van for cover and to stop bullets dropping on the ground. Helen reports what she found out, and he concludes that the shooting was not completely random, one of the people was the local construction company owner and was covered up by four innocent people being shot, but someone is trying to stop him investigating any further, and they frame him for the murder of a young woman he met. Reacher follows leads and finds an Ohio shooting range, former U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant and owner Cash (Robert Duvall), he only agrees to talk if the drifter proves his shooting skills on the range, which he does, it turns out a Russian gang masquerading as legitimate businessmen are the real perpetrators, their leader is the elderly man known only as The Zec (German film director Werner Herzog). The gang kidnap Helen with the help of insider Emerson, they hold her hostage at a construction site, so Reacher kills the various guards with the help of Cash, before confronting the Zec about the conspiracy, and then killing him. In the end, Cash flees the scene, and instead of proving his innocence Reacher stays on the run as a wanted man with confidence Helen could clear his name, her father was in the crime as well, and Barr wakes from his coma with no recent memory, but he accepts he was guilty of the crime and will face the consequences. Also starring Jai Courtney as Charlie and Michael Raymond- James as Linsky. Cruise does prove a pretty good choice as the steely and straight-faced former military man turned maverick investigator, the other cast members do their parts fine, including Herzog as the slightly pantomime but still dark villain, the story is reasonably easy to follow, there are some engaging chase and all guns blazing explosive action sequences, it is an alright start to what could be a franchise and series, a fun crime drama. Worth watching!"

There was something about Jack which was different to so many formulaic detectives ( and lets not pretend this is anything other than a cops and robbers tale ) So when I saw a feature on the TV that a movie had been made I was intrigued at first, then horrified that Tom Cruise was playing the eponymous role. At least 50% of the character is his physical presence, he is huge and a hard nut to boot, well versed at cracking heads as an MP as well as being a top notch investigator. <br/><br/>So I wasn't especially keen to see it, maybe I'd pick it up for rental at the video store if there was absolutely nothing else to watch. Then it was one of the selections on a flight I took a few weeks ago so I watched the trailer, thought it didn't look so bad after all and decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much the jist of my review, its wasn't so bad after all. Pretty faint praise. It was nice to see an old fashioned thriller again, not dependent on CGI special effects and huge explosions. The story starts off very well, but kinda losses steam a bit as the movie progresses. Its overlong for what it is, 15 minutes could be cut easily and it would be a better movie for the cuts. There is a very good villain, truly sinister, however his motivations, his master plan is really rather mundane and spoils it a bit. Rosamund Pike makes a welcome return to the big screen, hope we see more of her in the future. I quite liked the sexual tension between Rosamund and Tom and the fact that nothing comes of it is refreshing too. But the deal breaker all the way through the film was Tom Cruise, he is just so wrong for the role. Even if you had come to the movie with no pre-conceptions, no idea who Jack Reacher is I don't think it would make much difference. But then again it would be difficult to say who would be right for the part. The best I can come up with is Rory McCann, but he isn't a big name star and couldn't carry a big movie like this ( though he was in the running for the post Brosnan Bond slot ).<br/><br/>In the end of the day it cost 60 million and made 80 million, and that's before DVD sales etc. so its likely they will make another. As Tom Cruise is a bankable star and also producer its likely he will return to the role."

","I will start by saying I have read all of the Jack Reacher books and enjoyed almost all of them. Like many, I was skeptical when I heard that Tom Cruise would be playing Jack Reacher because a lot of the character's persona involves his personal size, which is massive, and compared to Tom Cruise's size would tend to undermine the transition to the large-screen, at least for Jack Reacher fans.<br/><br/>That said, after getting drawn into this well written and choreographed movie I was a convert. The spirit of the character remained true to the book and the story, with all its twists, kept me interested and on the edge of my seat until the very end.<br/><br/>There is a reason Tom Cruise is so successful and that is because his projects attract the talent necessary to make good action movies that entertain. Everything in this movie is top-notch and unless you, for some reason, dislike Tom Cruise you will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of action/detective movies you owe it to yourself to see this movie. Two thumbs up!"
"ChetXBuck","Null","0","4","11 April 2013"," Complex and Layered Story, Nice Moments, but Falls Flat by the end
","I wanted to like this film, but could only give it a 6 out of 10. It had great potential... a highly regarded book, complex story and characters and some good actors. But it feels over-long and has too many twists and turns. The big issue is that we do not really understand the motivations of the lead characters and some of the side characters are not believable. <br/><br/>The concept of the film and the complex story about solving the crime have a few ""aha"" moments, mostly related to plot twists. But by the end of the film I felt fatigued and cared little about the characters. The biggest issue is the relationships between various key characters... I won't say any more because it would be a spoiler, but in the end, we just don't know why people do what they do or feel what they feel... In some ways, a ""6"" is generous. I was disappointed. <br/><br/>That said, if you like the book--see the film. It's stylish and unique. Just not that good."
"RainDogJr","Null","0","5","13 January 2013"," Tom Cruise might not be ""Dirty Harry"", but his attempt wasn't that bad: 6.5 out of 10
","The trailer of JACK REACHER, the new Tom Cruise production starring (of course) Tom Cruise, played in pretty much every darn screening during the past few months. This trailer left no doubt that this was a genre movie, that was going to be out there just to satisfy its target audience; action and cars fans, and of course those Cruise admirers. However there was an element that indicated that it could be something much more interesting: the participation of the legendary Werner Herzog as the main antagonist of the story. It's quite strange for Herzog to act (although not long ago he did it for the film MISTER LONELY), and I don't think there's someone who imagined that someday he would work alongside Cruise on a 100 million dollar movie. <br/><br/>At the same time it's not hard to imagine Herzog, with his distinct voice, as a villain, and the general idea (I'm saying this as a huge Herzog fan) seemed the only remarkable thing of the movie. I think Christopher McQuarrie (director and writer – it was based on the novel ""One Shot"" by Lee Child) didn't give Herzog enough screen time. The development and conclusion to his character are quite disappointing (pretty much nothing happens with him), even with the promising beginning and with the fact that, indeed, the German filmmaker looks sensational in his antagonistic role. <br/><br/>This character is only known as ""the Zec"" (""the prisoner"") and his mythology is similar to some other fictional crime bosses. The character only known as ""the Greek"" from THE WIRE, for instance, is also a mysterious European that operates in the US – an almost mythical figure that with a low profile controls part of the criminal world. It's a cool mythology but ultimately ""the Zec"" is just another extra in Cruise's spectacle. So let's forget about Herzog to focus in what JACK REACHER really offers. <br/><br/>The movie opens with the sequence of a sniper doing a killing job. At one point we get to see the sniper's point of view and how each one of his victims (five in total) gets killed. If an opening like this one doesn't makes you think in the Don Siegel and Clint Eastwood classic DIRTY HARRY, well, is simply because you haven't seen that 1971 picture! In general terms, JACK REACHER feels like a descendant of ""Harry"" – and it's pretty obvious that it will be a franchise too. <br/><br/>Reacher ain't officially a detective (he served in the military), however he acts like one; therefore the movie moves just like any other that involves someone trying to solve a murder mystery. The protagonists, Reacher and the lawyer Helen Rodin (played by Rosamound Pike), will try to complete the puzzle and find the truth about the sniper and the five victims. There's nothing quite innovative and its few ""surprises"" remain inoffensive; but it's enjoyable, especially if you like classic detective moments. <br/><br/>The work of Tom Cruise also makes me think in DIRTY HARRY. No, I'm not comparing Cruise with Eastwood, is just that Reacher's attitude is somewhat similar to Harry Callahan's. However, you don't buy to the 50-year-old Cruise the idea that he's a dirty ol' bastard who couldn't care less for the law and literally smashes the heads of his rivals. When JACK REACHER tries to deliver the absurdist humor (that we could see in the trailer too), Cruise doesn't have any trouble to accomplish the mission; I'm not saying the result is always effective, as sometimes is just absurd, but for that kind of material, Cruise is all right. Robert Duvall is, by the way, pretty cool here. <br/><br/>Like I said, JACK REACHER has elements from those action movies from the seventies; and yes, it has a car chase too. Quentin Tarantino made it clear with DEATH PROOF that if you want to pay homage to the classics (like VANISHING POINT or DIRTY MARRY CRAZY LARRY) you better forget the CGI. It seems McQuarrie understood that; and Cruise didn't require any stunt double and drove the chase. This is certainly remarkable, but nevertheless the car chase with Zoe Bell and Kurt Russell from DEATH PROOF is still, and by far, the best, most exciting and impressive car chase that Hollywood has given us in the last ten years. So just like its car chase, the new Tom Cruise production is something the fans of action and mystery movies will appreciate but will soon forget.<br/><br/>*Watched it on 09 January, 2013"

","""There's this guy. He's a kind of cop, at least he used to be. He doesn't care about proof, he doesn't care about the law, he only cares about what's right. He knows what I did. You can't protect me. No one can."" James Barr (Joseph Sikora) That ""kind of a cop"" is Tom Cruise smartly controlling the titular Jack Reacher as he does almost every other character he has ever played. My son says he is one of the best actors of his generation, and while you may argue about that, you 'd have to say his acting chops were amply shown in Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire, and he is certainly one of the best stars of action thrillers in our time. The intelligence he displays along with the discipline of his movement makes him a hero to be applauded. After the assassination of five pedestrians by a sniper, Jack Reacher, a multitalentedexwarrior, emerges to do the heavy detective work deconstructing a gnarled plot that involves a lovely attorney, Helen Rodin (Rosemund Pike), and her DA dad, played by the always cool Richard Jenkins. She has the best line of the film when she asks Reacher/Cruise, ""Could you put on your shirt, please?"" In the old-fashioned thriller paradigm, which I favor, nothing is as it seems, and writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has the right repartee to remind us of great film noir with a touch of screwball comedy. Consider the brilliance of hiring Robert Duvall to play a crusty gun dealer who figures prominently in the rowdy denouement, and also having the eccentric director Werner Herzog play a very bad guy. You'll know what I mean about ""brilliance"" when you see them steal every one of their scenes. As predictable as this plot is, you are kept interested by the verbal virtuosity and the frenetic pace. Add to that formula subtle editing (Mark Stitt) and crisp cinematography (Caleb Deschanel) evoking the old black and white noir, and you have the best thriller of the season. ""You think I'm a hero? I am not a hero. And if you're smart, that scares you. Because I have nothing to lose."" Jack Reacher"
