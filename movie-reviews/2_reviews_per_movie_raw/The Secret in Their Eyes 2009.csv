","""El Secreto de sus Ojos"" hit me with unspeakable strength. I didn't expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.<br/><br/>First off, Campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. It even starts with a double exposure effect, mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful Buenos Aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. One shot especially, from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. Nothing to envy from Hollywood upper class.<br/><br/>But the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion Director Campanella has over characters, spaces and silences. Many moments are coldly tense, scary and very, very intense. This crossover from genres by Campanella couldn't have been better. Crime stories often fall in common places, this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it's intense dialog, acting and scenes.<br/><br/>I cannot stop recommending it, Argentina can open it's market with movies such as this. It has many, many memorable moments, it interwines comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it, as it is so well constructed. See it if you can!"
"torrelodones49","10","243","263","26 September 2009"," A masterpiece
","This is quite frankly an astonishing film. One that fills your entire array of senses and sensitivities, and the praise from Argentine reviewers here is 100 percent justified. Ricardo Darín turns in another majestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974, a tragedy that dominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between Darín and his superior, the investigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. The connection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier, if it was an English-language film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. The blending of tragedy, love, violence and humour is brilliant, and the comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darín is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from Guillermo Francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem, in fact the secondary acting is all first-class. The camera-work is impressive, especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups, and the script is also superb. Argentina has nominated the film as its candidate for best foreign film at the Oscar's, it deserves to walk it."
"tjdinvt","10","432","488","4 December 2009"," as good as anything out there
","Simply put, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I don't exaggerate when it comes to talking about movies -- but everything about this one, from the acting to the writing, to the camera work, to the directorial decisions, is grade A. The story deals with deep matters, and it does so one step at a time, with a plot that moves steadily forward, gathering force, substance and intensity, not settling for easy answers or plot points, not cutting corners. The characters are complicated, interesting, believable, flawed, funny, tragic and deeply human.<br/><br/>I prefer not to get specific about what happens -- I mostly want to try to get across the quality of this bugger. So I'll say it again: it's one of the best films I've ever seen, as good as anything out there. If there's any justice, a lot of people will see it."
"bicgus1","9","190","217","6 September 2009"," Extraordinary Film
","Last night I went to watch this flick, and I must say that all in all, I ended up quite surprised because of it's impressive quality. Taking into account that I was already expecting superior film, indeed, it came out to be even more outstanding than I thought, mainly because of the rare combination of noir genre with very precise and measured funny moments and especially an incredibly faithful description of the Argentine system of justice and the characters that compose it. This last element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all the time -no decays at all- and the set design is also great, to such extent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employed to achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fully understand some great details that are mainly local, but anyway they will surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film. It would be enough for them to say that almost all this locale's are just true, no matter how incredible they might look."

","This is it. A film that you can't get your eyes off until lights are back on... and then it's still difficult to stand up. A thriller, with lovable main characters, that makes you smile and think. A movie about a crime and a love. It has one of best chase scenes I've ever seen, involving what seems to be real complex camera work, something that could've been part of a Lord of the Rings movie maybe (at least that is what it looked like from my seat). Simply amazing. The acting is perfect. The pace is perfect. The ending couldn't be better (and we have seen so many great films that spoil it all at the end!).<br/><br/>Just go see it and enjoy what cinema should always be. It's a 10 out of 10."
"jpschapira","9","237","281","15 August 2009"," The secret of Juan José
","In my country, Juan José Campanella is synonym of 'cinema of the highest order'. The director works in USA and from time to time he brings a new film. We know, dramatically, what we're going to watch: Ricardo Darín in an important role, a lot of sentimentalism, references to the country's past, a love story. And technically, if it's the highest order, there won't be any complaints. When the film ended, the people in the movie theater started clapping.<br/><br/>""El secreto de sus ojos"" tells the story of Benjamín Esposito (Darín) and his need to tell the story of a case that wasn't completely solved 25 years ago and had an important impact in his life. A woman raped and killed and a husband with the surname Morales (Pablo Rago) who went every day to every train station in Buenos Aires to see if he could find the killer. ""You have to see his eyes; they are in a state of pure love"", Benjamín professes in front of Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil); his boss and the woman he loves.<br/><br/>There are things we never forget, Campanella knows well, and that might be the film's most important declaration. We expect from the director a powerful love that grows with the years, as we saw with Darín and Villamil in ""El mismo amor, la misma lluvia""; we expect characters with inner ghosts, things to hide and things to hold on to; we expect total control over the language of the environment (in ""El mismo amor..."" it was a magazine staff, in ""Luna de Avellaneda"" the neighborhood club), a knowledge of the customs and the way of speaking of characters that makes for day-to-day comedy. In this aspect, the casting of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval is crucial. Taking the place of the best friend role always in charge of Fernando Blanco, the comedian plays a drunk with a lot of respect for friendship. His change of look, the measurement of his composition and how he enlightens it with comic touches make for one of the year's best performances. <br/><br/>That's about everything we can expect. The fact is ""El secreto de sus ojos"" is a very good movie because there are things we don't see coming. The film contains a treatment of a police investigation that hasn't been seen in our cinema for years. In his riskiest picture, Campanella flirts with thriller, mystery and real action (handy-cam included); he acquires true tension and a sequence in a soccer stadium is the best example of it. He understands when silence is required and when the loneliness of the characters –each of them with a rich, mysterious private and inner world- must be seen fully. It's quite embarrassing in fact, because Darín as a director tried to achieve something like that with ""La señal"". Even though it's obvious Campanella took no inspiration from that film, everything that went wrong there can be seen here, improved. And Soledad Villamil is no femme fatale. I take a risk, however, and defy you to tell me if, because of image and makeup resemblance, and disposition of images and voice in off, the movie towards the finish line doesn't take direct inspiration from Chris Nolan's ""The Prestige"". It's quoting it somehow, at least.<br/><br/>It's very moving to watch excellent performances from recognized actors. We've seen them on screen so much, we know what they do, we admire them and respect them and, as with Campanella, we tend to know what to expect. However, sometimes they enchant us with every face in every frame, with every word in every conversation. I'm trying to explain to you the feeling of what Villamil and Darín do in this film: it's enchanting and contagious, purely human (as it occurred in ""El mismo amor...""), but at the same time moving, simply because they're not unprofessional actors that fit in the look of the film, or young actors with expressive faces, or newcomers that take our breath away: they are Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil. Campanella has a lot to do with this, because he knows how to make them work together and he made an effort so they would not repeat what they had given us in the other film I've mentioned.<br/><br/>The fact that Fernando Castets didn't write the film calls our attention; the script was written by the director and Eduardo Sacheri. It also calls our attention that Campanella himself edited the movie. Is this film-making of the highest order? I believe so, in our country, and speaking of something commercially successful too. It's the only movie seen by many people that can generate interest in revising the director's previous work and, who knows, maybe other national pieces."

","I am a big movie aficionado and watch a lot of movies. I guess you can say movies are my passion. After watching The Secret in their Eyes, though I confess I had my reservations as the movie was in a foreign language and I felt I won't be able to enjoy much as the real emotions and feelings mostly can't be conveyed in translations. Thus with such thoughts I proceeded to watch the movie. <br/><br/>Initially, the plot and the character build up seemed nothing out of the ordinary but then gradually as the movie progressed it held me in rapt attention.<br/><br/>Then it was simply impossible to let go, I was entirely swathed in this marvelous and sublime creation. The story line, the direction,the acting, editing, background music etc. simply sublime. <br/><br/>This is the kind of movie which mesmerizes you, captivates you and simply won't let go. The human emotions expressed and portrayed are bound to touch the viewer regardless of the region he belongs to. <br/><br/>This is the kind of movie which exemplifies that cinema has no boundaries and has an universal appeal. A must see for all movie aficionados and movie well deserving the Oscar.<br/><br/>This movie ought to go in Top 250 movies of all times and Hall of fame."
"casch0101","10","134","158","4 December 2009"," Absolutely impeccable, great film!
","I agree with SanFava. I am a follower of Campanella's and Darin. I have seen all previous three films. However, this one surpasses them all!. This is a great script, top-notch acting by everyone, partly thanks to the excellent casting. Superb cinematography. The film basically explores what ""passion"" is to the human being. A great passion (on various areas) is involved in almost all characters. You have suspense, a clever detective story, some surprising twists, etc. Darin has an ""aura"" (paraphrasing the the title of the film he worked in, ""The Aura"") that illuminates the whole screen. His presence is as powerful in the screen as that of Gene Hackman, Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman (the top, great ones). I sincerely hope this movie gets his due awards (Oscar included), because it deserves so!)."
"Hitchcoc","10","13","13","27 February 2016"," A Story of Passion and Commitment
","I can't add a lot to what has been written. The direction and cinematography aside (which is magnificent), this is an incredible psychological study, involving a group of the most complex of characters. Esposito finds himself in love with two people: the woman who was once his boss and because of inaction, left him heartbroken, and, secondly, a beautiful young rape/murder victim. Over a twenty-five year period, these forces never leave him. The rapist is his Moby Dick to his Captain Ahab. Since we don't see a lot of what happens in the intervening time, we must wonder how empty and fruitless his life has been until he has his epiphany. Mixed in all this are the politics of Argentina and the vengeance of a horrible man. Also, in the middle is the messed friend, an alcoholic, who can be a true talent, but is submerged in his problems, spending his time in bars. If we look to literature we might consider him the Sydney Carton of this film. When you see what happens to him, you will see why I choose this character as a reference. This is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It has it all."

","Not often I come to an IMDb review page and think what can I possibly add to all the comments that came before? The movie is staggering in its ability to engage and while engaging to constantly fiddle with the expectations of the viewer. It is the rarest of movies, a slow movie that is never boring and one you never want it to end.<br/><br/>I want to ask aloud why Hollywood feels the psychotic compulsion to remake every decent foreign film whether it needs remaking or not? I remember that one of the best horror films I have ever seen was about an undead girl in a climate so cold that the thought of living there was scarier than the story (LET ME IN.)

By the way I watched this movie in It's original language. Subtitles were translated into English. I think by using ""Google Translate"" which sucks.

","When Juan Jose Campanella is not directing episodes of Law and Order, CSI or the like, he periodically returns to Argentina make a movie. In this case he directed and co-wrote the screenplay of The Secret in Their Eyes. Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirty-five years and now in just few days after we saw it, we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie, Tell No One, one of our all time favorites, as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish, of course, with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery, crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by well-known Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements, which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view, which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting, directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre, there is a strong ending, which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection."

","The retired justice officer Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel based on the Morales Case of twenty-five years ago and has difficulties to find the right beginning. He visits his former chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil) in the tribunal to show his draft. In the 70's, Benjamín has an unrequited love for his new-hired chief Irene that belongs to an upper-class. Benjamin is assigned to investigate the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), a beautiful woman recently married with Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) that had been brutally raped and murdered. Benjamin and his alcoholic partner Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) feel touched with the grief of Ricardo and go further in their investigation. Benjamin observes that a man named Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is staring Liliana in many pictures and he becomes the prime-suspect. Meanwhile the tension between Ricardo and Irene increases along the days but Ricardo does not understand the signs of her eyes. Twenty five years later, Ricardo is still haunted by his love for Irene and for the unsatisfactory resolution of the Morales Case.<br/><br/>""El Secreto de Sus Ojos"" is a film awarded with the Oscar of Best Foreign Language Film of the Year with a dramatic story that perfectly entwines crime, thriller and a subtle romance in an adequate pace. The direction of Juan José Campanella is tight and the screenplay is wonderful, unfolding two lead stories – the brutal murder of a young woman and the repressed love of a subaltern for his chief – with many subplots. The acting is top-notch, with excellent dialogs and many funny lines but never vulgar. The cinematography and the camera work are magnificent and there is one specific scene very impressive with the camera approaching to the stadium in the middle of a soccer game between Huracán and Racing. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Segredo dos Seus Olhos"" (""The Secret of Your Eyes"")"

","OK, frankly, I didn't expect much of this.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with Argentinian cinema, so this was my first acquaintance with director, writer and actors.<br/><br/>Boy, what a surprise this movie made. It's beautifully filmed, it has lovely slow parts where director and actors narrate emotions through silence, this feature is almost vanquished from modern cinema where any frame that doesn't contain action is considered boring.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed directing, but acting left me pining for Spanish classes. Impressive portrayal of characters if self-evident, with Soledad Villamil's performance shining out as an example of true actress. Unfortunately, we Spanish-impaired people can only sense the beauty lying within spoken lines and rhythm of the language that subtitles just cannot convey. <br/><br/>As for violence and nudity they are used in glimpses, not more than necessary and in meaningful places, I spent good part of the movie fearing that it must eventually get ruined with some trendy shocker effect. But it doesn't, it flows it's own way beautifully to the end.<br/><br/>If one can use small court office and a rape case to tell a love story in such subtle and profound manner it leaves me wandering what Argentinian cinema has for us for the future. I'll jump on digging through it's past right away, and I hope anyone wondering if this movie is worth their time can be swayed to yes side by my humble recommendation."
"smatson123","10","20","23","10 June 2010"," ""Sus Ojos"" as Literature on the Screen (long)
","To get the big picture before beginning this piece, I did a quick sweep of previous reviews and immediately had to ask myself: why does the same film generate such passionate applause on the one hand, and such punishing comments on the other? I suppose it goes back to the question of ""sus ojos"" (your eyes). Those looking for an American style murder mystery or a boy-meets-girl, loses-girl, finds-girl romance may in fact have their eyes closed to some important possibilities. But those willing to see film as a novel have an experience to look forward to an experience that satisfies and enlightens on every level.<br/><br/>""Sus Ojos"" is a multilayered film that, like the work of Dostoevsky, makes us totally vested in the lives of its characters while exploring universal themes that can resonate with all of us. There are two major threads here that are worth close examination: the first is the unrequited passion that the intelligent and humane legal affairs clerk Benjamin Esposito feels for his well-bred supervisor, the beautiful, distant and self possessed Superior Court judge Irene Menendez. Having only completed high school, he has convinced himself he has nothing to offer her. In fact, his life is comparable to the clunky typewriter he has been given, with the defective ""a"" that always pops up as a capital letter: flawed; just not good enough. Esposito is held back by his self-doubt to the extent that, 25 years after the relationship begins, as he tries to start a novel based on an unresolved murder case, the prompt he uses to remove writer's block is ""TEMO""--I fear. Yet he is not a true coward: he simply, like any blocked writer, doesn't know how to reach his goals--both the completion of the novel and true connection with Irene.<br/><br/>The second theme, one that is strategically intertwined with the first, is the murder case itself. Soon into the film it becomes apparent that Esposito's inability to resolve the rape and stabbing of a beautiful, 23-year-old school teacher--that is, to bring the murderer to full justice--represents his de facto impotence in bringing his relationship with Irene into reality. And on an immediate level,too, his obsession with the case makes perfect sense. Empathetic and perceptive to begin with--who else would continue to give support to an alcoholic friend, as Esposito does--he wants to bring justice to the dead girl and some element of resolution to her traumatized husband. <br/><br/>Soon we are intrigued by the growing relationships between not only Irene and Esposito, but between Benjamin and his friend, who disparages him to barfly friends; Esposito and the husband, who insists that life in prison is the only acceptable punishment for the murderer; Esposito and the murder suspect; the murder suspect and Irene, revealing a toughness and ingenuity we hadn't seen before; and ultimately, the husband and the killer. And it is when Esposito sees that the final resolution is left to the husband that he is free to move on with his life. A simple act brings the decision to life: he suddenly realizes that by putting his ""defective"" letter A into the word ""TEMO"", he will end up with ""teAmo""--I love you: the declaration he must make--the action he must take--in order to go forward and leave the past behind.<br/><br/>Visual motifs keep the viewer connected and grounded throughout the film but placed to appear to be a natural artifact of the story telling. The most obvious one is the door image, used in promotional posters for the film. The judge's chamber door consistently is kept open or closed, depending on her relationship with those who enter. Esposito, attempting to put the final piece of a 25-year old puzzle into place, must wait for the husband to leave his house and enter a secret door. In the same way, secrets are hidden or revealed throughout the movie by means of doors large and small, obvious or subtle. A second motif is the train image, showing arrivals and departures, journeys and moving on from situations that cannot be resolved. Esposito, his life threatened by associates of the murderer, must take the train to a new town, leaving behind a regretful, running, Irene. The husband tells about murdering the suspect,the roar of a passing train disguising the sound of gunshots. A third, of course, is the eye, seen open and waiting in Esposito in the beginning shots--this is the eye of a person open to experience. The dead girls' eyes must be physically closed by an attending police officer. Esposito feels deep connection to her husband, citing the love for the lost wife seen in his eyes. A fourth is the interplay of columns at the department of justice--seen top down or bottom up--representing the aloof justice system, corruption and bureaucracy of the Argentian course system that prevents justice from taking place.<br/><br/>This film has it all under the accomplished hand of director Jose Campanella. Acting is up there:Ricardo Darin as Esposito, Soledad Villamil as Irene, and Pablo Rago as the friend are equally affecting. Then again there are the strong story lines; thematic development; pitch-perfect cinematography (the chase seen through an enormous soccer stadium is as believable as they come); and even touches of humor, developed through perfectly synchronized dialogue. Is there a happy ending? Well, as both Esposito and Irene tell each other at the end--and as we see in the best loved novels--""it's complicated."""

","El Secreto de sus Ojos is a great film. If you examine the filmography of the director, Jean Jose Campanella, you can see that all his years directing TV in Hollywood has taught him the craft of classic Hollywood style on a high level. But the movie is authentically Argentinian, both in style and in content. Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil are both deeply familiar actors in Argentina, and the romantic melodrama is quite typical, but the tautness of the suspense and the intelligent plot twists bring out the best in both actors, as well as an amazing supporting cast. And I loved the portrayal of politics. Without giving any more away, the scene in the elevator is one of the most effective portrayals of what fascism really feels like.<br/><br/>I'm sure Campanella's Hollywood contacts didn't hurt, and that the movie was done in a pretty standard style (note the tour-de-force long shot in the stadium!), but this is a great movie by any standard."

The fact is that there are a lot of excellent actors... what happens is that normally the movie scripts just suck.<br/><br/>In this case the movie blew me away... the plot, the performances, well... everything. A special thing that I really loved was the beautiful close-ups, the little expressions in the faces of everybody, the wrinkles, the words not said with the mouths, but with the eyes, every desire, every single detail of the number of emotions that everyone has.<br/><br/>""El hijo de la novia"", ""Luna de Avellaneda"", ""El secreto de sus ojos""... it's not a coincidence that all these movies have Campanella and Darín working in tandem.<br/><br/>This is the way more Argentinian movies should be: actors+SCRIPT."
"dave-sturm","10","15","18","29 May 2010"," Senor Campabella, take a well-deserved bow
","It's a thriller. It's a love story. It's a puzzle movie. It's It's an acting tour de force. It's spectacular cinematography.<br/><br/>It's a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Going in, all I knew is that it was a highly regarded film from Argentina that won an Oscar. I know zip about Argentine cinema, but it's hard to believe a better movie has ever been made there.<br/><br/>One thing Americans should know is that this ""foreign film with subtitles"" is in no way, shape or form an ""art movie"" loaded with ambiguity and other hoity toity stuff like that. This movie is the work of a master craftsman director working off a brilliant and intricate thriller script.<br/><br/>The narrative unfolds in interspersed scenes involving the same people, but 25 years apart. It's the same actors and characters, but youthful in some scenes and with wrinkles and gray hair in others.<br/><br/>The plot turns on the aftermath of a brutal rape and murder of a beautiful young wife. Front and center throughout the movie are Benjamin, the passionate young investigator for whom this particular case is one he cannot set aside, and Irene, his colleague (it was a little unclear to an American what their professional relationship was) who clearly is drawn to his passion and has feelings for him, even though she is engaged to someone else (offscreen).<br/><br/>Two shots must be discussed. First, there's THE shot. Anyone who has seen it will know exactly what I mean. It's a one-take (seemingly, but not really — it would be impossible without CGI) tracking shot involving a chase in a packed soccer stadium. The second much-discussed shot is only about a minute long and happens in an elevator, but you will not breathe during that incredibly tense minute.<br/><br/>Lots of credit goes to the secondary actors, who portray a law clerk with a drinking problem, the perpetrator of the crime, a hapless intern, a weaselly judge and the devastated husband of the victim.<br/><br/>The ending is an elegantly shown series of reveals. The next-to-last sequence totally screws with your mind. I kid you not, it's a shocker and it comes out of nowhere. Then comes the grand finale with Benjamin and Irene in the touching end scene.<br/><br/>You will leave the theater simultaneously with a chill down your spine and a lump in your throat."
"lee_eisenberg","9","18","23","6 April 2010"," Argentinian passion
","The second Argentinian movie to win an Oscar, ""El secreto de sus ojos"" (""The Secret in Their Eyes"" in English) looks at a Buenos Aires detective's passion in solving a case on the verge of the military junta that was responsible for the Disappeared. As I understand it, a difference between this movie and Juan Jose Campanella's previous ones is that this is more mainstream, so to speak. I actually found it pretty comparable to ""My Wife's Boyfriend"", which Campanella also directed. I certainly recommend both films. To be certain, this one has some of the best lines that I've ever heard. Argentina has clearly shown itself to be a fine country in terms of cinema during this past decade."
"ignacioposse","10","26","35","14 November 2009"," About Dardo's comment.
","This is a response to the commentaries of dardo (sorry about my poor English). What you see in the movie is exactly what it is: You can spot a fan because fans of a football team or hooligans, when their team plays as visitor in another team's stadium, the visitor's fans have a sector assigned ( up, in one of the sides), therefore it was enough to look for the assassin in that sector alone, and not in the whole stadium. The players' commentaries of Racing which appear in the letters, belong to old times football players, of whom Gomez was a fan when he was a teen-ager. It would not be surprising that he was commenting on any alternative of a game with his mother which they could have just watched, and that had been discussed with the rest of the family, for instance, in which case, she knew exactly what he was talking about when he was recalling this or that football player.<br/><br/>The mind of a rapist and murderer, is not the one of a normal person. There are thousands of examples of people who ended up confessing crimes to demonstrate their value or bravery. The Simpons are a caricature of real life situations because millonaires, drunks, corrupt politicians or whatever, do exist.<br/><br/>And at last, the insulting dialog that you refer between Esposito and Romano, is not exactly what they say. Romano never says the word ""ass"" (it's only suggested) and Espósito never says ""first"" (It's a word game between ""to rub"" and ""to put""). Insulting each other never has a real meaning, but the dialog is more sophisticated than what you tell. Translation problems.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the captures, scenes, the love story that undergoes the whole movie, a different plot and more than one very out-standing performance makes this movie a remarkable film. IMO.<br/><br/>It's a 10."
"jotix100","8","23","31","12 March 2010"," The secret of his eyes
","A retired investigator, Benjamin Esposito, from a criminal court in Buenos Aires, decides to write about a case that has haunted him since the days he was assigned to cover the crime. In putting his thoughts in paper, he realizes the case is still unresolved. What's more, he is more involved now, than he was back then. For that he must go back and speak to Irene, the district attorney, under whose office he worked. Irene, he realizes, is the woman he has never forgotten in spite of being apart for so many years.<br/><br/>The crime in question involved a beautiful newlywed woman found raped and stabbed to death in her apartment. Benjamin and the other investigator, Pablo Sandoval, try to gather as much information about the circumstances that triggered the murder. Both men are hindered by an elusive killer whose only, and possible identity, is a photograph that the investigators find in an album they get from the husband of the victim, Ricardo Morales. The thing that sparked their suspicion is Isidoro Gomez who appears in a couple of pictures almost adoring the dead woman, who obviously, he couldn't have. <br/><br/>Benjamin is a self made man. He came from humble origins, in contrast to Irene Menendez Hastings, a girl from money and privilege. In a class conscious society like Argentina, their possible involvement would have been nil. Yet, one can see how Irene gets under Benjamin's skin. Their attraction is mutual, but it will never happen. She, too, is aware of the way he feels, but ultimately, decorum prevails. After all, Irene is about to marry a society man. <br/><br/>The pursuit of Isidoro Gomez doesn't go anywhere. Pablo Sandoval's drinking friends crack the code about Isidoro Gomez's love for a soccer team, the Racing of Avellaneda. The suspect, who proves to be a master in the way he can outrun Benjamin and Pablo, is followed to his favorite place, the soccer stadium. When they finally catch up with the suspect, someone well connected with the government of then president Isabel Peron, bails him out. It was clear they had no chance in ever catching the assassin. Benjamin, in frustration leaves his post after his partner Pablo Sandoval is killed, a death that was meant for him.<br/><br/>Years later, Benjamin returns to Buenos Aires and goes back to Irene with the notes he has written. Irene, now married with children, realizes whatever they felt about one another, never having said a word, is now stronger than ever. Benjamin gets lucky when he decides to pay a surprise visit to Ricardo Morales, the widower of the slain woman. When Benjamin finds him at a remote place in the country, he is for an unexpected surprise.<br/><br/>Juan Jose Campanella is one of Argentina's best directors. Working with Eduardo Sacheri, and his novel, ""La pregunta de sus ojos"", the director struck gold. The film can be a bit disorienting for people without much knowledge of Argentine history that is at the center of the story. Most of the action takes place in the Buenos Aires of 1974, when the corrupt government of Peron's widow Isabel, was in power. One can relate to the way the story of those years work well with what the creators wanted to present. <br/><br/>With the presence of Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil the director had it made. Both are excellent actors who will enhance any film in which they appear. They both shine as Benjamin and Irene. But it is with the supporting players that Mr. Campanella achieve greatness. Guillermo Francella, who plays Pablo Sandoval does an amazing job. As he proved with ""Rudo y Cursi"", Mr. Francella steals the film from the principals any time he is seen. Pablo Rago, is brilliant in the way he approaches his role as the husband of the assassinated wife and whose life ended on the tragic day she was killed.<br/><br/>Felix Monti's atmospheric cinematography works well, capturing that bygone era. So does the fine musical score by Fererico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer. This is another triumph for Juan Jose Campanella."

","I don't typically write movie reviews, but I felt compelled to do so with this one. Note: I speak Spanish fluently so I watched without subtitles. I don't know what could be lost in translation. But being able to fully understand the dialogue surely makes a difference. I've seen this movie many, many, many times in the years since it first released in the USA. I saw it twice in the theater, I've never done that before this movie and since then. It is by far the best movie I've seen. The acting is outstanding. Ricardo Darin always delivers, but this one was just amazing. Even though the storyline moves back and forth in time, it's so that the viewer understands exactly why things happen. You laugh, you cry, you cringe. It's a roller coaster of emotions. The dialogue is amusing and spot on. The closeup of the different characters eyes at peak moments is subtle but so telling. The one camera take of the climatic scene really takes your breath away; you feel like you're there. I recommend this movie all the time. Perfection!"

","I had heard such rave reviews of this film from my friends and colleagues that I just had to watch it, and I'm glad that I did. What an exquisite piece of work. I loved the cinematography and the casting was perfect. Darin and Villamil, as well as the supporting actors, delivered outstanding performances--so believable and touching. Took a bit to get into this movie, but once into it, I became immersed. Afterwards, I couldn't get the movie out of my mind. Really stayed with me. What I originally thought of as slow was simply a steady build up to the movie climax. Nicely done. Intriguing. The romantic storyline didn't do anything for me (and I found it implausible) but the detective/suspense part was awesome. Not sure if I want to see the recent re-make because it might ruin this version of the story for me."
"erengencturk","10","8","9","25 August 2013"," Perfect Love
","Was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it. A lot of things happen on the screen, but the emotions are very subtle. In essence, it's another take on the age old question, ""How far would you go for the one you love?"" Here, we have two completely different angles to it. One man who walks away while another can never forget. I did not expect the ending, and while I'm generally not keen on any ""twist"" finales, this is one I'm willing to overlook because it makes sense. We should have known, in fact, that his love was that strong. Absolutely. It's an emotionally honest and subtle drama which centers around the idea that people search for a substitute in order to not fulfill what they are really looking for. The love story between Esposito and Irene who need many years to utter their feelings for each other on the one hand, and the cruel story of cold-blooded murder contrast in a brilliant way, and somehow all of the paths the film shows lead to one point, the disturbing scene where Esposito discovers the victim. The film is more complex and allegorical than one is used from that ""genre type"", and also manages to integrate the ""porteño"" humor perfectly. It's likely my favorite among the Oscar nominees and one of the most pleasant surprises from 2009 aside ""About Elly"" and ""Like You Know It All""."
"siderite","10","8","9","6 May 2013"," An example for movie makers everywhere
","It took me three years to finally watch this movie. It was in Spanish, and it was always easier to watch a silly blockbuster or some series when coming back from work, so I always waited it out. I am glad I did not wait any longer. As other reviewers noticed, it is hard to find flaws in the movie, from the beautiful story, nice camera work and great acting to the painfully emotional feel and the depiction of Argentinian corrupt justice system.<br/><br/>The film is slow paced, but building strength with every scene. The characters are complex, the situation is complicated and real. There are no useless plot devices, gratuitous violence or nudity, no ridiculously moral or powerful or lucky or beautiful people. No pointless Spanish cursing and over-dramatic scenes. It's painfully real for its whole length and, even if the ending is pretty intense, you get there in a smooth curve.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if this is the film, I really wonder how good the book was. The movie was perfect for me and I can't recommend enough watching it. It deals with love, pain, obsession, helplessness and retribution is a way few films ever succeed or even dare."

"gtoniazzo","9","7","8","14 August 2013"," When crime meets poetry
","It is never easy to write about a movie that you love because the words are never enough to describe the emotions that it gives you. This is one of my favourite movies of the last decade: made with a slow pace and always careful not to let the cruelty of the crime to take over and tell the story. We meet the main characters in Buenos Aires in 1999 when Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) is trying to write a book about a 30 years old cold case occurred while he was a legal counsellor. Benjamin has been haunted by the past and is in desperate need of closure, still in love with his ex-colleague Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil) and hoping to finally let the victim rest in peace. A young couple's dream of happiness is savagely destroyed and what remains of it carries such a deep and honest grief that no one is left untouched. Pablo Rago is brilliant playing the young widower Ricardo Morales, his inconsolable but calm way to grieve introduces us to a man made of love and patience while Ricardo Darin, never over the top, portraits a middle age man lost in a limbo of memories and who has waited for years to see his passions for Irene and for justice to prevail. Passion and melancholy are the elements that have made this movie a masterpiece, and the poetry of a director like Jose Campanella has borrowed nothing from overseas: this is an Argentinian movie with an Argentinian heart and this is why it has to be seen in his original language to be truly appreciated because nothing like the Buenos Aires's accent will rock you through the events. My vote 9.5/10"

The camera work is fantastic throughout, and there is one scene with a single sweeping shot from high above a football stadium down to crowd level which is truly amazing.

","Perceptible drama with suspense filmed with sensitivity and feeling. The story, set in 1999, is told in flashback way : in June 1974 a Justice Officer , Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin), becomes entangled in the investigation of the crime of an ill-fated wife named Liliana , cruelly raped and killed inside her home in a Buenos Aires neighborhood. Her widowed husband named Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago), is shocked by the crime ; Espósito promises to find the murderous and bring him to justice. Benjamin is helped by his drunk assistant Pablo Sandoval and a newcomer, the upper class Secretary of Court named Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil) who is hired at the Criminal Court . Despite the department already having two other suspects Benjamin seeks tips off . Espósito's rivaling partner Romano pins the killing on two immigrant employees so as to get rid of the case , an issue that infuriates Espósito, hitting Romano in a fury. He finds a track while seeing some photos provided by Morales: he comes across a strange young man identified as Isidoro Gomez(Javier Godino) who watch the victim in a rare manner in various pictures. Espósito investigates the whereabouts of Gómez, and learns that he is residing in Buenos Aires, but fails to chase him. Espósito and Sandoval break into Gómez' household in an illegal entrance and take some letters that lead a clue about his liking to Racing Club . The other issue is that Gómez is still at large, and they set out in pursuit . Meanwhile Benjamin Esposito is writing a novel, using the matter as the source material. Benjamin was personally affected by the case as he tracked the killer, hence the reason why the unsatisfactory ending to the case has always bothered him. <br/><br/>This sensitive tale contains intrigue , tension , drama, and an enjoyable love story . It's a brilliant and touching film though sometimes is slow moving and tiring but is developed with intelligence and sensibility. In the picture are treated ethic and moral themes narrated with great sense of fairness and ductility . Marvelous relationship between two main starring , they are frankly wonderful . Very good interpretation from Ricardo Darin as impulsive Justice Federal Agent who embittered by unsatisfactory ending to the case will have to face the traumatic truth and special mention an awesome Soledad Villamil as intelligent and wise chief department . It's impossible to escape to spell of the Argentinian movie star Ricardo Darín. Not only is he continually employed but whichever body chooses Argentina's Oscar submission each year has a huge crush. Darin's the star of their 2001 nominee Son of the Bride and this 2009 winner The Secret in Their Eyes and he's also principle cast in their submission titles that weren't nominated from 2002 (Kamchatka), 2005 (El Aura) and 2007 (Xxy) . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Juan Jose Campanela and deservedly prized with Oscar winner for the best foreigner film . He's a good Argentinian writer and director as Television as ¨Law and Order¨, ¨ Winds of water ¨,as cinema as ¨The Avellaneda's moon ¨, ¨Same love same rain¨, ¨Son of the bride¨ again with his fetish actor Ricardo Darin . Rating : Above average , well worth seeing . This a good-feeling movie full of intrigue , drama , tension , and agreeable message . Essential and indispensable watching ."

"roblesar99","9","4","4","9 August 2017"," A Modern Classic of the Genre
","Only the second Argentinian film to win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, The Secret in Their Eyes is equal parts a slow-burning crime thriller and a forbidden love story that affects everyone involved for over a quarter of a century, following two separate timelines. In 1974, Judiciary employee Benjamín Espósito begins investigating the rape and murder of a young woman named Liliana Coloto. Assisting him in the investigation are his assistant Pablo Sandoval and his superior Irene Menéndez Hastings. Twenty-five years later, Espósito decides to use the case as the basis for his first novel, leading to a reunion with Hastings and the revelations that arise from discovering events that were set in motion twenty-five years prior. Although the majority of the film's runtime is devoted to the 1970s timeline, director Juan José Campanella, who also served as the film's co-writer and editor, finds a masterful balance between the two, crafting a non-linear narrative that provides a satisfying resolution to both threads.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the film takes a while to get going, with the initial back- and-forth between the two timelines feeling a bit jarring. However, as the story begins to unfold and we delve deeper into the investigation, the film simply captivates, as Campanella delivers an engrossing crime drama with an ending that left me breathless. I will say, however, that I found it difficult at times to keep up with the film's rapid-fire dialogue. Even though I speak Spanish myself, some of the film's dialogue-heavy scenes demand the full attention of the viewer. While I don't know how this problem might play out for someone watching the film with the English subtitles as they might be simplified, but it is a problem that I found worth noting.<br/><br/>The film's engrossing nature rests on the strengths of its performers, which include Ricardo Darín as Espósito, Guillermo Francella as Sandoval, and Soledad Villamil as Hastings. Darín does magnificent work in the lead role, expertly capturing Espósito's growing obsession in regards to the case. Francella, in his after first dramatic film role after an established career as a comedic performer, turns the alcoholic Sandoval into a fascinating character. Sandoval, whose relationship problems and drinking habits often conflict with his occupation, could have easily been a one-note stereotype, but Francella (who bears an uncanny similarity to Steve Carrell) manages to make him a likable character. Sandoval's friendship with Espósito leads to one of the film's most emotionally charged scenes. Villamil also delivers a mesmerizing performance. Much like the film's title implies, the eyes of these characters play an important role, serving as a method of non- verbal communication. And none of the other performers use their eyes to their advantage as much as Villamil does. Through her beautiful gaze, we see the complex relationship she forms with Espósito, whose eyes convey a buried, unspoken love for her.<br/><br/>The film also benefits from more than just Campanella's storytelling abilities. This is a marvelously well-composed film, one that takes full advantage of the cinematic medium. Each frame feels tightly constructed, with Campanella sometimes telling two different stories in the same frame or obfuscating characters behind chairs or piles of documents and folders. In regards to the latter, by framing his characters in such a way, Campanella subtly communicates the growing obsession that they feel as the investigation begins to unravel. The film's technical prowess doesn't end there though. The film contains an enthralling five-minute long take set in a soccer stadium that ends with Espósito and Sandoval chasing their primary suspect, one Isidoro Gómez (acted to chilling perfection by Javier Godino), on foot. Campanella isn't just concerned with ideas of obsession, however. The film's conclusion allows for it become a meditation on justice and to what ends someone will go to punish a guilty individual. And Pablo Rago, who plays the deceased's husband, shines in these scenes as he delivers a haunting performance.<br/><br/>Campanella's The Secret in Their Eyes is a thoroughly compelling film that benefits from a well-executed screenplay, skillful direction, and a host of strong performances. It's a shame that Hollywood couldn't resist the urge to remake the film years later with Billy Ray's Secret in Their Eyes, which ended up being a decidedly inferior production. Campanella's original, however, stands on its own as a modern classic.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 (Amazing)"

","I came up to watch this film after its Oscar award as best foreign language film. Although it starts like a crime movie, slowly it becomes into a love story, when we see its development through the eyes of Benjamin Esposito, the former legal counselor, who tries to solve a long ago murder.<br/><br/>What I liked about this story is its reliability portrayed from the 70's - when being a critic of the government was considered a reason to be prosecuted by the state- combined with two loved women stories that have lasted for 25 years. One lesson this movie gives us is ""love can last longer than you think"" and another is ""even a forbidden love can even last longer"". And it's precisely those lessons the key for Esposito to solve a crime long ago closed."

","If you want to understand what this movie is about you need to ask yourself why the movie ends the way it does. One may think this is a crime movie, other may think this is a love story. I lived in that Society and I believe it is much more than that. The movie traps you right from the beginning, but the end is so logical that, even if it made me feel sad for the implications, I had no words to express the feeling that the logical conclusion produced on my person. There is a message in what the spectator sees at the end. If you think this movie is a thriller or a love story is because you did not understand it. When you understand the logic behind it then you realize the greatness of this movie. Some people may think it is about past times in Argentina. At least this was what my brother, who had recommended me the movie, told me when I asked him why he had enjoyed the movie. I felt sorry at the end because, it is not about the past, it also embraces the present."

A summary of lessons learned in the sewers of reality, of politics, of democracy. Where ""isms"" are everywhere and nowhere, where people are real and helpless, even when under the umbrella of the Governemnt itself.<br/><br/>A must see. One of those films that reminds me -again, that what we do in Hollywood is for boneheads. This film makes me think. It makes me feel.

","Hi, This is my first review on IMDb, so please bear with me. I don't speak or understand Spanish and I don't watch many foreign language films, but I somehow managed to get myself in a mood to watch this and I am so glad I did. This movie as mentioned here, had two underlying themes, one is about the obvious rape and murder mystery, and the other more effective theme is the unspoken love between the main character and his supervisor. As for the story itself, its about the rape and murder of a young woman, and revolves around the police team (a detective, his supervisor and his drunk assistant) who try to solve it, her husband and the killer. It is not so much about trying to find out who the killer is, rather about the emotions involved with the people concerned. The untold love story between the detective and his supervisor captures as much attention as the murder mystery and is beautifully told. I really didn't find any negative points with the whole film, the acting was brilliant, the screenplay was superb, the editing was also neatly done. Obviously I cant ignore that one shot of the football stadium which takes your breath away. I guess I am going to watch more of Spanish and other foreign language films after this one. 9 out of 10."

","El secreto des sus ojos (2009)<br/><br/>A quietly building up of suspense and romance , a terrific movie. It has some of the slow pace punctuated by violence of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and it shares the steadfast leading man (Ricardo Darin), willing to plod along until the crime is solved. And it's filmed with a contemporary edgy but warm eye, the camera often moving between things so the subject is half seen, or not seen at all, and yet it is so natural you just get sucked in further.<br/><br/>The plot may seem ordinary at a glance, with a pair of investigators, one a very funny alcoholic (Guillermo Francella), going after a man who raped and killed a woman, but it isn't really this main idea that matters at first. In the classic fashion of some great detective movies, it's the characters and how they proceed that matters. We come to know the two men (as well as actress Soledad Villamil, a tangential love interest) and wander through less common edges of Argentina, where this was made.<br/><br/>The storytelling is given depth by moving back and forth over a 25 year period, and this laying out of ideas slowly makes you pay attention. It's very smart this way, grabbing the viewer. By the end, the tragedies begin to really move you, the final large twist (or two) to the story is utterly believable and sensational, and the love story becomes as archetypal as ""Dr. Zhivago"" and as beautiful. A lovely, involving, and satisfying film."

","Actually, I don't watch Argentinian movies very often. Some of them are very good (Like Son of the bride), but in the majority are pretty bad. But I read some positive reviewers about this movie (El secreto de sus ojos) and I decided to watch this masterpiece. I watched it in Spanish, because I understand this language pretty good. They talked very fast, but the Argentinian accent sounds like that. I enjoyed all the movie. In the first minutes I wasn't convinced about the story of the movie. But after a while every piece of the story was in the right place and I could follow all the story to the end. It's special, non-Hollywood. It makes you think about what life really is. The actors were very good in their roles, special Darin and Francella. Funny, enjoyable, very deep. An excellent masterpiece!"

","I am not a big fan of rape movies no matter how well made they are. So I was about to walk out of the theater after watching a beautiful girl's body on the floor covered with bruises implying a rape and murder case. I am so happy I did not.<br/><br/>The first thing I loved about the movie was the story. Most rape movies show the reality of rape and the aftermath. It is very true that most of the time there is nothing you can do that can come close to revenge. when you leave the movie theater, you can feel how the real world is full of disgusting crimes we can not do anything about. This one was different. this one had a plot that real or not, fixed things. you leave the movie theater smiling knowing that he got what he deserved. You enjoy watching people trying to set things right even after 25 years. you watch them change ""Temo"" to "" Te Amo"". the second beautiful thing about the plot is the suspense. you barely notice the passage of time and the plot changes directions at all the right times.<br/><br/>The second thing I loved was acting. I really think they could have casted someone less creepy as her husband. I had a hard time believing that he did not do it himself. :) but apart from that I enjoyed the acting very much. Everyone from the detective to the rapist did a great job. Top notch acting indeed!<br/><br/>Last but definitely not least is script. It is not the most beautiful artful script but it is simple, strong, heartfelt and with nice twists like the ""missing A"" and the themes that are consistent through out the whole movie. beautiful look at love, passion and devotion. there is not even one single sentence that is left unexplained. everything comes to a beautiful whole at the end. A very touching work of art."

As a matter of fact, having been twice to watch it at the cinema i can attest that the ending had a profound impact on almost everyone both times.<br/><br/>As to this same reviewer's comment that he finds the references to Racing club in the killers letters not credible, I think quite the opposite, he was very careful in not giving himself away, but the point is made that it was precisely his passion he could not bring under control, that finally got him busted.<br/><br/>An last but not least, all the swearing in the language is not to be understood as childish scriptwriting.... most of us argentines truly speak like that in our everyday life."

"Metala84","2","62","115","17 December 2010"," Preposterous plot, weak characters
","Huge spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>I love foreign films. I love dramas with strong characters. I love films that make me feel with the protagonists and live their journey as my own. No matter good or bad. After reading the numerous extremely positive reviews here, and seeing the prestigious rewards it received, I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have any of these characteristics. Both the characters and the plot are extremely preposterous and even laughable at some places.<br/><br/>Imagine how disappointed I am right now, to sit at 1 am and to start writing my first review ever after years of membership at IMDb.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is horrible. Even TV series have more believable ""investigations"". Finding a killer after watching a few pictures in an old family album? Seriously? Hey what's wrong and so suspicious in admiring a beautiful girl you know from your childhood that makes you a murder suspect? Okay lets put this aside. So our murder suspect writes barely understandable coded letters to his mothers, containing the names of his favorite football players. Who does that? And a few drunks in a bar decode them and here the main characters catch the suspect right away at the next football game on a stadium with thousands of people. Just like that - as soon as they arrive there. Then, how do you get a confession from him? Easy. Get your boss, a beautiful woman, to tell him that his penis is small. There you go, he puts off his pants and shows her she's wrong and also confesses the murder. Piece of cake.<br/><br/>?!<br/><br/>I won't continue with the plot, because I already wasted too much time with this pretentious piece of crap.<br/><br/>Hey but who cares if the story is believable if you have strong characters! Right? Characters are what drive a good drama.<br/><br/>Well sorry, but this movie does not have such.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are not believable at all, except for the rape victim, but she didn't have the chance to prove the opposite. It is not clear what drove the main character to suddenly be so obsessed with the case. At the beginning he didn't want the rape/murder case. But when he saw her, the beautiful young naked body on the floor, he so suddenly changed, that I thought he knew her. That she's his ex-lover, or even... daughter. But she was none of these. Probably he loved her post mortem after seeing her incredible eyes. It was his specialty, yes? But the worst character in this joke was the victim's ""loving"" husband, who's acting was so misleading that I believed till the end that he was the one that raped and killed her. And no, I couldn't read the love in his eyes. There was no love in his eyes, as there was no suffering too.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the most boring, character-less and preposterous crap I've ever seen. And I wouldn't spend the time to write a review if it wasn't so extremely overrated. I can not justify any of the positive reviews and even less the rewards it got.<br/><br/>Don't force yourself to like it as I did while watching it. The error is not in you.<br/><br/>There're so many good films out there."

","The over-the-top praise for this film is mystifying. The characters and their motivations range from juvenile to incredible, the pace is tendentious, the writing is banal. The actors do as good a job as they can with a poor script and the cinematography is certainly watchable, though I have no sense of having been to Buenos Aires.<br/><br/>It's simply not possible to suspend your disbelief to the point where you can accept the premises or characters in this film. The trouble Esposito and Irene have communicating with each other is something most people overcome by junior high school, even given that class distinctions in Argentina in that period are probably stricter than here. The reaction of the husband, Morales, from beginning to end is close to fantasy, and as for the way Esposito and Sandoval track down the suspected perp -- preposterous.<br/><br/>So this won an Academy Award and an 8.3 rating at IMDb? What an example of groupthink."

Surprisingly, the ratings were very high, but the movie is dull. There is only one thrilling moment in the entire movie.

Er, OK you've lost me already. Where would we find this murder suspect? Why not pop along to the football stadium, we're sure to spot him in a crowd of only 20,000 or so. There he is! Quick! <br/><br/>Now we have him in custody, let's get a confession out of him, we have 6 minutes. Done deal! Next! <br/><br/>The relationships between the protagonists are frankly juvenile. The film is an insult to one's intelligence and if it had been made in USA starring - say - Bruce Willis, it would have been pure B list fodder.<br/><br/>It's too long as well, and the music made me want to eat my own fingers.

As a junior lawyer, Irene's skills and her character stole my heart. But even when I get older this movie will remain as my top 5. 
I might be too romantic, but I am left with thought that the movie took its name not from the eyes of Gomez staring at his victim on group photos, but from the way Irene and Benjamin lovingly look at each other.

"oggybleacher","9","3","3","3 September 2018"," The Missing 'A'
","So many details to enjoy from this movie that multiple viewings give reward. There is a deliberate disjointed time continuity narrative with foreshadowing that at first seems like it is happening in real time but one later realizes it is a flashback to a point in time that one of the narrative timelines has not yet reached. So one must pay attention. What I loved most is the directorial and editing approach that does not bounce around. The elevator scene, for example, is a single, agonizing, suspenseful cut. There are many single, long scenes where there are no arbitrary close ups or nonsense editing to relieve the actors of the job of acting for more than 4 seconds. The actors are acting even when they don't have a line and the director knows this so includes them in the scene. Hollywood has cursed our attention span so, that's the part I appreciate most, the ability to watch a scene unfold for minutes on end with quality script and the characters always acting their character. It's a tight script with what might seem like frivolous details all wrap around and become important in one way or another...many facets, a crime story with romantic intrigue and political complications. Even futbol is given a nod! Very good performances from everyone, even the out-of-focus court aides/interns who are treated like dirt as a rule and casually go about their business. The missing 'A' motif is brilliant. Watch again and again, like Silence of The Lambs. Even though I know the climax the dialogue is so enjoyable and the approach is so mature that I will always enjoy this movie. Bravisimo!"
"classicsoncall","10","3","3","21 November 2017"," ""How do you live a life full of nothing?""
","This is only the second Argentinian movie I've seen, both within the past week (the other was ""Wild Tales""), and so far I'm batting a thousand by picking two immensely satisfying films. I was reading some of the negative reviews and I had to laugh, more than one stated that the ending was completely predictable. Yeah right, like anyone could foresee that Morales would kidnap the guy who murdered his wife and keep him a prisoner for twenty five years. Come on, nobody could see that coming.<br/><br/>At least not ahead of time. After the fact, when you start putting two and two together, along with the picture's title, one is able to come to grips with the idea that Morales wouldn't let things go the way the corrupt district Judge Romano (Mariano Argento) did, and would relentlessly pursue his side of the case, in the same manner legal counselor Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) did on his. So much of the story depended on the concept that 'The eyes speak', and in more ways than one. It's what trapped the killer and what gave away the feelings between Esposito and his supervisor Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil), even though that relationship went unrequited for more than two decades.<br/><br/>The scene that really floored me was when Irene and Esposito began interrogating Isidoro Gomez (Javier Godino). I'm not entirely convinced that what Ms. Hastings did was ethical or not, but the way she demeaned Gomez to make him crack was truly inspired. The man would have to have been deranged to expose himself like that in a law office, so you had a pretty good idea right there that the guy wasn't playing with a full deck. The fact that he was released upon executive order is one of those things that makes one see red in any kind of movie, and inspires that much more contempt of the justice system.<br/><br/>All the while of course, one wonders why Esposito could never reveal his true feelings and intentions with Ms. Hastings. He came close a couple of times, and it looked like she was willing to reciprocate, but those frustrating moments dissolved into just another distraction. I was ready to give it up for lost until the very last scene when Irene told Benjamin that 'it would be difficult'. It leaves the viewer a bit conflicted because the woman had a husband and family that she was going to compromise, something that she and Esposito had done for the last twenty five years."

You get a real feel for the characters, city and underlying corruption that permeates the film and makes you feel uneasy throughout. There is also a real insight into the smarter side of Buenos Aires life with stylish bars, restaurants and a culture of humour not unlike the British. I am told by my Venezuelan fiancée that the Argentinians are renown for their sense of humour in Latin America.

","Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, The Secret in Their Eyes (also known as El secreto de sus ojos) is an ingeniously crafted mystery thriller from Argentina that grabs the viewers attention from the beginning, keeps their gaze firmly transfixed on the screen with its gripping plot, quality direction & compelling characters, and is one of the finest offerings in world cinema today that deserves a much broader audience.<br/><br/>The Secret in Their Eyes tells the story of a retired legal counsellor who is planning to write his first novel and chooses a quarter century old case he worked on as his source material. The plot then interweaves two story lines, first covering the case itself which was about the brutal rape & murder of a young girl while the second follows the buried romance between him & his superior, both of whom worked on the case together and are still haunted by it.<br/><br/>Co-written, produced, directed & edited by Juan José Campanella, The Secret in Their Eyes is intelligently crafted from start to finish for it brims with multiple layers which unravel itself steadily as the plot progresses and also manages to throw a few surprising twists along the road. Campanella excels in both writing & direction for the plot is highly engrossing, the arc of the characters inhabiting this story is brilliantly handled, and the tense political ambiance in Argentina during the mid-1970s is finely illustrated.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are no slouch and is carried out in an effective manner. The splendid use of camera, clever placements & controlled movements, in addition to the warm colour palette provide its narrative a rich, refined look which also fits the timeline its story is set in. The pacing is consistent throughout its 129 minutes of runtime. VFX is rarely noticeable yet its seamless fusion with the film's thoughtful camera-work & clever editing is responsible for a jaw-dropping sequence that would easily go down as one of the greatest scenes ever filmed.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Secret in Their Eyes features a committed cast in Ricardo Darín, Soledad Villamil, Guillermo Francella, Pablo Rago & others, and all of them are terrific in their given roles. What further helps their performance is that the characters they're given to play aren't weightless and their arcs are wonderfully fleshed out. Darín delivers the finest performance of them all, his chemistry with both Villamil & Francella is spot-on who provide amazing supporting work in their respective roles of his superior & assistant, while Rago is able to leave his mark as the film nears its conclusion.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Secret in Their Eyes is a masterwork of sophisticated filmmaking that triumphs in nearly all departments to work as an entertaining & enthralling example of its genre(s) and beautifully portrays the fear, vulnerability & flaws of its scripted characters on the film canvas. Covering the themes of love, loss, vengeance & corruption and further uplifted by its assured direction, impeccable script & honest performances, The Secret in Their Eyes is a remarkable film that effortlessly lives up to its reputation and is absolutely deserving of all the accolades it has garnered. A modern classic, this Argentine masterpiece comes strongly recommended."
"nicolechan916","9","3","3","12 November 2015"," Thrilling acting, cinematography and editing.
","The story is incredibly told with great editing, directing, cinematography and acting. Starting out like a normal crime film, the movie juxtaposes the present with those of the past, and along with Benjamin, the audience recounts the past through his memories. It gets more and more complex, as when a suspect is found, what seems to be the end turns out to be the beginning of a mystery. The film also displays the corruption within the legal system, and the battle between evil and good, with Benjamin being the embodiment of morality. <br/><br/>The acting as well is great. The connection and chemistry between both Darin and Villamil, and Darin and Francella is sweet. The film aggravates the audience by showing that both Benjamin and Irene love each other, but nothing is done about it. Similarly, there is a bromance between Benjamin and Sandoval that is touching, but heartbreaking when the relationship is broken. Rago and Godino both do a great job at showcasing their characters emotions and expressions. <br/><br/>What really stood out for me is the cinematography and editing. The camera moves with such fluidity across spaces that it often makes me wonder how they did it. For instance, there is a scene in a football stadium and in one continuous shot, the camera goes from a birds eye view to a close up of the characters in the stadium. I am thinking that perhaps they used a drone which is pretty impressive. Similarly, the camera work in chase scenes are just incredible, everything form the shot placement to the composition and movement. Additionally, the editing is on par with the cinematography. There are multiple scenes that do not depict what actually took place but is more of a 'preview' into other possibilities of the story. I found this to be very impactful as it disorients you and makes you think about the story more closely. It could be confusing at times though, so it is both a positive and a negative for me.<br/><br/>Overall a phenomenal film that tells an incredible story with great acting, cinematography and editing. Only thing is that it is a bit slow at times, but the ending is just chilling. <br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

"Chris_Docker","9","5","6","28 June 2010"," A long time in the unravelling
","The Secret in their Eyes is a tale of undeclared love, laced in a complex murder mystery that spans 25 years. The details are so densely packed that I almost would have nodded off had its beauty and skill in the telling not kept me shocked in wakefulness. It is a story of remembering. And how that act of remembering can change the present. What is that timeless quality that we sometimes see in a person's eyes? A look that can hold maybe more than anything, and how it can arrest our thought as they travel a sea of faces; a torrent of years. If they 'express the inexpressible,' is there a reason that stops the lips from forming the words? And if that barrier could be removed?<br/><br/>Beating such notable competition as Haneke's White Ribbon for the coveted Foreign Language Film Oscar was no small task. That the Secret in Their Eyes fathoms profound emotions (for want of a better word!) perhaps goes some way to explain its appeal.<br/><br/>Benjamín Espósito has been employed by the criminal court all working his life. Now entering retirement, he begins writing a novel. The story will be that of a tragic case he once investigated, the brutal rape and murder of a beautiful woman. The legal system in Argentina is not free of corruption but still a highly developed one. The court secretary, Irene Menéndez Hastings, is Benjamin's immediate superior. He is secretly in love with her, but she is far above his social station and he has no hope of being together with her. As he writes the novel, he goes back over events. Including his unfulfilled relationship with the woman he is still in love with after all this time. A love of justice propels the movie forward but at a pace that accepts some things can take a lifetime. Or a single moment.<br/><br/>The murder case is far from simple, even with Benjamin and Irene's pooled determination. Benjamin looks back on his life seeking meaning. Both in his own relationships and lack of them, and in the small successes (but greater failures) that accompanied the investigation. As he replays his memories will he be able to re-write his future? Or are there things to which his eyes will forever remain closed? Juan José Campanella's two hour film can occasionally seem affected. But as anyone who has visited can confess, that is true of life in Buenos Aires today anyway. It is still the bastion of European manners from a bygone age and The Secret in Their Eyes sometimes feels like a period piece (even though the film is set in 1974 to 2000). The subtleties of gentlemanly flirtation, the delicacies of social interaction, they present a careful, often unhurried formality through which we must finesse our way with perseverance and appreciation of good taste. We delicately unpick the knotted past so that it does not reap problems for our futures. Does the real life we have lead reflect our inner life and turmoils? The other way round? Or are they not connected? Memory is a powerful thing and can knit together more than just our imagination, our hopes, dreams, and insights. There are clues we have maybe failed to acknowledge. Through stupidity or 'blindness.' And what are the secrets? How do we see them as they really are; spot the clues before our eyes? One secret it's cracked is box-office success. The Secrets of Their Eyes is already a blockbuster in Argentina and enjoying huge triumphs at international festivals. It will probably be one of those 'timeless classics,' as they say."
"thesubstream","9","8","11","24 April 2010"," It's classic retro mystery film-making, made with an incredible eye for atmospheric detail
","El secreto de sus ojos (The Secret in Their Eyes), director Juan José Campanella's pot-boiling mystery romance, comes to North America loaded with the freight-load of expectation. Earlier this year the picture picked up the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, to some surprise, as it beat out two films everyone assumed were duking it amongst themselves: Michael Haneke's Das Weisse Band and Jaques Audiard's Un prophète, two absolutely astonishingly good films.<br/><br/>The bad news is that Campanella's film is not as good as Haneke's and Audiards are, but the good news is that it's a close-run thing. While Haneke and Audiard work at the outer limits of biggish-budget narrative film-making - coldly documenting the roots of fascism in the pettiness and cruelty of village life in 1910's Germany in the case of the former and grittily, violently exploring the tension between Arab and Corsican inmates in a Parisan prison in the latter - Campanella's film is old fashioned. Charmingly so, in fact.<br/><br/>Argentinian superstar Ricardo Darín plays federal justice agent Benjamín Espósito. Set partly in 1999 and partly in 1974, the film follows Espósito as he tries to complete a novel about a case that he had undertaken 25 years earlier, with the help of his alcoholic assistant Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and ivy-league educated boss, Irene (Soledad Villamil). As the three investigate the case - the brutal rape and murder of a young woman - they must not only piece together enough evidence to find the killer, but also deal with Argentina's slide into political violence under Isabel Perón, a widow with his own agenda and a budding, impossible romance.<br/><br/>It's classic retro mystery film-making, made with an incredible eye for atmospheric detail, made by people talented enough to create suspense and old-fashioned thrills without having to resort to cheap action-movie shootouts. It's occasionally corny and often melodramatic, but it is stacked top to bottom with great performances - comedian Francella as the heroically dissolute Sandoval chief among them - and a script that takes us and the trio from authentic-seeming 1974 Buenos Aires dive bars to a riotous football match, from the paper-jammed offices of a well-meaning judge to the gleaming polished wood of a fascist, scheming operative. It succeeds because of its occasional corniness, because packaged along with everything else that the film does so well it doesn't offend, it just seems pleasant, and old fashioned and warm, an entertaining reminder of how un-glitzy, un-rock and roll mystery film-making used - and still can - be. 8.8/10"

","This film is simply extraordinary, it has the building blocks of the great classical works: passion and sensitivity. What I felt throughout the film was curious and engaging, I was wrapped in an original and unprecedented dimension, as juxtaposed brush strokes cleverly intertwined into different layers, which have different stories each with its particular logic, and which inevitably come together and engage in this powerful and subtle work. Finally one has the sensation of floating in a world that is neither our daily reality nor the story one has seen. Such is the creativity that the insight revealed feels natural and unpretentious. It connects us to a mysterious part of ourselves . Someone described it as poetic thriller is more than that, is a huge breath of life, told from a place touched by creative grace.

","Are you in the mood for a well written,directed & acted drama,with a hint of romance & intrigue? You can't do much better than 'El secreto de sus ojos' (released in English speaking countries as 'The Secret In Their Eyes'),a film that was Argentina's entry for the Academy Awards for best film from that country. It tells the story of a retired defense attorney (Benjamin Esposito,played by the fine Argentine actor,Ricardo Darin,of 'XXY',and 'Nine Queens'fame) who is writing his memoirs,in hopes of turning them into a book. When he becomes interested in trying to re-open the case of a brutal rape/murder,he goes to his former employer for leads (Irene Menendez-Hastings,played by Soledad Villamil). What Benjamin discovers is lost feelings he felt for Irene). Cutting back & forth in time,we see stories of the young Benjamin & Irene working for the same government law firm,and the ups & downs of the law profession in 1970's Argentina,during their dirty war,which is never mentioned. This is a smart,well written screenplay (by the film's director,Juan Jose Campanella,mostly known for his work in both Argentinian,as well as American television,and Eduardo Sacheri,from the novel by Sacheri). Besides the above mentioned cast,the film also features Pablo Rago,Javier Godino,Barbara Palladino,Rudy Romano & Juan Jose Ortiz. Juan Jose Campanella wears three hats as director,co-writer & film editor. The film's lush cinematography is by Felix Monti. This is bravura film making for thinking persons who demand more from film than just car chases,explosions,fart jokes & other mindless droppings from Hollywood. Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains some strong language,flashes of an unpleasant rape scene,nudity & bloody violence"

Soledad Villamil gives a convincing, moving and at the same time classy performance as Irene Hastings. <br/><br/>The most memorable scene is of course the five-minute-long shot of the suspect being chased inside the football stadium. It takes no expert to observe the technical expertise shown here. <br/><br/>The political context of the movie is easily comprehensible even for people not familiar with contemporary Argentinian history. After all this is not a historical documentary, nor a cinematographic study on the peronist period, but a touching tale of love, friendship, memory, passion and revenge.

Its nonlinear narrative trajectory and perfect execution of its story/ plot should be watched by all even in an educational sense.

Both Ricardo Darin and Pablo Rago give strong performances as two different men afflicted by the same turn of events whilst the roles of the film's supporting cast, such as Soledad Villemil, Guillermo Francella and Javier Godino, all contribute emotional dexterity to an already layered film.

"Coventry","9","4","5","1 June 2015"," True romance is about  suffering
","I was curious and intrigued, but mostly skeptical when I first read the brief description of ""The Secret in their Eyes"" in a TV- magazine. It stated: ""a romantic thriller about the unresolved rape and murder case of a beautiful girl 25 years ago"". Huh? How can a thriller, especially one dealing with such painful topics like rape and murder, be romantic? And yet, the description is 100% accurate and truthful. This harsh thriller is simultaneously one of the most emotional stories that I ever witnessed and it's romantic at no less than three different levels! There's the obvious but oppressed romance between lead character Benjamin Esposito and his court superior Irene Hastings, and then there's also the more convoluted but undeniably romantic devotion that widower Ricardo Morales shows for his murdered wife and the perverted (but yet somehow romantic) motive of culprit Isidoro Gómez for committing the inhuman crime. One things for sure, ""The Secret in their Eyes"" is one of the most absorbing, beautiful and unforgettable films of the new millennium. I was wondering how on earth it could be possible that Michael Haneke's masterful ""The White Ribbon"" didn't win the Oscar for best foreign film for 2009, but now it makes perfect sense. Those people at the Academy were more than right to award this film instead! ""The Secret in their Eyes"" deserves every price that it won and it also deserves to be seen by as many people as humanly possible! <br/><br/>In 1974, the beautiful and lovable Liliana Coloto is found brutally raped and murdered by someone that she obviously must have known and trusted. The crime is so vile and shocking that it even silences the experienced court room counselor Benjamin Esposito. With the help of his alcoholic but brilliant colleague Sandoval and his new supervisor Irene, whom he's desperately in love with, Esposito identifies the unmistakable culprit and promises Liliana's grieving widower Ricardo that he will spend the rest of his life in jail. But the assumed killer is released shortly after due to internal courtroom corruption and personal vendettas and Esposito narrowly survives an assassination attempt. 25 years later, the retired Esposito travels back to Buenos Aires with the intention of writing a novel about this case that altered his life. He goes to see Irene Hastings, who built out an impressive career over the years, and notices that his old feelings are still as strong and irresistible as before. In all honesty, the more you contemplate about the plot and analyze the events afterwards, the less plausible and realistic ""The Secret in their Eyes"" becomes. And yet, for once this doesn't matter because you are so moved by the story and feel so much sympathy for the main characters that you'll gladly overlook any flaws that only come to the surface later. Apart from the story and the unique mixture of styles and genres, there are two other aspects that make this film a genuine masterpiece, namely the acting performances and the cinematography. Regarding the acting, being a European I don't know any of the actors and actresses in this film, but they surely all made a big impression on me. The camera work by Félix Monti is stupendous, with various great sequences in which he achieved beautiful effects through reflection (in mirrors or windows) and extended pan-images."

","I have commended on films that seem flawless and remarkable before.

Not to mention, it accomplished some of the most original yet beautifully memorable shots, i.e. the chase scene, the court scene (one of the best crime-solving feat i have seen in a while).

","What's this - ten stars for a movie in which the most vital turning point appears completely out of left field!? Gomez rapes and murders a young woman in the most brutal and sadistic way imaginable but because he is useful to the political regime as an informer, he is released!!! For non-Argentinian viewers, the time (1970s) in which this horrendous crime was committed was barely touched upon thereby providing no context for the later release of the prisoner. This is a HUGE weakness in an other wise well-produced movie. For me, from this glaringly incredulous stage of the plot, I struggled to maintain interest.<br/><br/>I must also say that the evasive romantic links between the two major characters seemed a bit trite. Do normal adults behave so? Very wimpish and immature was how their attempts at expressing their feelings came across to me.<br/><br/>Hardly worthy of an Oscar nomination let alone being declared the winner."
"MartinHafer","8","6","9","11 September 2013"," Good, but I think it's a bit overrated.
","""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a very good film--I don't in any way deny this. However, given that the film is in IMDb's Top 250 List, that it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and is currently rated much higher than ""The official Story"" (the other Argentinian film that has won the Oscar), I really expected more. Now you cannot blame the film but sometimes such high expectations set the viewer up to be disappointed...and I was to a certain extent. But, I still recommend you see it.<br/><br/>The story begins with a retired investigator struggling with a story he's been working on for years. He's been trying to write the story of his most perplexing and haunting cases--the senseless murder and rape of a young lady. What follows is a film where the story bounces back and forth over a 25 year period--from the present to the days when the case first began. Interestingly, the story (like the film ""The Official Story"") also is an indictment of the corruption of the Argentinian government of the 70s, as the identity of the perpetrator actually is eventually determined--but justice, it seems, is never to be.<br/><br/>The best things about the film are the acting as well as the wonderful ending. While I did guess the ending, it still was very, very satisfying to see. My only reservation is that this is a VERY adult film. Not only does it show a rape occurring (though it was done tastefully and respectfully), but you see a very nude corpse as well as a man dropping his pants to reveal his penis. It's certainly not the sort of thing you'd normally show your kids, your mother-in-law or Father Jenkins when he stops by for a friendly visit. Additionally, while the film is quite interesting, it never seemed great--like a must-see film and you certainly would expect that with its 8.2 rating on IMDb."
"mywriter","10","6","9","7 June 2010"," Works on every level
","This is a film that makes movies cinema and makes cinema literature: simply put, it works on every level. The character development is engaging and developed within an excellent narrative structure as well as being buttressed by fine performances from each cast member, even the minor ones. The viewer is engrossed, and much like ""Chariots of Fire"" or ""The Lives of Others,"" I felt like I was eavesdropping on people's lives rather than watching a collection of actors portray people. Then there was the directing, which features one scene (I won't say but you'll know it when you see it) that is as good as anything that Hitchcock ever did in building tension. The only complaint I've heard is that the middle moves too slowly, but I reject that: even if one concedes that, the information provided was essential to the final outcome, a close that puts this story on the same level as ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" Good stuff."
"rinoa-3","7","6","9","3 June 2010"," Definitely NOT a waste of time, but there was potential for more
","I must confess I was slightly disappointed. This film starts off great: a good premise, well-rounded characters and more than decent directing, all wrapped up in a wonderful mixed atmosphere of the ""drama"" and ""crime"" genres -- to sum it up, it strikes up your interest immediately, and is both friendly and captivatingly serious from the start. However, for most of its runtime from then on, ""El secreto de sus ojos"" feels both cheesy and pointless, presenting the murder case as (presumably) solved and focusing way too much on the seemingly eternal (yet never consummated) romantic attraction between the male and female protagonist. It's not that it gets boring; it just loses its focus for a little too long, and, not being a fan of the ""romance"" genre, I'll admit this bothered me.<br/><br/>Still, this film has a respectable amount of both hilarious and shocking scenes, and considerably redeems itself with its unexpected, twisted ending (I mean the part relating to the murder case, not the, once again, horribly cheesy romantic part), which will definitely have you curious for a while and then leave you thinking. Overall, I'd describe this picture as having great potential to be extraordinary, but ultimately failing to completely live up to it, not meeting certain expectations and becoming, for too big a part of it, ordinary. With that said, and while I was, all in all, disappointed, I still urge people to go see this movie -- it's much better than most of the girly vampires/dancing crap out there these days, anyway."

But I popped it in anyway, figuring out of all my options I'd hate it the least.<br/><br/>Right from the first scene I knew this film had something important to say. And I'm not just talking about some canned socio-political cliché that wins many Best Foreign Film Academy Awards. This movie has an important personal message to tell, and it's woven into the story in a very careful way.<br/><br/>The trailer, as well as a lot of exuberant film critics, make this sound like a tense action packed thrill ride, but it's not. Even better, it's a quiet, human, often comedic tale that happens to have some great elements of ""thriller"" and ""mystery"" and ""romance"" without falling squarely into any of those predictable categories. In a sentence, the plot is about a retired court employee who, unable to forget a murder case from 25 years earlier, decides to write a book about it and thus dig up some old ghosts.<br/><br/>Yes, if handled like a John Grisham thriller, it could have fallen into a standard Hollywood formula, but in the expert hands of director Juan José Campanella (quite respected in his home country of Argentina but not yet as famous in the USA), the film balances itself as a thoughtful yet very engaging statement about human nature. I am reminded of another excellent award winner from the same year 2009, ""Five Minutes of Heaven"", a UK film that similarly focuses on a crime decades past and how different characters have been affected by the passing of time.<br/><br/>But what made ""The Secret in their Eyes"" even more interesting to me is the way it's not necessarily about a past crime, but it's also applied to past love, past opportunities and past (and present) obsessions. As a great line in the film goes: ""A man can change his appearance, his job, his god. But he can't change his passion."" Thus the theme is stated: this is about letting go, or not letting go. And whether we're talking about crime, justice, love or dreams, we can all relate.<br/><br/>I have to mention one thing with regard to the cinematography & visual presentation. This is the sort of movie that cinema geeks will love, and so will average people just looking for entertainment. Certain scenes are so expertly handled, yet not obnoxiously artsy, that you can't help but get swept up in them. For example, perhaps the crowning achievement is the ""stadium scene"" which is a 5-minute, uninterrupted shot that begins a mile in the air above a stadium before gliding over the field, into the stands, to a dialogue between two characters, then following behind them on a tense scene running through the stadium floors, into a bathroom, over a ledge(!), through some more twists, then back to the field ALL IN ONE CAMERA SHOT. Certainly it was edited to appear like one shot but it's seamless. Fans of Orson Welles' famous ""Touch of Evil"" opening scene (which itself takes us through the streets of a Mexican city in a brilliantly orchestrated 5-minute single shot) will love this sort of stuff.<br/><br/>If you have the opportunity to see this movie, whether or not you find yourself in a cranky mood like I was, don't pass it up. Last note about content warnings: there's a disturbing rape scene right near the beginning with some nudity and blood, one or two bloody but tasteful scenes, then there's a somewhat eyebrow raising (yet necessary) scene of frontal man parts. But if you, your kids and/or your puritanical parents can handle those, the film is OK for everyone. Since this is a non-USA film where animal cruelty laws don't necessarily apply, I thought I'd mention there is no animal cruelty, whether simulated or real. This is a great film which, I believe, demonstrates the finest of modern Argentinian cinema."

It is a love story, crime, historical facts and friendship, all in one. It is easy to see and it easier to remember. Also the movie has very good dialogues.

","Oh, there are questions all right? Plenty of questions about what really happened? There will be answers, too, and they will be satisfying and maybe, even huge revelations to fit this epic drama, where people express themselves openly, and yet their own emotions take backstage to the drama of others, just like we forget we're watching a film and surrender ourselves to its hypnotic and bewitching power.<br/><br/>Set in a bureaucratic world where who you know will open doors and determine the safety of your future, a couple is in the middle of a drama which originates when a young and beautiful woman is brutally murdered. As the investigation proceeds, emotions grow, and in a perfect, isolated world, things would turn out easier. What develops is a messy situation where everyone becomes more and more frustrated because this world after all, is not forgiving or perfect, and sometimes justice is nothing else but a name or a word with not really weight.<br/><br/>As the onion layers are peeled, and we know more and more about what really happened in the drama that spans for 25 years, we discover that love is such a powerful force that it refuses to die, but it's not infallible and it's pretty confusing. There are after all, social classes, political mazes, and personal vendettas to block the road for our hero and heroine. There are also many fantastic pieces of dialog, and some very realistic recreations of what working in a government entity is like. As one of the main characters states: ""It's my life, live yours."" It's easy to be overwhelmed by the drama of others, especially if we get too close to the source of the mess.<br/><br/>This film deservedly won many accolades, and in one of those rare moments, was fairly recognized with the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Its two closest contenders would have made the Top 10 Best Picture list a better indicator of films with better craftsmanship, storytelling, and the true magic of a great film. I had a tough time choosing between ""The White Ribbon"" and ""The Prophet"". They're great films; yet there is something powerful and very touching at the heart of this movie, something that connects with our human needs, and that elevates the film a bit higher than the other films. One will gasp at the end of the final scene, one that summarizes the message of ""The Secret of Their Eyes"", an appropriate title if I ever saw one.<br/><br/>This film is not perfect; its length is a bit of a problem, but it's got epic feelings, classic moments, and a very satisfying conclusion, a moment that cinephiles around the world will recognize and embrace. Maybe because they don't make them like these anymore, certainly American studios don't put them out as much anymore..."

","A retired Argentinian federal agent writes a book based on his recollections of a 25-year old unsolved murder case. Darin and Villamil give good performances as government co-workers whose relationship is fraught with unconsummated sexual tension. It is an intriguing story, but the execution is sloppy. There are too many loose ends and the plot elements pertaining to the murder suspect are so ludicrously contrived in terms of how he is targeted, caught, and convicted that it's hard to take this film seriously.

","Catching up on Oscar-caliber films which I have yet to watch, I stumble upon this Argentinian crime-drama, a fair upsetter won BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM over more critically acclaimed THE WHITE RIBBON (2009, 8/10) and A PROPHET (2009, 9/10), in its own strength, THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES is a powerful and near-perfect dissection on how people are stuck in the prison of their own memories, ""you will end up with only memories"" is a vital sentence imprinted deeply in audience's mind. <br/><br/>In 1999, a retired legal counselor Benjamín Esposito (Darín) visits his former chief Irene (Villamil), with whom he is secretly in love for over 20 years, Benjamín tells her that he decides to write a novel about the horrendous rape-and-murder case of Liliana Coloto (Quevedo) in 1974, which would subsequently prompt him to leave both his job and Irene, in parallel, the film recounts how Benjamín and his drunkard parter Pablo Sandoval (Francella) traced down the suspect Isidoro Gómez (Godino), but thanks to the iniquitous loophole in the law system, the murderer got away with life sentence and became a threat to Benjamín's personal safety; alternately, it narratives the latest updates of the rekindled romance between Benjamín and Irene, until a final unforeseen discovery of Isidoro's whereabout, it is never easy to acquire a closure in regard to one's troubled past.<br/><br/>Majestically directed by Argentinian director Juan José Campanella, who studied film in New York University and is a regular hand in TV series (HOUSE M.D., LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT, and HALT AND CATCH FIRE), this film is his 5th feature, Campanella fabricates a slow-paced, reality-and-imagination entwined narrative under a retro palette, patiently builds up personae with rigid framing-compositions and intricate editing, often collates the two time-lines with subtle indications which intrigue multiple viewings. He and the DP Félix Monti have accomplished a brilliant long take (with superbly imperceptible editing sleight of hand) which starts from a hovering airborne shot of the stadium and authentically records the entire activity, from Benjamín and Pablo spot Isidoro among a full-packed stadium during an ongoing football match, to the subsequent cat-and-mouse chase until the suspect is captured, it exemplifies the fly-on-the-wall intensity and altogether it runs more than 5 minutes, which can blow any cinephile's mind.<br/><br/>Indeed, apart from its formalistic artery as a hefty CSI-styled chronicler, another amazingly satisfying deed is the suspense, not all over the place but when it approaches to the crunches, the edge-of-the-seat feeling accumulates and the suspense becomes grippingly pervasive, namely, the two most appalling findings in the film (one abrupt death and another is the revealing of the truth), both grimly under-lit and the effect is soul-crunching. <br/><br/>The picture is also abounding with top-notch performances, Darín and Villamil, bring about strong affinity in-between the 25-years time span, both render their feelings with indelible restraint, the shut-the-door metaphor keeps their unspoken connotations up and running. Guillermo Francella is the scene-stealing sidekick with an offbeat personality, not only he addresses cogently the pinpointed theory about man's invariable passion, his heroic act comes as resounding and pathos-inducing as well, what's more enticing, we don't know whether it is the real happening or the creation of Benjamín's wishful thinking. Pablo Rago, who plays Liliana's grieved husband Ricardo, carries the responsibility of being the linchpin in the plot as another prisoner of a traumatized past, and he also pulls off what Benjamín claims ""the purest love he has ever seen"", all four are in my top-10 line-up of 2009, although I push Villamil in the supporting group since almost all her scenes are with Darín, her side of story never laid bare and she is mostly absent in Darín's investigation procedure. <br/><br/>From ""temo"" to ""te amo"", it is a creatively designed wordplay for Benjamín's life-consuming odyssey to find his missing ""a"", Juan José Campanella commands a humanized brush to retouch a cautionary tale embedded with harrowing profundity and self-reflected sobriety, an outstanding piece of cinema, by all means."

"nesfilmreviews","8","3","4","3 February 2013"," A wonderful, richly layered mystery.
","""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is directed by Juan José Campanella--it is a splendid multifaceted film which skillfully alternates between the present and past, as it seamlessly intertwines a murder mystery, love story, and judicial injustice. All of these elements of the story are flushed-out--creating depth, and all play a crucial part in Juan José Campanella's adaptation of Eduardo Sacheri's novel. A film that effectively juggles both affection and misery, using Benjamin's conflicted heart as a way to humanize the chilling details, while observing a man not only starved for justice, but after a woman he abandoned decades earlier. Benjamín (Ricardo Darín), a retired court investigator, is trying to write a novel about an old case of his that was never resolved to his satisfaction. More than two decades ago, a woman was brutally raped and murdered, and although suspects were found, the case against them was thrown out on technical grounds. However, Benjamín always suspected someone else entirely. Benjamín and his assistant Pablo Rago (Ricardo Morles), ultimately were certain that a man named Isidoro Gómez was the real killer. For help, he returns to his old office and bounces his thoughts off Irene (Soledad Villamil), whom he has always loved despite never acting on those feelings. The past and the present begin to merge as pieces of the case are re-investigated, forcing Benjamín to reflect on his past, and what could have been. But Benjamín's search for the truth will put him at the center of a judicial nightmare, as the mystery of the heinous crime committed 25 years ago continues to haunt him in the present. Interweaving past and present, we see how the investigation affects Benjamín, as well as Irene, over the period of decades. Stealthily weaving Esposito's relationship with Irene into the on-going murder mystery, it takes on a life of it's own--a compulsive narrative that manages to be genuinely surprising. Haunting and gracefully, the film reveals its secrets slowly. Lengthly, but engaging, wonderful storytelling, and extremely well-done. The entire cast is uniformly superb, enhancing this foreign thriller--with its intelligent, layered screenplay. Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film (2010). **This was a unpredicted and surprising winner of the Oscar. It beat out two great films also in contention that year. Respectively-- ""A Prophet"" and ""The White Ribbon."""

","""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was one of a small number of films that I was willing to take a chance on buying without seeing. I bought this DVD for 2 dollars from my local video shop which is closing(a whole different story, and a shame). The DVD looked like it had never been viewed.<br/><br/>I love foreign film. I think it's a real escape from the Hollywood trash that's coming out of late, and a truly great way to find some more obscure/under-viewed releases of the highest quality.<br/><br/>This is not a film for kids. The themes and the pacing are geared towards an adult audience. Not only that, but the films subtitles move at a break-neck pace. I sure wish I spoke the language so that I might be able to enjoy more of the visual style of this film. Maybe I'll watch it again dubbed. That's something I don't usually prefer, but this film might actually open-up to some viewers like myself if you/I do so.<br/><br/>The film really demands the audiences attention. It jumps back in forth in time, and the characters are rather candid and restrained. The story isn't all that confusing, but it's played out like backdrop, or something that's there, but not always the center of attention. I'm still not sure if I would classify this as more of a thriller, or a romance. It's rather uncomfortable to finally return to dialog-driven cinema. Let's face it - America has turned into a bunch of action-junkies.<br/><br/>I have the feeling that I'll raise this rating after a second viewing. This is definitely the type of film that divulges new and fascinating secrets with repeat viewings. Some people will watch this and never want to watch it again(many won't even make it to the halfway point), and then some will watch it five times to 'take it all in'.<br/><br/>This is a ""heavy"" film.<br/><br/>I wouldn't rent this(or buy it) unless you really have the time to sit down and concentrate on the film. The film is long and hard to follow for the first time viewer. If you take your attention away for one minute you'll feel lost in that weight. You probably won't have missed anything, but you'll want to rewind it and make sure.<br/><br/>I kind of feel like this film beat the crap out of me. The last time I got that feeling was after P.T. Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"". I think that is actually a really good comparison. Two totally different plots and time periods, but two crushingly powerful films.<br/><br/>Careful with this one!"

","Fantastic crime drama. It begins with Darin attempting to write a novel based on a case from long ago. It's been 25 years since the rape and brutal murder of a young woman. It was a case that just fizzled out after getting too hot. This film is filled with love, revenge and obsession. It plays out in a rich tapestry of events over time. The film prevails against most others due to Rago. He plays the loving husband of the victim. He becomes obsessed with catching the killer, not to kill him, but to make him serve his time. With so many violent revenge fantasies, it's great to finally see a character we can relate to. <br/><br/>The films wonderful story unravels, but does so with unique and satisfying scenes. The football stadium sees action and intrigue take center stage, whilst an elevator scene is sure to send chills through the viewer. The climax was so expertly handled I was giddy to see it all come together. It was an ending that you do see coming, but not so early on that it ruins the film. It also had me contemplating on the nature of good and evil, and punishment itself. It was satisfying, but also made me feel a little cold. An overall excellent film that I can't wait to watch again."

"Manal1987","8","3","4","7 May 2011"," Why didn't I see that before?!!
","Ironically enough, the problem with non-Hollywoodian movies is that you never get to know them unless they win some kind of a top-notch 'Hollywoodian' award. I wonder how many other good non-American movies I've missed due to this monopolizing propaganda. The Secret in Their Eyes deservingly grabbed an Oscar for a Best Foreign Film in 2010. <br/><br/>The story of the movie is a quite simple, yet deep, one that touches upon the fine line connecting a love story with a homicide. Both being unfinished, they linger about Counselor Benjamin Esposito's (Darin) life and haunt his memories keeping him stuck in the past. What is really peculiar about this movie is that it delves deep into the most private human emotions: love, passion, loyalty, faithfulness, vengeance.. etc. It is also about the unflinching power of unreconciled memories that can take hold of our lives and control our future.<br/><br/>However, the film was not without shortcomings; the tempo was a little bit slow-paced and the events sometimes took some far-fetched turns. The cinematography and direction were outstanding, leaving you with some unforgettable scenes. Moreover, the screenplay was one of the wittiest I've ever seen. Without any exceptions whatsoever, and I totally mean it, the performance was epic! The cast did a great job bringing this heart-piercing story to life. A special kudos should go to Esposito's friend, Pablo Sandoval (Francella), for his smart, funny and witty Woody Allen-like performance."
"rmax304823","8","3","4","7 April 2011"," Very Nicely Executed Adult Murder Mystery.
","I'm glad they called this ""The Secret In Their Eyes"" because the director, Campanella, has filled the film with close ups of the faces of people who are mostly lying or manipulative. Happily, he has abjured the usual sickening fads -- the wobbling camera, the instantaneous cuts, the desaturated ghoulish pallet, the revolver held sideways, the two-gun shoot out, the inappropriate wisecracks.<br/><br/>Not that there aren't many exceedingly humorous moments sprinkled throughout the script, particularly in the first half. You have seen the detective too eager to solve the crime chewed out by his angry superior. Please don't trouble to deny it. You've seen it a thousand times. Often the miscreant is forced to hand over his piece and his shield. But you have never seen it done like this. I laughed all the way through it.<br/><br/>Esposito's new boss in the Justice Office, a stern woman named Hastings, is a recent graduate of Cornell which, high as it is above Cayuga's waters, suffers a climate that practically makes cheer illegal. She gets Esposito and his drunken partner Sandoval out of trouble, she tells him, by exercising her social skills, her charm, and her irresistible smile. Thoroughly reamed out, Esposito is about to leave her office but turns and asks humbly, with her permission, what ""irresistable smile"" is she talking about because he's never seen it.<br/><br/>All this humor is written with the understanding that the audience will get it and it's delivered in a manner consistent with an adult audience. The same isn't true of all the comedy. Esposito and Sandoval illegally examine a woman's house. She returns unexpectedly and they are chased outside by a furious but tiny short-haired dog. They dash out the door, the barking dog in hot pursuit. When they're out of sight, we hear a yelp, and see the dog running back in.<br/><br/>Well, one more example. His wife kicks out the drunken Sandoval and Esposito takes him into his apartment. Sandoval keeps stumbling into things. ""Too much furniture,"" he complains. When Esposito tries to call Sandoval's wife and explain things, he finds that there is no answer because Sandoval's phone has been broken for a year. Esposito decides to drive to Sandoval's house and get the wife. ""Why not phone her?"", asks Sandoval. Esposito: ""You just said your phone was broken."" A long pause and Sandoval replies with the logic of the inebriated, ""My phone IS broken, but yours isn't."" I don't want to get into the plot too much because it's complicated and has a couple of twists that no one could see coming. Some are, let's say, improbably. Having found that a murderer is a soccer fan, Esposito and Sandoval begin visiting games, which Esposito has no interest in. One game a week. Lo, on the fourth, they find themselves only a few seats away from the killer -- out of about 70,000 seats.<br/><br/>The acting could hardly be improved on. Esposito has a face that challenges disbelief. He's modest and completely trustworthy. Sandoval never overplays the drunkenness. Hastings, the boss back at the DA's office, is middle-aged, pretty, and not knock-out beautiful like a movie star. Romano, Esposito's rival who chews him out, is hilarious before he turns to the dark side.<br/><br/>Yes, it's true. You have to read the subtitles. And they're in the Argentine dialect too. But it's worth it. Everything about the film is admirable, including the photography and location shooting. Besides, you get to see what Buenos Aires looks like. It's arguably the most Europeanized city on the continent. And out in the boondocks, they drink mate. I believe you also get a glimpse of pampas grass, a fiendish growth that I had to fight weekly in my California back yard."
"paul2001sw-1","9","3","4","6 August 2010"," Truly brooding
","The splendid Ricardo Darin, star of the late great Fabien Bielinski's two movies, is back on fine form in this film. Superficially it's more conventional than Bielinski's films, being a straightforward story of a veteran (ex-) policeman who can't let his most interesting unsolved case lie. For sure, the plot is tricksy and there's evidence of corruption in high places; but this is all run-of-the-mill for this genre. What's unusual about this film is it's focus on character: the brooding hero is another stereotype, but Darin's character's relationship to his case is complex; the supporting cast are also great, and the sense of a life wasted, in part, because the hero's boldness in his job is not matched by a similar confidence in matters of the heart is well conveyed. The film is also superbly shot, there's a sequence filmed in a football stadium where the use of the camera to exploit the venue is frankly brilliant. Overall, I think that Bielinski's films with Darin were even better, but they also set a high bar; but 'The Secret in Their Eyes' certainly confirms his uncanny ability to shamble onto the screen and steal it completely."

He can't change his passion.""<br/><br/>'The Secret In Their Eyes' builds upon the very essence of life: a sequence of key moments that can completely change our destinies if we recognize them for what they are, held together by the long ordinary days in between where we don't feel remarkable enough to act. Yet its ultimate message is one of hope, while also challenging us to decide whether or not in certain situations revenge is justified. I am not normally a big fan of crime fiction, let alone romance, yet if 'The Secret In Their Eyes' was indicative of the way in which crime-romance cinema normally entertains, I'd have to jump the tracks and nail my colours to the mast. However, 'The Secret In Their Eyes' is simply a very good film, written and directed with confident maturity, populated with engaging characters expertly realized, and one that really makes you think long after the credits have rolled up into the screen.<br/><br/>As the 20th Century draws to a close, retired federal justice agent Benjamin Esposito decides to fictionalise an especially memorable case from his younger days - one that changed his life forever. However, as the memories come flooding back, the unsolved 1974 crime refuses to fade away, and Esposito finds himself compelled to solve it once and for all, in the process rediscovering his undying love for a woman he once let slip through his fingers. Along the way, he learns what truly makes humans tick and that true passion may be the strongest force in existence, although it may manifest itself in ways too hard to accept.<br/><br/>It will therefore hardly be surprising that I consider one of the film's prime strengths to be its study of the human condition. On one level, the commentary is nothing new: love, longing, missed opportunities, regret, fallibility, weakness, malice; yet this is humanity in a nutshell, with every generation enacting the same drama as before. <br/><br/>'Secret' is not intended to turn this all-encompassing portrait on its side and offer a new interpretation. Its characters are straightforward, easily-identifiable and found all around us - they may even be us. The aim is to show them in all their glory and misery and break them down into the raw emotions that make us all tick. If you've never truly loved and lost, much of the film simply won't resonate as anything more than a tired cliché. Likewise, if you don't care for a study on the mechanics of human behaviour, this isn't for you. It's not a new paradigm of the genre, rather a very open and honest one that relies very much on the viewer's own life experience for it to make impact. Others may be put off by the analysis of revenge, especially as it invites introspection on one's own character by film's end. Yet this is surely the point.<br/><br/>Another of 'Secret's key strengths is the choice of actors and the characters themselves. Ricardo Darin's Esposito is at turns very subdued, worn down by the realities of life, yet elsewhere a fiery champion of justice - perhaps not unsurprising given his vocation, but Darin has the feel of the character just right. In opposition, Soledad Villamil's Irene is a woman in conflict: career-driven, struggling to walk the right path, and torn by her feelings. If anyone embodied the film's title, it would have to be Pablo Rago's portrayal of Ricardo Morales, the husband of a rape victim. Rago's wide eyes says so much, yet hide even more. Perhaps especially memorable however is Esposito's friend, Pablo Sandoval, played by Guillermo Francella. It may again be unoriginal that the film's comic relief turns out to have the greatest insight (and espouse the film's central message), but the oft-ignored yet wise fool is a long-enduring character simply for what he offers the viewer. There is also something earthy and endearing about Francella's performance that keeps your eyes trained upon him. The humour also provides a welcome release amidst the darker themes of the film.<br/><br/>This is helped further by the touching, at times hauntingly-beautiful score provided by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer, proving an excellent match for the often sombre mood director Juan Campanella aims to create. Although 'sepia' would be too strong a word, there is a definite yellowish tint awash over the flashback sequences that give the film its art-house feel and atmosphere. Running at just over two hours, Campanella has managed to set the pace just right - anything slower would lose the audience, yet to speed things up would be to destroy the important character moments, often carried by lingering expressions that say more than dialogue ever would. Yet dialogue is very much the centrepiece of the film - none of the themes are left unexplored and Campanella isn't interested in letting the visuals do all the talking. Again, I felt the balance between the visual discourse and the verbal was just right.<br/><br/>As my first entry into Argentinian film, I was very impressed with 'The Secret In Their Eyes'. However, to dwell on its country of its origin would be to do it a disservice, for it is simply good cinema. While its commentary on its universal themes may not work for everyone, I think many will enjoy the very touching and human tale that unfolds. If it ultimately leaves you a little unsettled and undecided as to the choices taken within the narrative, it has achieved its goal. Actual rating: 8 1/2 stars."
"tedg","Null","4","6","27 November 2010"," You Eyes, Your Love, Your Passion
","This is a truly lovely film that has potential to change lives. I will consider it for my ""list of fours,"" when I report it.<br/><br/>You may simply fall into the rather soft world it builds, one in which love can be redeemed as a matter of earnest justice. It is a simple coloring of the by now familiar Spanish-language model of anti-noir. In noir, the on screen characters are buffeted by events and laws in a world designed by the act of us watching. In the Spanish-language model, the on-screen characters imagine a world that bobs and weaves around the world we want to impose on the movie. <br/><br/>Sometimes this is called ""magical realism,"" and I suppose that concept makes sense in novels where everything is internal. Here in cinema we see, we live in worlds.<br/><br/>As with the best of these films, there is careful structuring. Underlying all this — I'll call it mirroring here — is the effort of a man to change reality. Plot-wise, he needs to recapture a lost love with a colleague. This is mirrored in his need to revisit justice for a violent murder that terminated the most passionate love he knows. He follows his own passion, amidst a speech by his assistant about the inevitability of passion that is mirrored in how the murderer is captured.<br/><br/>I'll take a moment away from mirroring to remark that this capture scene is in a packed soccer stadium. It is in a continuous take that seems physically impossible and has the edgiest cinematic tension I know.<br/><br/>This is literally two movies spliced together. To begin, we know it as a police procedural, with a love story under. It morphs about halfway into the dual: a love story with a detective story under, and the detective story now is of a different kind.<br/><br/>That ""different kind"" has to do with the mirroring of time. The early mystery is who committed the murder and how to catch him. The later mystery about what happened after the in-story watchers let him free. He folds these together by writing the past while we watch him struggle with the future. He literally writes half of the film and his creation may well be fiction. We see him struggling in the first scenes. When his love reads the novel she asks if that is how it was because she wants to know the world she will inhabit. She is pleased, saying that things will be complicated.<br/><br/>Even this is mirrored. Where our detective creates a world by narrating it, the bad guy ends up in a limbo where he gets no story, literally.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"Red-Barracuda","9","4","6","28 June 2010"," Top class Argentinian mystery
","Well this Argentinian mystery film was a very good experience. Going in to it, I had absolutely no idea that this movie had won the best foreign film Oscar at the Academy Awards. When I discovered this immediately afterwards I had to admit that the Academy for once may have got things spot on. This is a terrific film. It's a murder mystery with romantic subplot underpinning it. The acting is excellent and the cinematography is brilliant, on one occasion quite extraordinarily so (but I'll come to that later).<br/><br/>The basic plot-line has Esposito (Ricardo Darín) a retired detective trying to write a novel about an old case that still haunts him. The crime was the vicious rape and murder of a young woman. In his memoir Esposito uses the memories of others to build the story, and his objectivity is clouded too because he is in love with his superior Irene Menéndez Hastings (Soledad Villamil). The old case from 1974 is then told in a series of flashbacks, while in the present Esposito tries to make sense of it all.<br/><br/>Darín and Villamil are especially great in the two lead roles. While he is a man with much vulnerability, she is very strong; the chemistry between both actors is wonderful and as a central pair they are never short of convincing as three-dimensional characters. Also very convincing is the period setting. The year 1974 is captured perfectly in terms of look and uneasy feeling (this was just before the military junta took control); the latter is alluded to in scenes where the state is clearly seen to be acting in highly corrupt and immoral ways. One of the beauties of this film is that it touches on so many different themes without being trite or aimless; as well as the aforementioned political situation, the film works seamlessly as a mystery and a drama about people living in limbo.<br/><br/>Of course it's all very well and good being thematically interesting. But this is cinema and does it deliver on that front? Well I did mention earlier the presence of a sequence of unbelievable technique. All I will say is, the sequence in question starts with a night time view of a football stadium from up in the air, from here we rapidly approach and then dip into the bowl of the arena while hovering above the game in action and then seamlessly arrive in the midst of the crowd; from here we continue to play the scene where the crowd erupts for a goal and a chase ensues around the inner workings of the stadium, ending up on the pitch. This scene lasts for the best part of ten minutes and it is one glorious unbroken shot. Although there must clearly be some trickery involved as it would be frankly impossible to physically achieve this shot, I for one saw not one obvious break. It's a breathtaking piece of cinematic art and worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>There are certain other short scenes of striking power, such as the sequence where the killer shares a lift with Esposito and Menéndez, and initially pretends that he has not seen them. He then takes his gun out and loads it. After exiting the lift we then see him briefly stare menacingly back in at his two principle antagonists. The sinister mind games at play are brilliantly presented in this short slightly off-kilter scene. But the film as a whole is full of little moments of unexpected excellence like this, including the final denouement, which I was not expecting; I won't give it away but it is a satisfying conclusion to the mystery.<br/><br/>If you haven't already guessed, I loved The Secret in Their Eyes and I highly recommend it to everyone. It's great to see a film every so often that is capable of surprising you. It makes you realise that cinema is still alive."

As another reviewer pointed out, it was difficult to keep the time period straight because the characters looked nearly the same in present and past scenes. That made it difficult to keep track of the storyline. <br/><br/>*** spoiler alert ***<br/><br/>The ""clues"" that led them to identify the murderer were so thin it was impossible to take any of that seriously. I also had problems trying to figure out what happened in the stadium; and the aerial shot was gratuitous and superfluous--just for show. The ending was interesting, but I found more story holes there, too. Another thing that bothered me was the female lead character's ending up in an empty, passionless marriage. It's hard to imagine such a fierce, self-possessed, successful woman would have settled for that.<br/><br/>All that said, the acting was pretty good--especially actor who played Sandoval.

","The theater manager where I just saw this movie addressed the audience to admit he had hoped The White Ribbon had won the Oscar for best picture this year, but that he understood why this movie won instead. For me there is no question as to this movie having the more current relevance. Bravo to the Academy voters for voting bravely and well.<br/><br/>By its end you will have seen an act of seeming inhumanity that I could ascribe to, but I am sure most of my fellow Lefties would find unthinkable. I think my 'comrades' sense me capable of such acts and it scares them. But when the mere joy of decent, ethical behavior isn't enough to entice some to live within acceptable limits, then negative reinforcement is justifiably employed, in my opinion. The problem is, of course, being sure of having the ethical high ground and admittedly, that's no small thing.<br/><br/>In this movie there's little doubt the protagonist is a decent man. Benjamín Esposito is unable to let an old murder be forgot. And for good reason: the case's outcome was politically tampered with. In one of the most brilliant scenes I've ever seen, the antagonist's motivation is made crystal clear, so succinctly and efficiently, that I was taken aback for a moment. But the director and I are totally in accord in his opinion of what happened. What I worry about is that most of the audience won't get it.<br/><br/>In the theater I saw it, slides preceded the movie explaining that the murder took place before the government's going far to the Right in Argentina. If you don't have a clear understanding of what happened in the '70s in Argentina, you need to do some preparation. That's not going to be necessary for most Lefties who are quite aware of the Dirty War in which the US, never mentioned here, aided the government in committing atrocities.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film carried elegantly along by its main leads, Soledad Villamil as Irene and Ricardo Darín as Benjamin, with the truly brilliant support of its many supporting actors. But in the end its a triumph of film-making for the director, Juan José Campanella, especially, who brings the story to life with consummate skill. He's created a truly pleasurable and memorable experience for people like me."

"howard.schumann","9","4","7","25 April 2010"," Brilliant and intense
","Is justice only a legal term or a spiritual ideal? Many seek justice but confuse it with revenge or being right and live their lives in turmoil as both victim and victimizer. Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin), a retired Buenos Aires state criminal investigator, knows that even though a case that has been haunting him for the last twenty years is closed, it is still incomplete for him and justice in his mind has not been served. Based on the novel by Eduardo Sacheri and written by the director, Juan Jose Campanella's The Secret in Their Eyes (El Secreto in sus Ojos), Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Language Film, is a noir'ish thriller that is the most popular film in Argentina today, having broken every box office record in that country.<br/><br/>Like multi-faceted films of the fifties and sixties, The Secret in Their Eyes is a murder mystery and psychological thriller, a lighthearted love story, a meditation on memory, and a look at justice in Argentina in the 1970s that does not hesitate to show the indignities people suffered during the military junta, though not in a heavy handed way. As the film opens, the retired Esposito decides to write a novel about the 1974 rape and murder of an attractive 23-year old woman, young newlywed Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), a case that was closed by the authorities but never solved to his satisfaction. To obtain access to the file on the unsolved rape-murder case he spent so much time on, Esposito pays a visit to Irene Menendez Hastings (Soledad Villamil), his former supervisor and chief supporter who is now a judge.<br/><br/>It is clear from their meeting that they have rekindled an attraction from years past that faltered on class and social differences (she got a law degree from Cornell) and remained strictly professional. Supported by the cinematography of Felix Monti and the engaging score by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer, the film moves back and forth between the present and the past. As the camera picks up the case in 1974, Campanella chooses to graphically display young Liliana's bloody and battered body (a very poor choice) laying half on the bed and half on the floor. Benjamin interviews the victim's husband, Ricardo Morales (Pablo Raga), but he is not a suspect. In fact, the investigator is impressed by the depth of the love that Morales had for his deceased wife and the impact his loss has had on him.<br/><br/>Although two workmen of dark skin color from a nearby building are arrested and charged with the crime, Esposito knows they are innocent and were coerced to confess in an example of the Junta's racist justice and they are soon released. When he goes through old photographs of Morales' wife, however, he notices a strange young man, Isidoro Gomez (Javier Godino), gazing intently at her in every photo. The ""secret in his eyes"" suggests that he may be a prime suspect and Esposito and his clownish partner Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) try to track him down against the direct orders of their judicial boss. Sandoval, a penetrating student of human nature though an alcoholic, goes through Gomez' letters to his mother trying to find out what his ""passion"" is and finds that he is a devoted soccer fan.<br/><br/>In one of the film's highlights, Esposito and Sandoval locate him (among 90,000 screaming fans) and a seven-minute chase scene takes place in one unbroken shot through the stadium as the camera sweeps through the crowds, follows a few false leads, then goes into overdrive when Gomez is spotted. Under interrogation by Ms. Hastings, the suspect cracks when, using every inch of her power as a woman, his physical stature is ridiculed by the Supervisor to try and provoke him. When Esposito tells Morales of Gomez' confession, both men agree that justice will be served only if Gomez is given life in prison but corruption gets the upper hand, at least temporarily. Performances by both leads are brilliant and intense and many twists and turns await the viewer as The Secret in their Eyes ratchets up the tension in the last half hour to arrive at a surprising and Hitchcock-like conclusion. It is one of the best films of 2010 so far."

Whatever be said about the plot, the film is about the Argentinian soul, which is present in the fashion, in the serious furniture, in the limestone and wooden paneling of the buildings, in the pomp of the institutions, in the spicy dialogs, the flat and dry and cold landscape. No matter the background of poverty, corruption, abuse and economic decadence, one sees how the characters do not give up being elegant, vainly , proud, sarcastic, sexy, a little arrogant (sometimes trying to be European in South America) but very human. So far, it has a similar effect to ""el hijo de la novia"" by Juan Jose Campanella with Ricardo Darin and Hector Alterio, which includes the cuisine. And behind the Argentinian soul, with consistent roles played by excellent actors, Campanella makes up a great story of idealism, friendship, grief, wrath, love."

The film is profoundly captivating throughout, with a scattering of one or two truly comedic moments punctuating a piece of intense and shocking drama, which ultimately proves to be a tale of both extreme love and engulfing tradegy.<br/><br/>The ending is typical of the entire film, highly subtle yet full of emotion, leaving the viewer to endlessly ponder the nature of true justice, if such a thing exists. I would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone and everyone who might be considering watching it, it is a masterpiece of modern cinema and is brilliantly abstract when compared to the monotonic tide of Hollywood blockbusters which generally dominate cinema."

","EL SECRETO DE SUS OJOS, based on the novel 'LA PREGUNTA DE SUS OJOS' by Eduardo Sacheri who with director Juan José Campanella adapted it for the screen, is a work of great subtlety and artistic taste. It is also a fine love story, detective story, and moral tale that makes every aspect of the total experience of watching the film unfold as a kaleidoscope of just how fine the art of cinema can be. <br/><br/>25 years ago in Argentina the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo) drew the focus of detective Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin), his feisty assistant Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and the department chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil). The murderer, Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is captured, but because of the corrupt government, he is not kept in prison: the disgusting governmental police release him to work as an undercover agent for the government as part of the desaperacidos situation in the 1970s. The case is closed, leaving behind Ben, Irene, and Pablo completely disenchanted by the legal system, and the grieving husband of the victim Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) to sit at the train station watching for answers. Now, in the present, Ben returns and is convinced he wants to write a novel about the murder he still finds suspicious. Together with Irene (who remains a love interest for the shy Ben) and Pablo, the three research every aspect of the case. In attempting to discover the truth of the murder each of their lives is changed: the communication on the part of every character is through the looks in their eyes until the story ends in a very surprising manner. Justice is served, love prevails, and the novel is written. <br/><br/>This may seem too fragile an outline of a plot about a film as important as this, but the true beauty of the film is the unraveling of events and the development of the characters: sharing too much information would destroy the complete pleasure the film provides. Every member of the cast is brilliant, the chemistry between Darin and Villamil is so subtle and credible, and the acts of violence we are asked to witness are delivered in a way that make the story line progress to a breathtaking end. Campanella's direction (and editing) is of the finest cinematic achievement and the cinematography by Félix Mont and the haunting musical score by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer heighten all facets of the action - love, terror, violence, and character of each of the actors. This is a film to own, as repeated viewings of it will be like repeated visits to an art museum. Highly Recommended. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","Recently retired law-enforcer Esposito goes to see his old boss Irene to talk about a novel he wants to write, based on a disturbing rape-homicide case they worked together 25 years previously. His jottings stir memories and passions long neglected but never eradicated.<br/><br/>Campanella's genre-mix, part period piece set in the Dirty War years of Argentina's late 20th-century police state, is a joyous emotional odyssey. The opening comedic tone is almost screwball comedy, giving way to the tragedy of youth and beauty mutilated in its prime, in a simple p.o.v shot timed to perfection that simply takes your breath away. The pacing of the film is exquisite, moving from sequence to sequence and shifting tonality in a manner both daring and effortless.<br/><br/>There are incredible performances from the leads. Ricardo Darín as Esposito carries the weight of the world on his shoulders, despite the flirtatious and foul-mouthed quips. He is an essentially good man in a corrupt universe. Like James Stewart in Anatomy of a Murder, he has a drunk for a side-kick, irascible Sandoval (Guillermo Francella), a man whose aversion to phone conversations is matched by his penchant for self-annihilation. For him, redemption can only come in the form of sacrifice. Irene (Soledad Villamil) has her own regrets, centering on a parting at a train station, a sequence that book-ends the first two-thirds of the film, before the narrative moves on to explore if there truly is anything beyond the deceptive succor of memory.<br/><br/>Despite the overtly political setting of the story, the film stays resolutely with the individual characters and their personal dilemmas. That is not to say it shirks the big questions. What is the sum total of a life? What does it mean to do the right thing in an amoral world? How do we go on knowing all we live for has been taken from us? Is there a punishment crueler than death? The film not only poses the questions, but dares to answer them, flooding the audience with catharsis in waves.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a film this moving, so satisfyingly complex, so rooted in human frailty, since The Lives of Others. Watch The Secret in Their Eyes, watch it again, take your friends, talk about it, celebrate it, love it. Bravo."

","With the previous two Best Foreign Film Oscars going to films that I thought were good rather than great, I was beginning to fear that the Academy Awards were losing their discernment. No worries though, for they got this one spot on – easily the best film of the dozen or so that I saw during this years' Edinburgh Film Festival, and probably the best film I will see this year. This is truly outstanding film-making that, like its' title, keeps you guessing, and works on a number of different levels - whose eyes contain the secret; the victim, the killer or the lovers? Content-wise, it broadly covers the nature of justice, in a plot that is slightly reminiscent of 'A Very Long Engagement' – a convoluted whodunit, played out over a long time period. But it's also about the nature of memory, and how effective or not it is, with a number of sequences that play on this uncertainty – did it really happen, or is it just in the imagination of the character? Whilst the mystery element of the film is rich and engrossing in itself, it shines even brighter in the love story. The Director manages to create a brilliant chemistry between the two leads, with their age-ing captured to perfection and providing an immediate reference point for the viewer to help make sense as the narratives moves seamlessly back and forth, sweeping through time.<br/><br/>Yet another level involves the injection of a quite deliberate and playful humour, most obvious in the wry banter between the main character and his assistant. On each level, a certain amount is left unsaid and unexplained, and is all the more satisfying for it, leaving you thinking about it for long afterwards. There's even the inclusion of some ambitious cinematography (the football match sequence particularly stands out), and the classical score is beautifully-judged, simultaneously wistful and melancholic, fitting the piece like the proverbial glove.<br/><br/>This is highly accomplished film-making in a class of its' own, and I am very much looking forward to seeing it again in a couple of years time once my own recollection of it has started to fade. A modern day classic. 9/10"

This is a staggeringly wonderful film! <br/><br/>Based on the novel by Eduardo Sachesi, it is written and directed by Juan Jose Campanella, who also directed Argentina's 2001 Oscar entry ""Son of the Bride"". Mr. Campanella also has quite a resume of U.S. television in addition to his film work. What really stands out here is the multitude of story lines and character development, none of which are cheated ... yet each which could have stood on their own as a film. This is terrific film-making with rare balance between comedic dialogue, a full fledged crime drama, unrequited love and nasty politics.<br/><br/>The excellent script is helped along with fine acting by the key players: Ricardo Darin as Esposito, Soledad Villamil as Irene, Guillermo Francella as Sandoval, Pablo Rago as Morales, and Javier Godino as Gomez. Each actor has physical features that play well with the film's title.<br/><br/>I certainly don't wish to give away much of the substance of the film, but it mostly revolves around the investigation by Esposito and Sandoval into the brutal rape and murder of Morales' young, beautiful wife. Esposito works for Irene and they have ""eyes"" for each other, and Gomez is the key suspect despite all the political maneuvering designed to throw the investigators off track.<br/><br/>There are a few outstanding scenes and my two favorite were an incredibly intense elevator ride, and a fascinating crowd scene at a soccer/futbol game. As you might guess, there are innumerable close-ups for a clear eye-level shot and the film bounces back and forth between 1974 and 2000, so we must adjust to the weak make-up.<br/><br/>For anyone who enjoys fine film-making and isn't afraid of 2 plus hours of subtitles, you will surely be satisfied and impressed at the quality of this film."

","It is Oh so rare that I have a new favorite movie. It's been 5-10 years since the last time. This was a 10, not a 9.9. The only TINY error I felt was poor makeup/aging for Gomez. Other than that, it would take me 10,000 words and several hours to detail every reason why this was the perfect film, and I mean PERFECT. If I ever see a movie better than this, i will be in shock. The final 10-15 minutes of this movie I will never forget even if 100 years old with dementia. Thank you to the most perfect job as director, the most perfect acting from characters Esposito, Irene Menendez, Ricardo Morales, and Pablo Sandoval, and thank you for the unbelievable filming. The soccer stadium scene and ensuing drama, and the ending, will effect me for years. There are so many parallels in this movie. Esposito was looking at Irene in the photos similar to Gomez looking at Isodora. But, i think the lesson was, it doesn't matter who they are looking at, the Secret Is In Their Eyes. One look was obsession, the other was love."

","Not entering in opinions or specific details about the movie itself, I believe the surprise has a key role (as happened to me) and very probably there will be enough comments about that. This movie deserves all the credit and will be so flattering to have received an Oscar (talking about the current state of things, of course )? I doubt it. The truth is that it has everything you want, either for fun (with a certain humor that often sprinkle here and there , and the inherent suspense as the events will ocurre, never dropping from beginning to end) or to approach a seriously theme and truthful to some extent (and here play two things: the real drama of the matter of the main story and the passionate romance involving it in parallel), and more than expected also. Plus the fact that it contains excellent works on all levels, from the cast and speech to backstage and makeup, from the script and adaptation to audio and beautiful classical soundtrack, from photography to camera work.. Honestly, I can not point out anything negative. It's so catchy and touching in a way that 2h will seem like half, even less. If perfection exists in modern crime/drama filmaking then El Secreto De Sus Ojos is certainly at the top or very close to it and has all the features to become a timeless film."

","Someone on this board stated that he is normally a harsh critic of Argentinian films. I give him credit because I wouldn't know an Argentinian movie if the movie reel hit me in the face. I wish I were that discerning.<br/><br/>""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is indeed an Argentinian movie, and an intriguing and dramatic one.<br/><br/>In 1999, a retired federal justice, Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel. Over the years, he has never forgotten the horrific rape and murder of Liliana Coloto, and the complete devastation of her husband Ricardo Morales. He does a rough draft and brings it to an ex-coworker, Irene Menendez Hastings (Soledad Villamil) for her opinion. She, along with Benjamin and his assistant Pablo Sandoval were all affected by the case.<br/><br/>Back then, some 25 years earlier, Benjamin sees a photograph of Liliana with some schoolmates, and zeroes in on one man, Isidoro Gomez (Javier Godino) whom he sees looking at Liliana in the picture. ""Something in his eyes,"" he says -- and it's something he recognizes, having been in love with Irene all these years. Gomez was ultimately caught, released, and vanished. The case was closed.<br/><br/>Benjamin revisits the case now, reminiscing with Irene, who has continued with the Justice Department. The end of the case has always bothered him, but he can't put his finger on WHY. Though he can fictionalize his novel, he won't be happy until he really closes this case.<br/><br/>Dark, mysterious, violent, with a shocking ending, ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a marvelous, absorbing film, filled with atmosphere as Benjamin attempts to resolve his life and Liliana's tragic murder. Beautifully directed by Juan Jose Campanella, this in many ways is a difficult story -- difficult because it's not filled with special effects and excitement, but flashbacks and characters. Ricardo Darin as Benjamin Esposito is terrific - warm, likable, and emotional as a man seeking the truth of the case and the truth of himself. All of the acting is strong.<br/><br/>Passion matters in this film; you can change many things about a man, Pablo Sandoval says, but you cannot change his passion.

"ajs-10","9","2","3","4 June 2011"," A great film...
","First off I had better warn you that this film is in Spanish, with subtitles, so if you are put off by either of these, read no further. For those that are left, in 2010 it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, so I hoped it would have some potential I was right! It is set in Argentina in 1999 but mostly told in flashback to 1974. A story involving the investigation into a rape and murder and also an unreciprocated love story make up the plot of this very interesting drama. I enjoyed it very much and even when I thought it was dragging a bit towards the end there were still more revelations to come. Here's a very brief summary.<br/><br/>Benjamín Esposito is a retired legal counsellor, with time on his hands he has decided to write a novel based on one of his former cases. The case, from 1974, involves the rape and murder of schoolteacher, Liliana Coloto. She had recently married Ricardo Morales, a bank clerk. In flashback we are told about the initial investigation which was not successful in bringing about a prosecution. Back in the present, we meet Esposito's former boss, now district attorney, Irene Menéndez Hastings. The pair has some history which Esposito wants to include in his novel. Back to flashback and Esposito and his colleague, Pablo Sandoval, discover another suspect who they don't seem able to locate. That is until Sandoval, who is a bit of a drunk, has a revelation and figures out a way to find him. This they do, but will justice be served? There is a lot more, but I won't tell you that here for fear of the spoiler police getting hold of me.<br/><br/>This film has a very deliberate pace about it, nothing is rushed but still it keeps the audience interested. There is some really great dialogue which I found added a great deal of substance to the piece. Great performances all round; Ricardo Darín did a tremendous job as Benjamín Esposito, he has that look of a man weary of his work about him that I liked very much. Soledad Villamil was great as his former boss Irene Menéndez Hastings and Pablo Rago was equally good as the grieving Ricardo Morales. Finally, a special mention for Guillermo Francella who put in a great turn as the unassuming drunk, Pablo Sandoval.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, I found the flipping between the flashbacks and 1999 was very well done and didn't disturb the flow of the story too much. As I've already said, some of the dialogue is truly excellent (take note any budding screenwriters out there). It is all very well made, but I found the plot and the quality of the writing stand up very well. I should finally mention a beautiful haunting score by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer, a wonderful piece of work. So, if you're not put off by subtitles I can highly recommend this Argentinean/Spanish co-production.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.7/10"

","Benjamin Esposito is a legal counselor who, together with his assistant Sandoval and his superior Irene Menéndez-Hasting, works hard to investigate the murder of a young lady. The investigation becomes complicated when a Romano, a rival legal counselor, works against them. Jose Luis Campanella does a tremendous job of intertwining a love story between the two main characters, together with a crime thriller. As a means of telling the story, the director switches from past to present and present to past, each time revealing a new aspect of each storyline. Throughout the movie it is easy to focus on the crime thriller storyline and think that it is the only thing going on. However, through subtle looks in the eyes of the main characters we are able to see that there is love brewing up in them and that this will become a main theme in no time. The film is filled with cinematographic beauty and technique and certainly proves itself to be one of the best movies ever made in the history of Argentina."

","This is a brilliant thriller set in Buenos Aires that is centered on a rape/murder case. Detective, Esposito, has returned home twenty-five years after the incident to write a novel about the crime, resolved to find and carry out justice this time. The movie combines suspense, tension, shock, and romance in a way that could easily result in a choppy and compartmentalized plot, but rather each theme and tone compliments the others and results in a complex and intricate story.<br/><br/>""El secreto de sus ojos"" deals heavily with the theme of lost time and wasted opportunities either based on variables beyond the characters' control or characters' crippling inhibitions. The movie switches between flashbacks from twenty-five years ago and ""today"" thus reestablishing the characters', especially Esposito's, regrets that have haunted him for nearly half of his life. We see that Esposito has been in love with his co-worker, Irene since the first time he laid eyes on her twenty-five years ago and later we learn that he had a chance to be with her when he instead fled his life that to him was only full of failure. Regarding the unresolved homicide case, Esposito had found the rapist and murderer and obtained a verbal confession only days before the judge decided to let the criminal walk free. After repeatedly trying and failing to correct the injustice, Esposito flees, dejected, in search of a new life in an attempt to forget the unresolved life he is leaving behind. <br/><br/>The movie BEGGS the question to the characters and the audience, ""what is justice?"" As unresolved as Esposito's life was, is the answer to this question."

Once I got past this shocking revelation I was ready to watch the movie. So this movie won awards all over the globe including the Oscar for best foreign film, and literally every award offered by the Argentinian film awards (which suggests to me maybe Argentina doesn't have a film industry so much as makes a movie a year). This movie was one of the best I have seen in years. It has flash backs that are actually purposeful and not confusing. It has humor. It has suspense. It has mystery. It has not one but two great love stories. It has violence. And it brought me into the world of Argentina, a world I am not that familiar with other than the rumors that Hitler is secret living there. I loved this movie, from the first shot to the ending, that I thought would be all typical Hollywood bull crap, but surprised me completely and made me go ""hmmmmm.. I did not see that coming,"" which is something I wish I could say more often with thrillers. This movie is a must see unless you hate subtitles.

","This psychophysiological thriller begins with the meeting, after many years, of Benjamin and Irene. She's a judge. He's a retired criminal investigator. They're a little too happy to see each other. Twenty-five years ago, when she was assistant to a judge and he was an investigator under her, they were caught up in a vicious case of rape and murder. Benjamin visited the crime scene, and the dead woman's body powerfully told of the crime's cruelty. Two workers were arrested and convicted. Benjamin was never positive of their guilt. Now he tells Irene that on his own time he wants to write about the case.<br/><br/>There's a revelation that comes that I felt caused the film to be overcooked, but regardless, slowly the emotional grandeur and tragedy of that aim become plainer after this begins an interesting backward-and-forward excursion through time, between Buenos Aires in the 1970s and the turn of the new millennium, which reintroduces both the crime and the unrequited sentiment that's lingered all these years between Irene and Benjamin. That's where their individual allure emerges. Actress Soledad Villamil is mature, strong, rational and probably cast for her eyes, as the film has masses of close-ups, and they're essential to hiding secrets. Playing Irene at ages 25 years apart, she's never too young or too old, but standing right there.<br/><br/>Ricardo Darin makes her admirable cohort as Benjamin. His rank was too low, his salary too little, her presence too self-possessed for him to believe the hints he must have known she was giving. He's one of those men on whom a beard seems preordained. There's a melancholy about him. He has never stopped thinking about the murder case, and we get the feeling---although the movie is oblique about this---that the investigation was mismanaged at the time owing to Argentina's contaminated right-wing politics.<br/><br/>Without being too open-faced about it, the film reconstructs the threads of two stories, the murder case and the fragmentary feelings between Benjamin and Irene. It's packed with lucid characters. There's fully drawn and effective comic relief Sandoval, played with a fine balance between gravity and lightheartedness by Guillermo Francella, is Benjamin's alcoholic assistant, rather sidekick, in the investigation, one of those drunks who may be bungling but is not hopeless. He and Benjamin, and all the legal-side workers, participate in the amusing ritual of referring to each other by fancy monikers. Morales is the husband of the dead woman, even now fanatically preoccupied with her death. Gomez has at all times been Benjamin's true suspect, and there is an astonishing scene featuring him in a soccer stadium that I have no clue how it could've been filmed, FX or not.<br/><br/>The camera is like an omniscient character. There are many wonderful shots in the film, like that which opens the film and is later repeated. Various scenes take place that'll be retold later, using the retelling as part of Benjamin's evidence in the solution of the crime. The shots that are repeated somehow take on a greater dramatic force.<br/><br/>Juan Jose Campanella is the writer-director, a gentleman who weaves a thorough (perhaps overly so), enthralling, adoringly constructed film, an epiphanic story where blinders are removed, suppressed desires are realized, self-limitations are accepted, the protagonist takes unusual actions, behaves oddly, anxious about the future. We get to fully know the characters, and the story details their complications and desires with fitting admiration. There is the continual feeling that they exist in the moment and not at some position along a predestined gamut. And though the film is a little bit overdone as I say, the cast doesn't act as much as it lives life candidly under invented circumstances."

","¨There is a lot of things that a man can change his mind about, but never his passion¨ El Secreto de Sus Ojos, which translated means The Secret in Their Eyes, is an Argentinean film that has recently been nominated for an Oscar in the best foreign movie category. Juan Jose Campanella (who also directed Luna de Avellaneda and El Hijo de la Novia, along with many Law and Order and House MD television episodes) directs this thriller which has been a box office hit in Argentina. It has also received a lot of critical acclaim because of the way the story is told in non-linear form and it also has some great performances from the entire cast; but what makes this movie so much better is the clever ending because in order for a thriller to work you need to have a decent ending and this movie has a great one. The entire build up to the finale is just sensational and the movie doesn't drag for one minute during the entire two hours the movie lasts. It mixes romance with action and drama with suspense and balances them all very well. There is one specific action scene in a soccer stadium where a chase takes place that is just breathtaking. I haven't seen an Argentinean movie so good since Nueve Reinas (Nine Queens). This movie is very clever and I recommend you seeing it in its original language (Spanish) because the performances are so good and the dialogues are so real (If you've been to Argentina you know most of the conversations take place in the exact same manner, it just has a very authentic feel to it).<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1999 and we are introduced to Benjamin Esposito, played by the very famous Argentinean actor Ricardo Darin (Nueve Reinas, El Hijo de La Novia, and El Aura). He is a retired federal justice agent who is trying to write a novel during his free time about a case that happened 25 years ago and that dramatically changed his life. He decides to visit his ex coworker Irene Menendez-Hastings, played by Soledad Villamil (No Sos Vos, Soy Yo) and tells her about his plans. Both of them get together and discuss about the Morales case which occurred in 1974. The movie is non linear because while Benjamin writes the story we are transported to the past and we experience it while it is actually happening. He is working at the federal agency and Irene has just been introduced to them as the new chief of the department. His co worker and best friend is Pablo Sandoval, played by the extremely funny Guillermo Francella (Rudo y Cursi). One of the first cases they have to take with Irene as their boss is a difficult one in which a young woman has been brutally raped and murdered at her home. They inform the newly widowed husband, Ricardo Morales played by Pablo Rago, about the terrible news. He is devastated and Benjamin is so stunned about the way that this man loved his wife (he later tells Irene that he has never seen so much love through the eyes of someone) that he promises to help him catch the killer. After viewing some photographs of the victim's past he finds a suspect, a childhood friend of hers named Isidro Gomez, played by Javier Godino (Deception and Kisses For Everyone). The chase begins and the movie develops from this point on jumping from 1974 to 1999 as Benjamin is writing the novel and trying to close a case that has been left open for more than 25 years.<br/><br/>El Secreto de Sus Ojos is a great movie which will have you at the edge of your seat at some moments and laughing your heart out at others. It also has some romance due to the interrupted love between Benjamin and Irene, so it is a movie that everyone can enjoy. It is a great story and Juan Jose Campanella does a great job of jumping back and forth during the movie in order to keep the audience's attention. The tension grows as the minutes pass and the mystery isn't entirely solved until the very end. I found the ending to be very clever and quite original because without a good ending this movie could have been easily forgotten. The true heart of this film is the story which has been adapted from the novel La Pregunta de Sus Ojos by Eduardo Sacheri, and the way in which the director is able to put all the pieces together in the movie. The acting in this movie is also superb. Ricardo Darin is great and Soledad Villamil also gives a good performance, but it is Guillermo Francella who really steals every single scene he is in. He is extremely funny and I think his performance is one of the best I've seen this year, his character just fit him perfectly. This is a great film and well deserving of an Oscar although I haven't seen the other movies that are competing in this category. Whether it wins or not, this is a movie you won't want to miss."

The history is as well fascinating and the way its reveal to us in the perfect timing. The characterization of the young and old leading actors is impressive, so simple but so brutal and well done. Ricard Darin is brilliant the director Juan José Campanella is a director to keep a close look This was one of the best movies I saw recently, even the small funny moments, which are not many, but they can be brilliant and so funny (the judge Fortuna Lacalle revealing he knows that Esposito was in that town looking for Gomez). This is a must see movie that confirms that the power of good acting, good directing and a good story with rich dialogues can overcome any multimillion dollar blockbuster made in Hollywood."

","This Argentinian film start slowly for me and felt a little formulaic in it's story. Yet it progresses well and becomes more and more engaging. This is helped by some fine performances, the fact it looks beautiful and there is some nice orchestration throughout.<br/><br/>Just as the character if Benjamin becomes consumed by the murder of a young woman and him and his colleague try in vain to find the culprit, we the audience are suddenly drawn into this world inextricably. We too long for answers, we too see the love the grieving husband has, hoping only to know who did this to his wife. His love and the strength of it shocks both us and Benjamin.<br/><br/>The was a point in the film where I was utterly consumed by the story; as the camera soars over the soccer stadium, i was stunned by the brilliance of the scene as the cameras then becomes part of the soccer crowd. Following that we are thrown into chaos as they search and find the suspect only for a fast and thrilling, yet brief chase ensues. I think it is one of the finest scenes in a film I've witnessed, so brilliantly executed. From this point on the film doesn't let go: The scene of interrogation, as the suspect is broken down or many years later when he enters the lift and removes a gun, the camera holds still as we see the fear and tears across the faces of Benjamin and Irene, the scene is so amazing, my body tensed up until the very last moment. The film is at times tense, sometimes funny and often very moving, I thought that it encaptures so many emotions so well, all that one would expect, for instance when Morales is informed of his wife's death, the control of the director settles on Morales as he mumbles away, stifling back tears as the news sinks in.<br/><br/>The film is perhaps let down by the desire or love between Benjamin and Irene, one that plays out throughout the story and is eventually resolved by the end, although the use of the motif of her running after the train at he start and then at the end of the film is nicely done. Despite this there is little to fault the the film, which is a near masterpiece and deservedly won Best Foreign film at the 2010 Oscars.<br/><br/>More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com"

There are a few times during this film when the screen blacks out and I was actually begging that it wouldn't end.

But don't let subtitles put you off going to this film. I'm not usually keen on random love stories being thrown into films but I thought this one worked very well, perhaps the end was slightly unbelievable and a bit Hollywood but by that stage I was shouting for them to get together.<br/><br/>The reason this film got 8 instead of 10 were that at some moments in the film I lost what was going on, it seemed to cut too suddenly, and there were some aspects I still didn't understand at the end.

And love, Morale's love for his wife, making him waiting in the train station day after day only because the murderer MAY escape from there. The love lasts for more than 25 years and just this love encourages Benjamin to face his own feeling for Irene, for which she has been waiting for so many years.I knew little about that time in Argentina, the chaos of society, the judicial corruption, or some dark things like that, so I can't figure out what the director want to tell other than love.

","The film ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" focused on an unsolved murder case that's 25 years old, and that all this time it has still been on an investigator named Ben Esposito's interest. The movie takes place in the 1970's with the brutal rape and murder of a 23 year old wife, and the extraordinary love of her husband. Even though years have passed, Esposito wants to find answers to all the unanswered questions. As Esposito is working on this case and the past clarifies in flashbacks, he finds his lost love, Irene. Irene is now married and is a well known judge. Esposito on the other hand is alone. The movie doesn't focus a lot on Irene and Ben's love. This film has some graphic scenes. The director, Juan Jose Campanella, is one of Argentina's best-known filmmaker. He is famous for directing episodes like ""House"", ""Law & Order Special Victims Unit"" and ""30 Rock."" The director was smart enough to focus on a cold case theme because it contributed to a variety of emotional themes that range from love and obsession to justice and retribution. Throughout the film, the cinematography used combines with the feelings the characters are portraying. The cameras focus more on the character's faces and their eyes. By focusing on their faces and eyes, it gives the feeling of tension and mystery which contribute to his theme. This helps the characters connect with the audience. By connecting with the audience the movie leaves a unique mark in their lives."

","Quite impressive cinema from Argentina that surely deserves its Oscar.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is that it works on various levels. It is telling a murder and two love stories at the same time. On top, it is also a movie about the existing corruption and injustice in Argentina. This is narrated along the way by means of the crime story. Maybe this unobtrusiveness makes it seep in even deeper. Welcome to South America.<br/><br/>The performance of the actors is generally good, but the most striking one comes from Guillermo Francella who is giving the side character of court investigator Pablo Sandeval, an alcoholic who loves his drinking and calls it his passion. Nonetheless, his contribution to solving the criminal case is quite essential.<br/><br/>I also like the fact that this is an all-Argentinian movie, which gives an inside view to a country, which is not only corrupt but also crazy for soccer. This can be seen in the chasing scene in the stadium of Racing Club. The whole atmosphere comes across quite realistic including the shabby conditions of the stadium's sanitary facilities.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, it is also interesting to see that apparently French cars dominated the Argentinian car market in the last decades of the 20th century as Benjamin uses a Peugeot in the flashbacks to the 1970's and uses a Renault in the year 2000. This may be unimportant but as a European, I was surprised to see these familiar cars in the Americas.<br/><br/>Of higher relevance may be the fact that the film is not finished with catching the murderer but still holds its biggest surprise in store.

","A train departs a station in 1974 and two lovers, Irene and Benjamin, part before they come together. ""Te mo"" is to fear and ""te amo"" is to love. Love and fear at the same moment. This multi-layered, rich, brutal and beautiful film revolves around this dichotomy in many ways.<br/><br/>Decades after the train left the station, Benjamin is unhappily retired from a prosecutor's office. He does not like what he sees in the mirror. An unsolved case, a savage rape and murder, weighs heavily on his mind, as does Irene. Benjamin and Irene worked on the case together and as it unraveled, so did they. So with more purposes than one, Benjamin resumes investigating the murder. New discoveries and different perspectives instill hope in Benjamin for solving the mysteries and memories that haunt him. People may change but their passions don't.<br/><br/>The justice system is not clean or simple in any country, and this brilliant film reveals how complex and ugly it can be. The Secret in Their Eyes seamlessly combines multiple genres including crime thriller, romance and drama. There is appealing depth to the story, characters, themes, acting and photography. The characters, for example, are not one dimensional. They are vulnerable, make mistakes, regret choices and, in sum, are fully human. Themes revolve around memories, justice, love, vengeance and more. Soledad Villamil (Irene) and Ricardo Darín (Benjamin) perform amazingly well together. The chemistry is palpable. The film won the Academy Award for best foreign language film."

I dont wanna reveal any spoilers, but let me say this, that the subtle, true to life way in which the director portrays the love a man can feel for a woman, touches my heart in a profound way. This movie is definitely NOT a sentimental romantic story, not at all. On the contrary, this movie is firstmost a suspenseful detective story about the hunt for a killer who raped an innocent young woman. The romantic part sneaks up on me as viewer quite unexpectedly, which makes it even more touching.<br/><br/>Direction, photograpy, music score are all really excellent. I mean, there is a constant mood of silent sorrow, which encapsulates this picture. This wonderful melancholy mood is captured in the music and in the soft colors with which this story is being portrayed. This movie feels like a dear memory of a long gone summer holiday. This description might sound a bit vague, but what I am trying to express is that the director succeeded brilliantly in depicting a beautiful melancholy mood with the excellent use of the techniques of photography and music. Truly wonderful.<br/><br/>The story AND the acting though are what truly make this picture rise out far above any other detective or romantic story.

The case concerns a murdered young woman and all the legal hoops they had to jump through in pursuing a conviction and all the corruption that stood in their way.<br/><br/>Ricardo Darín plays the lead role here. He was also my favourite in another Argentinian film, Wild Tales, which I really enjoyed, and he's also my favourite in this film. Something about his whole being is just perfect to convey the frustration and sadness his character has to go through in fighting the windmills that are the Argentinian government and its legal system.<br/><br/>As for the story, it was competent and very much enjoyable, but I also felt that it lacked that certain something. The end twist I could see coming miles away and the rest of the events, while competently filmed and certainly professionally made all around, were not what I'd call original.<br/><br/>Not to say that originality is the end and all of film making - although it usually doesn't hurt. You can tell a classic tale and your film will be a classic as well, if you just tell it well enough. But here I didn't find that personal touch that I'm looking for.<br/><br/>Still, the film is very good.

","A good melodrama with nice characters who, for some reason, cannot communicate directly. Add a touch of suspense, with a plot taking its time to unfold, and more -contained- pathos. Let it cook for over 2 hours, then you have it.<br/><br/>I am not being unjust here. Yes, 'El Secreto de sus Ojos' is a perfectly crafted movie, with fine performances. Now is it an excellent movie that does resonate and will continue to resonate with audiences a couple of years from now? Certainly not.<br/><br/>So what? I am quite sure we can find a better 2009 'foreign language' movie. So this one has one special thing, a special thing which resonates with the very audience voting for the Award it got. And that's the problem with critics, they love movies on the basis of the limited set of values of their little worlds. So the wider world should never take them into account.<br/><br/>A more personal note: I found it difficult to watch Ricardo Darin act as an almost introverted character. He is really good, but something in the movie doesn't fit. He is buoyant, he is easy-going, yet he behaves as a wimp (most critics must be wimps). Mixing present (old character with hindsight) with flashbacks (wimp) doesn't help to see eye to eye with the main character. And as far as I understand, to some this weakness must be a tremendously valuable asset for the whole movie."

","""Justice is an island. We work out in the real world."" Dateline: Buenos Aires 1974 -2000. Oscar-winning The Secret in Their Eyes trips between an Argentinean murder in 1974 and the involved justice Benjamin (Ricardo Darin) retired now and writing about the gruesome rape- homicide. Unlike in other thrillers, even Silence of the Lambs, director/ writer Juan Jose Campanella weaves a credible love story between protagonist Benjamin (and his boss, Irene (Soledad Villamil), with the love of a husband for his young murdered wife highlighting the somber effect of time, or its lack thereof, on those whose eyes may or may not hold the secret.<br/><br/>This intriguing and typically-slow exposition by a not-American director is a thriller of the first orderâ€”accumulation of facts and revelation of emotions while methodically nailing down the murderer, perhaps a bit like Lady with the Dragon Tattoo with a dash of Silence of the Lambs. As is to be expected of non-CGI dominated international films, character is everything, from a sidekick with a drinking problem and sacrificing heart to a murderer complex as the best cinematic murderers like Jackie Earle Haley's. The figurative importance of the eyes, burnished by multiple close-ups, is a motif that emphasizes the literate approach of the entire artwork.<br/><br/>In Eyes, the jumping across time is handled with a rare fluidity, helped by a graying beard on the protagonist but not helped by Ms. Villamil, who may never be able to play old because of her Sophia-Loren indestructible looks. The time mix influences the attachment we feel for characters fighting time but trying to live for the present. Especially when it comes to expressing affection, so easy to fob off on time or think like Eliot's Prufrock that ""indeed there will be time,"" when there will be little to none.<br/><br/>The Secret in Their Eyes is a somewhat languid eye-opener, the cinematic equivalent of seeing Casablanca after Letters to Juliet, a variation of the sublime to the ridiculous. No matter, now and then Oscar gets it rightâ€”best foreign language film of the year. The eyes have it."
"Chris Knipp","8","3","6","6 May 2010"," Too much going on here: a murder mystery with politics, comedy, and romance
","This Argentinian film has many virtues but some serious flaws. Ultimately it winds up being too much of a muchness. Its meandering story line focuses on a murder investigation that spans 25 years. It's carried out by a judicial underling, Benjamin Esposito (film veteran Ricardo DarÃ­n, who starred in both of the late FabiÃ¡n Bielinsky's films) with his (romanticized) alcoholic assistant Pablo Sandoval (the comic Guillermo Francella). Meanwhile the lowly Esposito is (wanly) in love with his judicial boss, the aristocratic Irene MenÃ©ndez Hastings (Soledad Villamil), who arrives with the imprimatur of a US Ivy League education, and eventually becomes a judge.<br/><br/>'Eyes' feels a bit like 'Zodiac,' only in Spanish and with too many flashbacks, too much unconvincing aging make-up, a last reel that feels like a trailer, and a saccharine conclusion. Everything is complicated by the corruption of the PerÃ³n dictatorship and its aftermath under PerÃ³n's widow Isabel, because it all begins in the mid 1970's. This is interesting and there might have been more of it it. The repressive regime could have been, but isn't, made to explain everything, the homemade justice, the delayed romance, even Pablo's drunkenness. Disorder and evil might well have been more emphatically shown as contaminating all aspects of life, as they clearly are in the superbly creepy 2008 Pablo Larrain film, 'Tony Manero,' about a petty criminal and John Travolta imitator in PInochet's Chile, vintage 1978.<br/><br/>Seen from the viewpoint of flashbacks, because the film begins in the 1990's when Esposito reflects back on earlier events, a young man's beautiful bride, Lilliana Morales (Carla Quevedo), is brutally raped and murdered; we see her only as a Grand Guignol tableau draped over a bed. The husband Ricardo Morales (the stiff Pablo Rago), a bank employee, never gets over it. Something is fishy from the start, when a rival judicial agent tries to pin the deed on a couple of dark-skinned immigrant workers, whom he beats into confessing. How do Esposito and Sandoval know who really is the guy? From the angle of his eyes in an old picture: it seems like something gets lost in translation at this point. Anyway, when the murderer, Isidoro GÃ³mez (the subtly creepy Javier Godino) is tracked down -- and this is when things get lively, with a buoyant, almost Hitchcockian chase and capture in a soccer stadium -- and is dramatically made to confess by Hastings through impugning his manhood -- also a very good scene -- he's released right away because he works for the dictatorship's death squad so ""what he does in his private life doesn't matter."" All this is being reviewed 25 years later when Hastings and Esposito, who've long been separated, meet again and he shows her a ""novel"" he's trying to write based on the murder investigation and his involvement in it. So the film, based on a novel by Eduardo Sacheri, is a murder mystery, a love story, a story about memory, a political study, and a buddy picture with comic overtones.<br/><br/>The latter may be its best aspect. The film is never more Argentinian or more charming than in its scenes in funky but historic-looking cafÃ©s full of seedy characters in front of tasty plates of hors d'oeuvres, everything drenched in sunlight and shadow, where Esposito goes to brood, or to retrieve Sandoval from one of his drunks. The interiors of houses are cozy and atmospheric too. If only some of the funkiness had been allowed to creep into the scenes around the court and law offices, but they are, doubtless by intent, kept coldly grand and marmoreal. Still, all the staging is ambitious and assured. There is something cozy in the way the story keeps doubling back over itself as well.<br/><br/>But Campanella may be a bit too sure of himself, because in time, over the film's 127-minute length, all the leisurely doubling-back, which seemed to suggest a magisterial, almost epic structure, begins to drain away the energy that has fed into the story from the hints of evil, the widower's determination to find the killer, and the comradely investigations of Esposito and Sandoval. You could have built a whole movie out of Sandoval. Unfortunately he doesn't make it through to the end of the picture. Campanella manages to juggle so many balls successfully for a while, but then the murder mystery falters and the makeup starts to show (overly emphasized by a preponderance of tight closeups). A creepy final revelation is followed too hard upon by a late-blooming romance. The romance is the weakest element in the story, too lukewarm and repressed most of the time (understandably, due in part to the social gap between Esposito and Hastings), and its most energetic moment, also its corniest, seems to be only a fantasy. Maybe Eduardo Sacheri makes it all work better in his novel. 'El segreto de sus ojos' has a few very fine scenes and much impeccable acting but the narrative contains kitsch elements that undercut the too limited depiction of the moral and political world of the time that the narratively less ambitious 'Tony Manero' manages so well for 1970's Chile. The film nonetheless won the Goya best picture award in Spain, and soon afterward received the Oscar for Best Foreign picture. But for all its ambition, it's not as successful as Jacques Audiard's 'A Prophet,' which it beat out for the Hollywood award."

And now we're all here, what next? <br/><br/>Flash forward to 1999 where our hero BenjamÃ­n, now retired, drops in on the 25 years older, now senior lawyer, Irene, to tell her he has decided to write a book about the case. And so, flashing back and forth, the two ends of the story get to meet.<br/><br/>It's pretty good stuff. From the unremarkable beginning, the plot moves along at a nice, if leisurely pace. The murder case gets solved quite early on, although whodunit isn't obvious, and it takes a while to track him down. There are some fantastic football (soccer) stadium shots (sorry, pet love of mine), then some other unexpected stuff happens, followed by a satisfying twisty end. Sandwiched into this are the developing relationships between the various participants. There's the almost Laurel and Hardy partnership of our hero EspÃ³sito and his drunken comrade Sandova. The unspoken respect of EspÃ³sito for the bereaved Morales. But most especially the unexpressed passion between EspÃ³sito and the unattainable Irene.<br/><br/>In El Secreto, where character arcs are as important as the plot, nobody lets the side down. Acting - from a cast unknown to me (Ricardo DarÃ­n, Soledad Villamil, Pablo Rago in the three major roles) is competent, believable and engaging. The sub-plot reaches a satisfying conclusion (albeit with echoes of 'Love in the Time of Cholera'). All in all, an engaging and competent piece of work.<br/><br/>So how it won the Oscar over 'Un ProphÃ¨te', whose subtlety, depth and complexity of both plot and character make it a vastly superior piece of work, is a mystery to me. They're not even in the same league.<br/><br/>And I have to add a postscript. Our hero, BenjamÃ­n EspÃ³sito is played by Ricardo DarÃ­n (born 1957). And not, imagine this, by Javier Bardem (born 1969, No Country for Old Men, Love in the Time of Cholera, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Penelope Cruz's latest squeeze). Who, I remember in particular from the superb 'El Mar Adentro' (The Sea Inside, 2004). Check out their pix, they could be brothers."

","Having enjoyed many Argentinian and South American films I saw the ratings and was very excited. My husband who has a great nose for rubbish saw through it in about 6 minutes, I kept going, travelling hopefully as they say...<br/><br/>I do wonder whether all the rave reviews were written by homesick Argentinians but that is really no excuse for an Academy award. That is just patronising foreigners cos they tried hard. <br/><br/>Nice photography is about it, although I always enjoy looking at the sets of bars, houses and workplaces in another part of the world.<br/><br/>It goes too fast where it should slow down and is painfully dull where it should speed up. It can't decide if it is slapstick, CSI, police procedural, political history or a heartwarming tale of old buddies solving cold cases together.<br/><br/>You always know things are going badly when a lead character starts speechifying and you lose any involvement and start wondering when this bit - which seems to be written by the director's daughter in her creative writing class so can't be cut - will end.<br/><br/>I found myself disliking even the main character's motivation for getting so emotionally involved with the case and I don't think it will give anything away to say that its just so terrible because she really is a beautiful woman.....aaahhh....<br/><br/>Despite what it says on the box there are no twists. No suspense, no nail biting and no thrills. <br/><br/>I can only assume that compared with Argentinian daytime TV this is brilliant stuff. What on earth is it doing in the top IMDb film lists!!"
"dusan-22","5","14","54","22 April 2010"," Overrated
","This film is a nice art try to make a thrilling mystery. Beautiful colors, costumes, nice recreation of the 70s and not bad acting. These are the things that most of the movies coming from Hollywood are missing and should learn something from here. What I also love about this film is sophisticated development of emotional relations between the characters along with the main movie plot. What this movie misses pretty much are serious corrections regarding scenario. Most of dialogs are too long and confusing and completely unnecessary making pretty easy plot very complicated to follow. Some scenes look very amateurish therefore. That makes whole movie too long without any necessity and the movie pace too slow making some of the scenes look like Telenovelas. All in all, we may call this film a cute work of art but pretty overrated. I mean, this film gets the same IMDb rate as 2001 Space Odyssey ... Common!!"

","Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of bashing films by calling them ""cliche"" or ""predictable"". Because, even if a movie exhibits signs of being any of those, it still might be told well enough to earn some merit in it's own right. In this case though my patience has been thoroughly exhausted.<br/><br/>I don't want to waste too much time, so just let me say that what you get here is an as straightforward and lame old man's romance as you can get. An ex employee of a district attorney basically, who never had the courage to confess his love to his female superior. And who's working his way through a former case just to find the courage to finally step up and tell her. And that's actually all there's to it. A dumb, mediocre romance wrapped into a pseudo crime story with literally no surprises or just any depth whatsoever.<br/><br/>I could go on and rip this trash apart step by step. But it isn't really worth the effort. Just take some good advice and don't waste your time on what I consider a disgrace to Argentine cinema. If this had come out of Hollywood, OK, I wouldn't have expected any better. But not Argentine cinema.<br/><br/>Booooooooooooh."
"MacacoBanditi","5","12","46","22 April 2010"," A decent but overrated movie
","I think Campanella was never able to decide whether to make a police thriller, a suspense drama, a romantic comedy or a comedy of manners, then decided to stick in a bit of everything. What emerged is a hodgepodge that considerably reduces the effectiveness of the film. There are constant and annoying changes of tone: you get into the oppressive atmosphere of courts and then you are transported to a comedy scene in a countryside town. The action takes place in two units of time, the 70s and the year 2000, but interest is almost entirely concentrated in the past. The current scenes are just forced dialog between Darin and Villamil that at no time justify the revisionism on which the whole story is based. To add confusion, real events are interspersed with imaginary situations from the head of Darin writing his novel.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>A court employee retires and decides to write a novel about a court case in which he participated during the 70s. This is loosely tied to a very feeble and uninteresting love story between himself and a colleague. Both the court case and his love story are unfinished business he somehow decides to deal with now, although we are never told why. In fact, the motivation of any of the characters for what they do is hardly clear ever.<br/><br/>The crime story has a good hook up to halfway through the movie, when the case is solved, without too many turns in fact, and it becomes clear that the murderer is Isidoro GÃ³mez. The interrogation scene, on top of the gratuitous male nudity bit, is not an ode to finesse. So instead of punching him stupid until he confesses (after all that's what they did with the other two poor fellows before), Hastings decides to get him pumped? Wow. Psychopaths are usually devilishly clever and, by definition, unbreakable psychologically, so you would expect him to just play along under duress. Here they just got lucky and caught the stupidest psychopathic murderer of all time.<br/><br/>IMO the film climaxes at the scene where Gomez, now free and doing free-lance work for the paramilitary forces of the government (hint to Argentina history here, very obscure to foreigners though), enters the elevator with the other two and forks out a gun. This sequence is great. From here on it is difficult to imagine what twists and turns might top this, because the several story lines of narrative converge neatly with historical framework. But no, Campanella's weak spot for Hollywood comes out. He switches the focus to the romantic side plot, and starts to add turns to the crime story to use it as a catalyst for the development of the romance between Esposito and Hastings. This affair has less credibility than that of Anakin Skywalker and Natalie Portman and really does not come even close to generate the same interest as the investigation of rape followed by murder. From this point onward there's an abuse of closeups on and references to eyes (""the love I saw in the eyes of this dude"", etc). Okay, we get it, the movie is called The Secret In Their Eyes, you do not need to hit us with a pan on the head with it, genius. Darin, who for those who have seen him before, had been playing himself quite flawlessly, starts to under and overact horribly. He goes after Morales, who in 25 years has aged about 50 and is even having trouble to walk (!). A very forced dialogs ensues, and when Esposito leaves, Campanella turns the ""Agatha Christie Mode: ON"". Esposito begins to tie up loose ends with flashbacks of pictures and voices, so he turns around and well, the film finally flounders with the absurd and grotesque scene of the home prison.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>Technically the film is flawless. Photography is great and the director uses the camera smartly to set the tone. The plot is compelling and leaves one on the edge of the seat until halfway through, where the writer obviously ran out of ideas and decided to stuff things in for sheer convenience. The potential to exploit the convulsed Argentine political background of the 1970s is wasted. The moral overtone about justice and punishment is extremely risky and borderline appalling, I'm surprised no one has commented on this so far. The motivation of characters is seldom clear. The ending scene made me cringe for its cheesiness and implausibility. <br/><br/>All in all it is worth watching this movie, but it is far from the memorable masterpiece some people have represented. Thus I have focused mostly on the negative aspects of it, but there are various aspects on which it does deserve praise, especially coming from a country were the film-making industry is small and chronically underfunded."
"dardo766","9","25","113","30 October 2009"," not so great
","since all the comments here about this movie are so overwhelmingly positive I thought I should write something since I didn't think the movie was anything special<br/><br/>the whole movie suffers from a problem that affects many talented people: they have a good idea so they put it on the movie even if it doesn't make sense logistically<br/><br/>the biggest example of this is the killer's letters to his mother, no one will ever make numerous references to something on letters directed to one particular person if that person doesn't understand what the references mean, for example I love videogames but I wouldn't write a letter to my mother saying things like ""I feel like Lara Croft on a ledge"" or ""he was a tough as Solid Snake"", she would have no idea what I'm talking about, also on ALL the letters they found there were references to Racing? come on <br/><br/>that's the point: the idea to get the guy through something he can't let go off while hiding is sound but the Racing Club thing makes no sense, for the letter issue that I mentioned and for the almost impossible chance to find him on the stadium among the crowd even if they went to 50 games, they wanted to use the ""passion"" angle but they didn't care to find a plausible way to implement it, it was done much better on the ending of Point Break where they found bad guy surfing<br/><br/>also the interrogation scene seemed like something out of a Perry Mason parody or The Simpsons, actually it reminded me a lot of that Simpsons episode where Bart and Lisa and trying to prove Sideshow Bob cheated on the election, so they say in court ""I don't think you're smart enough to pull this off"", so the guy breaks and confesses (I did it, I did it all!!), it's the same thing but played for real, not for laughs, they had nothing on the guy he could've just kept quiet and get away with it<br/><br/>also some of the performances were weak, in particular Pablo Rago, who seemed all wrong for such an intense part and he completely ruined the ending, what could've been a powerful scene was made almost moot because he gives the audience nothing there, I thought Francella was great but I found Darin a little on autopilot, he was good because he's a great actor but I felt his performance was a little phoned in, too much relying on his natural appeal and regular guy persona, he was a lot better on El Aura, a much superior film <br/><br/>the last thing I want to mention is all the swearing, which was childish at best and stupid at worst, for example the scene where Darin confronts the guy who beat up the roof workers for a confession, he tells him that he's going report him, so the other guys says ""I'll wipe my ass with your report"" so Darin replies ""I'll shove it up your ass first"", that just meaningless high school kids banter, all they're saying means nothing, Campanella should know better<br/><br/>anyway, good and solid, far from great<br/><br/>edit: well, about some of the comments of my review, first it is true that the chances of finding the killer among the crowd are increased if they're only looking on the visitor's area, but still it is a slim possibility, furthermore they didn't even know for sure that the guy was a regular on stadiums, it was just a guess, the fact that you are a fan of a soccer club and its old stars doesn't mean that you're still going to see them every week, and sometimes it can mean quite the opposite (I went to see River every week when Francescoli and Salas played but I would never go now)<br/><br/>and again on the original text I didn't even mention the biggest problem with the plot, the only reason why the focused the investigation on the right guy was because they found a picture of a group of people where he was looking at the victim, if it wasn't for that picture they would've never known about him, and the fact that he's looking at her on the picture means NOTHING (that's a pure example of wanting to go from A to C without giving a crap that your B is no good, George Lucas is the master of that)<br/><br/>and about the wearing, the problem is not the curse words or how offensive they are, it's how meaningless they're used, on the example that I mentioned they're talking about a piece of paper, they're not threating each other or insulting each other in any way, that's the problem<br/><br/>the movie suffers from lack of self discipline, they were going to use the ""catch the killer by his passions"" angle no matter what, because it's a great idea, but to use it first you have to find a way to make it work on the story, not just shove in there and hope that people won't notice how they get from A to C"
"moviestics","9","2","4","7 August 2014"," One of the best foreign language movies I've seen...
","I'm not a big fan of Argentinian cinema but there are quite a few of their films which I enjoyed and this is on the top. <br/><br/>Through the first one-and-half hour into the movie, it seems like a direction-less journey with too many sub-stories and neither seems to end. But the next half hour clarifies all the doubts stupendously and you are left with a life-long memory of a great climax and a feeling of great satisfaction. <br/><br/>A retired federal agent, BenjamÃ­n Esposito, is deeply haunted by memory of a case he has worked on in past. It is 1999 and he wants to write a novel, his first, on that case, named Coloto case. But he is having troubles getting started. He decides to visit his friend Irene Menendez- Hastings who also worked on the same case with him. She tells him to start at the starting. He does so. It is June, 1974 when he gets information of a girl raped and murdered. Liliana Coloto was attacked when she was alone at her home. Esposito assures her widower that the murdered will get a life-sentence for this crime. Esposito starts working on the case with Hastings and one more of their friend. When they are searching Coloto's house in her hometown, they find some photos and a suspicious young man, Isidoro Gomez, is in almost every picture, eyes always on Coloto. Esposito believes that Gomez is the real murderer. But Hastings denies his claims and tells him that it is impossible to identify a murderer just by his eyes.<br/><br/>Anyways, they keep searching for more clues about Mr. Gomez but find disappointment only. <br/><br/>They give up the case after sometime. A year after that, Esposito runs into Ricardo Morales, the widower of Liliana Coloto, and sees that he sits at the railway station on daily surveillance hoping that someday Gomez will pass from there. Banjamin Esposito is deeply impressed and inspired. He asks Hastings to reopen the case. And after that, the story takes turns, from mindless to mind-blowing. Who is the real murderer? Will Esposito finish his novel? Will Morales ever will be able to live a 'life'? Watch the movie to know. And again, watch out for the climax!<br/><br/>There was probably something between Esposito and Hastings during those old days but that something got buried as the case was ceased. The romance is unearthed when Esposito pays regular visits to Hastings for his novel. She seems to understand him more as a person. There is a twisting touch to this romance towards the end. I'm sure Ricardo Darin, who plays Benjamin Esposito, must have had gone through a tough process preparing for this role, especially mentally. The character he plays in this film is haunted by the memory of that case and wants to get rid of them and thus has decided to write his experiences and memories of the case in his novel. Also, through the case, Esposito had to face some difficulties especially when he wanted to reopen the case but everyone refused him. Towards the end, Esposito seems more of a concerning parent than a federal agent. Getting into mind of such a complex character is definitely not an easy task. But Ricardo performs exceedingly well here. Not for a single time you can complain about the characterization and some credit goes to the writer also who provided so much history and sense to the character.<br/><br/>Soledad Villamil as Judge Hastings provides much needed depth to the character. Hastings is beautiful and smart. She knows what is to be done and how. When Esposito comes troubled to her, she can well understand his concerns and helps him in every way possible. She has a working process of her own and helps in the case a lot with her brains and her beauty. As Ricardo Morales, Pablo Rago shines all the way. This is the character who will bring tears in your eyes in the climax. Juan Jose Campanella is writer-director of the film. To be honest, I love this 'writer-director' thing. I feel when the writer of the film becomes the director, he can do a lot more than he has imagined while writing. Juan does a brilliant job here. He knows the characters and provides them enough time to develop. Also, there is some back-story to every character which helps the audience understand them better. The story of this film is very engaging but sometimes we might feel that this is going in no direction and I think that is the beauty of the story. I'm not going to put much light on the brilliance of the story as it will lessen the fun.<br/><br/>In most of the scenes, there is no requirement of a background music and neither there is. But towards the end, a melodious and a dark music helps rising the mood of the film. An emotional touch in the climax brought tears in my eyes. Felix Monti's music is a treat and you ought not miss it. The music is placed at perfect places with perfect melodies. Superb job! This film won the Academy Award in 2010 beating the favorite, The White Ribbon. I haven't watched that one yet so can't compare the two. All I can say is that The Secret In Their Eyes was well deserving for the Oscar nod and I'm very happy that it got it. Also, this film bagged almost every award at Argentina Film Awards.<br/><br/>The Secret in Their Eyes is full of emotions and thrills. The first one- and-half hour of the film takes its time to develop and is a bit slow but the beauty of these 90 minutes resides in the next 30 minutes. This one is one of my favorite foreign movies. And definitely my favorite Argentinian movie. I will end this review with this question: How does one live a life full of nothing?"
"batuhanyahya","8","2","4","8 August 2011"," Image is More Important Than Words
","Juan Jose Campanella's ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was hailed as masterful piece of work instantly after it's release and many who saw the movie was mesmerized by it and i am one of those who able to see the movie rather late and it is really disappointing to see what i miss in that space of time between i heard about the movie and not watching it. first of all campanella's journey is a true one both the director and the screenwriter(Eduardo sancheri) have this sentimental understanding about the nature of the human kind so the emphasis on the ""eye"" subject that we see in the title of the movie is not just some coincidence it is actually a little hint about the core of the movie the filmmaker is not interested in the words or big statements what he's interested in is in fact the power of the image campanella shows us his intentions throughout the movie with wonderful camera use, little but effective dialog, magnificent pacing and editing and of course the performance he squeeze out from his actors and actresses... the movie starts with some truly memorable image actually the scene where the espotiso just starting to write his memoirs about the morales case and he recalls this beautiful, innocent and young girl, this is the mark of something that ends, seems to follow him, a cup of lemon tea and a sun beam that washes her cheek and campelena cut to esposito ripping of the page he just writes, with anger, and he starts over again but this sweet memory now turns into some sadistic rape scene and instantly he cuts back to esposito who ""now gently"" ripping off this page too... now this is maybe the best and simple example about the magnificent editing and directing about this film. there are lots of memorable scenes which audience feels time slips under his/her feets by simply playing with time forward and backward director creates uneasy yet acceptable atmosphere and leaves the audience to himself/herself, he/her has to understand the characters all by himself/herself and while we talking about the atmosphere of the film there are some important subjects that need to be told first the camera work is just amazing especially the stadium scene stands as a singular proof of that just how masterful that scene is... just remarkable... single plan shot from start to finish lasts about six minutes and it is really something any cinema fan should see some other director who tries do that would probably ruin it but campanella just handles it magnificently, i wasn't believe this to be true while i watch it i still find it hard to believe this to be done with so powerfully and of course another great effect on this atmosphere is no other than political background of the 70's Argentina the coup De et-at was taking place at the same time leftist movements were actively trying to overthrow the military government and this situation holds some key points in the development of the story but the director want to keep this at the background what he wants is to tell more humane story he don't want to preach politics but he criticize the military government and what it takes away from people of Argentina, as a strong political thriller enthusiast and as a person who lived in a country that resembles in many ways to the South American examples i wish campanella bring the political sub-plot to more attention which is an very important issue for all repressed countries but what he already does is really generous as what it is... the acting is another very solid department of the movie. the all three leads are really very fine delivering the goods. but the real winner is Guillermo Francella his playing is different, mature and yet childish portrayal of the Sandoval adds so many to film expends it's boundaries and also lets other characters to breathe as well really important figure in the script and rancella really understands even adds something more to his character. also Ricardo Darin, sole dad villa-mil, Pablo rago and Javier godino all play their parts successfully... and there is the script, at the beginning of the review i said it is a movie of the (haunting)images not the words or big talks and the script(delivered by sancheri and campanella) does exactly that and tones down the dialog it gives space both to actors and directors to really play out their roles. i am actually not against the ""full of words"" cinema of 60's(remember Lumet's theater adaptations in America, kitchen-sink influence in england) but as some important guys(like Hitchcock) said sometime ago a movie should not be about some talking images it has to move, ""go some place(literally)"" and this movie does that and this is important images stuck in your face just like vertigo's dreaming sequence now i have another images that haunts my mind and this is the real wonderful side of this film it stuck with you never let you go this is what cinema should do image should conquer yes there are many other films who could do that but this one takes it's subject with such a heartfelt passion it is something that came from inside i believe this movie is not just made for sake of a movie it wanted to tell us something that we don't want to see and do this with feeling just for that it deserves 10 points..."

","My first movie review at IMDb and i couldn't ask for any better film than this. After i watched this film winning the Oscar in ""Best foreign language"" film category, I was very keenly waiting for its DVD to release here in U.S. 3 weeks ago I finally bought the DVD and immediately watched it. One word AMAZING!!! This is cinema at its best and sets the bar so high for the world of cinema. These kinds of movies are hard to come by. Its a gem. Its one of those films that slithers through your body and sinks in long afterwards. Everything is just nearly perfect, with the terrific casting led by Ricardo DarÃ­n and Soledad Villamil with strong supporting performance from Guillermo Francella (who is a delight to watch) also is a source for comic relief. Dialogue, screenplay,and cinematography are top notch. And one could only get tire of trying to find the synonyms for 'brilliance' to describe the direction of the film. Every word doesn't feel that it will do justice to describe the stunning direction of Juan JosÃ© Campanella. He does an excellent job telling such a difficult story in such a flawless manner. Basically it is a love story with a detective mystery thriller twist to it.<br/><br/>Recently retired criminal court investigator Benjamin (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel based on a twenty-five-year-old unresolved rape and murder case which still haunts him. Sharing his plans with Irene (Soledad Villamil), the beautiful judge and former colleague he has secretly been in love with for years, Benjamin's initial involvement with the case is shown through flashbacks, as he sets out to identify the murderer. But Benjamin's search for the truth will put him at the center of a judicial nightmare, as the mystery of the heinous crime continues to unfold in the present, testing the limits of a man seeking justice and personal fulfillment at last.<br/><br/>Everyone in the film have acted splendidly. They make it look so easy, which is not. Its the kind of a role that requires them to act and deliver message by talking less through their mouth, but rather with their eyes. First rate performance by everyone in the film. The flashbacks shown back and forth do not create confusion at all. There are some moments that gives viewers a chill and the actors does a superb job in creating that. The metaphor in the film is clearly about how eyes can say many things without actually saying a word. At the end of the day, its an outstanding stylish and intelligent Argentine film that is destine to become a world classic cinema. A MUST WATCH!!"

This Oscar winner for best foreign language film seamlessly combines all of these elements without disjointing the grim narrative.<br/><br/>Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Bob Dylan), is a retired criminal investigator, who battles inertia by writing about the Morales case, a ghastly unresolved case of rape and murder of a young bride he was assigned to 25 years ago.<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of a corrupt 1970s Argentina, Esposito decides whilst writing his book to revisit the case â€“ and in the process, Irene (Soledad Villamil), his superior from the period, whom he has always harboured feelings for.

Whether it's Esposito and Irene who cravenly conceal their love for each other, or the suspect whose eyes implicate him, or even the widower who is suspiciously unperturbed by his wife's death. Writer-director Juan Jose Campanella guards all the secrets and doesn't reveal anything until the denouement.<br/><br/>I remember seeing Darin many years ago in a superb film about con artists called 'Nine Queens'. In that film he was a tour de force. Here his performance is reserved to the point of indifference. Plus he's much too groomed â€“ particularly in old age â€“ to be the wizened investigator he should be.<br/><br/>However, the badinage between him and Pablo more than makes up for any splinters in his performance. It's as witty as any Woody Allen screenplay. There's a chase scene which takes place in a football stadium which, put simply, is one of the most fascinating scenes cinema has offered in my lifetime.<br/><br/>A word of caution. There's a reason why this film is certified for persons aged 18 and above. Expect full-frontal nudity (male and female), an explicit rape scene and perennial profanity.<br/><br/>As I took my seat in the refurbished Midlands Art Centre (MAC) in Birmingham to watch this film, a jovial usher whispered, 'You'll love this film'. He was right. Trust me. Trust that usher. Trust the MAC audience. This is one you won't want to miss.<br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net"

","Great works of art are made with great love and care. They take something out of the souls of their creators. So give them your complete love and attention for the short time that you will experience them, and more often than not, they will remain with you for a long time, filling your moments with the fragrance of their beauty and magic. This is my advice to all those who crave fast-paced entertainment these days. This is a beautiful film. Perfect in many ways, from the cinematic technique to the performances. The subject matter and the themes of love and revenge will the haunt the discerning viewer for a long time after the film is over. It is a thought provoking film, but one that does so through the emotive senses, I felt. It is difficult to describe the scene towards the end where Godino's character requests to be spoken to by his own jailer. A great cinematic moment. The simplicity of the moment. A lonely old man wanting be spoken to by a companion in his last days, and yet the significance of his request in the context of all that has happened before."

","""If that's what happened...why didn't you take me with you?""<br/><br/>The Secret in Their Eyes is a thoughtful, layered mystery/drama from Argentina. The story is split between two time periods: the investigation by the three main characters of the rape and murder of a young woman in 1974, and the reunion of two of those characters in 1999. Benjamin (Ricardo Darin) is writing a novel about the 25 year-old case that ended with an unfavorable outcome , and in the course of recounting what happened, we learn about the past events and the rather complicated past that Benjamin had with his superior, Irena (Soledad Villamil).<br/><br/>What makes the movie so interesting is the relationships between the characters. Ricardo Darin, Guillermo Francella, and Soledad Villamil are all wonderful in their roles, and the camaraderie the two men and the chemistry between Darin and Francella makes what happens to the characters feel very involving and real.<br/><br/>This really is a movie that has a little something for everyone. The unfolding mystery of what happened 25 years ago and the events that are revealed in 1999 are interesting and ultimately satisfying, and so is the understated relationship between the male and female leads. It's hard to imagine anyone not liking this, unless they just have a negative opinion of subtitles."

","Wow, what a director. Instead of upping the pace, he lets scenes breathe and develop, leading to unexpected details that make the characters so much more lovable. He lets the leads shine, he doesn't overdose on the violin quartets, his camera angles genuinely surprise, he manages to run a tight art direction without making it a ""design movie"". Usually, a great script makes or breaks a movie for me. This script was good, but not brilliant. Campanella just goes to work. <br/><br/>The past 20 years, filmmakers have slowly increased the pace and editing. Pace excites us and has the additional advantage of hiding weak parts in the script by bombarding the audience with sheer visceral impact. Now, I always prefer a superficially exciting movie over a dreadful, semi-profound sleeper. But nothing is better than this: a movie that finds its own pace and just pulls the audience along, with their full consent."

","This really is an absolutely marvellous film. It really blew me away. A retired legal counsellor Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) wants to write a book about a case he investigated 25 years ago. The case was a brutal rape and murder of a young girl and it still plays on his mind after all that time. He struggles to get it started so visits his former boss Irene Menendez Hastings (Soledad Villamil) to discuss it as she was also his superior at the time and the two have a close relationship. The film then moves back and forward from the case at the time to the present day as the story, along with each of the personal journeys of Esposito, Hastings and the grieving husband Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) are slowly revealed. The two main characters have superb chemistry, the film has some amazing shots and scenes, particularly one at a football match which is really exciting and there are some great characters including the quite hilarious assistant of Esposito, Pablo, played by Argentinian comic actor Guillermo Francella, who has a great way of answering his phone. It's a great story, well written, no scenes are wasted, and there's a quirky side tale of the missing letter 'A' which is really cool. Do not miss this one whatever you do.

"Quinoa1984","8","2","4","16 June 2010"," a solid page turner of a mystery movie, with a few truly great scenes
","One of Howard Hawks' axioms was ""A film should have three good scenes and no bad ones,"" meaning, basically, wow them a few times, and just make sure you don't suck too much. The Secret in Their Eyes is one of those kinds of movies, and while I wasn't impressed quite enough to agree with the Academy (awarding it Best Foreign film at the Oscars over truly magnificent films like The White Ribbon and Un Prophete), it gives an audience what it wants: believable and unpredictable characters, and a story that flips around through time but doesn't get too confusing. Certainly this is the kind of mystery movie, like a recent Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, that could potentially play to mass audiences (say, a small theater at a cineplex at a mall) and do pretty decently. That it's sometimes dark and a little crazy, with a couple of terrific performances, helps greatly.<br/><br/>In the film, we follow a rape/murder case that starts in 1974 for Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin), who is called Counselor but is basically a detective. He and his partner, Sandoval (excellent drunk side-character played by Francella), are trying to solve this case, where a woman was brutally raped and murdered, but the killer is elusive, seemingly disappeared. But then there are some clues that arise, the ""Passion"" element, and (spoiler) the killer is discovered. But this is barely even through the halfway point, and the twists keep coming after this, with constant inter-cutting from 1974 to 1999 when Esposito, having finished a book, still has his memories of what happened in the case, how something about it ended, be it what happened with the killer, and Sandoval, and the widower himself, Morales (Pablo Rago), doesn't sit well with him.<br/><br/>It makes some sense looking up the director Juan Camponella, that he's directed far more episodes of Law & Order SVU and House than he has films since it really does work best as a kind of conventional murder- mystery (or just straight up 'what happened') story. And, like on those shows, when twists happen the audience is meant to go ""Wow"" or ""Oh my God"". This is all well and good, but what about the artistry of it? Well, aside from the stellar acting, mostly by Francella and in his few minutes on screen Javier Godino as the perp (plus some sexy-without- trying acting by Villamil), it's those three scenes that stick out best. <br/><br/>One of these is when Espositio and Sandoval, having tracked the ""passion"" element to soccer, go to a soccer match, after a whole month of going to games and trying to see if the killer will show up. He finally is spotted, somehow, and runs. The camera-work in this scene is very much of the intense hand-held sometimes-shaky variety, but it's never false in its intentions, and the length of the shots are impressive as well. The standard shooting of a lot of the rest of the movie- save for some impressive and intentionally exceptional close-ups on some things- is broken up by this. Another scene is an interrogation, and this involves Esposito's boss, played by Villamil. This is the kind of interrogation scene that one wishes were this smart and harrowing as on Law & Order; you really don't know how far the characters will take the scene, but you know the actors are game and it makes it exciting.<br/><br/>The last really great scene comes near the end, and while I can't reveal it- not as a spoiler but just as to not spoil the fun- its a combination of horrifying cinematography (or 'dark' kind), and the subtlety of the acting. When Camponella is able to strike the iron hot, The Secret in Their Eyes works amazing. The rest of the film is good too, just not as extraordinary as it thinks it might be, or could be. It's an interesting testament to mourning and memory, the loss or lack of love and what justice really means."

I went in with high expectations and was not disappointed. This movie is really a kind of poetry for people who don't like artsy stuff. Quite easy to follow but also beautiful and compelling. I figured out most of the big twists before they happened but it still works as a crime movie but manages to hit a number of big themes: class/longing/loss/politics/despair/humor. Filmed beautifully others have mentioned the awesome pan of the soccer stadium and I liked the dreamy opening sequences as well and the lovely wide open shots of the the court house.

It makes the movie very enjoyable. In terms of music, it really is a brilliant job because it accompanies the appropriate scenes, making the experience very moving. The variety of locations where the film takes place made it not tedious, on the contrary, it made it exciting.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked the most about the movie was the acting of the characters because they made it interesting and really made you feel empathy for the situations described.

","A fairly compelling Argentinean pot boiler that weaves past and present into a part mystery thriller/part romantic drama about life's unresolved dilemmas.<br/><br/>A former legal counselor is haunted by a brutal rape and murder case that goes unsolved -- or rather, it's solved, but the criminal isn't brought to justice because of corruption within the Argentinean legal system.

It's on shakier ground with the romance, primarily because the two leads don't have a lot of chemistry. We're just told they're smitten with each other, but we never really feel it. Also, the film's execution at times teeters toward the painfully strained, most notably in a scene where the two protagonists are trying to bully a confession out of the man they suspect of being the rapist/murderer. I always felt the film was trying to be smarter than the material would allow, as if the film makers couldn't be content with letting it be a plot-driven thriller (which is what it's really begging to be). But despite these criticisms, it's a very good and crafty film.

"joshbaileynch","Null","0","0","15 July 2011"," An allegorical detective story
","'The Secret in their Eyes' is, on the whole, a very well constructed film. The direction has real visual flare at times (especially noticeable in the dream-like flash-back that opens the film) and the performances are generally excellent. If one were to be hyper-critical then one might point out the rather invasive use of a highly melodramatic musical score at times, or odd moments where the plot feels clichéd and unbelievable (for instance getting a confession from a rapist by insulting him about the size of his manhood until he becomes so enraged that he forgets himself and admits what he has done). Where the film works best is as an allegory for a troubling Argentinian past. Set in the late 90s, the narrative deals with a man attempting to understand and come to terms with a brutal rape and murder that he was involved in investigating in the early/mid 1970s. This was the time during which the Peron government was over-thrown in Argentina and replaced by a brutal regime which embarked on the ""dirty war"" against its own people - a time of government sanctioned murder, torture and disappearances. It is easy to see the rape/murder victim as emblematic of both the state and its people during the 1970s. The crime is en expression of the way in which innocence and trust (it is significant that the murderer is in fact known to his victim) were violated and destroyed by a government which betrayed its own population. The film emphasises this by tracing the way in which the legal system itself becomes increasingly corrupted and obstructive of justice with the regime change that came in the '70s. Our liberal and morally decent/responsible hero finds himself increasingly frustrated by judges who attempt to block his investigation and who ultimately free the murderer in order for the government to use him as an assassin in the ""dirty war"".<br/><br/>All of this is set against the recurring theme of memory and the need to find some kind of catharsis and redemption through exploring and resolving past horrors/trauma. The hero's decision to return to the case twenty five years after the murder suggests a nation that needs to return to its own past in order to put things in their place. This said, the films message is ultimately a positive one - the hero learns the need to not only confront the past, but also to find some accommodation with it so he can move on with his life, which has been held in a kind of limbo (perhaps much like Argentinian society) since the murder took place. This progress is particularly marked by the way in which, at the end of the narrative, he finally takes the plunge and begins a romantic relationship with the woman he has been in love with since his days working on the case in the DA's office. It seems that he (Argentina) can only move on and progress towards more healthy and happy times if he (it) can first confront and recognise the nature of the past; something that is apparently impossible for the victims husband who takes another path - one in which he remains trapped in the horror of the past and whose life effectively ends with the death of his beautiful young wife in the 1970s."

","The first thing to mention is perhaps although this movie juxtaposes between two time frames 25 years apart (early 70s and late 90s), it is easy to follow because progression along both timelines is simple and linear.<br/><br/>Part of this movie is a crime thriller about tracking down a rapist-murderer (Javier Godino). The bitter irony is that under the lawless environment of Argentina in the early 70s, the convicted criminal was soon released because he can serve as a useful tool and weapon in the hands of the extreme right government. It's those who brought him to justices that became fugitives.<br/><br/>A parallel theme is the subtle romance between those two who brought the criminal to justice. Irene (Soledad Villamil) was an Ivy League legal fresh grad returning to Argentina, naïve to the harsh political realities that corrupted every aspect of daily life. Working for her was seasoned court investigator Benjamin (Ricardo Darin), street-wise but still with a fire in his belly. Their social and education discrepancy was sufficient to keep their feelings for each other at the smouldering stage. When the criminal was set free, while Irene was protected by the status of his politically powerful father, Benjamin had to go into exile, in the form of a transfer to a remote area. When their passion finally flared at the train station as they said goodbye, it was a little too late.<br/><br/>A third theme evolves around the victim's husband (Pablo Rago) who saw the cruel reality even before the rapist-murderer of his wife was apprehended. To him, even killing the criminal (and thereby becoming a criminal himself) was too light a punishment and the nearest to poetic justice would be life imprisonment. But under the environment of the time, there was little hope that justice would be served. He seemed destined to live the rest of his life in gnawing agony at the injustice.<br/><br/>The movie actually starts 25 years later with Irene now a judge (married with children) and Benjamin retired (divorced) and trying to write a novel based on this painful case. Upon their re-encounter, he asks her to bring back the past memories (and with that's, inevitably, past emotions) but her gentle response is ""The past is not in my jurisdiction"". As the story unfolds as the audiences enters into a roller-coaster of many-faceted emotions as they realize that there are a lot of loose ends from 25 years ago that clamour to be resolved. The final plot twist is echoed in my summary line.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly superb.<br/><br/>Much talked about is one long (10 to 15 minutes) take in the middle of the movie starting with an aerial shot zooming in onto a soccer match in a packed huge stadium and ending with a close-up of apprehending the criminal. While a lot is credit is due to this clever endeavour, it is a contriving show-off, sort of ""Mother, look, no hands""! There seems to be a split-second cutting when the camera zooms into the spectator crowd scene but even if that is the case, the technical achievement of the ensuring portion of the continuous take deserves credit. But for good style, I would much prefer the long-take at the beginning of ""Snake eyes"" (1998). And then, of course, neither of these is anywhere remotely comparable to ""Russian Ark"" (2002).<br/><br/>Looking within ""The secret in their eyes"", I much prefer a far less showy montage starting with the sound of a whistling kettle off screen. The current scene is then cut into a dimly-lit frame with THE kettle in the blurred background and the protagonist at the front struggling with the draft of his novel. This is followed by a close-up to the desk, showing his hand putting down a pen, all the while with sound of the kettle whistling in the background. His hand then disappears from the screen while the camera still focuses on the table with writing paper and pen, and after a few seconds, the whistle stops."

","In this film by Juan José Campanella Esposito, a retired legal counsel, decides to write a novel about one of his past cases in hopes of finding closure. The case was an unresolved homicide of Liliana Morales, wife of Ricardo Morales. Decades later he returns to Buenos Aires to talk with some of the people involved in the case and he ends up discovering more than he expected to. <br/><br/>This film was funny at times and also had an interesting twist with all of the detective work and Esposito went back through the period of time when he was investigating the crime. The ending is far from what I was expecting and I'm not sure that I like it.<br/><br/>The movie brings into question the idea of justice and how it is served, while providing a slight criticism of the government and their dealings within the judicial system. It definitely gets the audience thinking about what sort of punishment is justified for a crime and whether or not it is the government's responsibility to carry out justice."
"yris2002","6","3","9","28 June 2010"," A plain plot and an old-fashioned style, counterbalanced by heartfelt interpretations
","The movie does not stand out for originality, both in plot and style. The story of a former federal justice agent, seeking for justice and bringing to light a cold case of rape and murder, in Buenos Aires, after 25 years, sounds more suitable for a TV series, rather than cinematic, the plot proves plain and developed in a somehow predictable and linear way (whereas the hint at some some political connection is not developed), except for some sudden time-shifts and some strong shots impressing the viewer, but not preventing the movie from sounding too old-fashioned in manner and style. <br/><br/>Having said this, it would be unfair not to appreciate its heartfelt interpretations. The actor and the actress playing Benjamin and Irene are subtly paired, their individual histories and relation are not so well explored, but they get to communicate passion for justice and life, as well. It is also fair to mention the final interesting, plot-twist, and some emotionally and almost physically involving scenes, such as the one where Irene manages to get a declaration of guilt from the murderer, by provoking him: really shivering. As a whole, a wisely thought, almost by the book movie: it proceeds with a dry, plain, style, direct to the end, where no originality, excess, specialness, or simply out of tune element is to be perceived."

","Some of the best movies I've ever seen came from Argentina, but the more like American movies they become the less interesting they become. Maybe this one was made with winning an Oscar in mind, to please Hollywood audiences, and that's why it's so superficial and annoying and predictable - and popular.<br/><br/>The hallmark of an American movie is good-guys-versus-bad-guys melodrama, in which the bad guys are REALLY BAD and the good guys are REALLY GOOD; the bad guys win at first so we get all indignant and outraged, and then the advantage lurches back and forth between good and bad a few times before finally the good guys win, the good guy who's not good enough for the girl wins her heart anyway, and they ride off into the sunset together holding hands. That's been the Hollywood formula for more than a hundred years, and it's The Secret in Their Eyes in a nutshell.<br/><br/>This sleek, glossy, superficial movie could just as easily have been made in Hollywood with George Clooney and Julia Roberts (no... she's too old: whoever the latest Julia Roberts is) - and maybe it will be. They can do better than this in Argentina, but (as with movie makers the world over) less money nearly always makes a better movie.

Although the film is artfully shot taking advantage of dazzling cinematography and set pieces, the story happens to be very conventional in its outcome. Besides, the narrative is far from gripping that is the result of subpar writing and unmemorable performances by actors. I was never particularly enthralled with the exception of two subsequent scenes. The first involves a superbly directed chase after a presumed murderer at the stadium, while the second showcases his hilarious interrogation in which his manhood is being questioned by a female investigator.

The stadium sequence is just a great sequence of scenes with the illusion of being 'uncut'. One thing that is weird for me is the romance part that is not really balanced.

","THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES is a powerful multi-decade Argentinian thriller, which brilliantly switches genre from police procedural to political thriller to horror, whilst also retaining elements of workplace comedy and unfulfilled romance. Its hero, haunted and lonely, decides to write a novel about the unsolved rape-murder case - brutally but not luridly depicted - which has hung over him for years. The film flits through memory and literature (very Latin American) as it navigates the squalid reality of Peronist Argentina, where murder is rewarded, the cops are more brutal than the criminals, and love is doomed. Exciting, amusing and horrific it combines technical brilliance - a sublime chase through a football match - with great drama and a savage, almost Biblical, conclusion in which vengeance and a last hope for love are mixed.

Unlike a lot of films however, that throw you a curved ball right at the end and that you had no chance of ever guessing it, none of the jolts in this film are in any way unrealistic. You watch it & you think; ""so that's what happened""! I can't speak too highly of the film. If you haven't yet seen it, please do so. It is utterly wonderful.

"destinysilva13","8","1","2","23 May 2011"," Some thoughts
","El Secreto De Sus Ojos has an artistic element not seen in many movies. This drama-thriller about a murder case also involving unspoken love is visually and emotionally appealing to national and international audiences. The themes throughout are time, love, closure, regret, corruption, and injustice.<br/><br/>Visually, the film contains interesting camera angles such as the incredible crane shot for the soccer scene. There are many close ups to emphasize the actors emotion during this scene. There are also point of view shots where the viewer can see what the character is discovering or looking at along with them. These shots create anxiety and anticipation for the audience. Throughout this movie the lighting is very intentional and often focuses on the actors faces. The lighting changes from being dark and focused during serious scenes to being overhead and bright during happy scenes.<br/><br/>Emotionally this film tugs at the heart strings of the audience. The viewers are drawn in to Benjamin Esposito's story of not being able to get over this murder case and proclaim his love for Irene. Ricardo Darin does an incredible job at portraying a passionate character. Soledad Villamil has the ability to act as an authoritative, strong, yet emotional woman.<br/><br/>Something many international audiences would not know about this time period was about the ongoing Dirty War. This is important to note because it provides historical relevance and a deeper understanding of this murder case as it pertains to this specific era in Argentina. The Dirty War was a government campaign in Argentina between 1976-1983, that would ""disappear"" Argentineans who were against the military-run government, called the junta. The war relates to one of the underlying themes in the movie – corruption of the justice system.<br/><br/>All together the various components of this film make it an easy watch. It has emotional appeal inspired by superb acting. National and international audiences alike can enjoy the storyline and come away not just having watched a mindless entertainment film, but instead having watched a movie that provokes a deeper, heart-felt and reflective reaction."

I thought the lighting was too dark, it makes the movie too heavy, it's obvious that the subject of the movie is dark. The question is why make it obvious? The movie also looks very out of date as in terms of the cinematography. THe movie looks like it was made in the early and mid 90's although the story takes place in the 70's. The movie is also too long, they could have easily cut some of the scenes out and should have shorten them. The makeup was also very poor-the husband of the murdered woman and the killer looked rather unconvincing. The ending, however is a good one and is very satisfying."

Kudos to all the time that is spent on the internet. This movie is so poetic, touching, thought provoking, I only could imagine what emotions movie could have stirred up, if I had known Spanish language. May be that is why they say language is not a barrier for a perfect art. Performances are brilliant that many a times I did not have to read the subtitles. I could read their eyes and know what they are trying to say! Basic theme of this movie is passion. Everyone has a passion, that makes them live their life to the full, to the end. Passion is what keeps each of us going on. And this movie is a direct question in the face, to those who lead their life's without any passion, as invalids. How do people live empty life's? ""A guy can change anything. His face, his home, his family, his girlfriend, his religion,his God. But there's one thing he can't change. He can't change his passion"" Movie starts with Benjamin Esposito, retired from Criminal Court, working on his novel. His novel is a fiction based on his own life, and one murder case that he solved during his tenure, but to which he could not provide justice. Reason? Office politics. And this constantly troubles him all his life. For the purpose of his novel, he revisits the case and tries to trace the murderer and the husband of the deceased. He believes that doing so, will make him be at peace with himself. Movies goes back and forth in time, with flashbacks of his job at the Court, working with his friend Pablo Sandoval and lady boss Irene.<br/><br/>""How do you live a life full of nothing?"" Irene and Benjamin share the strange relationship of unspoken fondness for each other. In-spite of their mutual likeness, their relationship ends when Irene gets married to a man from her class/ status. He does not express his feelings for her openly, knowing that he can never match her social status. But in the novel he does.<br/><br/>Pablo the alter-ego of Benjamin, an alcoholic, plays a crucial part with the twists in the story. He adds the humor to the movie. This is an important character in the movie and you would know why only after watching the movie.<br/><br/>""If you keep going over the past, you're going to end up with a thousand pasts and no future."" Ricardo Morales, is the widower. He actively follows up on the case, to see that the murderer is punished. His love for his wife is true love. He visit train station everyday hoping that someday he would face the murderer. His pain and suffering is depicted poignantly. He says to Benjamin that killing the murderer is not the punishment, but having him live his entire life in a confined cell, with no hope than to wait for his death, living an empty life, is the best punishment that he deserves. But when the case is closed, he disappears from the city as if he had come to terms with the injustice.<br/><br/>Can Benjamin, after 25 years, find peace? Will his relationship with Irene ever blossom, in his novel and in his life? Are all the sacrifices done by him and people around him worthy of life? Does Ricardo get justice? Or the justice is already done? What is the passion that drives each of these four important characters of the story? It's a classic movie based on love, crime, life. The ending of the movie plays a lot on your mind, and you just keep staring at the screen, contemplating everything that has been narrated so far and all you can do is nothing but marvel at it.

The need of a closure is also for the hidden love for his former boss (soledad Villamil). With no doubt Campanella executes an interesting story with an accurate direction and cinematography. Performances are satisfying; nevertheless, the only one that greatly shines is Guillermo Francella - his character, Sandoval, is the only one that is lovable and touching in his pathetic.<br/><br/>The film achieves a coherent pathos through the first half, yet, at the end, the story is ""dilated"" and loses part of its charm: the suspense is resolved in a very easy way. Camapnella shows his knowledge of the Academy's taste, 'cause his movie has a major inspiration in ""the life of the others"" (Florian Henckel, 2006), a minor tittle that won an Oscar due to the unpredictable taste of a still polemic institution."

Benjamin is writing a novel about something that happened years back. There are professional and personal voids from that age which keeps dragging him in. He wants to solve the first one and craves, silently, for a solution to the latter. In this battle of his own, he needs to braver and smarter. For the film to work, it needs him to be played by Ricardo Darin. An actor of great depth and charisma, he lends to his role every twitch of emotion and every pound of dignity it demands. A brilliant film and some fine acting make this a must watch."

","The Oscars rarely picks the correct 'Best Picture' but what were the odds of neither 'A Prophet' or 'White Ribbon' not winning the famous statue in 2010? So when the relatively unknown Argentinian film 'The secret in their eyes' pipped the aforementioned films, i took notice. I had to wait a long time to see it, and then my beloved Duke of Yorks cinema could only show it once, at 2:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon! I had to go, leaving work early, my colleagues bemused why it was so important to see an Argentinian movie at such an odd hour!<br/><br/>I'd recently seen another good Argentinian movie, XXY, which cast the same lead actor, Ricardo Darin, as in this film. 'The Secret in their eyes' centres around the rape and murder of a young woman. Darin plays federal justice agent Benjamin Esposito, who is responsible for solving the murder, aided by his alcoholic assistant Pablo Sandoval, and his new boss Irene Menendez Hastings. What is essentially a formulaic plot is transformed by some superb acting and excellent direction. The film effortlessly weaves between a murder mystery and a love story, using flashback, current, and flash-forward techniques due to the story being told 25 years after the murder by Benjamin, now retired and decided to write a book about the murder.<br/><br/>There are moments in the film that seem more at home as television melodrama, and the plot at times is shaky in its deductions. The ending felt like it was from a Stephen King novel, but no less affective and certainly caught me by surprise. As the title to the film suggests, everything is in their eyes, and the acting by everyone was excellent. Sandoval in particular, played by Guillermo Francello, is both hilarious and touching as the alcoholic sidekick. Beautifully paced direction from Juan Jose Campanella, with echoes of the best in Hollywood film noir. Overall, a wonderful film with many admirable qualities."

","'THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Another film that's made a lot of year end critic's top ten lists and was last year's Academy Awards winner for Best Foreign Language Film. This film is an Argentine mystery / crime drama based on the book 'The Question In Their Eyes' by Eduardo Sacheri. The script is adapted by Sacheri and the film's director, Juan Jose Campanella. Campanella surprisingly has a lot of experience directing American TV series (like several episodes of 'HOUSE M.D.', 'LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT', 'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' and others) and his directing here is very impressive and memorable, including a breathtaking chase scene that appears to be all one single camera (although it was edited together using multiple cameras with CGI). The film has impressive acting turns as well from Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil in the two leads.<br/><br/>Darin stars as a retired federal agent who tries to lay old memories to rest by writing a novel about them. He turns to an old friend, Judge Irene Menendez-Hastings (Villamil), for help. She was his superior, whom he also had strong feeling for, on a disturbing rape case several years earlier. The case was closed but it's outcome still haunts him to this day and leaves him with many unanswered questions. He tries to piece together the past with the help of Irene in order to finish his book and conquer his nightmares as we watch through flashbacks.<br/><br/>The film is a very involving and intriguing crime mystery with a lot of emotion and interesting complex characters. It is very grisly at times though, including a torturous rape scene which is one of the most disturbing visuals I've seen in cinema. There is a lot of graphic violence as well as nudity and the movie is very hard to watch at times but if you can stick it out it's worth it. It's very beautiful in a lot of ways at times and leaves the viewer with as many positive emotions as negative. The writing, directing and acting is all superb and the movie, with all it's ups and downs, is a rewarding and memorable film going experience.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ"

Secondly, for the technique of camera work and the atmosphere the film created, I assure you the movie is definitely one of the best movies in 2009, and maybe one of the best of all time! <br/><br/>The love between Benjamin and Irene is easy to sense, and it's maybe easier to guess the results when they finally meet again. Nonetheless, the way they pushed each other away was still heart breaking, not to mention the difficulties they had gone through together. Fortunately, when Benjamin finally solved the mystery after visiting the husband, he also gained his courage to move on with Irene regardless of their situation. It's beautiful but sad to say that it is never too late to show your love if you think the beloved is worthwhile for the risk! <br/><br/>I totally agree with the theory about passion that Sandoval mentioned, they wouldn't catch Gomez if it was not for the theory of passion. Besides, I myself am a mania of movies and tennis, and sometimes it's even kind of obsessive not to miss one good movie or any big game in tennis. Though the criminal was convicted, he still got away from the prison, and that led so many problems ever since.<br/><br/>Death penalty has been argued for decades, yet there comes nowhere near the conclusion. How to define the best punishment for the sinners is not something to work out in short time, but the movie definitely gave a certain way to think about. Gomez was sign for the corruption of the generation in Argentina, or maybe in the world, but it's important to always leave rooms for discussion. With all the controversial history, such an extremely method the husband did is too shock for the audiences to neglect the necessity of the abolishment of the death penalty.<br/><br/>Is it true that secrets can be revealed in one's eyes? I'll say I agree in a certain degree since I always thought that I can tell if someone is a good person from their looks, especially in their eyes.

"meeza","10","1","2","8 January 2011"," A secret masterpiece!
","You are just too good to be true, can't keep my eyes off of you! And boy is that true in viewing the mastery of the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language motion picture ""The Secret in Their Eyes"". The Argentinean flick is directed by Juan Jose Campanella. If Campanella's name does ring a bell, it is because he is not only an acclaimed Argentinean auteur but also has directed numerous episodes of the critically-acclaimed television series ""House M.D."". Campanella also co-wrote ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" with Eduardo Sacheri. This movie is unlike any you have laid your eyes on before! Campanella masters the craft of developing unpredictable journeys on where the narrative of this film takes you to. ""The Secret in their Eyes"" stars Ricardo Darin as Benjamin Esposito, a retired lawyer who decides to write a novel on a murder case he was assigned to many years ago that still haunts him in his present life. In returning to the undiscovered aftermath scenarios of the case, Benjamin's buttons are pushed in so many variations. I will not divulge too much on the case because that will be a bit of plot snitching on the secret of ""The Secret in Their Eyes"". I will state that in rediscovering the case, he reunites with a past female attorney colleague Irene Menendez Hastings. Benjamin always held a secret love for Irene but was not hasty enough to express his love for her, due to the nature of the infamous case. During the time Benjamin and Irene were working on the case, they had the assistance of a wisecracking, inebriated attorney colleague Ricardo Morales. He provides the film's comic relief of an emotionally-wrenched narrative. Campanella and Sacheri's screenplay is as intense and compelling as they come! And Campanella's directorial vision of ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was 20/20 perfect! His skilled orchestration of interchanging between past and present was one of the movie's finest assets. The cast of ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was phenomenal! Darin's daring starring performance as Esposito was undeniably outstanding. But he was not alone, because Soledad Villamil's work as the captivating Irene was up to par with Darin's effort. And not to be left undone, Pablo Rago was exactly no rag doll with his scene-stealing performance as Morales. ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" was most worthy of its Best Foreign Film Academy Award, and that is no secret. ***** Excellent"

","""The Secret in their Eyes"" is a sad and precious story about wasted lives and regrets.Its plot travels between 1974 and 1999, from the time of dictatorship to the time of democracy. Argentina , like the most of South America went through turbulent upheaval in the 60's and 70's. The Cold War and its protagonists were spreading their macabre influence all over the world. If you weren't with them, you were against them. The simple tragic murder and rape of a young schoolteacher took a back seat to military junta's fight for survival. That act of criminal injustice affected three lives.This is a powerful, touching movie colored with pastel colors of regret and loss."

","On the face of it, the underlying narrative for this film does not suggest much. It's a foreign language film that's made it to the mainstream. This is to do it a great disservice. Wonderfully shot so that you know precisely when the action is 'fictional' and when 'real' it is a tour de force in film technique. But technique never detracts from the action. We know precisely why our main man can't get over his infatuation; we empathise with the drunk - knowing all the while that he is a feeling man - peculiarly aware of the truth behind the crime stories that pass over his desk and through his office. He drinks in a realistic, not a stereotypical way. There are twists and turns aplenty and plenty to make you think. Ah, lovely. Real entertainment."

","The Secret of Her Eyes fell under my radar after watching the Oscar nominations for 2009. I had watched A Prophet and The White Ribbon and I was interested in seeing how this rather unknown movie competed with these two masterworks.<br/><br/>Juan José Campanella's movie follows Benjamín Esposito's investigation of the rape and murder of a 23-year-old schoolteacher. It's a case that haunts him for decades and comes to define his existence. The movie is temporally fragmented, so the narrative jumps from past to present constantly. I should commend the makeup department for its ability to portray the ageing of actors Ricardo Darín, Soledad Villamil, Pablo Rago and Javier Godino. Without good makeup, this movie would have fallen apart quickly.<br/><br/>Esposito's investigation takes many turns, meets opposition several times, comes to halts several times in the course of his life, ruins his personal life, and seems like it will never be solved. At the age of retirement he begins reminiscing about it and starts writing a novel based on the event.<br/><br/>This movie addresses many topics at the same time: first of all, the craft of fiction, as Esposito struggles to make sense of the events in order to write his novel. But through this inner journey, the movie also discusses the importance of memory. It also explores the danger of obsession, as Esposito comes to realise that decades working on the case has only left him with a lonely, empty life.<br/><br/>All these ruminations are disguised as a crime movie, a rather elegant one at that. The movie plays with genre a few times, the best one being that it reveals who the murderer is before the end of the first hour. By doing this the movie introduces a more interesting idea: what to do with a criminal who's politically untouchable? Is vigilantism ever justified? At times I reminded myself of Mystic River, which posed similar questions, although the stories are totally different.<br/><br/>Ricardo Darín gives a good performance; in fact I have little to complain about the performances in the movie, but Darín stood out as the passionate, tireless investigator. Pablo Rago, who plays the victim's husband, also impressed me for his ability to portray loss so well.<br/><br/>Since I watched this movie because of A Prophet and The White Ribbon, I have to ask myself: is it as good as those two? No, not by a long chance. The Secret of Her Eyes has quality and good ideas, but I never felt I was watching more than a good movie, whereas I consider the other two masterworks. It's worth watching, but it's hardly the masterpiece everyone is saying it is.<br/><br/>On a final note, if this movie deserved another Oscar nomination, It should be for Federico Jusid's score, whose beauty will no doubt get him more exposure soon."

","I really don't have much to say about this movie, other than the fact that the dialogues and the acting made my ears and my eyes bleed. They are very very tedious and to believe what the actors are saying you have to be not older than 7 years of age. The script is on the level of some mediocre Brazilian shows, and, although, it tries to tap on some serious questions, it does so in such a way that you are left bewildered at best. Acting. I don't know, maybe Argentine Method is slightly different, but the way the actors expressed characters' emotions seemed really odd to me. Example - the husband whose wife was just raped and murdered is entirely calm and then, in the following days, proceeds about his business completely uninterrupted like nothing has happened at all. In any crime movie, such a behaviour would make him the prime suspect, only in this particular case he has an alibi. The movie is not without merits, though, and like so many before me I will say that cinematography is indeed superior. This, unfortunately, is not sufficient for keeping this disaster of a film afloat"
"absorbtion1","6","4","19","19 September 2010"," a mediocre film of good ideas
","This film is a bit like an empty pie: beautifully executed and still full of calories, the only thing it seems to be missing is a solid filling of a plot. Neither the detective story nor the love story in it make much sense and aren't really worth writing home about. If, however, we mute our internal critic for a while and try to believe the story, the film will unfold as something more than just a well-photographed flaw. Essentially, ""The secret in their eyes"" is a fable about coping with unresolved past - and, no less importantly, about whether such coping on its own provides enough nourishment for creativity. <br/><br/>Some time in the middle of his career, Benjamín Esposito, a legal counselor, encounters a rape/murder case that he cannot resolve. The reasons for this are hardly convincing, but let's say this is mainly due to the powers that be as well as his own hotheadedness. This case haunts him so much that he befriends the husband of the victim - Ricardo Morales, a somewhat unimaginative banker, who would go to the train station each morning trying to trace the murder suspect. Esposito is very empathic to Morales's suffering, almost unnaturally so. He is horrified that Morales's life from now on is going to be a life sentence, with nothing else happening. Morales is indeed in a very bad way at the beginning, but at some point we're left wondering whether he copes with the events better than Esposito himself. There's also an unresolved (and very unconvincingly presented) love story between Esposito and his young upper-middle class boss Irene that happens at the same time, which leaves both of them scarred.<br/><br/>It is 25 years later and Esposito, now retired, is still trying to reconcile with the past. His take on this is now is to try writing a novel about the case. In his pursuits he revisits Morales and Irene, who both seem... no, not to have moved on, but rather to have found a positive way to get on with their lives. Only Esposito dwells on the past. To make the things worse, his writing isn't going well, friends find it too dry - as if notes to a novel rather than the novel itself. <br/><br/>It is only when Esposito discovers what exactly Morales has done (and is doing) to be able to look ahead rather than ""serve a life sentence"" that he realizes he needs to stop pondering the past and act. The actions required are on a considerably smaller scale, but they seem to do the job. We don't even need to care whether his novel was a success in the end. That courage is a necessary ingredient for both happiness and creativity is the message that the film delivers much more sincerely than the particulars of the plot itself."
"johnnyboyz","6","2","7","4 April 2011"," Perfectly fine and perfectly rounded little thriller with more grandeur-a aspirations to be what isn't quite; The Secret in Their Eyes makes the grade more often than not.
","There can't be many actors working within Argentina, indeed the world, with a presence-come-expression, or 'tone' about his being there as there is with Ricardo Darín. The man's solemn appearance twinned with the general low-key immediacy to his being on screen is in no way an insult; on the contrary, for most of his work in terms of the characters he has played, a downcast and lonely-cut figure of an individual with some crucial decisions on his mind has seen him close to being always perfectly cast. His expression just seems sad, as if the weight of the world rests on his shoulders and there is nary a person within a hundred miles whom can help him deal with it – if we were in the film with him, we might see ourselves wanting to lend a hand. Here, that man is dropped into a film whose narrative is a weaving, twisting plot kicked off by a pretty harrowing catalyst and left to those primarily involved to stew in juices that do not involve a whole lot of justifiable help from the authorities whom operate distastefully. Here, Darín plays one of those protagonists placed on the front-line; a character who, at one point, has to literally kick away at a yapping, puppy-dog sized mutt in what you might categorise as self-defence but is an action born out of Darín's being in a place he initially should not have been. Not many protagonists in movies can kick a dog belonging to a somewhat elderly woman and still have the audience on their sides after a breaking and entering offense, even enforce a guffaw out of the whole situation: Darín can because we're on his side the moment we see him.<br/><br/>His character here is Benjamín Esposito, a man we first encounter in a place of dwelling all to himself as the thoughts; memories and his own envisages of what might have happened during past events he was not present at, haunt him. Now, he attempts to turn what it is he has experienced into material worthy of selling as the written word; the lack of a word processor or even a typewriter suggesting a man of a particular age, the crumpling up of several sheets of paper despite some fairly competent renditions of his work wryly hinting at a man obsessed with detail and figuring things out to their perfect denouement. The film, Argentinian set, will flick between the present day and the latter-half of the 1970s; those of whom knowledgeable of contemporary Argentinian history (or have at least caught Christopher Hampton's 2003 film Imagining Argentina on the off chance) will know that the said era was one of a distasteful nature. An ongoing case to do with the rape and murder of a young woman across the street from some construction workers that were eventually blamed plagues the past, the reunions between those predominantly involved with investigating such a case doing so for the present.<br/><br/>The film kicks into gear when Esposito, in the present day, visits a long-time companion from that case named Irene Hastings, played by Soledad Villamil; a woman he can still remember first laying eyes on and for whom a fair while has passed during which time he has harboured certain affections. She is a judge at the law firm at which he worked, pleasantries and niceties giving way to solemn silences when the Morales case, long-since closed from decades ago, is mentioned inducing now somewhat glum faces. Like Esposito displayed during the opening, she can be eloquent in her dictation and has a similarly high level of skill with words; the film exploring their relationship in the present day as much as it does the link they had when they worked tirelessly back in the day. The Morales case is indeed the crime revolving around the deceased young woman whose perpetrator, its seems, got away with what he did and the film flashbacks to the time and place it all unravelled so as to follow Esposito team up with an alcoholic co-worker named Pablo Sandoval (Francella) in the attempt to try and tackle the state-led enemies in order to dig out the truth.<br/><br/>The film is an interesting and brooding piece without ever being overtly involving; it painfully, and granted the accolades it has won, even confusingly did not necessarily strike me with quite clearly the same verve it did to many-a other. The film is a competent but plodding piece, somewhat televisual but rather plump and rounded in its neat, free-flowing causality as one thing moves onto the next and a power struggle erupts between two sides. I spent large portions of the film wandering to myself precisely what it was Darín's character did; eventually pluming for a sort of hybridised role encompassing journalism, archivist and police work. There are moments that the film leaps off of the screen and enraptures you, but do so more out of the sheer jump in aesthetical quality than anything else; take, for instance, the sweeping shot from high above a football stadium but ends in the rafters of an end behind the goal, a sequence which strikes us as the cinematic bolt-from-the-blue because it probably belongs in a better film.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, The Secret in Their Eyes is an able-bodied enough little investigative thriller but it is so without being overly confrontative nor particularly daring; its cat-and-mouse elements leading up to and beyond the apprehension of whom it is they assume to have committed the murder are engaging enough, but are counterbalanced by instances such as a key scene in a central relationship whose chief moment of emotional release is relegated to the status of a self-aware cliché, which still doesn't stop it being what it is. You could do a lot worse than The Secret in Their Eyes; the film is a fairly decently executed, well-meaning character study but which, frustratingly, did not strike me as much as I would have liked."
"dromasca","7","3","17","16 May 2010"," a telenovela gets the Oscar?
","There is no 'bad' genre in cinema or literature or music I believe. There are just good films and bad films, good books and bad books, good pieces of music and bad pieces of music. So, saying that with 'El secreto de sus ojos' the Academy gave this year the Oscar prize for the best foreign language movie to a telenovela (soap opera) - a genre so popular all over the world which has a special flavor in South America and especially in Argentina - should not by any means be taken as an insult.<br/><br/>The story line of 'El secreto de sus ojos' crosses a quarter of a century which for Argentina meant huge convulsions and transformation from the populist demagogy of the rule of the Perons in the 70s, through the brutal military right wing dictatorship at the end of that decade and the beginning of the 80s, until the full restoration of the democracy by the end of the century. It is a complex story, involving a brutal rape and murder which is being investigated by a criminal judge which tries to bring justice at all means, in a system that seems to be corrupt and incapacitated whatever the political system of the day. he story of passion allows the authors to make a deep and convincing reflection about the relativity of justice when faced with political and human weakness. However, beyond the satisfying thriller story it is the unconsumed love story between the investigator Benjamin Esposito and his superior, judge Irene Menendez Hastings that eventually takes over. This apparently impossible love, because of professional and social circumstances, gives the whole film an air of melancholy, and Soledad Vilamil as the judge is a fascinating screen presence, of an ageless and noble beauty that reminded that shines through the whole duration of the film and gives it the deserved title. Her partner Ricardo Darin seems a little too restrained, it is exactly the passion that never changes in a man which is once referred in a key scene that seems to lack to the actor.<br/><br/>Many of the elements remind indeed the telenovelas - the development of the action, the parallel threads, the romantic tone. There are however some differences, some in favor of the movie, other against it. There is no violin sentimental music score. There are moments of great quality in the scenes of the 70s representing bars or house interiors or the stadium, the viewer can not only visualize, but also hear, feel and the smell the period. Beyond the principal actress there is at least one more exquisite supporting performance of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval, the drunken, pathetic, and eventually heroic partner of Benjamin. Yet there is not enough time to develop all the subjects. The film at 127 minutes is too short for all threads to develop completely, the authors seem to have intended to say too much and had not enough time and space to extend, ans the result is that the dictatorship period seems to be treated in a quite superficial manner, and the story has two endings - one for the thriller and justice story, the other for the romantic thread, which do not really come together.<br/><br/>'El secreto de sus ojos' is not a bad film, quite the contrary. Having however seen two other of the films that competed for the Oscar this year, Haneke's 'Das weisse bad' and the Israeli 'Ajami' - I personally would not have been surprised or upset at all if any of these other two had won and not this one."
"abhyuday-tandon","3","1","3","29 March 2020"," Doesn't deserve the Thriller tag and the 8.2 rating
","The movie is highly overrated and much of the praise in the reviews on IMDb doesn't actually show up in the movie. It seems the Argentine audience has boosted the ratings too high.<br/><br/>The plot makes very little sense, firstly why are court officers investigating a rape and murder? Isn't that the police's job?
Secondly, the killer is identified by the professional court detectives just because the killer happened to be creepily staring at the victim in three old photos. That's some shaky logic but alright. The killer is interrogated by two court officers and not professional detectives. Why!?
The most ridiculous part of the movie is that a convicted rapist-murderer is let out of prison and given a police job just because someone had to settle a rivalry with the arresting officers. Wow.
The entire movie is quite slow and dull, it gets a bit interesting towards the end as the movie hints that the victim's husband might be the killer and a potential plot twist approaches which could've redeemed the movie. However it simply turns into a lame twist wherein the perpetrator is kept in a personal prison instead of being killed.
The movie is a major disappointment, it definitely shouldn't be called a Thriller, it is more of a frustrating romance drama"

","This is an OK film. I would not say it deserves the Oscar it got, though. I've seen most of the winners in the ""foreign film"" category over the past decade or so, and I think this movie, although decent, is not in the ""best of the year"" category.<br/><br/>Although I liked the movie generally, I have more than a few issues with it.<br/><br/>A have a problem with the way they figured out who raped and killed the woman. It was simply based on the way some childhood friend looked at her in a couple of old photos. It's ridiculous and kind of embarrassing. As this is work based on fiction, I think viewers deserve a little less insulting grounds for suspicion than a couple of evil-eye-type looks. I actually expected that the guy they caught didn't do it after all, as their evidence amounted to a big fat zero.<br/><br/>I understand that many things were lost in translation (I watched it with English subtitles) and Argentinian culture, relationships, environment, sense of humor and so on could be quite different from mine or anyone else's. However, I felt that the plot details were sometimes a little confusing until they were clarified later or became obvious. I don't know if that's because of difference in their local approach to storytelling or if it was simply a flaw on the part of screenwriter or director.<br/><br/>Also, characters looked exactly the same in present as they looked 25 years before. It's really confusing to distinguish what's happening when if a guy looks the same when he's 35 and 60. A couple of gray hairs is just not enough for a viewer to figure out he's suddenly 25 years older. Also, none of the decor, technology, hairstyles or cars seem to change in Argentina in 25 years, at least according to this movie. A little weird, when you think about it.<br/><br/>I don't know why they bothered with the continuous stadium shot. It's really nothing special and it adds absolutely nothing to the story. They should have saved the money and invested it into some make-up for actors to make them look older or younger.<br/><br/>All in all, an OK movie that could have used a lot of tweaks to make it more polished, professional and ultimately more believable."

","I never would have even heard of this movie, if not for its unexpected Oscar win in the category of Best Foreign Language Film.<br/><br/>This is a Foreign Language film which could have been set anywhere in the world. There was nothing really uniquely Argentinean about its characters and situation. A retired investigator wants to write a novel about a 25-year old unresolved brutal rape-murder case that affected him the most. He reconnects with the people associated with the case to get insights about his writings. In the process, he discovers more about this cold case, as well as about his own self and his relationships.<br/><br/>The film works as a crime mystery-thriller. It also works as a romance drama. There are also scenes of fine comedy. These multiple layers were well-combined and well-executed into one fine film. The camera work is very good with its focus on the eyes of the characters, as the title would suggest. There were also very exciting action shots during the soccer stadium scenes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were some flaws in the plot development, with incredible jumps of deduction and coincidences which may strain credulity and logic. Something totally trivial and incidental turned out to be the most revelatory clue, more than once in the story. The ending is something which may impress some, and disappoint others. I personally liked the eerie way it was done despite the melodramatic manner.<br/><br/>Overall, there is nothing so spectacular about this film that makes it truly outstanding. Of the nominated Foreign Language films this year, I definitely liked ""The Secret of Their Eyes"" more than ""The White Ribbon"" and ""A Prophet."" However, when you compare this to the nominees of last year's Oscar for Foreign Language Film, I liked ""Departures,"" ""The Class,"" ""Waltz With Bashir"" and ""Revenge"" more than this one."
"Imdbidia","7","1","7","21 April 2011"," Enjoyable, but completely overrated
","An Argentinian film directed by Juan José Campanella that tells the story of a retired public lawyer, Bejamin Esposito, who starts writing a novel about one of the most intriguing cases of his past: the rape and murder of young wife Liliana Coloto, and the investigation, with his colleague Sandoval and superior Irene, that led to the capture of her murderer.<br/><br/>The acting is uneven, poor sometimes, with the exception of Guillermo Francella who is terrific as the drunkard but insightful lawyer Pablo Sandoval. Soledad Villamil and Ricardo Darin have a great chemistry on camera, but not much dramatic emotion can come from them as the script has the love story as a background to the murder investigation, so their feelings are mostly showed indirectly. She plays correctly Irene, a high-class judge, a beautiful rich inaccessible girl. Darin shines in his portrait of the lonely old retiree looking for clues in his life through remembrance, more than in his portray of the young Esposito; however, he portrays with constriction and sensitivity the soft looser that Esposito is. The script tells us widower Ricardo Morales is an emotional wreck after the death of his wife, a man still in deep love with her, but Pablo Rago's performance rather shows emotional frigidity regarding the death of his wife, his grieving, and the search and capture of the murderer. I found Javier Godino's performance over the top as rapist Isidoro Gomez, although I think it is what the script requires from him; in that regard, it is not his fault.<br/><br/>I do not mind flaws in a script if they are well integrated in the story, and if the movie compensates them with other positive elements. However, there are so many and evident flaws here that one cannot ignore them. 1/ The first is the fact that the way a man looks a woman in a photo can lead to anyone to suspect he is a murderer; to be honest, if this is the case, Esposito could be a potential murderer, too, if we take into account the way he looked at his adored Irene in the photos taken in her pre-wedding party. 2/ When Esposito and Sandoval are at the house of Isidoro's mother, the old lady returns, her dog starts barking at them but she does not suspects anything, and, even more, OMG the back-door is completely open for them to run! 3/ We are told who is the murderer and that he loves a specific football team, so Esposito and Sandoval go to the next match, the stadium is fully packed, but they manage to find Isidoro 10 feet away from them; not only that, the lawyers have convinced the Police -one assume Argentinian Police had much free time at hand at the time and would consider the proposal sane- to be there to capture the murderer. 4/ Most of the movie is set in the 1970s, when a military dictatorship was ruling Argentina, a system that allowed the Justice System to act in a certain way; but if you are not familiar with Argentinian history many of the events/attitudes in the movie wont make any sense to you. 5/ We know who the murderer is quite early, before he is even captured, a fact that kills the suspense very soon. 6/ One would expect that whomever sent the group of assassins to Esposito's apartment to kill him would have provided them with a photo or at least an accurate description, so the question of the assassins in the movie is completely redundant. 7/ The end of the murder case is good, but still, too delayed and lost in a mix of themes explored at the same time; on the other hand, the end of the romance story is a bit unbelievable, ""I solve the mystery and I overcome all of my securities with this woman"" sort of thing. This, and much more, makes impossible to call this movie a masterpiece, unless you are blind.<br/><br/>Said this, the movie has a wonderful warm retro mood and tones, a beautiful interior photography, a simple unfulfilled romance story, an intriguing plot, a very interesting ending, and good performances by Darin and Francella.<br/><br/>The film it truly overrated."

The script is literate and the characters well-drawn, but it lacks the spark required to make it truly engrossing. The plot is quite spaced out and limited given the length of the movie, leading to long sequences where not a great deal happens. In comparison to electrifying, action-packed thrillers like the French POINT BLANK or more plot-focused detective stories like the Swedish GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO trilogy, I have to say this is nothing special.<br/><br/>That's not that it's not worth watching - the acting is strong from the whole of the cast, particularly the leads playing the two prosecutors whose subtle romance is the emphasis of much of the running time.

","I've rarely felt so strongly about my opinion (opinions are like belly buttons, everyone has one). France's THE PROPHET should have been a front runner for the Best Picture Oscar, not just the best Foreign Film. Germany's THE WHITE RIBBON is a great film. TSITE is, at best, a mediocre made-for-TV movie. That TSITE beat out, among other films THE PROPHET and THE WHITE RIBBON for the 2009 Foreign Film Oscar is yet another shame upon the Academy (add to MOONSTRUCK and DRIVING MISS DAISY).<br/><br/>TSITE is a plodding melodrama packaged as a crime drama. Its two hour length is padded with inconsequential banter among its main characters. It is chock full of awkward, incredible plot devises: Hero ""discovers"" killer in group photos; killer bated into confession; killer appears in elevator with hero, etc. Not only is it not in the same league with THE PROPHET or THE WHITE RIBBON, it is not even a good film! JUST BECAUSE ITS FOREIGN DOES NOT MEAN IT IS NOT JUNK.<br/><br/>If THE PROPHET had been beaten out for the best Foreign Film Oscar by THE WHITE RIBBON, I'd be in disagreement but would also be at peace. For one, its tough to compare an apple and an orange; e.g., whether one is more ""orangey"" or ""applely"" can be debated forever. On the other hand, TSITE is full of useless and/or protracted scenes and dialog, tired storyline and subplots, cardboard characters and, especially, contrived sentiment.<br/><br/>Life is unfair as is.

"jamesferguson-04874","7","0","2","30 June 2019"," In one film Argentina obsoletes every cliched American revenge movie.
","So it's a revenge movie. America seems to make about 400 of these every year. Bad kills/takes good guys' wife/daughter/dog (hello, John Wick), so good guy decides, with good/some/no justification, that calling the police is not an option and the only way to get justice is to abandon the rule of law, get his (it's always his) medieval berserker bloodlust on and go on a homicidal killing spree murdering as many people as possible (apparently the more killed the more true was his love) who are in any way even tangentially linked to the bad guy. About the only way anyone in America ever innovates in this category of movie is the vary the choreography and find novel ways of murdering someone. Oh and there's always the traditional American gun worship, you can't forget the gun worship.<br/><br/>There's a whole argument to be had over whether these films relieve pent up anger at injustice, or just restlessness, and so prevent outbursts of violence, or whether they basically glorify homicidal killing sprees and promote violence and a vengeful approach to conflict. FWIW, I can never get away from a certain amount of feeling dirty having watched one of these things.<br/><br/>Enter Juan Jose Campanella from Argentina with an actually original and innovative revenge flick. He goes the complete opposite direction from Hollywood's ever more divorced from reality comic book killing sprees with a film about a few ordinary police, and a grieving husband, struggling to bring a killer to justice. The background, very sparingly alluded to, is the fascist Peron dictatorship, thousands of political activists and opposition members who became ""the disappeared"", and generally a time when a great many people in Argentina found justice very hard to come by.<br/><br/>Unlike Hollywood's short attention span, where new revenge films pretty much have to have killed 100 footsoldiers and the head bad guy within 24 hours of the good guys' dog being buried, Campanella's story of revenge spans decades. And not just a then-and-now structure, the original investigation spans years and the present day story spans a good deal of time too. All of this piles on the dramatic tension - ""will this monster ever see justice?"" - and builds our appreciation of the heroes, they're not just risking being killed, they're risking spending decades of their lives on a futile hunt. And while guns are present, they're about as useful as they are in real life. No one's going around blowing away their problems with merry abandon.<br/><br/>And then there's the finale, which of course I won't spoil. I'll just say it makes every American revenge movie hero look childish and narcissistic. This is a revenge story for grown ups. The hero isn't just throwing a bloody and homicidal tantrum until he makes himself feel better; he's making a steep sacrifice to see justice done and to honour the person he lost."

It's perfectly possible that a woman lets an old acquaintance in without her husband being aware of it, but to me, it's more likely that she was being unfaithful."

Ricardo Darín is an excellent actor, one of the best in Latin America. his performance in this movie was pretty good. Also Guillermo Francella performance was very very good. The whole screenplay is thrilling from beginning to end, and once it ends, you still wish for more. Is these kind of movies, is these kind of art that makes me proud to be a Latin American.

However, this slow burning mystery drama just doesn't engage all the often to make you want to care about any of the characters and any of the events.

Any movie where a character takes his privates out of his pants and flops them around is okay with me (though they look very prosthetic).<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to others.

"FilmCriticLalitRao","6","0","6","18 October 2014"," The secret in their eyes : A Juan José Campanella film with tremendous mass appeal as well as numerous loopholes.
","It is due to films made by veteran directors Fernando Solanas, Eliseo Subiela, Hector Alterio, Adolfo Aristarian, Maria Luis Bamberg etc that Argentine cinema continues to enjoy considerable fame among specialized film festival audiences and knowledgeable general public. In many ways, that tradition of success is being carried on by a group of young directors including Juan José Campanella whose films are quite popular in USA. However, 'The secret in their eyes' is a major disappointment as it ends up being a weak work of cinema with numerous plot related shortcomings. One glaring error is that Campanella's film does not concentrate on one particular theme. It flits amblingly from novel writing by a retired legal counselor to his desire to find love from his former lady boss and his willingness to learn more about a highly intelligent criminal who is believed to have perpetrated a heinous rape as well as murder. Apart from showcasing an important 'entertainment' content for viewers, director Campanella's film succeeds in depicting a certain equitable idea of justice with ""ethical implications"". This idea leads this film's protagonists to pursue 'justice' till the very end. Finally, things happen at such a frantic pace that viewers are left with no choice but to think highly about sixth Babylonian king Hammurabi and his famous adage ""an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth."
"Turfseer","6","0","4","15 October 2014"," Academy Award winner, a gritty crime thriller with credibility issues, is truly a mixed bag
","'The Secret in Their Eyes' won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2009. Some critics have criticized the film for a lack of verisimilitude, but others, the greater majority, were quite impressed by the way in which the sordid underbelly of Argentina in the 70s is revealed, when it was ruled with an iron hand by the Peronistas and their fascist supporters.<br/><br/>The protagonist here is Benjamín Espósito who pays a visit to Judge Irene Menéndez-Hastings, who was his boss back in the 70s in Buenos Aires. Espósito is now retired but used to work as a Federal Police Officer in the courthouse. He tells Menéndez-Hastings that he plans to write a novel about the rape/murder case he investigated involving the attractive victim, Liliana Coloto, married to an unassuming bank employee, Ricardo Morales. Most of the rest of the film involves flashbacks to the time Espósito investigated the crime.<br/><br/>As we flash back, Campanella puts us right square in the middle of the down and dirty world of these 'federales', who are entrusted with bringing criminals to the bar of justice. Espósito is aided by his good buddy in the office, Pablo Sandoval, a deputy clerk who has a drinking problem. The machinations involving Sandoval add to the film's believability as the 'good guys' are shown not to be 'squeaky clean' or overly heroic. Initially, two construction workers are fingered by one of Espósito's colleague, Romano, as the culprits in the murder of Coloto; but after Espósito interviews them, he concludes that they're wholly innocent and were beaten and framed by Romano. Espósito goes so far as to file a formal complaint against Romano, who is transferred to another city.<br/><br/>The real suspect, Isidoro Gómez, is revealed after Espósito notices pictures in Coloto's old photo album who are given to him by Morales. In these pictures, Gómez is seen staring at Coloto and this is enough for Espósito to conclude that Gómez is his man (merely by the look of his eyes). Many internet posters found Espósito's conclusion not to be believable at all but sometimes old fashioned police work involves mere 'hunches'. Gómez's guilt becomes more apparent when he intentionally disappears after Espósito and Sandoval are hot on his trail.<br/><br/>Espósito (much to the chagrin of boss Menéndez-Hastings) engages in some extra-judicial shenanigans of his own when he breaks into Gómez's mother's home and steals some of his cryptic letters. Again, the good guys are not always so good. Menéndez-Hastings shuts down the case but a year later, Espósito runs into Morales in a train station, who informs him that he goes to various stations and sits there for hours, hoping he'll find his wife's killer. Espósito is so impressed by Morales' determination, that he convinces his boss to re-open the investigation into Coloto's murder.<br/><br/>It's Sandoval who has the brilliant insight that the purloined letters reveal Gómez's passion for soccer (Sandoval's meditation on mens' passion, is a critical component later in the plot). Specifically, Gómez is a fanatical fan of a particular soccer team, the Racing Club, so Espósito and Sandoval have been attending Racing Club's games in the hope of finding him in the crowd. And again, many internet posters found it unbelievable that the intrepid investigators would be able to find such a 'needle in a haystack'. Nonetheless, they do and Gómez now finds himself in their custody.<br/><br/>It's rather neat how Menéndez-Hastings takes over the interrogation of Gómez and pretends that he's not their suspect because he doesn't fit the profile of a 'real man' who could possibly rape and kill the victim. She insults him by claiming that he is not well endowed at all and eventually he loses his cool, takes out his member (as proof that he is well-endowed), calls her a 'bitch', punches her in the face and inadvertently confesses. It's a very 'cinematic' scene but the wily killer (who soon is smart enough to escape the bar of justice) is not a very clever psychopath at this juncture at all!<br/><br/>Perhaps the best twist in the plot is when Gómez is released from prison after his conviction and is seen on TV, behind Eva Perón, as an apparent bodyguard. Now it's Romano's turn to get 'revenge' as he tells Espósito and Menéndez-Hastings to get lost, as the killer has become a trusted lieutenant for the bad guys. It's chilling when Gómez flashes his gun in the elevator in front of Espósito and his naïve boss and even more chilling when Sandoval is mistakenly shot at Espósito's home, in a case of mistaken identity.<br/><br/>The years pass and we're now back in the present. Espósito's ending for his novel isn't satisfying to either one of them (he paints a hackneyed portrait of himself and Menéndez-Hastings—with her having second thoughts about rejecting him, chasing him in the train station, as he leaves Buenos Aires on the train for good, seeking protection from Gómez and his associates).<br/><br/>With the Judge's help, Espósito tracks down Morales (hence now, a better ending!). The climax is designed to shock but is it believable? After Espósito doubles back to Morales' house, he realizes that the story that Morales told (that he killed Gómez), couldn't be true since Morales had made it clear years ago that life imprisonment was far more a vengeful (and satisfactory) punishment than the death penalty, where a killer merely peacefully 'goes to sleep', after receiving a lethal injection. Given the situation he was in, trapped like a rat by Morales, do you really believe that Gómez would not have taken his own life? And furthermore, I wasn't convinced that it was so easy for Morales to abduct Gómez in the first place.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'The Secret in Their Eyes' kept my interest, although some of it was slow-moving and not always believable. As for an Academy Award—some voters may have gone overboard just a bit."

","The Secret in Their Eyes is a movie that won Oscar Award. I haven't yet seen other foreign language nominees of that year but i think they cant be much better than this one. It was different, intense in its human behavior and atmosphere.<br/><br/>As it started i felt like not another typical movie-geecko movie that got Oscar but it was not so. Other than average carry-on story and normal acting, and it remained average for that during whole length with boring locations and cinematography but it features unusual ending and beautiful human behaviors displayed in various context. It has no strong point of 'look in the eyes' as its title suggest. Its just couldn't go that successfully with the hidden lie in the eye but other then that, it carves out few nice events like hidden liking and expressing it for each other, parting away, friendship, revenge and unusual revenge depicted powerfully by a single line 'tell him to talk to me'.

","The secret of your eyes is certainly a good film. The plot really can involves the viewer, but what i appreciated even more than the thriller was the subtle meanings and a couple of philosophical questions brought. <br/><br/>For example, the drunken friend of the protagonist couldn't have used cleverest words when he made analogies and metaphors to explain that what really moves the persons is the will, the passion, the love, don't matters what you do love. The protagonist apparently loved the woman, and all his actions about his past just happens because he was moved by the love. The allegory of the 'A' is missing is really, though it is perhaps more understandable for those who have Spanish as first language. I mean, i was kinda lost about the meaning of the word 'Temo' but it was quickly solved by a research on a dictionary. <br/><br/>The acting is indeed very good, Ricardo Darín is perhaps a good actor, and the entire cast did a good job. About the villains, they did very well their jobs and reached their objectives, that were being hated by the viewer.The antagonist was a very unlikable and arrogant character, and the murderer is really nasty. And not mentioning the fact that this film has perhaps one of the weirdest and most ambiguous twists in film that i've ever seen. Anyways, it's obviously worth a watch. 8.5/ 10"
