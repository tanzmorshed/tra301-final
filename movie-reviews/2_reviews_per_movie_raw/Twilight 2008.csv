","I think this movie suffered from lack of a good script and bad acting."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","5","294","434","26 November 2008"," Twilight! Twilight! Oh, my... Twiiiiiiiiliaaaaaaaaaaght!
","That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I'm not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.<br/><br/>Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood.<br/><br/>So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it's average, it's my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I'm a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn't take their ""love"" seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward's father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you're a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matin√©e price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.<br/><br/>5/10"
"DemonicAnthony","1","404","632","1 December 2008"," Twilight Shines Brightest Once the Credits Roll
","This review may contain spoilers. You've been warned. Twilight was a terrible film adaption of a, let's face it, mediocre novel. I went into the theater with an open mind, not expecting brilliance, but expecting to be entertained. Well, I guess I was technically entertained since I laughed throughout most of the movie. Sadly, I wasn't laughing at purposely funny moments. I was laughing at the awkward ""acting"" of the actors and the terrible dialogue.<br/><br/>Now this is where it gets tricky: Do we blame the screenwriter or the author? The movie made me realize just how corny the book's dialogue was. I found myself rolling my eyes, when I wasn't laughing, at every word out of the actor's mouth. Especially the dialogue between Edward and Bella. Now, the dialogue could have been over looked if the actors were able to deliver them. Alas, whoever decided to do casting for this film decided to cast every ""actor"" with the acting ability of a toaster. Now, a toaster is a inanimate object and therefore cannot act. Get the hint? What made me laugh the hardest was at the end of the movie when Bella's mother decides to inform Phil VIA TEXT MESSAGE that Bella is alright. I was so shocked that she was really texting him that I turned to my friend and whispered ""Bella's okay, L-O-L"". Really, though. Text messages? I would think that informing your potential spouse of your child's well being would warrant a phone call at least.<br/><br/>Now, I have to point out the scene where Edward decides to flash Bella the goods. He want's to educate her in the ways of the vampire. He cannot go out into sunlight NOT because he'll burn or turn to dust, but because he turns into a failed children's art project. Reading the scene in the book I already knew whoever turned the book into a film was going to have issues with the scene. However, I really thought they'd aim for something above spraying Robert Pattinson with water then dumping craft store glitter on him. I didn't even notice the ""sparkles"" at first. My friend turned to me and commented ""The sun hits him and he gets gross and sweaty?"" because, let's face it, that's what he looked like. Damp and dirty. Oh baby, I can hardly contain myself! I could go on and nit pick at everything, but I'm just going to wrap it up and say this movie was awful and I'm disappointed in the screenwriter as well as the director. I feel like Hardwicke was too focused on making the mise-en-scene beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, which is all well and good, but in doing so she over looked her cast of actors who would probably get over looked at a high school play audition with the way they displayed their acting abilities in this movie. Though, maybe I take back the part of being disappointed in the screenwriter since you can only do so much with the source material you're handed.<br/><br/>BRING ON THE TWILIGHT FANS! I CAN TAKE THEM! *Shields at maximum power!*"
"CaniCanz","5","252","397","19 November 2008"," Movie is Missing the Magic - An Opinion
","This is just one person's opinion. No need to get angry, in fact I'd like you to convince me I'm wrong.<br/><br/>The movie is missing the magic. Edward appeared on screen and I swooned. He opened his mouth and I cringed. Edward is strong and confident. He wasn't a whiney, smitten child. In love yes, but brooding and in pain. Bella was delicate, not just dry and indifferent. This Bella lacked emotion maybe even a soul-who is she? She didn't feel like the yearning, thoughtful Bella I had imagined. I wished she needed to be protected. This version can take care of her own business--and I'm not sure how bad she wants to be with Edward, or why for that matter. Maybe if she narrated her emotions would have been more pronounced. Don't get me wrong, the actors' chemistry is very evident, they should get married and have melodramatic children. But was the film from Bella's perspective or not? The changing pov was off-putting. This film proves that Meyer's pages and pages are what bring this story and Edward and Bella's love to life.<br/><br/>The TONE was completely lost in the book to script to screen translation. The story is supposed to be a song that takes you to another world, one where vampires and werewolves exist. The story is an intoxicating melody. Here we're presented with a boy-band pop song sung by kids who think of themselves as classically trained Opera singers. PICK ONE. Be a chart-topping, America's Top 40 or be the haunting, dangerous lullaby I think a lot of fans were looking for.<br/><br/>Speaking of boy band...the screen version of Jacob Black is one ""Bye Bye Bye"" from being the lead singer in Over-Produced-Axe-Wearing-Guy-Group 2008. Jacob, in my mind, is earthy. He's a guy's guy and gets his hands dirty fixing cars and building stuff. Jacob always left me feeling like he was wise beyond his years, a smitten kitten of course, but I always felt that he was more dynamic than this cute little wig-wearing version. I always felt this sense of history and quiet power. This version wears Abercrombie (and randomly appears from behind trees apparently...you'll see).<br/><br/>The cast was quite OK for me. I did feel bad watching them try to deliver the lines they were given. I get that this is a vampire-romance movie, but honestly. The script is dripping in gooey, sticky, melted, mixed cheeses. OK, so it's fantastical, but to slap me in the face with Gouda and Brie every other frame is just insulting. <br/><br/>Cheese aside, Charlie was great. His timing was spot on. Carlisle played the part, but the caked-on white makeup so completely distracting. Esme-- I wanted to crawl up onto her lap and have her tell me bedtime stories. Love it. Alice... that's her on that screen. A little bouncier and she's perfect. Jasper-- freakishly creepy and pained, loved it. When he comes out of his shell and plays more than the wide-eyed silent sidekick, I'm all over it. Those who doubted Reed need to reconsider. Rosalie is freaking hot and one sassy vamp. Emmett...holy crap, on the money (call me). Jessica is the best casting job in life...Mike, however...really?<br/><br/>I know that this is just a movie. Film is a different medium than books. We get to create the world from a book but people get to interpret for us on screen, I know. I just wish it wasn't so far off base for me. I wanted nothing more than to enjoy it. I think I'm going to remember the series the way I imagined it and set this version aside. My oil canvas painting to their Polaroid. <br/><br/>Who's melodramatic now? This girl.<br/><br/>Here's hopping they make a choice for the next one: teen scene or dark love story so audiences know what they're getting into. Teenie Boppers are quite loyal, perhaps bubblegum will beef up their box office."
"socact-1","7","415","674","21 November 2008"," Really Grew on Me...
","To preface this review, I read all four Twilight books in one weekend (last weekend, actually) when I picked the first one up at the airport, and could not put it down. I zipped through the other three and went to the midnight screening on opening day. To say the least, I was captivated by Twilight (and I'm in my 20s...).<br/><br/>I was anxious to see the movie because, like so many other people, I felt really invested in Bella and Edward's story. Not only that, but I love the vampire premise - it just never gets old, especially when you put a new spin on it, as Meyer did in her books. The events of each book really ran together for me, so in a way, I felt like a non-Twilighter coming into this film. I really didn't care if the movie deviated from the book - in fact, I was kind of hoping it would, since you can't expect a book to translate directly to the screen. I heard a lot of serious Twilight teens complaining about ""major things"" missing when I left the theater, but I honestly didn't notice any major omissions.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was better than I expected (based on previews, I expected it to be extremely cheesy, low-budget, and awkwardly filmed). It definitely grew on me as it went on, especially Pattinson's performance. His introduction was extremely awkward - not sure if that was Hardwicke's fault or Pattinson's acting. In any case, as soon as he settled into his character, he was absolutely captivating. Stewart plays a great brooder, and she certainly did that here. I loved the scenes with her father; in my opinion, these were some of the gems of the movie.<br/><br/>The romance between Edward and Bella, which was obviously the crux of the film, was fueled by their chemistry, but not much else. Where was the development?! I really wish Hardwicke or the screenwriter or somebody had taken more time to delve into the roots of their relationship. It all just happened way too fast. I feel like this happened because of the James story, which to me was almost completely unnecessary (yeah, I know, it's a big part of the book and obviously needs to be here). But even so, the film would have been a more moving romance, and probably a more poignant, emotional film, if that cheesy, goofy subplot hadn't existed.<br/><br/>Hardwicke dealt exceptionally well with teen angst, which was evident in the high school shots. Unfortunately, she really struggled with the vampire side of things. I have to put most of the blame on the director because the characters were all spot-on, very well-acted and well-cast. I also think a higher budget would have done wonders for this movie, and I'm hoping that becomes a reality for the sequel. The special effects were embarrassingly bad, and nearly ruined the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""Twilight"" for what it was - a romance that probed the timeless dilemma of wanting what you can't have (and despite Meyer's Mormon beliefs, this whole series is basically a metaphor for sex). It makes for an interesting, compelling story, and I expect more from the sequels, because the potential is certainly there."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","4","1132","1902","21 November 2008"," So bad it's ALMOST good.
","NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review.<br/><br/>Another much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not.<br/><br/>As a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It's not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it's one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I've ever seen. Let's not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It's one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of ""so bad it's ALMOST good"". Yes, I just invented that category.<br/><br/>The 'allure' of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she's perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me.<br/><br/>Our supporting players...Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can't take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward's 'sister', and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie.<br/><br/>Okay, I don't really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There's a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn't bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson.<br/><br/>That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are.<br/><br/>As far as these visual effects go, I've seen a few vampire movies in my day. I'm going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well.<br/><br/>All in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn't help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a 'disappointment' and that the film went 'half way' with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I'll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it's ALMOST good."
"AnnaShade","Null","467","773","21 November 2008"," Pretty Good for What They Had to Work With
","I have read the books, and the first thing I noticed was that the story wasn't about a plot line at all. It's about the characters and what's going on with them. Stephenie Meyer focuses on interaction, not on dialog, plot, or setting, which is fine. But it makes for a bad movie.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Twilight wasn't that bad of a film. I expected it to be much worse. As I said, there's very little plot or dialog in the book, so it's hard to make a convincing film. They had to over act looks to try and communicate without many words. I could probably count on one hand the lines in the movie.<br/><br/>Other than the over acting, it wasn't bad. There were some very good moments and some very ""eh"" moments. But overall I would recommend it to Twilight fans. I probably won't ever want to see it again, but it's okay at midnight with some school friends who like it or something."
"Impartial-Critic","Null","47","70","5 March 2020"," Didn't Know Vampires Need Public Education!
","Not completely sure if this should be considered a parody for the vampire sub-genre or an adaptation of a couple of teens meet in public school one of them Edward who belongs to a vampire clan and the other is a human Bella who stays with her dad, they both develop an attraction towards each other.<br/><br/>Least to say about Twilight is this, it was excruciating!...a bad joke from the beginning to the end. The story is too lame and too shallow, which can be described as a clich√©d teen romance that plays out in a complete opposite manner of any folklore or even a decent vampire adaption. The casting choices are weird, like they decided to combine all the ugly actors/actress in 1 movie! In my opinion, most people miss good looks with fame and propaganda, Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are facially ugly! remove the fame and publicity then put them to work in any convenience store and people won't even look at them twice.<br/><br/>The acting was over all bad, the actors facial expression and eye movement so weird and bad as if they are smelling onions while shooting the whole movie! the makeup is a laughable disaster as if you are watching movies acted by clowns...clearly the director and the makeup department don't know the difference between having a pale skin and applying a clown makeup, not to mention the ugly wig of Taylor Lautner. The VFX is laughable with all the fake flying around, goes without mentioning the joke effect of vampires under sunlight, no fangs and human like bite marks! It's an over all disastrous movie and the fact that Twilight had some kind of success it can only prove how shallow the average audience mentality has become."
"jury28","1","284","503","22 November 2008"," I wanted to throw my eye balls at it!
","I would give this movie no stars.. This movie is pathetic. I mean so pathetic. The acting was awful! <br/><br/>The movie starts well, but once they introduce the Cullens its pretty much downhill. Ashley Greene looks good as Alice, Jackson Rathbone looks constipated as Jasper, a wooden plank would have been a more convincing Edward. Robert Pattinson deserves the Razzie, second thought, his acting is so horrible that a razzie is like honoring him. <br/><br/>Vampires are supposed to be scary, when Edward scales trees he acts like a monkey, move over Kong! The baseball match looks like Super Mario Sluggers on steroids! Horrible..<br/><br/>The scene where Edward glitters is pathetic. It looks someone dumped some glitter on him.. <br/><br/>On the other hand Charlie Swan and Jacob were spot on.<br/><br/>Over all the director tried too hard and lost it all. I strongly believe someone with more experience should direct a high profile film like this. This movie doesn't appeal as a Vampire movie or as a Romantic movie. Its pathetic.. <br/><br/>Jury"
"ricedoll","4","161","278","19 November 2008"," Twilight
","I'm an avid Twilight reader and stalker (yes I went to Hot Topic tour.) I can't remember a time when I was SO anxious and excited to see a movie. I just saw Twilight at a screening in San Francisco on 11/17. I left the theatre feeling¬Ö..indifferent.<br/><br/>First of all, I knew the movie was not going to be based exactly to the books but at the same time it kind of hurts me to say that it just wasn't good. ~sigh I felt that the director Catherine tried to bring her indie elements into the Hollywood style movie that just didn't work. The opening scene with the deer was alright, but I was just about to laugh out loud when the movie got to Edward and Bella finally acknowledging what Edward truly was. This was the biggest issue I had. I didn't think viewers were able to experience the intensity of Bella and Edward relationship. I wouldn't believe that Bella was ready to place her undying pledge to go vamp at the end. The scene was so choppy, where it felt like the scene was full of greatest hits of one liners all cram into this one scene. It wasn't the turning point as where it should have been. The movie was clearly not based on romance, which is the ultimate theme of the book. The movie hastily breezed through the courtship development to finally get to the lingering action sequence.<br/><br/>I like Robert but he just couldn't pull off a convincing Edward. His reaction to Bella in Biology class was just laughable. Again Catherine trying to pull the artsy camera cuts--- silly, silly. Jasper's reaction was humorous also.<br/><br/>Edward's showing Bella who he was in the sun was not remarkable. His body hardly glisten. Couldn't they get Britney's Swarovski body suit from her ""Toxic"" video? The movie nicely brought out Rosalie's dislike for Bella. Alice was very convincing and good. Carlise was attractive and fitting.<br/><br/>I was surprised by the diverse student body of Forks. I liked Jessica a lot. It was hard to see her as the small minded character as how she was written in the book.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie wasn't made for fans of the book, but to lure moviegoers into (hopefully) the film franchise.<br/><br/>Little things that could have been included in the movie to make the readers happy wasn't included. Such as why couldn't Bella wear the blue V neck sweater when meeting the Cullens for the first time? Why couldn't Bella attack Edward on the onset of their first kiss? Why couldn't Edward's couch be black? Why did James bite Bella on her forearm and not her hand? <br/><br/>As a Twilighter, I think I may go see it again just to see if my reactions change, but I wouldn't recommend this film to any non-Twilighters."
"black_heart_night","3","363","650","26 February 2009"," the book was better and thats not saying much
","Now do not be offended by any of this, this is just my opinion.<br/><br/>No I am not a rabid Twilight hater. I read the books, yes all of them. I thought they were interesting. Not very original, well thought out, or well written, but decent enough to read. I had several problems with this movie. It's not just the cast. Though I think Cam Gigandet did an excellent job as James. Okay my main problem with the cast was not really who they picked. I guess it boils down to the fact that Bella and Edward really are not that interesting. Is it so much to ask for a heroine who isn't so whiney and can take care of herself. Or maybe a vampire who isn't broody and boring and doesn't SPRAKLE! ((sorry that just bugs the **** out of me)) I think if they had stuck more to the actually book it would have been better. Granted, not by much, but it would have at least gotten 5 stars from me.<br/><br/>I do like the cinematography. The movie is gorgeous visually, and as i stated before the acting was not terrible. I would have picked different people for most of the cast, but thats me. I do have one more thing to say before i end this.<br/><br/>RABID TWIlIGHT FANS NEED TO CALM DOWN!!! ITS JUST A BOOK AND MOVIE SERIES!! don't take the fact that people don't like it to heart. if you like it, thats great."
"cligutan","9","747","1405","19 November 2008"," Just trying to enjoy the movie for what it is.
","Don't spend your time comparing it to the book. If you just sit there comparing the book and the movie, you'll take the fun out of the movie itself. If you are a book reader, reading Midnight Sun really helps understand Edward's reactions and such. This is the best movie I've seen that has stayed the closest to the book as much as it could. I do understand why they made a few changes to please some of the moviegoers who haven't read the book. It ties things in a different but acceptable way. I loved how they interpreted the book. I understand that it was a teen movie so of course there was a little cheesiness at times. But hey, the book is geared towards a teen audiences regardless of the wide age range that actually reads it. I think Summit did a good job and should make New Moon."
"winner55","1","10","13","22 March 2009"," Marketing research or film?
","This film is a brilliant example of market research, a product that is perfectly crafted for its target audience, middle-class females ages 12-16. And I sincerely mean that. I know of few films that have so captured the romantic angst of early feminine puberty, and have done so in a pop-cultural idiom touching - at least lightly - on all the hip romantic fads this age group inherits from its parents and elder siblings, from 'goth' to 'Native American spirituality.' It also references much more violent films of the 'vampire' genre without ever betraying its softly shaded early-teen 'sensitiveness.' But good marketing does not necessarily make good film. If you like this film and you are not a middle-class female aged 12-16, you really need to ask yourself why you want to be a middle-class female aged 12-16, because such is the only audience that would not be appalled by this extremely long, drawn-out, soap-operatic ""Dark Shadows"" style inversion of the old Archie comics.<br/><br/>Some other reviewer wrote that he didn't see the 'so bad it's funny' elements of the film. Please, sir, understand that the very idea of vampires playing baseball is inherently grotesque, and amusing for that reason - it's amazing Mel Brooks didn't come up with the idea for ""Dead - and Loving It."" Also, the repeated references to the scent of the heroine driving vampires wild had my friends and me telling feminine hygiene jokes for a good half-hour - deservedly so, since the market research that went into this film is clearly manifested here in the not so subtle reference to the body odors young girls become acutely aware of as they enter their menses. And the first indication that the film is soon to become a trash classic is the very appearance of the vampire hero. Bad enough that the actor was chosen because he looks like an 'emo' cross between an anorexic Joaquin Phoenix and a James Dean suffering manic-depression. But then there's that HAIR! It's precisely the kind of cut young girls think guys should wear.<br/><br/>The point being: the situations, the dialog, the very appearance of the film, although all well-crafted to sell to a target audience, make the film hilariously bad when it doesn't simply just drag (which it does quite a bit).<br/><br/>All this sounds like I'm trashing the intended audience of this film as much as the film itself. Not necessarily. When I was very young, I really thought the comedies of Don Knotts (e.g., ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"") were utterly charming. Although some films I liked as a child I still find amusing (e.g., Three Stooges shorts), I got over my tolerance for Don Knotts by the age of 14. Had his films been worth seeing for someone younger than ten? Sure. Were they utterly atrocious cinematic sludge? You bet. Back in the '60s, 'New Critics' of various arts convinced us that we had to like great art - which also meant, inversely, that we had to defend entertainment we enjoyed as great art. That simply isn't so. If you're a middle-class female aged 12-16, enjoy this feast, it was prepared for you. As you mature you may yet develop more enlightened tastes - the Cullen family did, after all."
"Raeniel_Cuthalion","Null","10","13","7 December 2008"," Well, it wasn't as bad as ""Manos""....
","The Twilight franchise has always given me the willies. I found the books to be an affront to women and portrayed a terrible model of what a 'relationship' should be. I was dragged to the movie by a dear friend, but came out of the theater smiling. It wasn't for the plot or the acting, but for the future joy I know I'll experience when Twilight hits DVD. I intend to MST it into oblivion. The dialog was just... laughable at times.<br/><br/>The entire movie made me giggle.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint has to do with Edward's piano playing skills. If he's 100-something years old, why isn't he playing some Liszt or Rachmaninov? He had all this time to get Really Stinking Good, but he chooses to woo the ""girl of his dreams"" with a piece a second or third year piano student could play. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the music from the movie, including that piece, but I just think that something a little more complicated might have been more suitable given his age and presumed experience. I'm a violinist by trade and have very little knowledge of how to play piano, but after 2 hours in the practice rooms I've almost mastered the right hand of the piece. Next time he should bust out ""La Campanella."" That said, go see Twilight if you need a little laughter in your day. If you're a die hard fan, don't bother."
"maryfabuk","1","10","13","6 December 2008"," Turn and run from the cinema!
","OK, so I've read the books twice and thought they were great, so I went to the cinema with my sister who hadn't read the books yet to see this film which I'd been looking forward to for ages.<br/><br/>Biggest movie mistake ever! The actors were, to put it bluntly, crap. There was absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between any characters. The acting was so wooden and the lines so cheesy that I literally covered my eyes at some points in embarrassment! Kirsten Stewart is extremely miscast as Bella. Every sentence she uttered was peppered with sighs, um's and halting stuttering speech, which basically made me want to throw something at the screen after a while. The only time this varied was the hospital scene. Edward tells her he'd be better off leaving her, and she does raise her voice an octave, even if it was a laughable delivery in what should have been a serious scene.<br/><br/>I wonder if anyone told the actors that they can vary their tone and pitch when speaking, or if they were told to deliver every line in the same boring monotone? The effects were horrendous, the flash back of Carlisle and the werewolves was totally unnecessary and something a child could have come up with. I mean, great costumes guys! Just stick a flat cap on and some breeches and away we go! There we have a genuine flash back! My sister and I were in stitches for all the wrong reasons, mainly the bit where Edward sucks out the venom from Bella and the expression on his face when he's doing it! I mean, does he always go cross eyed when he feeds or what? It must have rubbed off on Bella anyway cos she was also cross eyed in this scene. Maybe it was an outtake they forgot to remove? The other characters don't get enough screen time for me to have an opinion of, but I do hope they use Alice more in the next film. She's the only one who seems to have a bit of promise.<br/><br/>I hope Kirsten Stewart gets her finger out for New Moon, seeing as we're supposed to believe she's so in love with Edward she cant live without him. In Twilight it came across to me like he annoyed her a bit and she could take him or leave him really.<br/><br/>Bad casting, bad effects and really bad directing made this film for me the years biggest flop. It should have gone straight to DVD.<br/><br/>All in all, avoid this film like the plague!"
"dancer-45","3","51","85","21 November 2008"," Where 's the Vision?
","Okay, just got out of theatre and let me begin by saying I am a high school girl who went in a big group of friends. I have read all the books and was just interested in seeing how they adapted the story to film (1), and also how well the film by itself as just a movie (2).<br/><br/>1) Adaptation: almost spot on. In essence, the movie stuck close to the book and probably pleased the series fanatics as far as storyline. The part of the adaptation that I felt was off was the casting, as many people have commented on. The movie didn't feel: intimate, romantic, fairytale-like, whirlwind, passionate, etc. Aka all the adjectives that describe the books and make them so popular. The characters for the most part ""looked"" the role, but not all of them carried it out. Robert was dashingly handsome (although, not what I pictured in my mind), and it seemed like he had a good chance of taking the role to the next level. Unfortunately, I think I would like him better if he just froze with his Ray-Bans on in his suit...because that would be more entertaining than the way he delivered his lines. Bella was another big problem. Kristen perfectly looked the role but she came out being cold instead of passionate, unemotional instead of head-over-heels lusting after this guy.<br/><br/>2)As a movie I can say this honestly stunk. :( It moved along choppily, the film editing was all wrong, the soundtrack was wack, and the acting was just not there. Apart from knowing and loving these characters, if you have not read the book you will be asking yourself why there is a 90 minute movie focused on these characters. The build-up, turning point, climax, and resolution were all weak. It is never a good sign when the sold out theatre is laughing at all the wrong times. One to point out would have to be Edward's ""constipation"" reaction when he first sees Bella. I know that the reaction is hard to convey on film but..come on.<br/><br/>So there it is. Love the books. From page to film this was a wasted opportunity. The intention was there but the vision was not."

","'Twilight' was one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in awhile; at least that's how it started. Reminding me a lot of 'The Happening,' I found myself laughing out loud during the first half and then simply hating life during the last half. I have heard this was meant for teenage girls. Fine, I get it and I'm not one. However, how I wish more for them. They deserve so much more. It's absolutely no wonder why this movie dropped its audience 62% on weekend 2. There are so many points to cover for this two-hour tragedy, I'll at least attempt to cover the incredibly bad aspects: awful, laugh-out-loud acting and dialogue/narration, horrible soundtrack, special effects were downright amusing, the bad (""Johnny Suede"") hairdos and the desperate attempts at a franchise ¬ñ let's just set up every scene to set the stage for the inevitable part II, III, etc. I'm just going to assume the people playing the parts (it's too nice to call them actors) read the original material. Well, the ""I can't live without you"" wooden dialogue seems like they are seriously reading from the book rather than playing the parts. And one of the worst aspects of this film was the fact that after all the lovey-dovey stares, (oh, God, the constant stares Bella and Edward give each other. STOP, please, God, STOP!) they seemed to forget one of the most basic elements in any plot ¬ñ the adversary. OK. Well, let's introduce one 3/4s into the film in the shape of Brad Pitt. Why does he want Bella? To get back to the family? Why? Oh, I guess I'll have to wait for Part II. And yes, I plan on waiting in line for that film. I'm always in the mood for a good laugh or dozen."

","""How Old Are You?"" ""17"" ""How long?"" ""A While"" ""What are you?"" ""A vampire... are you afraid?"" ""...No""<br/><br/>This is the perfect example of how the script is layed out in Twilight. If a script's IQ is judged by how many words are in a sentence, this movie would be mentally unfit to be in public. This movie is truly poorly written. I wouldn't mind the movie as much if it didn't have such poor dialog. Since this is a dialog driven movie, I expect a good script, but it was god-awful. This movie hardly had any good vampire action. Hell, the vampires didn't even have any fangs.<br/><br/>I realize that the books are well written and popular, but the company who produced Twilight better get a better writer. Otherwise the franchise will fall extremely flat, and all the teenagers watching the movies will wake up... very soon."

"randomhooves","1","8","10","17 August 2011"," Avoid at all costs...
","To say this review ""contains spoilers"" is to imply the viewing experience will be ruined, or at least in some way damaged by reading them. This film has already been ""spoiled"" There are few redeeming features - the scenery and the reasonably pleasant looking Kristen Stewart being the only 2 I can think of. The film opens with a pale girl (Stewart) moving from Arizona (and her mother) to Washington State (and her dad) - no hard feelings on either side though. She meets some random Native Americans and then goes to school where she immediately is befriended by an unbelievable multi-ethnic group. Also a mysterious family of incestuous ""foster"" kids, who seem to be the only paler beings than Bella (Stewart) in existence. They also all look to be in their mid-20's despite supposedly being 17. Brooding amongst this group is Robert Patterson - who is her ""leading man"". This is where the film ended for me - the interaction between the two of them was so static and unbelievable - it bypassed normal teen awkwardness and descended into slow motion shots and.....so....many.....pauses, seriously this film would be half an hour shorter if they had a conversation like normal teenagers. After being saved from an out of control car by Patterson our two star-crossed lovers start hanging out and she guesses he is a vampire - but a nice one who doesn't feed on humans any more. A small part of me died then. RP wants to show her then what he looks like in the sunlight (these vampires are fine wandering about in the daylight, but avoid sunlight at all costs). A part of me wanted him to explode into dust so the film would end, but sadly it didn't. Instead we saw, not a burning vampire, not a revealed monstrosity drooling blood. No. He was sparkly. That's right, he sparkled. Gold. Like an underground 80's pop star covered in glitter. I didn't pay much attention after this happened, I only kept the telly on as background noise - there was a ""humerous"" scene where KS went round RPs house and the rest of his ""family"" (incuding the local doctor) used the kitchen ""for the first time"" to cook her some food. There was a baseball game with vamp powers and KS got stalked by some random ""evil"" vampire. Ends with him biting her RP and the family destroy him and RP sucks out the vampire ""poison"" just saving her from turning into a vamp herself, before RP and KS head off to the prom - as you do. This was over 2hrs of wasted life - it makes Buffy look like Oscar winning acting and I am amazed it was ever green lighted for filming. A true golden turd winner, knocking even the derisable APEX from it's lowly perch."

"JoeytheBrit","Null","8","10","7 December 2009"," How is it possible to make a dull vampire movie?
","There's no doubting that I'm not a member of the intended market for this film (a good thirty years too old, alas) and it's equally true that I'm also of the wrong gender, but the phenomenal success of this film is puzzling to me. It's quite difficult to make an uninteresting film about vampires ‚Äì although quite a few have succeeded ‚Äì but this, the first of a franchise, set amongst a high school milieu recognisable to its target demographic, is as dull as the palette director Catherine Hardwicke chooses to paint her picture with.<br/><br/>While I like vampire flicks, I don't really like films that play too much with accepted vampire lore. Twilight doesn't so much play with its conventions as totally re-invent them for its own somewhat cynical purposes. Twilight's vampires have no fear of daylight ‚Äì they just turn a pretty silver colour when exposed to direct sunlight ‚Äì which means they can interact with humans, go to school, hold down a job ‚Äì as a doctor, no less; they have no fangs, no fear of water or holy symbols, and they don't feed on the blood of humans, choosing instead to chow down on wild animals. In fact, in many ways they're a typical all-American family: prick your thumb and suck the blood and you'd be as much of a vampire as these guys. (Perhaps I should amend that last sentence to typical dysfunctional All-American family).<br/><br/>Of course, this makes the prospect of becoming a vampire a not unappealing one; after all, you get to live forever and, if like the lead vampire here, you get turned in your teens, you get to spend eternity appealing to pretty girls of a similar age. This being aimed at teens, there's a strong identification with the trials of an outsider. The young heroine is the new girl in town whose father is the local cop, and the vampires are outsiders because of who they are. All of which makes them appealing to teenagers who feel the world doesn't understand them and who are subsequently unsure of their place in it.<br/><br/>To be fair to the author, it's at least a fairly unique idea, and the Twilight books have clearly struck a chord with young teenagers. The film is reasonably well made, and while it won't make a particularly enjoyable experience for most adults, it at least doesn't cut corners in the belief that it doesn't have to try as hard simply because it's aimed at a less demanding than average target audience."

","This movie was terrible. If you read the books and watched the movie and liked it, you didn't pay attention to detail. Bella is supposed to be some klutzy, pale, sarcastic girl from Arizona. She is supposed to be a very giving person and puts others before her. She ALSO is supposed to be more on the emotional side of things, thats her awkward trait. Edward is supposed to be very protective of her and very suave. He looks even more awkward than she did!! He is a vampire, they are (supposedly) these charming, witty people. He is also very sarcastic with her.<br/><br/>The movie messed up some one the things. Dates and time. In the book Bella says she went to Forks every summer until she finally told her dad that she didn't like it there so they vacationed in California instead... In the movie they messed that up. Jacob is supposed to tell her all about Edward and his family, she flirts with him to get the information. <br/><br/>Where the heck did Lauren go?! Jessica (in the movie) was supposed to be a combination of both. Book Jessica was phony. She pretended to be nice and friendly with Bella because she noticed that EVERYBODY liked the new girl. Lauren just hated Bella.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewert is apparently the greatest actress of our time... HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!?!?! She doesn't show emotion, her scared voice and her happy voice sound the same. The only good scene in the movie was when she went to find James. And she blinked, looked around way too much. SHe bit her lip (which is a quality of Bella, she took it way too far.) and breathed heavily. Bella goes through random bursts of excitement in the movie, especially when she finds that Edward stayed the night as promised.. <br/><br/>The first kiss happens after the Meadow, not in her room. <br/><br/>Victoria doesn't talk until the third book. Rosalie only talks once or maybe twice in the first book.<br/><br/>Alice and Jasper have a more emotional Connection. Emmet and Rosalie have a more physical romance. Jasper comforts Bella a heck of a lot more in the book. ""I know what your thinking. And your wrong. You are worth it."" (He said that to Bella after the whole thing with James.)<br/><br/>THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THE MUSIC. I would recommend the soundtrack, it is awesome."

I figured there was no way the books could be as bad as the movie with the huge amount of fan base they had. Where was the love, the fire, or for better lack of appropriate term, the bite.

","The only reason I never read Twilight when it first came out, long before it was popular, was because I read a book review stating that it was a clich√©d and traditional¬ótwo things that I hate more than anything. The only reason I watched the movie was so I could actually understand what the vast majority of America was talking about when they raved about it. I came with low expectations and an open mind. I reassured myself, after all, I do enjoy love stories when they're original and memorable, so this couldn't be too bad, right? Three hours later, I left the theater feeling as if I was just released from a torture device and struggled desperately to my car on weak legs that just walked through hell on earth. Is my last sentence melodramatic? Maybe, but compared to the cheesy melodrama that IS the plot of Twilight, me sitting through that atrocious movie looks downright life-or-death.<br/><br/>From the first scene to the last, at least 1/3 of every scene in the movie is filled with nothing but characters staring at each other or at various things. I've never thought I would have to sit here and actually type up a complete paragraph complaining about the amount of staring in a movie, but, folks, the day has come. Bella meets Edward: they don't talk, they literally just stare. The vampire plot point is reveled: they stare. Bella is in a life-or-death situation: she stares at whatever is about to kill her. At one point, a car is ready to crush her, and what does she oh-so-realistically do? Stare at it.<br/><br/>The acting is that hilariously bad. During the majority of the movie Bella has a look on her face that is a mix between being high and having an orgasm¬ówhile staring. Edward, despite what the horny pre-teen girls (and middle-aged women) want to believe, is a walking self-parody. Cheesy lines (that he repeats over and over again), unintentionally cheesy lines (""I'm so hot, and that makes me a perfect killer!""), and did I mention he's supposedly hundreds of years old yet he still acts like an angsty-creepy-weird-virgin-guy? <br/><br/>So, how was the story? It's based on a novel, so it has to have a plot, right? Wrong. Put simply, vampire romance is the most unoriginal idea ever to hit literature. Not to mention movies like Near Dark and Let the Right One In already beat the overused plot bloody on the big screen. Essentially, Twilight in one line is: boy and girl fall in love, boy must sacrifice everything for girl as she sits there like a pretty Barbie doll (and Kristen Stewart isn't even much to look at here), then they both commit. And while you're watching it, it seems even less interesting than that. There is zero entertainment value unless you're a hopelessly horny female who humps her pillow with images of Edward in her head, or you're a hopelessly pathetic male who just wants to impress his girlfriend because he can relate to a ""emotional love story"". I can't comment on the former, but, seriously, I'm a guy who likes love stories and this is NOT a love story. It's a traditionalist middle school English essay with flat characters and no plot other than: put two horny kids together, but appeal to the ""dark"" crowd by making it a vampire story . . . without even showing fangs.<br/><br/>Other dishonorable mentions: 1) Twilight = Napoleon Dynamite - the humor + stupid subplots 2) The ""Restrain yourself, Edward, don't suck her blood!"" scene brings unintentional cheese to a new level 3) The movie never ends; two hours seems like eternity (in hell) 4) Baseball doesn't make edge-of-your-seat action 5) There is no action 6) There are no real vampires unless you count pretty-boys 7) Stephanie Myers completely screws up the vampire myths <br/><br/>I almost feel sorry for Catherine Hardwicke. She's an amazing director, and she singlehandedly turned this stupid crap-fest into a well-done movie on a technical level, and everything else was out of her hands. But who would honestly turn down the money this movie would bring in? I don't blame her, I blame Stephanie Myers.<br/><br/>I also feel sorry for the countless people who watch this and think it's a quality love story, thus never being exposed to the true love stories out there. What is Twilight? A horny, unoriginal, childish fantasies put into a movie. That, like always, wins mass reader, and now viewer, acclaim. I just wish one day popular fiction wasn't a synonym for retard fiction.<br/><br/>0/10"

","Let's face it, the movie was a total let down. I had low expectations. Extremely low but the movie disappointed me even then. The amazing love story we all read in the books was transformed into a whiny preteen nightmare. There was chemistry between Robert and Kristen, there is no denying that, but I didn't feel the need that is in the books. They are supposed to be I-can't-live-without-you, take-me-forever, I'm-devoted-to-you-always in love (Unless you want to count that one incident in Eclipse, but let's face it, most of us don't) but all I saw was a bored vampire and an indifferent girl.<br/><br/>The one thing that made me most angry was the complete disregard for the meadow scene. It is a VERY important part in the book where they pretty much declare themselves to each other. This meadow scene lasted all of 10 seconds and consisted of them staring at each other. They changed around the timing of the movie so much that it almost made no sense. Lets face it, the book was a good story but the writing wasn't up to par. It was pretty much written to be turned into a movie and the screenwriter obviously didn't realize that.<br/><br/>Sure, Robert was smoking hot (don't lie, you saw the ray bands) but his performance of Edward was terrible. The first time Bella walked into the Biology class, I laughed at his expression as did most people in the theater (some of them were too busy squealing). His badly-covered up English accent was also laughable.<br/><br/>Jasper was perfect, the person that made me laugh during the movie because if you looked, not at where the camera was focused, in most scenes you could see him lurking in the background and I think it fit his character well. Carlisle was cast to a T as were Esme, Jessica, Rosalie, Emmett and Alice. They all fit their parts well even if I imagined Alice a little bouncier, Emmett a little bigger and Rosalie a bit more bitchy.<br/><br/>Oh, the camera work. I'm not denying it, I liked the flickers between scenes at times but after a while, it can give you a headache. The insane closeups did NOT do what they were supposed to (show the intensity) instead they made me where they were half the time and realize how much makeup the actors where wearing. Every time there was a close up on Robert, it was totally obvious he was wearing contacts. Seriously, look for the line.<br/><br/>The one thing that was actually done really well was the climax with the ballet studio and James. The fight scene was pretty cool and I totally believed that James wanted to kill Bella right there. But, with every up there is a down. After James is killed and They are taking care of Bella, why couldn't Edward have been more upset? It's written right in the book that he all but cries when he sees her.<br/><br/>The movie was hyped up to an extreme so it was obvious it would be a let down, I just didn't know how bad it actually was. I don't get why they couldn't do little things that would have made it a bit better; The biology class incident? Bella wearing blue? Why the hell did James have to bite her arm instead of her hand? Would that have been SO hard to change? All in all, go see it if you are a Twilight fan but be weary. If you aren't, stay away because you will not understand a thing that is going on. As I said in my title, somewhere, Edwards is rolling over in his hypothetical coffin (yes I know they don't sleep in coffins, or sleep period for that matter, but that's why it's hypothetical)"

Unfortunately these were not the only disappointments I faced in this viewing. The cinematography was less than acceptable. The book made a huge point about Edward stepping into the light. He shimmered and sparkled as the light bounced off his dead, cold skin. Yet in the movie NONE of this happened. He stepped into the light and ""BAM"" disappointment. He barely even glowed. Now if we can create movies were there are blue people and wild animals, or where people are able to water bend, I'm pretty sure that they can make a guy sparkle. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the acting was, well in a better way of putting it, on a scale from 0-10 (10 being the best) the acting of the crew in general was a 0. Now who should we blame for this? The casting director, the director, screenwriter? I believe that they all are at fault in a sense. From picking a British actor who had never used an American accent before to play a boy who had lived in Forks, for who knows how long, to picking a leading actress who's acting was as dead as her figurative boyfriend. I've seen better actors in the drama department at my dinky barely 1,000 student school. She had no emotion, and kept the same monotone voice throughout the entire movie. In the book it was obvious that even though she kept to herself an awful lot, she was an extremely emotional human. Even at the most intense scenes, such as finding out your boyfriend is a vampire, or meeting the blood sucking family, she didn't even show signs of fear, worry, excitement, nothing. Her face was as vacant as her mind. <br/><br/>My next point, this film has made roughly around $367,160,734. Yet, they wouldn't spend enough money to hide the wires that were used in order to make the characters ""fly"". And seriously guys? These vampires are supposed to be un-humanly fast, and I swear the speed that they made the go in the movie was slower than an all-star track racer, my grandmother could have moved faster. <br/><br/>In general, I went into this movie with decently low expectations, as I usually do when seeing a movie after reading the books, but I was shocked at the amount of disappointment I felt when leaving the theater. I feel as if it wasn't even worth my time."

","************SPOILER****** O.K. people, I will admit right here, right now, I simply LOVED the books. I have read them all several times and I was genuinely excited at the prospect of MY book coming to life on the big screen. I went to the movie theater with my die hard Twilight friends, expecting to be amazed. Well, I was amazed all right. But definitely not in a good way. The scene starts out with Bella( Kristen Stewart) leaving for the airport with her mother. For some strange reason, her carry on item is a potted cactus plant. The scene them melts into a birds eye view of the beautiful Washington mountains(helped along by whinny, annoying, indie rock music). As Bella comes to terms with her new life(narrated by the mannish voiced Stewart), Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner, wearing a dead ferret on his head) arrives with his father and their old, Bella's new, truck. The only thing they got right in this scene was the truck for crying out loud! In the book, Charlie(Billy Burke) is not on speaking terms with Billy because of his prejudicial dislike for the Cullen clan; however, in the movie, the two men joke and laugh and have a grand old time. Meanwhile, Bella and Jacob make forced conversation, never quite looking at each other(even though in the book, they don't meet until very much later). Stewart's forced smiles, bad acting, and foul mood completely ruin the scene. We then move on to the 'first sight' of the Cullen clan. I shouldn't even comment. The characters come in-slow motion of course-in pairs, each arm and arm with his/her own lover. Lets start with Rosalie(Nikki Reed). Reed is short(Reed wore awkward, six- inch heels she couldn't even walk in), very tan(can you say, pasty make- up?), with brown hair(Reed was unwilling to dye it, so she wore an ill fitting wig), moles, and an all around ugly face. The choice for her role was made solely because of the director's relationship with Reed. The real Rosalie-as stated in the book-is tall, statuesque, with golden blond hair, very pale, and beautiful-all in all, the complete opposite of Reed. I honestly like the choice for Emmett, except I wished Kellan Lutz beefed up a bit more. Alice was too tall, but otherwise I had no problem with Ashley Greene(she could have lost a little weight though- just saying). Now, Jackson Rathbone as Jasper would have been fine, if the guy could act. He took the phrase 'hungry enough to eat a horse' way too literally. He had a pinched, grotesque look on his face for the whole of the movie. Finally, ah, Edward, how will I begin? Well, Robert Pattinson looked the part, if not a little too skinny, but oh, ah, ugh, the make-up! What on earth were these people thinking? You could tell he was wearing a gallon of make-up, but they ran out of it when the reached his Adam's Apple. Edward also, apparently, loves the new strawberry Cover Girl wet slicks lip gloss. Now, onto the biology lab. What to say, what to say. Well I recommend, Vampires Suck. The people there displayed Pattinson's reaction to Bella's scent perfectly. In the book, it merely states that Edward goes rigid in his seat, glaring at Bella with hate filled eyes as she walked past him. Past him. Not Bella walking in front of a fan-slow motion, once again- with her mouth opened suggestively. And Edward DID NOT slap his hand to his face, hiding his nose from someone who farted near by. And I don't remember Edward trying not to cry in the book either(his 'I'm trying really hard not to cry' face reappeared throughout the movie). Well, I am bored now, so I wont bore anyone else with the rest of my review for the most terrible, poorly written, directed,acted, etc, movie in a decade. The indie film feel with Stewart grabbing at her hair, jutting her chin out, shaking her head(you'd think she was a dog), and stuttering makes you want to stalk out of the theater to go shriek at the manager for your money back. Stewart and Pattinson's chemistry is non-existent in this poorly adapted, haphazardly written, laughably acted atrocity of a film."
"wwe7961","1","6","7","2 December 2010"," Bland-something boring and uninteresting Ex. Twilight
","Bland is the perfect word to use with everything about Twilight. Bland acting, bland story, bland dialogue, bland direction, bland cinematography, bland romance, bland effects, bland action, everything is bland about Twilight. It is one of those movies you watch to make fun of, but after watching you feel like you really wasted two hours. It's unlike other bad movies were you can watch, review, and feel entertained by making fun of it. With Twilight everything is so boring that you feel like falling asleep ten minutes in. I found myself so bored that I started thinking about stuff for around thirty seconds. When stopped thinking about stuff I looked back at my TV to see the movie playing. It is so bland that thirty seconds of though made me forget that it was playing. That is like a cup of water and a stale piece of bread blandness. Sure there is other things to complain about also. The effects are terrible. When Edward runs it looks like he's going up an escalator in the ground. Then there is the moronic romance. Bella staying in love with a guy that stalks her, wants to kill her, and watches her sleep for months is pretty stupid. The ending where Edward sucks the venom out of Belle to stop her from becoming a vampire is stupid. If he let her change she would be safe from vampires, and he wouldn't have to deal with her growing old and dying. Sure she would have to live with seeing her loved ones die, but she would have Edward with her. Also her parents are grow old and die anyway so what's all the difference that she doesn't age during that time. Then of course there is sparkling vampire skin. It is really the stupidest thing ever. How is he supposed to pass as a strong vampire if he has sparkle skin. Why not make it be when he is in the light his true evil form is revealed or something like that? Oh yeah because A.That would be cool B.That would create actual dramatic tension C.Girls like jewelry so they love guys with sparkle skin. I'm not trying to be sexist here it's just these girls who buy this crap are increasing the stereotype of moronic teenage girls that have awful taste. I don't want to be sexist with this statement, but if this is a phenomenon to girls than it is official that a large portion of teenage girls have no taste whatsoever. In the end though it is the blandness that sticks out with this one. A pile of trash in many occasions can be better than nothing. Twilight sure is a nothing.<br/><br/>0 stars out of 4"

","As an avid fantasy reader, I have not delved the vampire depths, and I find the current fad of vampires as sex objects disgusting.<br/><br/>I had planed to never watch this movie, but when I found that some of the former MST3K crowd (Mike, Bill, and Kevin) made their own ""commentary"" for it (rifftrax.com), I just couldn't resist. <br/><br/>To sum up the plot in one word: Angst <br/><br/>To sum up the event that is the movie(in sotto voce): Line!<br/><br/>So if I were to rate this as an MST3K film it would be about a 8 or 9.

","Now the phrase 'dragged to the cinema' is commonly used by people who end up watching a film on the silver screen that they feel embarrassed about having watched. These movie goers know that they have witnessed a truly horrible film and want to forewarn the entire world not to see it, while somehow still maintaining their dignity in having actually watched it in the first place.<br/><br/>Now I'm not going to lie, I have never so much as thought about the Twilight saga, read any of the books or anticipated any of the film releases, but I do recall going out on a date with a girl whom I had a certain penchant for, and in willing to please her we went out, got something to eat and had a nice time. And then she suggested we watch a film in the adjacent cinema.<br/><br/>Now at this point, alarm bells rang. I knew she was crazy about Twilight. I mean, she had already watched the film TWO times in the cinema and it had only been out for a week. But, as is my chivalrous and relaxed nature, I went along with it, telling her that she could choose the film as there was not much out at the time. But in the back of my head I knew what I was getting myself into.<br/><br/>I mean, where to start? How about with analysis of the word 'saga', which comes from early Scadinavian and Germanic settlers and means 'epic or legendary tales'. How this term can be so much as coined to describe this plight, nay, disease that is the scourge of the earth at the moment is beyond belief.<br/><br/>There was nothing that I saw in that film that even made me want to think about watching or reading anything related to the name 'Stephanie Meyer' again. She has been blacklisted from my subconscious, and this travesty of a 'saga' is dead to me now, despite having only scraped the surface of this<br/><br/>Now, I have watched films such as 'Trolls 2' that has been given a rating of 2, and Twilight does not hold a candle to that film. Literally. I would honestly choose that film over this 100 times out of 100. I would in no way describe myself as a film snob, though I would never go out of my way to watch a film that has been ill recommended to me by like minded movie goers, but Twilight is the anomaly. The film that proves that sometimes the most shameful target audiences can prove the most effective - the teen/tween female population who have watched too many sappy animations (I love Pixar releases so this isn't a jab at Disney as a concept) to believe that this storyline could happen to them if they squint hard enough and imagine.<br/><br/>When it actually comes down to me describing the film, the inclusion of Muse gained it one star, whose publicists must be lapping up the adulation at the moment, though whom may be regretting it as soon as the band release a song about vampires and werewolves. The storyline isn't even a bad one, and I could imagine the books to be at least somewhat readable in a very acute (LSD?) state of mind, but the film screams money. Simple as that. And as I count, I believe we are on the 3rd or 4th one now within the space of 2 years, and my hypothesis then rings true now.<br/><br/>The acting was wooden, the 'romance' was transparent, the fight scenes were laughable and yet this girl (both the one sitting next to me and the big manly one on the screen) was lapping it up! Swooning when Edward 'sparkles' (how a girl could find sparkling an attractive quality in a man is beyond me) and crying at the end when they declare undying love for each other, that was read straight off of a cue card.<br/><br/>Suffice to say I haven't spoken to her since."

","I am so tired of hearing all this bull-loney about TWILIGHT! Sick of it! I don't care, this is not how I want to see vampires! But I digress, the whole issue of this review will barely speak of the film and will be entirely based on people who watch it. The original term a friend of mine coined to describe Twilight fans is Twifags, I wanted to simplify it and shorten it to Twigs. Twigs are people so blinded by sparkly vampires that they rush to theaters to see more of them, completely blocking out all other films from the top spot of the box office! I myself am excited to see The Last Air Bender and can already tell that it will be second in the box offices this weekend, because of the legions of Twigs so dedicated to fictional characters. I can't even convince people that this movie is terrible unless they already know that it's so bad. The worst thing about it is the obvious billions they make in marketing what with all the Edward shits I've seen, I mean shirts, no wait, I don't. TWIGS!"

","Now I don't believe in vampires, but there is a lot of folklore that has developed over the years, they are all different, but none as different as Twilight is.<br/><br/>From what I understand of vampires, something can kill them, whether that be silver, wooden stakes, guns, decapitation etc etc, they are never immortal.<br/><br/>Sunlight effects them negatively, whether that'd be them completely being withered away or receiving a nasty sunburn, it effects them, it does not make their hair glitter up and make them look like something that Tiffany & Co. would sell.<br/><br/>They do age, they may age slower, but they do age.<br/><br/>So Twilight comes in and trashes, craps all over and obliterates the entire sub culture that enthusiasts have built over hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Now I want to stress this point strongly, I do not believe in vampires, nor am I a part of their sub culture, but their beliefs should be respected none the less, after all it has developed over a long time, it wasn't written in twenty minutes when a fat woman was high on crack.<br/><br/>Then you add to the fact that a mortal falls in love with the vampire... really? I'm trying to remember something that sounds eerily familiar, of right! Buffy! I don't watch Buffy either, but the woman who wrote Twilight could at least come up with an original idea.<br/><br/>Then there's this Team Edward and Team Jacob crap, which is PROOF, that only a professional author should write a series of books, not someone who is simply trying to milk as many $$ out of an already god awful franchise.<br/><br/>I stated this in the title, but I will state it again, if you enjoy this movie, then please shoot yourself, hang yourself, suicide however you please, just don't spend too many tax dollars. I would do so myself, but for some reason, they invented a law that doesn't allow me to kill people, it's a shame there are no loopholes that allow me to kill stupid people."

","First, I must confess I only watched the DVD and since it was a DVD I watched the film on my own time. Initially I was sceptic about investing two hours on this film and my fears were not misplaced.<br/><br/>Though the first five minutes had some element of anxiety, that was the full stop to all things good about the film. I wonder how this film made so much money. I guess vampire crazed fan base is the only reason.<br/><br/>The life of a film is its story and the characters and I found a lack of both. There are no more than five characters who contribute to the already flimsy plot. And even the characters that were there were not portrayed very well.<br/><br/>There was absolutely no chemistry between the vampire guy and his dame and to make things worse, the story seems way too abrupt and it seems the crew spent far too much time on elaborating unnecessary details rather than fabricating a decent story.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the only thing ""good"" about this film was the way it looked with the eerie backdrop. It manages to usher in a sense of excitement as if one was waiting for something to happen. But, unfortunately that poor one is kept waiting until the end of the film. To be honest I was relieved to see the credits.<br/><br/>The lack of characters and the slow pace of 'Twilight' might have worked for the book, but the film adaptation really needs an overhaul-already.<br/><br/>Verdict: Trash it! And a piece of advice-stay away from the next installment because it is probably going to be as bad if not worse."

","I can go on for days about how much i hate this movie. First off, Robert Pattinson is a horrible actor. the only good movie he was ever in was harry potter 4. It changes everything you know about vampires. I am tired of all the 10-12 year old girls screaming about this movie. Its just so stupid. i've seen if any of my friends liked it, they all said they rather watch disaster movie then this movie. WARNING SPOILER ALERT: So the plot is that Bella (Kristen Stewart) is going to live with her father. when she starts school she meets a strange boy named Edward (Robert Pattinson). She finds out he is a vampire then she is tracked down by three other vampires. That's all I'm going to say.

Not only was the acting terrible, but the whole movie was ridiculous and did not follow the plot line at all.<br/><br/>The faces Robert Pattinson made looked like he was constipated. I all but fell out of my chair, I was laughing so hard. He fit my mental image of Edward, but when he opened his mouth, things went downhill.<br/><br/>Kristen, Kristen. What a disappointment. Throughout the whole movie, she only has two emotions. I could not connect with her at all and she came off as an annoying, scoffing, bratty teenage girl.<br/><br/>The chemistry was awful and awkward. They kissed, like twice and their relationship was mainly awkward staring. At random moments, lines would be ripped from the book (ex: You are my life now) and put in the wrong places.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes were taken out of the movie. Couldn't they have at least put in the blood typing scene? And the meadow scene (which was very sweet and intense) got completely ruined by this sorry excuse of a movie.<br/><br/>Carlisle's hair bugs me. Rosalie didn't show the appropriate amount of hatred. Jasper looked like he was mental. Emmett looked like a wannabe gangster. Esme's eyes kept on unfocusing. Alice just seemed weird.<br/><br/>The music was just bad. I found myself cringing in some parts and covering my ears in others. Ah, Robert Pattinson. What the crap? His song, ""Let me Sign"" was put in the wrong place. It completely ruined the moment of him saving Bella. I was laughing out loud at the horrible singing voice. Just give up the dream, Rob. It's not working for you.<br/><br/>And what was with the creepy camera angles? I was embarrassed to call myself a Twilight fan after this movie. Especially when Bella was driving her truck after telling Charlie she's leaving. Edward just smacked into her window like a bug getting splattered across the windshield.<br/><br/>I hated it and would not recommend it to anyone. Especially non-Twilight fans because they will be very confused. Horrible director, horrible actors, horrible screenwriter, horrible film. It totally and completely ruined a wonderful book.

","Twilight follows shy Bella Swan as she embarks on the greatest adventure of her life. This teen flick is a typical girl meets boy romance with vampires mixed into the equation.<br/><br/>Catherine Hardwicke brings the successful adult teen book to the big screen. She creates a dark and edgy mood and gives the 'Twilight' saga some added bite. Hardwicke has previously written popular gritty drama 'Thirteen' with Nikki Reid, who plays Rosalie Cullen in 'Twilight'.<br/><br/>Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) moves from sunny Phoenix to dull and dingy Forks, after her mother decides to go travelling with her new husband. Whilst she is in Forks she enrols in a new school where she has no problem making friends. It is here in that she meets the mysterious Cullen family. She instantly captures the eye of Edward Cullen (Robert Patterson), but all is not as it seems, as the Cullen family hold a dark secret.<br/><br/>From the opening scene we are gripped as we watch an innocent deer being hunted by some sort of creature. The sweet deer is a metaphor for Bella as it shows us what's to come. We follow the story of Bella's story to Forks, whilst she narrates her reasons for leaving to live with her father. We then see the difference between Phoenix and Forks. We see long shots of Phoenix's mountains and then the camera fades into the snow capped mountains of Forks.<br/><br/>We follow Bella's story as she struggles to fit into her new surroundings. All the girls want to be her friend and all the boys want to go out with her but she does find someone she is interested in, a mysterious pale vampire. From the moment we meet Edward, the camera is drawn to him. Bella is instantly attracted to the mysterious Edward Cullen, played by rising British start Robert Patterson when she glances across the classroom at him, but he seems utterly repulsed by her. The next day Edward miraculously saves Bella from a potentially deadly car crash with what seems to be superhuman abilities. From that moment she is hell bent to find out more.<br/><br/>'Your hand is so cold' Bella say's as she gazes upon Edward, in what in my opinion is the pivotal scene of the whole movie. As Bella walks out of the police station, her father works in; everything starts making sense to her. She goes home to research about ancient legends in her tribal book we see her buying earlier in the film. She is instantly drawn to the phrase 'the cold one'. She then goes on to her computer and researches 'the cold one'. Then we have a montage of all the words that she has noticed and she associates with Edward; 'speed', 'strength' and 'cold skinned'. Then she see's 'drank blood', immortal', 'undead' and then finally 'vampire'. Then it fades into a picture of the vampire Nosferatu, the 1922 German expressionist horror film adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br/><br/>That night Bella dreams about her and Edward. Edward is this classic vampire figure with Bella as his meal. She imagines it in an old fashioned way with over the top make-up. Bella suddenly wakes up and makes the connection between dreams and reality. Her whole world has been turned upside down; this is shown through slow motion.<br/><br/>As she looks across Folks High School she wonders if any of it real. She looks upon Edward and this seems to be one of the only times in the film in which he can read her mind. Bella walks into the forest; followed. The school represents the safety in her life and then her leaving that to go into the mystery of the woods. The setting of the woods links to the opening scene of the film. Bella has become the hunted deer and Edward is the hunter. At this point the tension is unbearable.<br/><br/>I have many mixed feelings about this movie. I love the story, but they should have made it a bit more interesting with a bit more action to grip the viewer through the whole film. The acting from Nikki Reid and Peter Facinelli is really good; they are really well suited for their parts. However, the good acting is over shadowed from the bad as the good characters are hardly in it and the main characters were played by terrible actors such as Kristen Stewert. The love scenes between Bella and Edward were cringe worthy and the bad CGI effects really put me off. Overall, I like the story but the bad acting and love scenes let this film down."

","Twilight Movie Review -<br/><br/>When the teen blockbuster Twilight first came out, I saw the previews and went, ""eww..."", but everyone seemed to like it. I sure as hell wasn't going spend the money to see it in the theaters, so I waited. Tonight I found it on Showtime On-Demand in HD and figured, ""what the hell"", I've got nothing better to do.<br/><br/>This movie sucked modern-day vampire gay ass. Or should I say dick? It took a dark, mysterious, and sometimes romantic monster and wrapped a shiny glimmer around it, stuffing it with cotton candy. <br/><br/>Everything that made vampires compelling is thrown out the window. All the abilities that made vampires desirable remain. To compensate, they amped up the strength, speed, and charisma of the mythological creature. Traditionally, vampires lived in the night because sunlight killed. In these movies and books not only can they survive in the sun light, but they retain all their powers. The sun presents a mild irritant, giving them a skin tone akin to glitter. I know vampires are not real, but these stories presents no downside to vampirism. Hell, let's all be vampires. It removes the fear of anything except werewolves.<br/><br/>Twilight features some of the worst displays of acting since Hayden Christensen in Star Wars Episode II and III. It wasn't just one actor or actress, it was all of them. I've seen other movies with the same talent in it and the actors didn't suck nearly this badly. So why has everyone in this movie forgotten how to act? I suspect a big share of the blame goes to director Catherine Hardwick, creator of exercises in mediocrity such as ""Thirteen"" and ""Lords of Dogtown"". <br/><br/>The only good thing that I can see about this movie is the photography, the sets were beautiful, but that's more just a complement on the northwestern region of North America.<br/><br/>I would never watch this movie again, let alone recommend it. It was probably one of the worse movies I've ever watched in my life, and I've watched a lot of bad movies.<br/><br/>Seriously. A lot."

The only notable difference was that Roswell was good, with a good acting, not so annoying characters and much more suspense. Twilight has nothing to offer. Well,there is Jacob Black in some scenes. In New Moon he'll have a larger role, which will definitely improve the series (you can see new moon, it is not a bad film if you know what to extract from it). But nothing else. The vampires are not vampires, but some Elmo kids with sparkling stars on their skin (the vampire skin,they said, but who can believe them?!). I know how a vampire looks and acts. Surely he does not look or acts like the Cullens. The idea of the movie is that humans are inferior beings and vampires must be adored like Gods. We all must aspire to become vampires. Subliminal Satanism, maybe?... Or just lack of intelligence?... The entire movie is boring, nothing interesting happens, Bella and Edward are awful, immoral and unacceptable characters. There is no respect for the myths. There is no respect for nothing. Nothing you can learn from this movie. Nothing will entertain you.

Edward is even more hate-worthy because he is just plain creepy (A 107-year-old man spying on a 17-year-old even when she sleeps?) and incredibly controlling.<br/><br/>The acting was horrible. I don't know who the acting coach was but I hope they get fired. Nobody in the entire film (Jacob, Bella's Mother, Eric and The Annoying Jessica excluded) showed any emotion. KStewart had the exact same blank expression on her face throughout the whole film, even when she was writhing like a bug when bitten. R-Patz had this weird pained-but-not-really expression which was incredibly annoying. And everyone else sounded like they were reading something out loud half-heartedly. The bad acting completely distracts one from the plot, which was silly and slow and boring. Smeyer obviously just threw in the bad vampires because she realised that without them the story lacks suspense and substance (which it still lacks).<br/><br/>The special effects were laughable. I cringed when the evil vampires attacked the fisherman, not because the scene was scary but because the effects were BAD. And don't even get me started on Edward's glittery skin, which was a silly thing to begin with and made him look like he was made of bubbly wax.<br/><br/>What also annoyed me was the amount of hype around this film. When I finished watching this film, I was like, ""That's it?"" (even though I read the book). It wasn't epic or funny or even remotely entertaining, so it doesn't really have ""EPIC CULT PHENOMENON"" plastered all over it. It's obvious that the only thing that made this film so massively popular was Edward, which doesn't even make sense since there are loads of hotter guys.<br/><br/>The forest scenery was really pretty, but not pretty enough to compensate for this sorely lacking film. And the other high point is that it follows the book pretty closely. However the book sucked, and the film sucked."
"hchristoforidis","1","6","7","9 December 2009"," Total disrespect for the myth.
","I have not read the book yet, but I'm guessing I wont like it. And that is because my problem with this movie has nothing to do with acting or directing (they both are mediocre and good at some points) but with the script/story itself. So, unless they changed the story, it's very likely that the book will get on my nerves too.<br/><br/>Twilight is typical for today's de-generation's urge for twisting everything in the wrong, money-making way. The vampire mythos is totally destroyed in an attempt to make the vampires look cool and sexy. In other words, there is no actual curse in being a vampire. A vampire never ages, he is handsome and for some reason stylish, he has super powers, he can even walk around on daytime. The sun doesn't heart him. Direct sunlight just betrays the vampire's nature, by making vampires glow! THAT'S why they fear sunshine. There is no actual curse, no price to pay, no walking the shadows of the damned in remorse, no nothing. In other words, everyone should want to be a vampire! Other than that, the movie itself is so corny that can drive a person crazy. It's like watching a soap opera with vampires, a Gothic (stupid) romance at it's best. It's obvious throughout the plot's viewpoint that this was written not for women but for school girls.<br/><br/>There is a scene although which atrocity goes beyond all reason. The scene where the vampire takes his mortal loved one to his lair. And by lair, a mean a beautiful, luxurious glass house up on the hills, where the girl has dinner with the vampire family (a 50's family actually), where the vampire mom looks so happy that her son has finally found a nice girl... WTF ? Twilight is one of the corniest, most stupid and boring films I ever saw, something that can only be liked by Young and naive children that (hopefuly) one day will grow up and appreciate Bram Stoker's and Ann Rice's gems. There is no horror in this film, it could easily be 90210 with vampires. Avoid at all cost and prefer to watch again ""Interview with a vampire"". If you want to watch something more modern, ""Queen of the Damned"", or even ""Blade"" are much better.<br/><br/>Oh and something else. I've read a numerous threads, where they are comparing Twilight with Harry Potter. My opinion is that Harry Potter was way more original (and fun). J.K. Rowling managed at least to create a mythos (or saga if you like), a whole universe - instead of stealing and killing something"

Honestly, I would have loved to see a better movie, but I decided to be a nice person and give this movie a chance. Having read only the first book, I thought I would at least be up-to-date with the movie, as opposed to my friends, who had finished the series well a while back.<br/><br/>I think the previews were more entertaining than the movie. Seriously, I wish I had finished my popcorn in the opening advertisements, because once the movie started I lost my appetite.<br/><br/>Enter the Cullens. Not your typical vampire family, according to Meyer... they're vegetarians! Edward's face the first moment I saw him made me laugh. The guy was wearing contacts and a good bit of makeup, right? And Kristen Stewart... is she always that dull, or was it just an act for the movie? Jacob, Alice, Charlie... well played, not lying there. But could they have put a little more personality into their characters? The book wasn't excellent, and the movie left a whole heaping bunch to be desired.<br/><br/>The movie made Edward and Bella seem like an obsessive couple, the ""I'd rather die than live without you"" couple or, in other words, the ""I'm going to go insane and end up in a mental hospital if I can't touch you"" couple. Were they like that in the book? I don't recall.<br/><br/>The death scene looked like Edward was taking a bite out of a piece of chicken. I have never seen anyone wear a more tacky outfit than Bella's to a dance. Oh yes, and pertaining to that, apparently deadly vampire enemies ENJOY watching their archenemies DANCE as well! The movie wasn't that great for any Twilighter or any non-Twilight (like myself) out there.

It will appeal to the kind of person who thinks stalking and sexual assault are signs of ""love""; and that a guy who want to kill you and drink your blood is the perfect boy, the target audience seems to be the kind of girl who proposes to serial killers on death row.

Kristen Stewart is literally the worst actress EVER to star in a movie; she doesn't know how to portray her emotions at all, she has no control over her face, which twitches constantly. The only positives I could find, were the visual aspects of the movie, quite plausible. Other than that, I feel too generous giving this 2 stars, when it clearly deserves none. There's really nothing much to say about this movie, other than it's stupid, flat, boring and non-inspiring.

","An insufferable female protagonist and a beguiling yet empty male romantic lead make up this ill-judged teen Vampire flick that lacks bite. Helmer Catherine Hardwicke has fashioned a modern-day Vampire allegory crudely linking burning heterosexual sexual desire to vampirism. This conceit is trite and dated and also surprisingly simplistic. The notion that its two romantic leads are just looking for love in spite of the vampiric element is crudely realised and formulaic and is no different than Romeo and Juliet - yawn.<br/><br/>Perhaps stiffled by the novel's limitations, Twilight fails to reinvigorate the Vampire genre and might as well have been released in 1987 given its rural setting and distinct lack of style. By their nature, Vampires reject any notion of sexual desire as mere impediment to their desire to extract blood from humans, but this point escapes Hardwicke's naive film. Furtehrmore, she didn't realise that Vampires are inherently bisexual by nature and the heterosexual love story it uses is as contrived as ever. A missed opportunity."

","Don't even bother seeing this. I know it's already out on DVD but don't waste your time or money. Let me just start by saying that I'm a HUGE fan of the book series. Unfortunately the movie didn't stick to the plot, and added stupid scenes and bad lines that the characters never said. However I could have lived with this, if the rest of the movie wasn't just as horrible! I think they did a very poor job at casting. The Cullen family was decent. Carlisle, Emmett, Jasper and Alice all seemed about right, but Edward was awkward and in my opinion became that much less attractive as soon as he opened his mouth. Also, Rosaline was supposed to be gorgeous, and she doesn't stand out at all in the film. Other than the Cullens, the kids were annoying, Jacob looked like he was 14, and his father was just a joke. Charlie just seemed all wrong too. Not to mention the special effects just plain sucked. I can't say enough bad things about this film. It was just done all wrong and it makes me wonder if the director or producers even read the books. I'm thoroughly disappointed. Thumbs way down for this one. :("
"bookheart64","2","6","7","21 March 2009"," TwiFAIL
","So, I had gotten hooked on the books long before any report was ever given about a movie coming out. When I heard that one was, I was pretty disappointed because very few movies based off of books turn out very good. Well, I wasn't disappointed. I went to the midnight showing, hoping for a miracle, but ended up laughing the entire time.<br/><br/>When it first started and you saw the scene of Bella leaving home to go to Forks, I was like ""this actually might be good."" I didn't have to wait long to be proved wrong. Bella acts like a PMSing girl the entire movie, moody and whiny. It doesn't help that she can't even finish a sentence at the most dramatic times of the movie.<br/><br/>Edward, while promising when first cast, proved out to be a horrible choice. I think he first started going down hill when he chose not to wash his hair for seven weeks. His acting was terrible. I read that he studied his character in depth and really got into the sullenness of Edward. Apparently he forgot to study the part where he falls in love too.<br/><br/>I thought the rest of the cast was pretty good, but not enough to save the movie. I love Carslile (except for the first time you see him) and I thought Esme was a sweetie. Alice, Jasper, Rosalie, and Emmett were all good too, but not the best. The ""bad"" guys were only bad in their acting, and not in appearance.<br/><br/>The movie some what followed the books, but I don't really remember them having that many bad one-liners. They forgot to mention Jasper's ability, which is going to be a major problem in the up coming movies, and they didn't really expand on Edward's too much. When you see Victoria at the end of the movie watching them, that was a major goof. I guess they forgot that Edward can read minds and would know that she was there.<br/><br/>The only good thing about the movie is the soundtrack, and that is the only thing I will buy. I usually buy movies based off my favorite books even if they suck (in loyalty to the author), but I am afraid that this is one that I am just going to have to skip."

"KissedInColdMirrors","2","6","7","18 December 2008"," Lacking Any Substance and Depth.
","Before I begin, I am a dedicated fan of the Twilight saga and have read all the books multiple times. I had very low expectations for this movie. I mean LOW. I had already begun complaining to anyone who would listen over the choice of Robert Pattinson as Edward. Turns out that the casting of Edward was among the least disappointing things about this movie. I wasn't even a huge fan of the dialog in the book, let alone in the movie. The relationship between Edward and Bella--prior to when Bella discovered what he was--was way too short. In the book, their relationship is deep and meaningful, in the movie, they take about 10 minutes of the total runtime to get to know each other properly. In some cases, the casting almost made me cry (Edward, Rosalie, Esme.) BUT in other instances, they did a great job. It took me a while to warm up to Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan, but by the time I got to the movie, I had begun to think she was a great Bella. Same thing goes with Ashley Green as Alice. At first, I hated the idea of Nikki Reed as Rosalie, but as the movie went on, I thought she suited the role well. Examples of perfect casting would be Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, Jackson Rathbone as Jasper Hale and Peter Facinelli as Dr Carlisle. The baseball scene was probably the only scene in the movie that was true to the books description. By the end of the movie I was wondering what happened to the rest of it. I understand that they can't include everything, but they should've at least extended the meadow scene--It was a pivotal point in the book. It seemed to play out like a TV show with an introduction, conflict, climax, resolution within a small space of time. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but it lacked the depth and substance that the book had. The main problem was they only touched on how strong Bella and Edward's connection is and how problematic this is for both Bella and the Cullens."
"Bangs_McCoy","2","6","7","18 December 2008"," Really....REALLY...Not good...
","I've seen worse films, granted. But I could probably count them all on my hands. This really isn't the smartest of premises in the first place, although the book made it work very well. This film is slow, plodding, lacking in action (save for around 10 minutes about an hour and a half in) and, in my honest opinion, very over-rated as well. The trailer for this film looked fantastic but the film managed to disappoint me. I think what they have done here is the same with ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring"", focusing more on the build-up of the upcoming sequels rather than having an integrated story all of its own. The majority of this film was padding and was not needed at all. In fact, if you took out the moments that weren't necessary, you would probably end up with only about 20 minutes of footage. This film was a good idea that they shirked on and it could have been made into something a lot better. Unfortunately, a disappointing experience for both me and my friends."
"jklinka2121-1","3","17","25","25 November 2008"," Twilight Leaves Trail of Confusion
","The much revered and respected writings of Stephanie Meyer exploded on the scene back in 2005 and left the reading public wanting, no, begging for more TWILIGHT! Although, once released, these books targeted younger teen girls, many adults (namely women, ages 20-45) found these novels just as enticing and addictive. I, myself, am a big fan of this series and have truly enjoyed reading each book (Three times each... what?! Don't judge me!) When I caught wind of Twilight being pushed into production I was beyond excited (Yes, I was one of those people who bought their ticket online, 3 weeks before November 21st). With much anticipation I watched casting choices, photo shoots and trailers and despite much controversy over some of the actors chosen for Twilight's coveted roles, I was still hopeful and trusting that this film would blast the competition out of the water. Although I didn't expect the movie to surpass the quality of the books, I was still ever hopeful that I would be entertained. Unfortunately, however, as I watched the film I grew more and more confused. First, where was the meadow scene? This was the most important part of the first book and it was chopped to pieces via a random walk (or romp) through the forest behind Forks High School whereby Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson awkwardly exchanged even choppier dialogue. This brings me to my second point. The Twilight actors. Why did Rob Pattinson look constipated when Kristen Stewart's character walked into the Biology room? I know he's supposed to show pain but not that kind of pain. Also, what was the deal with Jasper (I can't remember the kid's real name, sorry)? Bella's scent is only strong to Edward yet when Jasper first sees her he looks like he's in more pain than Edward. Finally, Kristen Stewart. Why on earth was she flopping around like a fish out of water after being bitten by James? Yes, I get that she was burning (as was made evident by the over-acting). The scene reminded me of a couple of kids playing cops and robbers, where one kid pretends to get shot by the bad guy and he starts jumping around pretending to die. In combination with this and the ridiculous look on Rob Pattinson's face (looked like a bad orgasm), the whole theater was laughing hysterically. I felt horribly for these people! What direction were they getting that said, ""Yes! That's great!"" Finally, the script. Oh the script! If you didn't read the books you would have no clue as to what was going on. If you did read the books (as most did) you were at least able to follow the general idea. However, in adding random scenes, i.e. the killing sprees of James, Victoria and Laurent, it destroyed the flow of the story! It was so incredibly choppy, just jumping randomly from sequence to sequence. I get that Catherine Hardwicke wanted to keep this film true to the book but just taking lines, word-for-word, from the book and skimping on the actual story line makes for one heck of a disaster. This is just my opinion, of course, but Catherine Hardwicke tried to film this movie the same way she filmed Thirteen (p.s. actually a good movie) and failed miserably. She proved to be a one hit wonder, at best. Speaking of Hardwicke, a lot of people have wondered why Nicki Reed was cast to play Rosalie. EX: Nicki is short and is curvier while Rosalie is described as tall and slender. I'm not saying that Nicki Reed is not a good actress or a beautiful girl because she is but she very simply did not fit this part at all. The sad part is that I think the actors in this movie are actually quite talented, however, in taking into consideration the poor direction given, the rush on getting this film finished before Harry Potter and the choppiness of the script these poor individuals didn't have an opportunity to make a quality film. I really hope that Summit pulls what Warner Brothers did after the first Harry Potter and can the director (WB did this after the first HP film). This film had the potential of being the best movie of the year (not based on box office numbers which, by the way, most of the tickets were purchased based off of the popularity of the books not the trailers) in quality, but it failed miserably. On a lighter note, I do think that Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson were excellent choices for Bella and Edward. They, unlike the movie, have the potential to be big players in the Hollywood arena. I truly look forward to seeing what they do next and I am hopeful that action will be taken to ensure a much better New Moon and Eclipse (Breaking Dawn has not yet been signed on to be made into a film). All in all, this film left much to be desired but not in the same way as the books. Very disappointing."
"gabyrosias","1","43","72","23 November 2008"," Totally Disappointing
","This movie was extremely disappointing. I've read all of the Twiligh books at least twice and loved them so the problem for me was not in the original plot or the characters, but I believe the producer, director, and the some actors left a lot to be desired. I realize that no matter who they picked to act out the roles they would never look exactly as they did in my mind but that is no excuse for the horrible acting that went into this movie. Some of the characters were great and true to form Alice, Jacob, Charlie, Renee, Bill, Carlisle, Emmet, and Esme, and the kids casted as Bella's classmates (jessica, mike etc..) all did a great job. But here lies the problem, all of those characters were only in supporting roles during this movie. The actors casted as Bella and Edward in my opinion looked like they didn't know what they were doing, for most of the movie they just looked confused or awkward, in a packed movie theater it was sad to see how many people were laughing during parts that were supposed to be sad or touching just at the mere absurdity of it all, to top that off I didn't feel a great amount of chemistry between Bella and Edward, even when she professed her love to him it seemed childish and kind of random. The special effects were also pretty bad, during the parts where they're supposed to be running really fast they only added a slight blur behind the actors and some cheesy sound effects that wouldn't have sounded out of place in a roadrunner cartoon, even the TV show Heroes does a better job at showing speed, I expected something a lot better from a movie. And all of this is aside from the fact that the movie wasn't really true to the book on many aspects, but I came into the movie expecting that. On a personal note I think the character that was worst casted was Rosalie, Rosalie is supposed to be practically the essence of female beauty, this girl had a butt-chin and in my (and my friends') opinion she was on the heavier side, not to say that she wasn't pretty because that would be a lie, but i just don't think she quite reached the level that the real Rosalie was at, and I can think of many other actresses that would have been better suited for the role."
"anidrent","1","11","15","5 April 2009"," criminal
","After spending two hours of my life that will never get back I can honestly say that what has been done by the creators of this movie to a very enjoyable book is nothing short of a crime. With all the technology and good examples out there for making a good fantasy film it is hard to believe how poorly this movie was made. It was filmed like a reality show combined with shots out of a CK commercial. I would have to say that the worst part of this transformation from book to movie is how the dialog from the book which was clever and witty turned into unsophisticated sad blurted out sentences. Not to mention the well built characters that sadly transformed by poor acting and poor direction into paper cutouts of their original form. I sincerely hope i was able to stop someone from subjecting themselves to this horrific crime."

I went in with low expectations because the previews didn't make it look that great - but I was surprised that it was even worse than I thought it was going to be! <br/><br/>The only thing I liked about the movie is that the characters look like I thought they were supposed to when I read about them. And I liked the Cullen family - all except Edward. In the books, Edward is the most romantic guy you could ever dream of. But in the movie, he is just whiny and awkward. It reminded me of Hayden Christenson's butchering of Anniken Skywalker in the Star Wars movies. Robert Pattison is nice to look at, but his acting is terrible! And Kristen Stewart is not much better. <br/><br/>I think the thing that was the worst for me when watching this movie, is knowing how the romance is supposed to play out, and instead I found myself thinking ""why do they even like each other?"" There is nothing really remarkable or special about the movie Edward or Bella. They are both very wooden and one dimensional. The scenes in the book that show how they fall in love and the intense passion they have for each other are all kind of jumbled into one really choppy, uncomfortable scene. <br/><br/>When reading the book, the thing that really moves the story along is the characters - which makes for kind of a boring movie - so I knew that they were going to have to change some things around to make it more movie friendly. But the stuff that was changed didn't really add anything to the story, and the character development was totally lost in transition. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was unwatchable, even for people who haven't read the books. It's super boring and the acting is bad. I actually had to re-read the book so that I could remember how Edward and Bella's story is supposed to be and try to forget I ever saw the movie as it nearly ruined the whole series for me. Hopefully the new director for New Moon will be able to make a movie that is worth watching, but I'm not holding my breath since he still has to work with the same actors..."

","Some movies are so good that they are talked about, often quoted and thought of almost with reverence decades after their first release. Twilight is not one of those movies. Twilight is fluff, utterly forgettable, and gives cause to wonder why anyone would want to make this movie in the first place. This movie is so nondescript and so devoid of anything that is even remotely interesting that calling it a bad movie would give it too much credit. In times past this movie would have been assigned to the B portion of a double feature and be given little if any notice. The story contains certain interesting features but at no time does it make any dramatic impact worth noting. The movie may work as escapist fare if you feel like going to the movies to take a nap, but given the high price of tickets today, that is not an advisable option. So if you feel like taking a nap, go watch this movie when it comes out on a DVD or better yet when it is shown on network television at which time you can start watching it and then go to sleep in the comfort of your own home."

","As a fan of the Twilight series, I really thought this could be a knock-out film. I am a Harry Potter fan and understand what a film adaptation of a book series looks like. There are differences, but the essence is captured. I feel that the Twilight movie completely missed the target. The heart of the book is the relationship between Edward and Bella, and it was massacred. They were awkward and unnatural around each other, and I blame it entirely on the production company and direction. The characters couldn't have been more perfect, but the script, special effects, and direction ruined it. The cheesiest lines were pulled from the book and placed back to back so that nothing could be taken seriously. What a huge disappointment. I won't see it a second time if I can help it. I do hope that the second film is handed off to a studio with a larger budget and better vision."

","All right, so I have read all the books, and i LOVE them. I love Edward Cullen and everything, okay? I just thought the movie was HORRIBLE. I may have compared the movie to the book, but even as a movie, I did not like it. Robert Pattinson is not an Edward. I'm sorry, but he is not: well in my eyes he isn't, so no flaming. There were many crucial scenes that should have been in there like the blood-typing and the meadow which were replaced by other not as important ones. I also think that the sparkle effect was not very good at all; I mean, seriously, a two year old could do that. The dialogue was also delivered all wrong, and a romance was turned into a complete comedy. Like my friends and I were literally cracking up the whole time. I'm not saying that Summit is a bad company, or that Catherine Hardwicke is a bad director, or the actors are bad, but this movie SUCKED.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; loved the books(well, except for Breaking Dawn), hate the movie."
"annette-autrata","2","15","22","26 November 2008"," Bad, but better than the book
","I found Twilight to be one of the worst books I had ever read. In addition to just bad prose, lame dialog and sloppy editing, it also contained an awkward, naive, meek, hero-worshiping and foolish heroine - the antithesis of the modern, emancipated and confident woman I want my daughters to become. Besides, the plot was really thin and predictable and in the book all the nail biters are actually just hear-say, as Bella (the narrator) doesn't participate in them: Bella is in the hotel while the Cullens chase James and is out cold when they defeat him in the Ballet Studio.<br/><br/>So when my kids told me they had to see the movie just to talk intelligently about it in school I wasn't exactly thrilled. But I agreed with their reasoning and tried to convince myself that the movie could only be superior to the book.<br/><br/>In some ways the latter was confirmed. The chemistry between the two protagonists came across better in the movie than in the book and I was spared some of the silly details of Bella's homely life. They also added the chase and fight scenes that the book only thinly narrates.<br/><br/>But, boy could this have been a better movie with the right writing and directing. Why not take the main ideas that make this story new and make something thought-provoking and fun out of it? So, vampires live among us and they are strong, fast and beautiful and of course have many decades of life's experiences. They can opt not to be bad, but it's a tough choice. They can fall in love, even with a human. The monumental struggle and life-altering decision-making process in such a partnership, peppered with external adversities from narrow-minded humans or the carnivorous branch of the vampire species could have been very meaningful and entertaining.<br/><br/>But instead the director cashed in on the book's main draw for the mostly female teenage audience: A gorgeous male lead with superhuman powers and a riveting background who falls unconditionally in love with a 'normal' girl. This girl is envied by her peers for making such a catch and is cherished, guided and protected by her 'hero'. The intelligence of the dialog never gets past the levels of ""I love you"", ""I want to be with you forever"" oh, yeah and ""you are so beautiful"". Additionally, there are many films with much lower budgets and less known actors but better directing, acting and editing.<br/><br/>I am sure Catherine Hardwicke actually made the right economic choice by staying close to the book's premise, as the current box office results suggest. But the large studios will hopefully not see the success of the movie as an accomplishment of the director or even the author, but rather as an indication that they have so far under-served the film's main demographic group: You can still lure female teenagers with Cinderella stories, the more fantastic the better - just make sure you cast a stunner as the prince."
"marilyndeathrow","3","20","31","24 November 2008"," not like the book and not a great movie in general
","I am a huge fan of the Twilight books. Of course when I found out a movie was coming out I had to see it. I saw it opening weekend and was horribly disappointed. Without getting into too much detail, there was just so much wrong with it.<br/><br/>First of all, the only characters that I thought were perfectly cast were Edward, Emmett, and Alice. Kristen Stewart was okay as Bella, but I think someone else could have done a better job.<br/><br/>Then of course there were way too many changes from the book to the movie. I know that changes have to be made when you're making a book into a movie, but it was just too much. They changed a lot of the series of events, there was nowhere near enough character development, some of the locations were nothing like they were described in the book, the lighthearted banter that Edward and Bella always had was missing, and everything seemed rushed. It went from Edward being rude to Bella, Edward saving Bella's life, the 2 of them falling in love, Edward saving her life again, and then Bella being willing to become a vampire. It was just ridiculous. The movie really only skimmed the surface. I also felt that a lot of parts in the book that are crucial to the sequels were completely left out.<br/><br/>And it's not just the fact that I loved the book that made this movie bad. I went with a friend who had never read the book and she didn't like it either. She said that the movie had no real depth to it, the dialogue didn't flow very well, and that it seemed like just a bunch of close up shots of Kristen Stewart.<br/><br/>I wanted so much to like this movie. I will probably still buy it when it comes out on DVD just because I love the books. But it was very very disappointing. Hopefully if they make New Moon they will do a better job and stick more to the books."
"czjrox_2","2","20","31","23 November 2008"," Complete Miss
","Wow, being a Twilight fan, the trailers alone set my low standards. But I wasn't even prepared to sit through two hours of...that. First off, the director, Catherine Hardwicke, was potentially the worst choice possible to make this film. Her indie style mixed with the camera shots that mimicked the acid trips I'm sure she was on ruined the romanticism and drama of the book. I don't feel that she really understood the book and what it did for people. Everything was flat.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson? Really? Like, really, really? For one, I consider him ugly. Two, he can't act. Three, thanks to the soundtrack we've also learned that he can't sing. But that aside, he totally missed the concept of Edward. The faces of utter constipation got annoying after the biology scene(which had everyone in the theater laughing). His whiny voice and his constant insecurities were completely not Edward. Bella, was extremely poorly casted. Kristin Stewart as a person, not an actress is too strong to play the weak Bella Swan. Nuff said. She was just so...butch in the movie. I can't wait to see how she fails at New Moon.<br/><br/>The romance was appalling. I felt no chemistry between the characters and it seemed as if it was like BAM LOVE! The movie skimmed past the romance to head to action part. And they really said ""lion lamb"" line. Lord have mercy I almost left the theater when they said it. The graphics were pretty seventies too. This movie was big budget, they could have done more.<br/><br/>And now, for what angered the most: NO ALICE OR JASPER. Um, excuse me, they were only prevalent throughout the last half of the novel! Alice said like 15 lines total while Jasper, just looked like a vegetable. This movie, unfortunately, chose to lose its appeal with fans to score more money in the box office.<br/><br/>I give it two out of ten. One point for the fact that Alice was the only character that felt fitting. Two, because we get to see her rip James' head off."
"Quinoa1984","2","12","17","25 July 2009"," whoever you are, girl or boy, man or woman, Twilight is shoddy, pretentious film-making
","Look, whoever-you-are-readers, I'm not a teenage girl. I'm a 20-something gent who just likes watching movies, usually good ones. I can also go for the occasional really stupid/fun bad movie or incredible guilty pleasure. With Twilight, I knew it was, according to what I heard and read and seen about it, *meant* for teenage girls, I suppose, since it's one of those super dated and tried-and-whatever stories of a girl falling for a guy she's not supposed to and bad stuff happens - only with vampires. I can't speak for anyone except myself in saying it simply stating that it's not a good movie. Period.<br/><br/>And it's not just about the treatment of vampires. Sure, there's that. Sure there is the facet of these being diluted and watered down so-called vampires to the point of being nothing but mockable. But it's simply a story that on its own terms is not told well. It's shot through the filter of whiter-blue-shade-of-pale, where the intent, I guess, is to make Washington state (specifically the town of Fork) look like this all the time.<br/><br/>The director, Catherine Hardwicke, has directed some decent films before, such as 2003's Thirteen. But here she tackles the material without any subtlety. The cast, featuring sometimes very-good-actors Kristen Stewart and (yes) Robert Pattinson, seem to be in the kind of ""method* subtlety that comes with that caveat of years of the James Dean in-breeding school of acting. Her camera people roam around without, usually, any sense of placement for the sake of the story, and, well, the story itself reeks of stupidity and consequence in the most mind-boggling of happenstances.<br/><br/>Perhaps there could have been at least a semi-interesting or compelling story here, with an out-of-town girl in a new town meeting a young mysterious man at her high school and falling in love and finding he's a vampire and still being really turned on by it and yada yada bad things happen. Or maybe I'm wishing impossible things. Coming from a book by Stephenie Meyer that is more Harlequin romance than vampire lore, it's central problem is giving us characters not only not likable, but without personality. Say what you will about the corny aspects of Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it had characters and story lines that actually meant things, with personalities and humor and real drama that could be affecting. In Twilight the coldness of the environment is reflected quadruple-fold in the characters and story, and the film-making, shoddy as it is, probably reflects that attitude of the book.<br/><br/>Oh, and of course, it's corny poppycock a lot of the time, but again it shouldn't have been a problem. I might have even laughed out loud, for all the wrong reasons, at one of the most unintentionally funny scenes of the decade with the vampire baseball scene (yes, it's as ludicrous and bang-your-head-against-the-wall-till-you-bleed without any point for the story save for a West Side Story stand-off). But aside from its abstinence-only allegory (and believe you me, this is the antithesis of 2008's Teeth), there's nothing here a viewer can take away of worth. Nada. Zilch. There's nothing interesting in the romance because the characters are either boring miscreants, befuddled side characters like Bella's father, or 1/2 dimensional drones like that ""bad"" vampire in the mirrors climax.<br/><br/>And finally, nothing to add significantly to vampire lore, save for its pop culture phenomena. Maybe I'm missing something the teen girls are seeing, maybe there's something oh-so dreamy about that pretentious navel gazer Edward. But a duck is a duck, and Twilight is an overwrought, meddling piece of a twaddle-corpse movie."

Also Vampires, since the time of Dracula, have been known to have ""No feelings, especially love"". The film itself is just a very poor excuse at matching Vampires, a horrific blood sucking beast, with romance, a teenage fantasy.

Vampires that glow in sun light, and are vegetarian (they eat animals, i though vegetarians eat vegetables but the author doesn't think so) and a love story between a ugly emo girl and a homosexual vampire. Everything in the movie was so bad i even felt bad for the people that actually liked it. After someone showed me fractions of the book i understood why the movie was to bad, cause the book is even worst (or not). made to please little virgin girls that are in love with weird girlie boys, this book and movie really diminishes your IQ when your exposed to them, it's a scientific fact. And I seriously advise anyone with common sense to keep away from this movie. Resuming, terrible acting by the worst actors i've seen in a movie, dreadful special effects and the worst most disgusting storyline ever written. <br/><br/>If you liked this movie than you're a 12 to 16 years old virgin and i am sorry for your you"
"Copaface","1","9","12","13 August 2009"," Words can't describe how bad this movie is.
","I am an 18 year old girl so unfortunately I am stuck with a lot of people who are obsessed with this silly little Twilight thing. After attempting to read the book (and giving up halfway through over how poorly written and plagiarised the story is) I thought maybe I'd give the film a try hoping it would be better. Now I have never walked out of a movie before but I discarded my popcorn and stormed out of the cinema in disgust after half an hour.<br/><br/>Not only does this completely take a huge dump all over everything that is cool about vampires but it has practically destroyed the lives of the actors. If only somebody had told them what they were getting into before they signed up to be in this film. Both Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart have been repeatedly harassed by the idiotic and overly annoying behaviour of the stupid fans. I genuinely pity anybody involved in this movie. I pity even more those who enjoyed it. If you enjoyed this movie/book, you obviously have no idea what good literature or good film-making is and are seriously deprived.<br/><br/>As a My Chemical Romance fan, I am thoroughly insulted by the fact that Stephenie Meyer says she was inspired by them. So as you can imagine, I practically had orgasms out of joy when MCR turned down the 'opportunity' to record the theme for New Moon. Basically put, I would rather have my intestines ripped out through my mouth than hear another thing about Twatlight/Twishite or any of it's terrible sequels. Simply the brain child of a silly repressed mormon and her wet dream."
"mickran","1","9","12","4 April 2009"," A pretentious misguided attempt at a serious vampire movie.
","First let me make two thing clear with regarding my review. I have never heard of the Twilight books and didn't even know about them until after I saw the movie so I am reviewing it as a move rather than an adaptation of a book. Secondly this is clearly aimed at juveniles (which I didn't know before hand or I might never have watched it) and I am a married middle aged man with a kid so I am certainly not the intended audience.<br/><br/>But what is it about serious vampire movies that makes them so awful? Certainly Tony Scott's The Hunger and the more recent and more dreadful Blood and Chocolate come to mind. They really do come off as being pretentious and arrogant and with very little entertainment value. Sic Fi and horror can pull off serious movies why can't the vampire genre? In the movies I've mentioned the lack of human interest stories, centrally as far as humans we can relate to is completely missing and Twilight is no exception.<br/><br/>I was cringing as the lead character badly acts through her hot crush on some gorgeous girly boy with a bouffant hairdo and pale skin that Gary Newman would have killed for that she has to sit next to in the science lab. This was more embarrassing than watching the worst 80s new wave music videos. Why oh why do vampires always seem to be either stuck in the 70s punk or 80s new wave stage. Were they all sired back then? Was there a vampire epidemic that I missed during my childhood?<br/><br/>Anyway I won't bore you by going scene by excruciating scene through this teenage coy glance-fest as the two main characters finally figure out they love each other, despite the face that one of them might eat the other for brunch. Bad acting and plot holes aside suffice it to say if you are 15 years old you might like this movie but if you're a full grown adult and way past the puppy love stage give this a miss or bring a sick bag with you. Corny, hack handed, cringe worthy and squirm inducing... hey! Maybe it does capture being a teenager quite well? Maybe, just not in a good way."
"k_beth91","Null","9","12","31 March 2009"," Didn't do the books justice..
","First of all I'd like to say that not many movies ever accomplish the difficult task of doing their books justice, but this movie basically made the books look ridiculously lame and cheesy. Anyone who watched the movie first hoping for some insight to the books will NOT want to read the books afterwards because the love story seems so unrealistic..while the reason the books are so popular is because they SEEM like the love between Edward and Bella could actually happen in real life! Until the baseball scene, there was really no action, and the movie just kind of dragged along. Once the ""bad"" vampires came into play, things finally started to get interesting. I think they should've included more action like this throughout the entire movie to keep viewers attention."
"z2830","3","9","12","22 March 2009"," WOW, step in the wrong direction
","Having read all four novels of the series, I was excited to see the book brought to the screen. Of course, expectations were low because books are generally always better than the movies. Obviously, if you have read the books, you are most likely going to be disappointed. <br/><br/>Summit took Twilight for granted, thinking Robert Pattinson was going to save the day by being a teen heart-throb. Which for all the pre-pubicient teen girls was good enough. When you pick up Twilight, it is a non-stop page turner, leaving the reader wanting more. The movie, on the other hand, left me thinking, ""they couldn't be more far off of the book."" <br/><br/>The scenes or characters did not make people believe Bella and Edward were in heart-stopping, I can't breathe without you love. In the books, Edward is a smooth and confident individual, but in the movie Edward seems awkward around Bella, moving his face in weird expressions, as if he didn't feel anything for her except an obligation to protect her. Edward should not cringe when he is with Bella, he should embrace her. Bella was even more disappointing. Does Kristen Stewart even feel emotions because she acted more like a robot. Continuing with the characters, they were casted pretty well. Alice and Emmett are absolutely perfect. Alice needs to be a little bit more chipper like she has had way to much coffee, but other then that no complaints. The potential is there for New Moon. <br/><br/>I understand that books need to be adapted for the big screen, so of course there are going to be changes here and there, but to leave out important scenes and put unnecessary ones is pointless. For instance, the meadow scene. One of the most pivotal parts in the book, where Edward lets down his guard to exposes himself to Bella looses all its magic in the movie. Every scene flies by way too fast just so they could fit everything in the movie. Jacob, who plays a major role in New Moon was barely introduced. They basically slapped a wig on Taylor Lautner(Jacob Black) and said action. Jacob has a rivalry with Edward with not just land, but wants Bella to choose him and not Edward.<br/><br/>Suggestions for the other movies; actually go through the book and pick out the parts that are important, develop the characters, get acting lessons for Kristen and Edward. Maybe they should read the books for inspiration."

None of the characters pushed me to believe them. I wasn't invested in a single relationship on screen. They were all just delivering lines.<br/><br/>The story was extremely choppy. Admittedly, it was close to the book, but you're not going to get a very good movie when your source material is lame, right? It was just all over the place and had a very disjointed feeling to it.<br/><br/>The cinematography was erratic and annoying. There was nothing significant about jumping from sweeping tree pans to inside Edward's pupil. The entire thing looked like it might have been filmed in about two weeks. It was just laughable.<br/><br/>The special effects were just silly. I wasn't wow-ed by how ""cool"" Edward looked when he was scaling trees like a monkey, I was laughing my head off about how stupid he looked while doing his tree shimmy. All of the special effects were definitely meant to look cool, but really just ended up making everyone look hokey.<br/><br/>The music was completely over the top. Almost every scene was punctuated by shrieking violins to tell you, ""THIS IS AN EMOTIONALLY CHARGED MOMENT! FEEL TENSION!"" Thanks for giving the audience cues for when to feel things, since we're obviously too stupid to know when something is scary...which this movie wasn't. Intentionally.<br/><br/>All other elements of the movie were just as lame. I'm so glad I only spent a dollar and change on this massacre. I mean, I knew it was going to be awful, but even THOSE expectations weren't meant.<br/><br/>I'm sure it made lots of pre-teens very happy.

The secondary characters - particularly Carlisle and Alice - were played virtually spot on. Kudos to the actors who portrayed them. But they couldn't save this train-wreck of a film.

However, everything goes downhill from here.<br/><br/>I KNEW going in, that it was going to be a bad movie; but after seeing the cast and some interviews prior, I gained a bit of hope for it. Little did I know that it would be the most ludicrous and horrible movie I've ever sat through in my whole entire life.<br/><br/>I knew it was bad on my part to support it by watching it opening weekend. But the movie was so ridiculous and god-awful (I've never laughed or cringed for a movie as much as I did that night) that my $10 was actually WORTH the hopefully-once-in-a-lifetime entertaining experience. (I am NOT going to see the 2nd movie, unless it is a God-send). I also know that adaptations can be a bit hard to swallow, but it's not even worth the title of being a ""film"".<br/><br/>ON EDWARD: Unfortunately, I was NOT anesthetized with an absolute adoration for Pattinson; thus I had to agonizingly sit (more like cringe) through variations of his ""sexy-gaze"" while he regurgitated his lines through a mouth barely open to keep his fangs in. It was like watching Hayden Christenson (as Anikin Skywalker) in Star Wars 2&3 all over again. As I felt sorry for Portman then, I feel sorry for Kristen Stewert now. <br/><br/>At least Star Wars made up for it with its cool CG effects. Which brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>ON EFFECTS: Why did they need so much money, only to present us with THOSE graphics? How could they make a vampire so...UNAPPEALING? If the book was lacking in plot ANYWAYS, it was their DUTY to do a fantastic job on the effects!! I duly give them credit for 2 segments they did...<br/><br/>I guess it was smart of the filmmakers to make this movie NOW, whist it is leveraged by the adaptation/remake trend in the current film industry as well as the undying support of hormonally ravaged tween girls in need of better literature. Maybe I'm getting too old, or maybe our society is spoiled and will never be as creative as it used to be.

While the movie is not perfect, it is very good fun and delivers as long as you don't expect a masterpiece. So don't raise the bar of your expectations too high - this is NOT going to be an Oscar winning masterpiece and it is NOT going to enter the IMDb Top 250.<br/><br/>The story is simple - Bella Swan is a common girl which falls in love with the vampire Edward Cullen. Cullen's family are ""vegetarians"" - they drink only animal blood and do not attack humans. Then, however, are the ""classic"" vampires that would not hesitate to do it, and Edward protects Bella from them.<br/><br/>I guess those who hate the movie do not know what a bad movie really is. You can call a movie bad when you regret that you watched it and when you feel that you have lost two hours without any good reason. ""Twilight"" is not that kind of movie. It has a sense of direction and it is not just ""flowing around"" like other movies. Acting is pretty decent. Although I thought Kristen Stewart was an awful actress, Robert Pattinson (Ed Cullen) and Cam Gigandet (James, the villain vampire) excel in their roles. Although the story is not one of the most original ones, it does not bore people and if you have nothing to do, I would recommend seeing ""Twilight"".<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, for all the girls who adore ""Twilight"", I guess I get them.

","The vampires in this movie were frankly ridiculous. Oh no, we have to avoid the sunlight or people will think we are wearing body glitter! Grab a little makeup and presto you look perfectly normal.<br/><br/>These creatures live for centuries apparently, and yet Edward has not learned to control his feeding impulse in 80 years! He acts unsure of himself with Bella...if he has been to high school 10+ times he should know how to charm an emotionally vulnerable teenage girl.<br/><br/>The color palette was washed out, the acting (except occasionally with Bella) was pathetic. My guess is that these books were popular, so the author got movie rights and a focus group told them how to market this film to overly emotional angst ridden teenagers. Someday I hope that we make more movies for teenagers that show realistic relationships and don't have Shiny Vampires who act emotionally retarded."

","This movie was complete crap. Most of the scenes that were shot gave me a headache. They needed to hold the camera STRAIGHT. My brother wasted twenty bucks when we went to see this. He liked it though. I'm an avid reader of the books. (Read the first three in two weeks, and the fourth in a week.) I felt they butchered the books. Nothing was the same. Not even when she told him her theories of the vampire in the car. The meadow where everything started!? HORRIBLE. I HATED IT. Most of the people in the theater did. Catherine Hardwicke did a horrible job. None of the actors fit the roles. Especially Kirsten Stewart. She's NOT Bella. Emily Browning was much more suited for the role. She speaks through her teeth, and her tone was monotone'd the WHOLE movie. Seriously. Don't waste your money."

","I am a Twi-Hard. Ever since I started reading the Twilight Series, I was hooked. And when I found out there was a movie, I went through the roof. For the past six months, my time has been consumed researching everything Twilight. And the weeks leading up to the movie, I was extremely anxious for the movie to come out. Last night, November 21st, I went to go see it with a friend. I was excited. I was about to explode. I had never been more excited for anything in my life. I could just not believe I was going to see Twilight. But to tell the truth... It wasn't as I expected. It lost the magic. I didn't get excited when they kissed. It was a great film. Amazing, in some ways. I know that movies can never match up to any book, but I walked in with very high expectations. They made too big a deal over the release of this movie. They got Twi-Hards like me pumped up for the 21st. To start, the facial expressions were hilarious. Edward's reaction to Bella in the Chemistry room was funny. Jasper's face was exact... he really looked like he was in pain. Edward was intense. His expressions were laughable. Rosalie, Emmett, Alice, Esme, and Carlisle fit the characters. When Edward revealed his glitter-clad self to Bella in the meadow, I laughed. When James bit Bella, and Edward was sucking out the venom, I was hysterical when he couldn't stop. His face was the most amusing thing I have ever seen. The facial expressions were the funniest part of the movie. I have no complaints about James, Victoria, or Laurent. Jacob, however... Catherine Hardwicke didn't make him the center of how Bella found out Edward was a vampire. I didn't want to look at his face because the hairline of his wig made him look like a moron. I love Jacob. I am Team Jacob. And I can't wait for New Moon when he shaves his head. I think it was great that Stephenie Meyer had a very small role in the movie. If you didn't catch it, watch it again, and look in the diner scenes. The fight scene was the best. Even though I had watched it 20+ times on you-tube, I still cringed when James bit Bella, and sent Edward flying across the room. The teenagers at Forks High School were cast (casted?) well.<br/><br/>I miss all the things they could have put in. They went from ""Hi, I'm Bella Swan!"" to ""I love you, I'd rather die than be without you."" in 20 minutes. They cut out the interrogations. The original meadow scene and kiss was missing. I find it ironic that the Cullen's house was the only place they didn't have to hide and could be themselves, yet it was made completely of glass. The scene where they took blood samples was unfortunately gone. The part before prom where Tyler calls from Bella's house was never filmed. A lot of the great parts of the book were replaced.<br/><br/>The ending was my favorite. It made the audience realize that they were making New Moon into a movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I loved this movie. I just believe it could have been so much better. I will, no doubt, go again in three weeks. I will buy it on DVD. Because it was a great movie. And partially because it's part of the Twilight Experience."

","Surprisingly good, of course it is sometimes a bit sugary, but that's to be expected in a teenage love story. Catherine Hardwicke did a great job, I love her edge. The casting director did well in choosing actors not movie stars to flesh out the book. Robert Pattinson plays the 'Hero' with the right amount of self-loathing and swagger. Kristen Stewart is believable and has a wonderfully tough vulnerability. You can almost see the supporting cast holding back a smile or grin, which made it even better. The Pacific Northwest looks gorgeous. It is a very important character in the film. Twilight made me want to take a trip to Oregon and Washington. A walk along the Cannon Beach coastline or canoe down the Salmon River would be lovely. And it would be worth every penny to hire a guide to hike to the stunning Multnomah Falls. Twilight's target audience will definitely see this movie several times. I believe the film will reach the magic box office number it needs to make sequels : )"
"onurish","7","130","251","28 December 2008"," Not bad, but a lot of room for improvement
","Before I begin, let me just say that I haven't read the book, so I'm not some die-hard Twilight fan or anything. In fact I hadn't even heard of either the book or the movie until a couple of months ago when my cousin (who had been reading the entire series) showed me her books and talked to me about it. She even said that there was a movie for the first book that was going to be released in a couple of months time. I remained uninterested, and I still lacked the enthusiasm to actually want to watch this movie in the first place, despite all of the frenzy over it, particularly with my female friends who, at the moment, have gone absolutely gaga over the male lead, Robert Pattinson (who plays the role of Edward).<br/><br/>It was only two days ago, when a good friend of mine who I hadn't seen since June (because I moved to another school), asked me if I wanted to go to the cinema with him to watch Twilight. There really wasn't anything else on that could have been better, so I just thought ""what the heck, might as well give it a shot"". And so I did.<br/><br/>This friend of mine is not really the kind of person to be watching movies like Twilight. Indeed, he is more of an action/superhero film type person, and so I don't think he liked the film that much (at the end I noticed an iPod earphone in his ear - need I say more?). Even now I'm still quite surprised that he even suggested watching Twilight in the first place.<br/><br/>I, on the other hand, consider myself more open to different film types, and I enjoy a little bit of almost everything, Twilight being no exception.<br/><br/>The choice of actors was simply a job well done; all of them fit into their roles perfectly. Pattinson, with his amazing, masculine good looks and pale skin, fits perfectly into role of the ""both-warm-and-cold"" vampire that is Edward Cullens. What I mean by ""both-warm-and-cold"" is that despite his cold looks and temperaments, he is an extremely likable character and his somewhat hopeless romanticism takes over slightly without tarnishing his vampire image. I honestly couldn't think of anyone else who could suit Edward's role better than Pattinson. Needless to say, he also makes really good eye candy.<br/><br/>The choice of Kristen Stewart as Bella is also very noteworthy, as she also manages to fit her role as a pale, very reserved young woman really well. Bravo to her too.<br/><br/>Just - bravo to both of them. Never have I seen such chemistry in a film. They are just such an item, and it's easy to see how much in love the two characters are thanks to these two wonderful actors.<br/><br/>I felt that the film was filmed really well, too. I particularly love how every second of the film in Forks (the main setting of the movie) looks so cold and grim, and it kind of adds to the whole bleakness of it all.<br/><br/>All of this, however, does not mean that Twilight doesn't have it's flaws. In the first half of the movie, despite it starting of well, it really seemed to have dragged on quite a bit and it wasn't until the second half that things started to get really engaging and interesting, and even exciting. Unfortunately I still don't quite understand one or two elements of the plot as much as I would have wanted to, so obviously that's a major flaw too.<br/><br/>On a more minor note, the special effects could have been a little better, particularly with the whole ""speedy vampire"" business, which looked somewhat unrealistic, but despite it being unrealistic in the first place anyway, the special FX people could have made it seem more real than it actually did.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the above criticisms do not change the fact that it is definitely a watchable movie. It's not perfect, and it definitely could have been, but I guess at least it's kind of gotten me interested in reading the book, now. After watching that film, now I want to read the book so that I can finally understand those things that I didn't. In a way, my criticism of that may be considered a bit of an irony, but it is still no excuse to make the plot incomprehensible. Like I said, the film could have been much better."

","Whatever you do, stay away from this movie. I watched this with low expectations, but they weren't low enough, apparently. I expected the writing of a cheesy fanfiction. I expected the acting of a kindergarten play. I even expected a bunch of tweens squealing with joy every time the ""hero"" came on screen. I still wasn't prepared. Don't get me wrong, all of those features were present in large amounts. I occasionally saw people in my age group watching this. There was a simple dividing line in the audience. Women loved it. This is likely because of the transformation of vampires from legitimate movie monster to weak, subhuman toys. I want to say something nice about this movie, but I can't. To say one positive word about this movie would be equivalent to treason. I can't describe how terrible this movie is without inventing new words for it. The acting was asdfgds.

","I can't remember the last time that I was literally one of 3 or 4 men in an otherwise packed theater. Tonight was just the case when my wife and I took in Twilight. My interest had been peaked by a co-worker who is female and a big Twilight fan. My wife has not read the books (nor I) but did receive the first 2 for Christmas. We wanted to check out the movie and see what all the hoopla was all about. We were not disappointed.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie. It does play like an episode straight out of any female focused romance story that is currently playing on TV. But there is a maturity about the film that brings it up a notch. It is full on love story stuff, but being a guy who isn't afraid to embrace the chick-flick side, I was pulled into the story, even though I know basically the outcome of the whole 4 book set. Catherine Hardwicke spun a very nice tale, it is shame she will not be back for New Moon. I thought all of the acting was top notch, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson the obvious standouts. But it was the supporting characters; Edward's family, Bella's friends and family, that really helped with the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>I had heard reports of laugh inducing dialog, never caught any of that. With any story that has a target audience that is in their teen years, one must expect earnest and often overly dramatic dialog and moments. It never goes into the day-time soap variety. <br/><br/>There was a lot of online snipping from mucho-macho fanboys that mocked the film (without having read the books) and called in a Covenant clone. Too bad they won't let their geek cred take a hit and actually go see this film before bashing it. Not anything that will change cinema forever, but a very different and entertaining take on the vampire genre. The thing I enjoyed the most was the return of romance to the vampire tale. Recent films have taken a more action approach to the vampire tale. I can't wait for New Moon."

","I absolutely hated this movie. I went in prepared and fully aware that it wasn't going to be like the book and that they were going to change it so it was more adaptable to the film. I didn't really have any high expectations, I just wanted to see some parts of to life or at least attempt to come to life. I was utterly ""mouth dropping"" disappointed. I don't know how Stephenie Meyer could have let this even happen to her precious story. There was no character construction, you didn't connect with the characters and this has nothing to do with casting for the actors. I don't even blame it on the director. THERE WAS NOOOOOOOOOOOO SUBSTANCE AT ALL!!! You didn't feel any connection with the love story. Events meshed in and clashed due to wrong timing and placement of scenes. Crucial scenes were left out for useless scenes ( field trip?!?!?!?!) Even though the scenery was breathtaking they could have cut out at least 40 minutes of it to develop the storyline better. They killed the story. It was horrible just plain horrible. This was worse than adaptation of Harry Potter. I was disappointed when i first saw Harry Potter, even though i accepted that it would not be the same and still enjoyed the movie. This is on a whole new story. At least Harry Potter made you feel like it was the essence of the story still there just cut short. Twilight was just like seeing two strangers that have no real established connection no relationship (They don't even have a friendship) and then suddenly they are together and now they are trying to save this girl who doesn't even seem like is in that much danger to the very end. I laughed in some parts but then there were parts where it was not meant to be funny and they tried too hard to turn the situation into a comical moment. <br/><br/>Also the fact that inconsiderate fangirls were cheering for every useless pathetic scene in that movie didn't help to get into it. How can you call yourself a fan of the series if the essence of it was never even portrayed. Even if it wasn't close to the movie at least show some bonding of characters. I don't know how anyone who claims to be a fan of the book can enjoy this movie without cringing at the fact that they ruined the most basic story. Again, I am not talking about the actors' performance nor the directing. I'm talking about the beautiful aching and pain of the story. The soul of the story was never there. <br/><br/>Will not go to another premier of any further movies. Will consider going to other movies but only to go see some the ""story parts"" being visualized. If you disagree, that is completely fine! To each their own!

","Be Warned: This is coming from a girl in her 20s who has never read the Twilight saga. But I do enjoy a good vampire film/series.<br/><br/>After all the media surrounding Twilight I expected a decent film but I found Twilight to lack the luster and buzz of recent media. I love the concept behind the novel but the execution was horrendous. Emulating an episode of Passions, the film is filled with above-average looking actors and a poorly written script. Apparently the script was written in 6 weeks and it shows. As a vampire film, it was hard to concentrate on the fantasy aspect because the special effects were laughable. And when I say ""laughable"" I mean I actually laughed out loud a few times.<br/><br/>The film is over 2 hours long and 30 minutes in I was already checking my clock. The only thing keeping the audience (girls) in their seats was Edward, played by Robert Pattinson. I admit he is eye candy but I'd rather watch him as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter because at least that film is watchable. The actor's performances carry the film especially the actors playing the 2 leads. They do their best with the horrible script they're given. Also, I found the actress playing Alice to do a very nice job as well.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Bella and Edward's love story but one second their eyes meet and two seconds later she claims she loves him. The film doesn't develop their story so it's difficult to believe their love for one another. I'm sure the novel explains it in a more believable manner which is why this film may be geared more towards those loyal readers.<br/><br/>If you plan on watching the film, I recommend reading the novel first. That way you can visualize the story and ignore the poor script development and odd film choices. There's going to be a sequel so I hope they hire a new scriptwriter and director."

","I've been avoiding 'Twilight' for years and was only open to watching it if it was on a had-to basis. And so, as that basis has presented itself, I watched it. After the immense popularity of the novels, particularly among the young crowd, a Hollywood movie seems to be the next step in further cashing in on the popularity these days. Famous examples include the Harry Potter films and 'The Da Vinci Code'. <br/><br/>Cheesy and corny as it is, there are some unintentionally funny moments. The writing, directing, visuals and acting are quite poor. The special effects are sometimes so bad that it looks like a B-Movie. <br/><br/>Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart became one of the most liked on- screen couple. 'Twilight' further made Stewart's lack of expression popular which may have overshadowed some of her good work (yes she can act at least sometimes as proved in 'Welcome to the Rileys' and even 'In The Land Of Women'). Pattinson does a passable job here. Most of the rest of the actors just follow formula. Special mention ought to be given to the lousy fight sequences.<br/><br/>Overall, it's quite a silly film even dreadful at times but mostly (inadvertently) funny."

Even if the director had no plot to work with, he could have at least tried to make the scenes look good, much less chosen qualified actors for the dramatic characters of the story.<br/><br/>In my opinion, there is no excuse for this film to have been as bad as it truly is.

","Sometimes you can't help but give a 1 rating because the movie is just simply that bad. I don't want to be lumped as a person who hates Twilight for simply being cool or as a general hater. I have reason for hating this thing...<br/><br/>First, let's start with the acting. How on Earth can anyone take this acting seriously? Stewart's constant blinking sets off an all-caps-rage with me and she's not even the worst part of this movie, which says a lot, folks. Robert plays the worst vampire ever created. He looks like a pedophile in a few scenes and consider he's probably over 80, he technically is a pedophile. He acts like he's afraid to speak, when it should be Bella who's afraid to speak. Near the end of the film, the 'bad' vampires crouch in front of the Cullens (who also crouch) showing that they are hungry for Bella's blood. It's so laughably ridiculous that it's shameful to think anyone would find this as the most dramatic moment in the movie or call it the climax of the film.<br/><br/>That being said, the plot never shows up. I never felt like there's a reason to watch this. I watched it so I could give a valid review having seen it, finally. But, I kept waiting for a reason for all this to be happening. It never came. It was just, ""stay away, I'm dangerous"" and then nothing even happens to Bella.<br/><br/>How about the 'visual effects'? For a movie with a substantial budget of nearly $40M, you'd expect better special and visual effects. Plus, I expected the vampire make-up effects to be better. I was very tamed and unimpressed about all three effects department. But, I guess it's not completely their fault since they had to build these concepts for the film off of poorly written material. Really...? A vampire sparkles in the daylight? That's their golden special effect? I feel sorry for<br/><br/>Melissa Rosenberg, because most of the time (I know her as a writer for The O.C.) she is talented. Maybe it was the fact that she was not doing a teleplay but an actual screenplay. Maybe it was the fact that she had to stay true to Meyer's horrible story in the books and couldn't change anything. Whatever the reason, the script is filled with cringe worthy dialogue that makes anyone with half a brain roll their eyes in utter bewilderment. ""You're my own personal brand of heroine,"" is such a romantic pick-up line, isn't it? It worked on the slut Bella, since Edward is like, so, totally the dreamiest of men in the world. Ahem, erm, uh, vampire, I mean. Seriously the dialogue is so cheesy and stolen from other movies, it's super-difficult to resist mocking it.<br/><br/>In a 2-hour movie, (why??) the establishment to the audience that the Cullens are vampires takes too long (45 minutes invested movie time). For people who don't read the books, maybe it would have been better to come into the story later on or perhaps tone down the outside-of-school time. Maybe tone down the entire thing... oh wait...there's 4 more films of this trash.<br/><br/>After years of refusing to watch this because of all the people I know who have intelligence and taste, I can safely say this is the worst movie ever made and I'd watch any other terrible movie (ie. Meet the Spartans, Blair Witch, Date Movie, Butterfly Effect 2, etc.) again and again before I ever gave this a second viewing.<br/><br/>Stephanie Meyer's finger should have never clicked a mouse to view wikipedia nor touched a computer keyboard to type her ridiculous story. You want a real vampire movie? Check out Interview with a Vampire, or Blade, or even 30 Days of Night was better than this."

The plot is obvious and bad and it betrays every legend that exists of vampires.<br/><br/>Seeing this film being as successful as it has in the box-office truly does make on think what has happened to the world.

If the film-making was any worse, the youthful, stud-filled cast would not have even been able to save it. All of the effects were done poorly, the acting was horrendous, and it seemed that each scene was more outrageously exaggerated than the last. I had actually seen the parody of the film before seeing this film, and I was very surprised to find that it was basically a scene-by-scene re-creation of the original.

From the character development to the messed up love triangle, in all honesty, the most believable character was her dad, who wasn't in the film but for a couple short scenes. It wasn't the worst movie I have seen, but was definitely given more credit than it deserved (hence the immense amount of 12 year old fans, twi-tard shirts and other merch that is still stocked at Hot Topic.) So if you like the idea of a made up creature that was originally supposed to horrify people, be portrayed as a harmless sparkling fairy-boy who cannot make up his damned mind, then by all means watch it."

","Let me begin just by saying that I hated this movie. And I do mean I *hated* this movie. Why? Was it really that bad? Cinematically, it was subpar at best. It barely reaches the mediocre level. As a fantasy movie, romance movie, vampire movie, and/or action movie, it's just about as bad as it gets. It tries and epically fails to be all of these at once.<br/><br/>Our main characters cannot properly display emotion. And there is less chemistry and acting ability here between these two ""lovers"" than between Anakin and Padme from Star Wars. (Also, at least George Lucas attempted meaningful dialogue between them, unlike here.) Where is the romance here? Where's the romantic chase?<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen. Many times, it is painfully obvious that they just sped up the film. Just because you *can* use CGI doesn't mean you always should! The dialogue is cheesy and stilted at best. There is absolutely *no* character development. Plus, there are characters in this movie that don't even have a purpose (such as Bella's father and friends).<br/><br/>I'd like to say that they did, at least, try to put some effort into this movie, but I really don't think they did. I think the film makers in this case just thought that they could just throw in a good looking guy in pale make up, give the characters the names from the books, and throw in a couple plot points and they'd be able to sell this miserable excuse of a movie to every Twilight pre-teen girl fanatic in the country.

It's unbearable to watch this girl Kristen Stewart try to act and Robert Pattinson isn't all that much better. Stewart does this absurd stuttering that I know has nothing to do with the character because every interview of her displays the same boring characteristic. Therefore, she is not an actress, not in any way. She's only playing herself and she has no charisma to begin with.<br/><br/>This is worse than Days Of Our Lives. The acting is at the same level if not worse as shown by every single actor on screen. There are horrific visual effects, a ridiculous script even if it is an adaptation, horrible directing.

"xchinguyenx","Null","7","9","28 June 2010"," Twilight does not send a healthy message to their young viewers.
","Twilight has set up almost an impossible expectation for young girls regarding romances and relationship. The Twilight trilogy portrayed a normal plain female role that developed an unhealthy interest on Edward Cullen, a seemingly perfect vampire male figure who is the object of desire for all women. The relationship between the two main cast, Bella and Edward, is basically an endless vortex of unhealthy obsession that Bella has toward her vampire lover, to the point where she has engaged in reckless, and even suicidal activities in order to relieve some of her desire for Edward, which includes getting on a motor bike of a gang member in a dangerous alley, jumping off a high cliff into the ocean. And considering that Twilight is the most popular books and movies for young teen currently, what kind of message has these examples been sending them? Twilight's fans consider Bella a role model, an obsessive girl who appears to only have tunnel vision and only cares about being with Edward selfishly, not caring about whether she hurts anyone around her (namely her Dad). While some may argue it is fiction and Twilight is a love story depicting two people that are meant to be together, the relationship portrayed in Twilight is not love, it's obsession. <br/><br/>The main reason that Bella is a bad female role model for young teens is that her character is defined only by her obsession for Edward. She has no interests of her own, and breaks apart whenever she's not by his side, as shown in New Moon when she spends three months in her room crying after Edward leaves town. Would most parents want their children to fall into depression and shut away from their families and friends after a failed relationship? If relationships in real life are to become similar to those that are portrayed by the Twilight series, then depression and suicidal rates amongst adolescences would soon skyrocketed."
"matt-spence-1","1","7","9","7 June 2010"," Amazing DOP dose not disguise a missed opportunity
","First of all, this film looks amazing. The director of photography had done an incredible job, even if the CGI is a tad to obvious in places. Just to get that out th way; now onto the bad stuff.<br/><br/>For all of its failings, the Twilight series has a simple message of comfort for coming of age girls about the perils of relationships and the pain inherent with the joy of first love. All fair and good one might say, however the toned down films offer a far more damaging life lesion of how teenagers should approach their blooming sexuality, portraying a safe, rose-tinted depiction when in reality relationships are hard and rough with problems other than how to deal with overwhelming affection when separated (as is the case of the second instalment New Moon). Not that relationships are bad and destined for failure, don't get me wrong, but the relationship between Bella and Edward is playing the fairytale card too strictly to the letter when it should really be guiding its impressionable young audience with something more tangible to what they will actually face. In reality, teenage boys are commonly ravenous and rather selfish beings out for themselves and all the sex they can get, making the vampire a highly symbolic medium, so a girl in love with a vampire is a great way to portray the terror that is the adolescent male and his undying lust for¬Öwell lust draining her of self-worth as she continuously pours her unrelenting love into him. Yet in Twilight Edward is patient an almost comically nonsexual, his emotions suppressed, happy to simply stare into Bella's eyes or sneak a rare passionate kiss. Now we have a woman whose urging desire to be bitten (representative of sexual congress) needs to be slapped down by Edward, who fears her becoming like him. Now from a certain feminist perspective can understand why this film is considered as a positive influence for young women; here we have an independent female protagonist who knows what she wants and refuses to back down, but when her goal is ultimately to be subject to her man the argument looses its momentum, even becoming somewhat hypocritical.<br/><br/>Going back to my earlier statement, monsters are steeped in symbolism ‚Äì each and everyone reflecting a very real human fear, trait or outlook. As the lead male, Edward is representative of the vampires we see throughout the movie, with those acting like the classical parasitic vampires coming off as heinously villainous in contrast for simply doing what they have to. What I am getting at here is that Edward's vampirism is wasted potential if he refuses to ever act in any way like a vampire. I realise the point is he believes he is evil incarnate and so must fight to suppress his nature, but in the context here it just plain fail if Bella is more blood hungry (well, she's certainly hungry for something of Edwards) than he is. Surely Bella is a negative influence on Edward for trying to make him abandon everything he's been working so hard to achieve just so she satisfy her needs. In this light, Bella is really the more monstrous of the two.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with these films and books is that they play the teen monster card to safe and child-friendly ‚Äì like if Disney were given the reigns to remake the Hammer Horror catalogue. Puberty and monsters is a dream combination, as it's a time of great uncertainly, self-awareness, new sensations and rapidly changing body and emotions to contend with; it's a goldmine of potential that only films such as Ginger Snaps and the more recent Let The Right One In have utilised in the last decade ‚Äì and these were strictly speaking not American (Canadian and Sweden respectively) so were untainted by the overdone sentimentality of their Hollywood cousins. In Ginger Snaps the repressed sexuality of Ginger is unleashed after a werewolf attack that triggers her delayed puberty. The werewolf motif is initially unrecognised for it mirrors the traits of puberty; hair growing in new places; a changing body shape; uncontrollable lust (albeit for blood); and bouts of emotional instability. Even when a male character is infected by the lycthropancy virus after having unprotected sex the symptoms manifest like an STD rather than an urge to repent for his misdeeds. This is far more realistic a portrayal of the teenage years and sexual awakening than Twilight is willing to employ, and I find it disheartening to discover that a fluffy piece about unconditional love over between to emotionally dead and rather vacant people is a global success while the superior mediums are regarded as cult or niche. I understand that in a time of fearful and unwanted change its comforting to have films like Twilight there to hold your hand and give you head a reassuring pat, but kids need to learn that hardships coming or it will be all the harder to deal with the difficulties of boys, sexual peer pressure and the nightmare that is puberty. To this end, a film about the suppression of desire in the face of first true love is more harmful than one in which people are maimed, eaten and savaged ‚Äì at least they know how to vent their frustrations and desires rather then bottling them up for the inevitable post office massacre in 30 years time."

","This movie is a disgrace to cinema and a waste of celluloid. My heart goes out to the projectionists and theater workers who had to put up with the relentless torrents of mindless teenyboppers in the movie houses.<br/><br/>I'll try to explain the plot without sacrificing any braincells. There's a girl named Bella, who has the acting ability of a mannequin at Hollister, who falls in love with Edward, a ""vampire"" who breaks every known archetype of a traditional creature of the night. Apparently, Pale Face was looking for someone like Ms. Mannequin 2008 for almost 100 years. Talk about high standards.<br/><br/>Now, more about Edward's vampire faux pas. Dracula and the like drink human blood, often turning victims into vampires themselves, burn in direct sunlight (or any sunlight for that matter), and overall have an intimidating presence. Edward, unfortunately, has none of these traits, as he glistens in sunlight and drinks animal blood. He may have the helpless victim thing down, though, but that's being generous.<br/><br/>The CGI looks cheesy and the camera work is sloppy at best. I will give Robert Pattinson credit with a decent set-list. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is only worth your time if you feel like committing cerebral suicide or if you are a supreme masochist. On a lighter note, the book isn't as bad, but it's still pretty bad. It'll no doubt please obsessed preteen girls, but everyone else should avoid this like the plague."

","I would just like to say before I review this god awful movie a huge thank you to all those who hated this and the new one (though I have't seen it I couldn't put myself through the torture again) and gave the films a one star or even a bit more rating. I have hugely enjoyed reading a lot of these reviews that have slated Twilight into the ground and has provided me with lots of enjoyable entertainment. For a lot of you reviewers your comments on saying how rubbish this film was had me in tears of laughter because I couldn't agree more.<br/><br/>First off I can understand why a lot of girls like this movie gorgeous Edward played by Robert Patterson sets your heart throbbing yada yada yada and even the special effects though tacky can hardly be surprising for such a small budget and I wouldn't have minded but every other part of this movie rings awfulness so much that it's excruciating.<br/><br/>OK well the basic story we all know about the character of Bella falls for Edward and finds out he is an 100 year old vampire and gets sucked into his world and where she meets his family and there rivals who want Bella for there next meal.<br/><br/>Unfortunately they don't get her a pity really then I wouldn't have had to put up with her. Now Kristen Stewart can act I know that for a fact from seeing her when she was only 12 and starred in Panic Room with Jodie Foster but in this she is beyond awful. She always sounds somber when talking to Edward and just mumbles her lines as though she dosen't know how to speak. Not that Robert Pattinson another good actor playing the character of Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire fears any better. The romantic chemistry between Bella and Edward is about as electric as the relationship between water and fire when it comes into contact just goes out. The acting just feels so forced ""well we'll act if we must"" and the characters are so boring and underdeveloped. It's just left me extremely frustrated and what about the story vampires shimmering in daylight. What trollop came up with that idea?<br/><br/>The script seemed to have been written by a five year old and putting it that way a five year old could right a better script and the dialogue is so clich√© and cheesy that it was cringe worthy. It's clear from this film that to call it a romance is an insult and I just got so irritated by all involved and I was disappointed by Stewart and Patttinson's non existent wooden acting which was as wooden as though tree trunks in the woods in the film as they can act but not this<br/><br/>I think the reason this film has done well with girls is that are so focused on gawping lovey dubby eyed at Edward that they don't realise how terrible the rest of the movie is. It is absolutely torture this film, a waste of time and money to have made and seen.<br/><br/>Even though I won't see the new one I get sick of seeing the damn books and posters everywhere grrrr! But as long as these reviews slating the film keep coming in I should be happy. Sorry Twilight fans if I've offended you with this review but I have to say how I really felt about this film otherwise I wouldn't be honest."

At the start.. I'm a sucker (get it?) for a werewolf story. The territorial line thing made a bit of sense. But noOoOoo! We need to wait for part 2. Which I'm sure it'll be those damn love triangle plot lines that would never, ever happen in real life. And with two super human beings all hot and horny who thinks it would lead to murder? Quite a ""stable"" relationship as well. Not only is your bf an undead, killer but he can't take a stroll in the park, beach, mall, public with you unless its cloudy? How romantic.. And lets forget common sense for a moment, this as- was abusive throughout the whole movie and Bella was thrown around like a helpless rag-doll. Heaven forbid Eddy there losses his temper when he comes home from work and his food isn't on the table.<br/><br/>But lets talk about the difference of guys and girls for a sec. Guys watch for; plot line, effects, action, hot chick. (and not necessarily in that order) 1) Plotine - sucked, for reasons above 2) effects - We hardly could see the harness when those two climbed the trees or the half bed truck they ran on.. sure! Eddy there glowing in daylight.. umm, kay? 3) action - none. Even the last fight was lame -- and worse yet I wanted her to stand up for herself 4) hot chick - Guys are honest about who they think is hot or they'll watch a movie only for a hottie - why can't women? Its not a great but its honesty none the less. Almost none (less than 4%) of these girls ""starring"" in this ""movie"" aren't even mature enough to know what an adult relationship is.

Unfortuntly, none of that happened in Twilight. <br/><br/>Plain and simple, if you are not a 12 year old girl, then this movie is not for you. This movie was ONLY made for 12 year old girls. It really, really sucks. Films like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings may have been made for a certain segment of the population that they are geared for, yet those films still are able to appeal to a wide variety of people because they are so good. Twilight, is utter stupid insipid garbage. If you not a 12 year old girl and you like this movie, you should really just remove yourself from the gene pool and donate your body to science, that way at least you will have served some purpose. <br/><br/>The first time I tried to watch Twilight, I only lasted about 17 minutes. I got to the point where Edward and What's her name (I forget, and don't care) see each other for the first time in biology class. WHAT the hell was with that scene!??!?! They just sit there and stare at each other, there is nothing else going on... Oh, it supposed to be so emotional and how they feel.... It's not, its done very, very stupidly and poorly. This is an immature stupid bad film that has high production values. The production values are the only good thing about this movie, but the acting, the actors, the script, the dialogue, everything is puerile crap. And yes, if you like this movie, you are an idiot. Its not just that you have bad taste, its that you are stupid. And worthless to human society. Go drink some tainted blood."

","I'd like to group it as a vampire movie, for the first 15 mins of the movie or maybe 20mins. And hardly can i go on with the movie.<br/><br/>The male actor was like acting cool from all the beginning, seems like ""am just so special, and a prince material.. and so on"". I liked the girl in other movies, such as ""the fierce people"", and some scene in ""jumper"", but i couldn't really focus on her acting skill in this one.<br/><br/>Let's go on with the guy, he's simply showing off his special ability in an old way, to save a girl from a car dashing around madly.(pay attention: in campus). Isn't it the most dramatic way for two persons to meet/fall into each other? the difference is: the girl was still acting cool and questionable even when the hero had saved her.. this kind of hero i've seen since a kid, but considering today's young people, this movie might also be nice to stand in difference angle to see a love story.<br/><br/>I couldn't tell the rest of the movie, sorry bout that."
"rinoa2530","1","7","9","29 August 2009"," If I could give it less then I would.
","A mate and I watched this film, and it did not take us long to conclude that it was painfully awful to watch. The vampire's within the film cannot be considered to be vampire's, yes they have all the typical characteristics of a vampire. But the lore is still out of sync. Within this film vampire's are created via a different means to that of Dracula, and the most important difference is the idea that vampire's can walk around in the daylight, and most certainly do not sparkle.<br/><br/>This though is not the main problem with the film, as you can consider the idea of creative licencing, and maybe it would not matter if there was any explanation as to why this is the case. No there are other more pressing problems which must be addressed.<br/><br/>When you watch the idea of werewolves and vampires being in differing tribes and against one another, you can't help but think back to another vampire film which has a certain storyline that is similar. Underworld? Yes, you were thinking it too. Then again at least the underworld vampire's were not all depressives who wanted to end their lives, like Edward Cullen seems to wish to do.<br/><br/>More problems with this film? The script writing was terrible. The acting was even more terrible, but then you can't expect good acting in such a situation. The film is completely unbelievable, especially when you consider Bella Swann is possibly the most uninteresting character in a long history of uninteresting characters. There is no personality there with her, yet everybody seems to wish to be her friend, and instantly loves her, and most of all there is no chemistry between the main characters.<br/><br/>Honestly, I would have given this no stars if I was able to. It was so poor it was just ridiculous. I would not recommend this film to anybody. And if I do, I would only recommend it to teenage girls under the age of 13, because that is who it is aimed at."

","I really did not enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>I finally gave in and watched it because of the hype its received. ,mainly from teenagers and young girls who haven't a clue however. I just thought it was a bad movie. Nothing really happens in it. <br/><br/>The fact that the vampires sparkle in the sun rather than spontaneously combust in descent vampire movies like blade or 30 days of night is a joke. The effects when the vampires move fast are terrible, smallville has better effects and its a TV series. I will not be seeing anymore of the series. Also they have rushed the release of New Moon within a year of twilights release in an attempt to milk it for all its worth and so i think it will be equally bad. The werewolf looks awful from the trailer. The vampire genre has suffered a bad blow."
"TransPM","1","7","9","31 July 2009"," Great movie for little girls dying to meet their dark prince.
","It's a great movie for little girls dying to meet their dark prince who during his mere century of life never paid a visit to a tan salon.<br/><br/>There's definitely a new, sparkly in the sun, breed of vampires around who, apparently, don't even fume when exposed to that classically dangerous ultraviolet radiation. And that's when you thought Queen of the damned was one of her kind! So, these vampires go to school (no Buffies in this flick) redundantly like college hasn't been invented yet; what a pretty lame excuse for a higher education phobia, I know.<br/><br/>One of these eternal high school vampires meets Isabella, the central heroine of the movie, at a bio lab class. But, instead of greeting her, he's about to puke when he smells her teen flesh, so he rushes out of the classroom like a total bulimic, leaving Isabella thinking that perhaps she forgot to take a shower that morning. After a few days, she finally meets the weirdo again, and he manages to squeeze out a hello out of himself. Then they have a conversation, but, contrary to my expectations of their native English language proficiency reminiscent to that of Juno (remember that pregnant smart-mouthed chick from the eponymous movie?), both of them exhibit severely inadequate articulacy in verbally rather embarrassing situations.<br/><br/>The movie also ""unintentionally"" serves advertisements to the viewer with an Apple laptop, Google, and eBay. Blah blah blah, Isabella and the weird guy Edward become romantically involved, and what's even weirder than the guy himself is that, since he's born in the year 19-something, his legal age (he likes to tell everyone he's 17 though) is around 100 years (2000-something minus 1900-something equals 100 +/- 10), making him virtually a pedophile. Roughly, that's like Miley Cyrus dating your grandpa, with the exception that he looks like a Jonas brother. So, they go out on a date at a restaurant, but he says he's ""on a special diet."" Remember I said he was like a bulimic? My apologies: he's an anorexic.<br/><br/>He stalks her for a while, calling it his being ""protective"" of her. Later on, he takes her to his house where he lives with other high school vampires, among whom is Rosalie, played by Nikki Reed (she's got a huge butt in this movie, and I'd never guess it's hers if I didn't look up the movie's cast). He shows Isabella his room but there's no bed there; she wonders why's that, and it turns out he doesn't sleep - at all (no one to sleep with, apparently). He decides to show her his old kung-fu movie moves where he climbs trees like he's got needles in his butt and flies from one tree to another, all that while carrying Isabella on his back like adult female monkeys do when they have a baby without a babysitter.<br/><br/>Yeah, he keeps stalking her, and this time he appears in her room, saying that ""the window was open,"" and then they try doing it in the bedroom of her dad's house, but it's a PG-13 movie, so he pushes himself off of her, they just lie on her bed, and nothing happens.<br/><br/>Then arrives this hungry horny firecrotch, who thinks Isabella is supposed to become his snack (like there are no girls in other states). And this is mostly where the drama ends and you can enjoy a bit of thriller/action. (:"

","The real problem is not the movie, by the way (even if it's the worst movie of 2008). The real problem is the story itself.<br/><br/>When the book sucks... the movie sucks too. <br/><br/>The book is a mockery of real fantasy vampires. If you want to make a story about vampires, make sure you can respect what a vampire is. If you are planning to create a character who doesn't fit with a real vampire description then don't call it a vampire. IJust imagine that you, as a writer, create a non-horned unicorn... and expect to everybody believe that is a unicorn... is pathetic<br/><br/>The lack of talent in production, acting and writing is evident. I don't blame the actors at all... If the author of the book and the director of the movie have no idea about what are they talking about, there's nothing actors could do to save the movie. Even thouhg, i still thinking the acting was awful... <br/><br/>Seriously, people.... if you want to watch a real, beautiful low-budget vampire romantic film... please check out ""let the right one in"" (the original Sweden movie, and not the American re- make in coming) and don't support this.<br/><br/>Please, don't let Twilight saga kill Vampire/Werewolf culture, and stop paying for it."

Everything happened so fast that I really couldn't understand when they fell in love. And I didn't see any chemistry between Kirsten and Robert, they felt more like brother and sister.<br/><br/>The thing that annoyed me the most was the lack of emotions in Kirsten Stewarts acting (if you can even call it acting). She looked bored and confused during the hole movie, and had a very hard time getting her line out in spoken words. There was just a hole lot of stops and stuttering. I think the movie would of been better of with another actress.<br/><br/>The movie does grow in you, and the only reason i'm giving it a two is the charm of Robert Pattinson and the the rest of the Cullen family.<br/><br/>After I read the books I disliked it even more. I couldn't get the feeling of love, feel your heart pound faster and harder. There was no magic. I wanted to fall in love watching the movie just like I did when i read the book."
"Movie_Reviewer123","1","7","9","13 July 2009"," The Equivalent of Watching Paint Dry, but Much More Boring Still
","I watched this bloody atrocity for the sake of reviewing. Saying my expectations were low is an understatement. Words can't describe how low my expectations were for this movie. I turned out to be right.<br/><br/>Twilight tells the story of Bella, a depressed, emotionless teenager with paper-white skin, falling in love with the equally depressed ""teenager"" Edward Cullen.<br/><br/>My first argument is the attributes of Bella. She lived in Phoenix, Arizona, but is whiter-skinned than a piece of paper. Considering Arizona is basically a large desert, this makes no sense.<br/><br/>My next argument is the acting. To put it simply, a rock has more emotion than all of the main characters in the movie combined. Bella speaks in dreary, almost morbid monotone the entire way through, as does Edward. This sort of acting does not add to the atmosphere, it's utterly stupid.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is nothing more than scenes of Bella and Edward falling in love. Considering it's a vampire movie, you'd expect vampire-like action scenes, and there is one, but it's about 2 minutes in length, and that's it. The rest is nothing but whiny, mopey, overly-goth vampires whining about their lives, and playing baseball in the rain for whatever reason.<br/><br/>Another fatal flaw is found in one ridiculous scene. It's an established fact vampires die in sunlight. However, Twilight decides to have a different approach. When vampires step out into the sun, they sparkle.<br/><br/>You may ask, ""Is that it?"" Well, yes. They sparkle.<br/><br/>This senseless, idiotic scene made the movie terrible, among other countless flaws. After seeing this movie, I wouldn't care if they even stopped the film at this point and started playing Star Wars Episode IV, I'd still give it this rating. Vampires don't sparkle, bottom line.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this movie is a terrible waste of time and money. Brainwashed fans will love it, but the rest of the world will despise it."
"Dark_liquid","1","7","9","28 June 2009"," Laughed my ass off! What a money sucking crap.
","I couldn't freaking believe it. What an incredible piece of ****. I had the awful experience to read the book, i had the double awful experience of hearing some friends blabber about what wonderful story it is, and last but not least, i had one of the worst cinematic experiences in my life watching this movie! <br/><br/>All of you die-hard fans better shut up and stick with your beloved Twilight novels. As i've noticed, any normal person above the age of 15, with some decent values of good acting and satisfying plot agrees with me about this movie. Actually, what the hell am i saying, the fans of Twilight are already teens full of the secret desperate wish of being noticed by a hot vampire. One of my greatest interests is literature and especially Gothic arts, besides i'm a writer myself, and i still can't stop wondering why the heck people say that Twilight is a good serial. OK, you may like it, it's your right, you're amazed by the story because it matches to your own shallow dark fantasies, but you can't say it's GOOD, because it simply ISN'T.<br/><br/>Alright, about the movie. I watched it yesterday with my brother and his girlfriend, and all i can say is that we didn't know how to react on most of the scenes. I laughed at most of them, because i didn't know what else to do, apart from covering my eyes. I mean, what in the world was happening to Bella? What personality did she show in this movie? ""Hi, i'm Bella and i'm very misanthropic. I love Edward, i'm not sure why, i guess because he's hot and he can always save my ass when i get in trouble, because, ya know, he has these superpowers. Other than that, i'm lame, unfriendly, don't have any facial expressions and can't feel any other emotions, and i like to stare at people with the most painful look i can pull of, and make them think i am about to puke."" Geez. There are TOO many awkward scenes, it's just unbearable to watch it. They stare at each other, they stare at other people, they stutter and engage in meaningless, boring and extremely irritant chats...i'm simply speechless. Actually, i'm only left to wonder was that horrible acting part of Catherine's wonderful plan, or they are naturally so untalented? Indeed, all of the Cullen vampires acted very strangely, they all looked like they're about to puke!<br/><br/>One of the weirdest things (but also one of the things anyone hardly notices) is the amount of friends Bella made in her new school. I mean, being so indifferent, boring, confused and cold blooded all the time, and avoiding contact with humans at almost any cost, and all of those people simply felt a unexplainable urge to have her as a friend? That's definitely not the way things are in the real world.<br/><br/>The romance between Bella and Edward also was a pure pain in the ass. It almost made me suicidal. Yuck! When did that love-for-eternity happen? At one point the viewer is very confused, torn between Edwards stupid facial expression and Bella's boring character, and right in the other minute she confesses that she wants to have him for eternity. What the heck? It simply looks like her character is invented only for the purpose of adoring Edward, even though ""he could hurt her"".<br/><br/>Pathetic from every angle. I'm so sick and tired of these glittery Hollywood twists of beautiful legends and stories. They have a way of ripping the soul out of every one of them. I hope that the cast, director and of course that Meyer woman made a lot of money out of this hilarious tragedy, because that was their only goal with this crappy serial and this even crappier movie (yes, that is possible) anyway. Most of the fans of the books don't even bother to be honest to themselves and admit that this is a bad movie. But nevermind, they're fans already and they'll swallow up anything related to the *brand* Twilight, a situation very similar to a mass brainwash, hm? But i STRONGLY recommend the non-Twilighters to stay away from this...thing. Your eyeballs shall never forgive you."
"H_Spengler","1","7","9","18 June 2009"," clich√©d, wooden, awful dreck
","I contemplated seeing this in the theater, just to see what the fuss was all about. I'm sincerely glad I dodged that bullet, instead waiting for the DVD.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing more than porn for tweens who are anxious to drool over Pattinson or Stewart, although I can understand Pattinson's dark, brooding appeal, he's got talent, it's a shame that neither the director or the screenwriters chose to use any of it. Instead he's reduced to a emo, glaring, statue. <br/><br/>Stewart was absolutely terrible. She was so wooden, that I kept looking for strings attached to her body. She consistently holds the same monotone voice, same expression, and sleep walks through the movie. Nothing of the unworldly events, or shocking revelations, or uprooting her character experiences seems to shock, please, sadden, etc. her at all, she just holds that tranquilized expression through everything. Also, her delivery of lines is horrendous, awkward delivery, and pauses where none should be, one could almost feel violent waiting for her to finish the simplest of sentences. Let's not even get started on the group of friends.<br/><br/>Mostly I was left confused with what I considered to be a poorly written tepid storyline. Edward glitters like a craft store special when in the sun, he and his clan hunt and drink blood from animals rather than people, and play baseball. There's one ""climatic"" ""matrix-esque"" battle with some evil vampires., all because this girl and whatever she emanates is like vampire cocaine. Yay.<br/><br/>Never was I convinced of any great love between the two leads. There were one or two moments where I felt an almost warmth or desire between their characters, otherwise I was mostly bored at the endless staring scenes, Edward's apparent ""bi-polar"" behavior as he apparently has some inner-war with himself about Bella, ""I love you, but it's dangerous for us both to be together."" Give me a break.<br/><br/>Not to mention some very strange adults....Bella's mom and dad show about as much concern for her as a piece of moldy fruit found in the refrigerator, the whole family text messages one another, and no one seems to give a squat what happens with anyone else.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, and seeing this movie gives me no desire to do so either. <br/><br/>I have read Anne Rice's series on vampires, and enjoyed it immensely as she had the ability to fill in characters, and personalize them so well, you feel for them even through the text of the page. This movie however, what a fault ridden waste of time!"

I think brain cells nearly popped out of my head when I saw this.<br/><br/>First off, why in the name of god does everyone in this movie LOOK SO BLAND AND PALE!? Is it the camera, or did someone say 'Hey! You know what this movie needs? Pale and blandness! That's sure to make it better!' Pfft... right! Also, the movie seems so dark and depressing. I guess that's the theme of the series, since it's based around vampires... which is a stupid idea if you think about it, but it makes me so suicidal that I bring five packs of razorblades every time I see the stupid thing. Not to be harsh, but that's how I feel about it.<br/><br/>I will admit though, there are some nice camera shots and some nice music within the movie, but the movie is more of a depressing romantic story about two emos who like each other... yeah, way to go!

As a fan of the books I am aware of the risk of being biased but the acting in this movie actually made me vomit in my mouth a little! Kirsten Stewart has no emotion what so ever! It's like watching a Mannequin, even the dealings with Edward (the eternal love of her life?) are just her with her deep (In an attempt to seem brooding i assume) voice and blank expression. A complete world away from Stephenie Meyer's character whom offers up all of her emotions on her face.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson, yes he is extremely pretty but really the nose holding in the first scene? Laughable, truly laughable, could he smell something by any chance?!?!?! It was awful.<br/><br/>The additional characters are very hit and miss, Nikki Reed is not a convincing Rosalie and Jasper was a horrendous choice of actor. Whereas Charlie and Jake are excellent.<br/><br/>I agree with the previous comments concerning the poor screen writing, ""I'm only afraid of losing you"" being a key example of the cream cheese all of the audiences are supposed to swallow. There was no build up of their relationship, one moment he is afraid of the air around her and the next they are in love.<br/><br/>Overall a hugely difficult film to enjoy, i found it painful, cringe-worthy and generally terrible.<br/><br/>PS, The design team in charge of costumes?

Maybe that is the key, this movie is for people who purely like to be entertained and not think about the 'why's' and the 'how's'. This is kind of sad because I really like movies that stretch outside of reality, but Twilight was more ridiculous than reality bending.<br/><br/>If this movie came out in the 80's it most definitely would have lend itself to having a cartoon made after it. The theme song could have gone something like ""Twilight, na na na, sparkly vampire take you on a magical ride, na na na, they fight the other vampires cause you smell so good, na na na, twilight vampires don't eat people cause they like to eat cats, na na na,.."" (the other 2 and a half mins of the theme song would be kind of repetitive, but you get the idea) Twilight the animated show would have aired right after The Real Ghostbusters and right before Gummy Bears.

","OK. I'll admit, i've seen Twilight a total of 3 times, i've read the first novel twice and i'll tell you something, it doesn't get ANY better. I would first like to start by saying that the books are good, for what they are that is. Stephenie Meyer is an awful writer! And really needs to give the thesaurus a break. Anyway. This movie was the biggest disappointment since Lemony Snicket's ""A series of Unfortunate events"" hit the big screen. I admire Chatherine Hardwicke's directing technique, but not in this film. She took a descent novel and turned it into an atrocious film.<br/><br/>Twilight lacks enthusiasm, chemistry and excitement. I was ready to sleep watching it the first time. However, i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried again, to no success. The cinematography is appalling as is the acting skills of Robert and Kristen. I must say that I am a fan of Rob and Kristen and they really should have thought twice before signing on to this garbage. Kristen does not suit the character of Bella at all, regardless of the fact that she resembles the character physically. How many girls don't? brown eyes, brown hair, pale skin are not too hard to come by. She just does not have the spunk Bella needed and her monotone acting frustrated me to no end. Robert was also failed by the crappy script. Not only is he forced into a monotone-like state, but he also lakes the magnetic pull of Edward. Twilight isn't a hard novel to adapt, add two spunky actors, a lot of chemistry and a good director and you're on your way. But sadly this lacked all of the stated. The ""chemistry"" between rob and Kristen is the biggest laugh of all. They look so incredibly awkward that it makes me wonder what they really think of each other. Perhaps Kristen was to scared to really sink her teeth into Rob because of her long-term bf. Who knows! but one things for sure, both must'v failed chemistry in high school. No disrespect to them as actors of course. And Finally, I must say, that there was no suspense, as there is in the novel. No sexual tension or anything! No build up to the big revelation. The film stayed on a straight run the whole way through. It was the dullest load of **** I've ever seen. I just hope the next director does a better job, good news though, is can't get any worse than this!<br/><br/>So, save yourself the trouble (and money) and ignore this ""phenomenon"", because this movie is definitely a waste of life.

This movie made ""Dude Wheres My Car"" and ""Snakes On A Plane"" look like Oscar worthy films. The biggest turn-off for me was the bad acting - or should I say over acting. Kristen took 5 years to say two words because she would spend so much time making faces and gestures beforehand. Evertime she got ready to say a line I wanted to puke. She was way too over dramatic and forced emotions that a good actor could portry without trying so hard. Why did Edward act like he wanted to puke when she walked into the Biology class?? He didn't even know her but he acted like she had just killed his mom or something - so stupid!! I turned the movie off when Dr Cullen came into check on Bella after she was almost hit by the van. It is soo obvious he is a vampire and no one in the movie seemed to notice - duh - I couldn't take any more cheese.

Kristen Stewart's almost constant stuttering made the dialog difficult to follow, even for someone who knew most of the dialog from the book already. Add all this to lackluster special effects, cheesy acting by supporting players, Kristen Stewart's monotone narrative, and some rather irritating deviations from the book made it a rather unpleasant experience.

","Before I even saw this movie,I knew this movie would suck.Like millions of tween girls in America and all over the world,I read Twilight.But,unlike millions of those rabid fan girls,I thought the book was absolutely horrible.It wasn't even a book,it was just a wet dream of a fat and sexually frustrated Mormon.There was no plot,the characters were extremely shallow,and the ""romance"" between Edward and Bella was seriously f***** up.<br/><br/>The only reason I even saw this horrible piece of s*** was because no other movie was playing at the theater I went to and I was curious to see how bad it really was.<br/><br/>And what I saw that night was one of the most boring two hours of my life.Like the book,this movie had no plot(although they DID do quite a weak attempt to conceive one),characters were extremely shallow,and of course,Edward was quite a creep.<br/><br/>But that's not all why this movie sucked,it was these other reasons,too.<br/><br/>*The Acting-Some of the worst I've ever seen in a film.Especially a tween film at that.Robert Pattinson was just OK,but the character of Edward was going to make any actor's performance a bad one.Kristin Stewart as Bella was so irritating to watch,she was always twitching and stuttering,which made the movie even more uncomfortable to watch.And the chemistry between Rob and Kirstin?None whatsoever.They reminded me of an old couple who had been together for too long and couldn't stand each other.Hell,I can only recall three incidents when Kirstin even smiled in Rob's presence.Other than that,it was Rob who was doing most of the smiling.<br/><br/>*Cinematography-The movie was also grotesque visually.It had that De-saturated look that made a dead movie look even more dead.It almost felt like I was watching somebody's funeral,which,in a way,it was.The funeral for good teen movies.Don't get me wrong,that De-saturated look can work,it did in Sweeney Todd and Sleepy Hollow,but it didn't in this movie.Obviously the cinematographer tried to hard to make this movie dark and mysterious,but with the rest of the movie an epic fail,it just didn't work.<br/><br/>*The Script-Well,the script was obviously going to be bad since it's source material was s*** in the first place.Like the book,it had no plot and corny dialogue.<br/><br/>*Costume Design,Hair and Makeup-Another horrible job out of the dozen in this film.The costumes were boring and didn't express any of the character's individuality and tried to hard to be goth(not like these characters actually DID have any individuality,but still).The makeup was even worse.All the vampires looked bleached out,especially Nikki Reed,who has some Native American roots belonging to her,and the obvious attempts to make her look white came out looking all fake.Another thing that made everything look artificial was the obvious dye-jobs applied to some of the actors,notably Nikki Reed and the guy who played Carlisle.And Jacob's wig,need I say more?<br/><br/>Luckily,this movie isn't considered a classic because if it were then my faith in humanity would go down tremendously.However,on a brighter note,there was very small gems in this film.<br/><br/>*Eric-In the book,Eric is the more chess club type as described by Bella in the book.However,in the movie,the script gave him more diversity and turned him into a Gaysian.All the scenes he was in made the movie a little less bad.<br/><br/>*Charlie and Billy-The dads of Bella and Jacob didn't have much character in the book,but in the movie,they did and actually had some great scenes together.Who can forget the line ""I'm down with the kids."" and the scene when Edward comes into Bella's house and Charlie clicks his gun and says ""Bring him in.""?<br/><br/>Unfortunately,these small gems couldn't save the movie from it's steaming pile of s***.However,in my opinion,the movie was somewhat better than the book.By 0.03%.The 1,000 scenes of OMG,EDDIEKINS IS SO GORGEOUS AND GODLIKE AND SPARKLY AND GOOD SMELLING I WANT TO BE WITH HIM FOREVER AND EVER were omitted.<br/><br/>However,if you are a movie fan and want to see a good movie,I strongly recommend you don't.For a good vampire movie,watch Interview With The Vampire."

","As much as I would like to say this movie was good, I can't. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved the books and was really excited for this movie to come out.I was very disappointed after I saw it, to put it simply, it sucked. I never have liked Kristen Stewart because in my opinion she is a terrible actor. For this movie all she had to do is basically play a somewhat awkward girl who falls madly in love. She wasn't even capable of this. The scene in the hospital bed was painful to watch when he says he's going to leave and she kind of stutters was horrible. I love Robert Pattinson but he is not a good actor either. When he reacts to her walking into the classroom with the fan blowing on her everyone in the theater burst out laughing. Its understandable he would be very uncomfortable but the way he acted it out was awful. The scene in the forest when he is showing how fast, strong, etc. he is was also a display of his lack of acting skills. The directing was also very bad, Catherine Hardwicke directed this movie as if it was an indie film. Even though it didn't have a big budget it still should have been filmed as if it were a big budget movie. the sometimes shaky camera or weird camera angles really bothered me while watching this film. Overall the cons outweighed the pros by a ton."

Now, 4 months later I got a chance to watch the film. The first 12 minutes were beginning to bore me but I didn't surrender. The fact is that I finished the entire film and wondered: ""How could one earth be a nostalgic fan of the novel when the movie itself sucked big time?"". It was produced on a low budget movie company releaser and span almost 2 precious hours of my life. Even some who liked the book so much told me that they didn't liked the movie. Heed my advice people: Don't downloa-- *whoops*, I mean avoid this and just contemplate on your imagination on reading the novel. Well, good job to the producers who spent less and earned more."

"luvau2","Null","7","9","19 February 2009"," Book vs. Movie
","This is the difference between reading the book and seeing the movie: The book is like talking to a Bella and getting all the details of her story and really feeling emotionally involved with her and her friends and all the characters because she's telling you everything that she felt and remembered. The Movie is like getting to see some of her home movies now, but you don't get every detail, and a few of the ""memories"" of how Bella told you the story were a little mixed up and you feel like there is so much more and why couldn't she just have videotaped her whole life for a reality show . . . it's just not fair! Well, at least that's how I felt after seeing the movie :) <br/><br/>But, having read the book, you can at least feel like you know ""the rest of the story"" and can fill in the missing details of the movie in you mind. I can see where it's ""important"" to see it more than once. The first time, I just kept thinking, ""oh, they missed something"" or ""that's not how it happened"", and it just seemed like chopped pieces of the story here and there. Now, I think I can go and just relax, being excited to review the parts of Bella's home movies that she does have and enjoy those parts of her story visually. The Movie did seem ""Low Budget"", and the make-up didn't seem consistent in some of the scenes, but then, as ""Home Movies"" go, the lighting is never the same and I can just rationalize it that way. Hope this helps you to relax and enjoy the movie, and re-read the book and see the movie again... and, I just can't wait until New Moon is released, or Midnight Sun is finished . . . and hopefully one day, the continuation of the story (please Stephanie)."
"dede6116","1","7","9","10 February 2009"," Horrible movie
","This movie was horrible, I loved the series and thats saying much since I'm not into fantasy novels at all. But I'm glad i finished the books before i saw this movie. It was ridiculous, First of all physically, I think the casting was bad. Shame on you Meyers and whoever the casting director was. The only thing that would have helped it was if the actors PROVED that they should be playing their respective roles-which they didn't:<br/><br/>Kristen playing Bella was a joke, I think someone else said she was so independent that they wondered if and why she needed to be with Edward? I totally agreed. Stewart brought a stoic performance to a character that was anything but that, in my mind anyway, From the book, you got the sense that Bella was physically weak yet gained strength from her passionate and headstrong side. I saw her as being more feminine and delicate in her demeanor-not rough and indifferent- it was like huh? how is she Bella?<br/><br/>Robert playing Edward was also a joke, just because they put white makeup on you does not mean that it makes you Edward. A lot of the lines he didn't deliver as convincing as he should have, whether it was a misunderstanding or whatever he just did not pick up on the sarcasm that was there or at least what i read to be sarcasm, I mean this guy was suppose to be charming to every girl and yet he just stood there in every frame most of the time looking constipated. Bottom-line: I'm tired of hearing that Kristen and Robert and SO MUCH chemistry. No they didn't! does ""The Notebook"" ring a bell? That movie HAD chemistry between the two leading actors. I'm tired of people saying that these were breakout performances by the two when they were mediocre at best. It makes me mad that there are actually convincing actors out here that are doing silly teeny-boppers shows while these two and the likes of Zac Efron are getting all the major roles. HUH? I didn't see or hear most of the supporting cast like the rest of the Cullen-Hale clan to put my two cents in about their performance I guess I will be looking for that in New Moon (unfortunately)<br/><br/>the h.s. kids, irked me, the WHOLE h.s. setting irked me, Bella went to a small school with different little houses being the classroom where did you get the Chinese and the black guy from? I thought forks was a small town in Washington? when did they go on a field trip? did i miss that in the book?<br/><br/>**I think that people who are reading the reviews especially the negative ones should do so with a grain of salt. After reading a lot of them, I realized that many of them either have not read the book or saw the movie knowing that they do not like the book. I don't think it is wise to judge from them how terrible the movie was. Instead, the reader should read the reviews of people like me, who have read all the books: Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn ( and the few chapters leaked of Midnight Sun) that has a background, and above average understanding of the characters and their interrelationship and still think that this movie was g0d awful. <br/><br/>Physical performance aside the movie was very choppy and shot in this weird ominous light that annoyed me if you didn't read the book you would not know what was going on because the small important parts that were linked to the major ones were cut out or devalued to the point where you wondered why did they bothered to show it. The great thing about Twilight was that Stephanie Meyers took a person not in tune or interested in books about vampires and made me-in this series anyway but its almost like the director overlooked the good and captivating writing and made the movie the way she felt it SHOULD look not keeping Meyers vision in mind. if this was Meyers vision all along then i must be that stupid because i don't see it. Hopefully, director Chris Weitz could revive some of the magic back into this comatose series."
"emmiilayx","2","7","9","2 February 2009"," horrible.
","This movie was nothing like the novel. I'm surprised the author would allow all the left out parts and changes to be made. For example, when Bella and Edward kiss the first time, that's supposed to be in the MEADOW, not in her bedroom. And when she discovers that Edward is a vampire, they're supposed to be in his car and she never actually says the word vampire. And when James, the tracker, tricks Bella forcing her to escape from Jasper and Alice, it's supposed to be in the airport and she's supposed to be on the edge of crying when on the phone with James, not defensive. And also, important factors leading to the next books were left out, not like they're not gonna butcher New Moon too. This should have stayed as a TV movie. I'm pretty disgusted right now. My suggestion, stick to the books, you won't be so disappointed. And if you've read the books, don't watch the movie, it'll only get you mad about the casting, the changes to the plot, the lack of acting skill, and how quick everything happens in the story with little explanation as opposed to the books. I understand that this movie was meant for television, so if that was the case, it should have aired on television."
"lime_chic43","1","7","9","3 January 2009"," Disappointing
","I have to say this is actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen. At first, after forcing myself through the movie, I thought that it might be because of my high expectations after reading the excellent books. But actually, it's not. I do understand that the budget was low for this film, and they really tried to follow the book. However, the acting was horrendous, the storyline moved way too fast, and there was no emotion whatsoever. It was a mix of a Super Mario game from the early 90's and a high school project. I read the books so quickly...I couldn't put them down. My mistake was watching the movie - COMPLETELY ruined the book for me. Hopefully the change of director and more money for the second movie will make it bearable - but the actors need to step it up as well.<br/><br/>Horribly disappointing. I'm surprised I actually finished watching it. What a waste of my time."

It was so bad I tried to push the straw from my drink through my eye into my brain to stop the pain.<br/><br/>Every time there was running up a tree or that corny running really fast nonsense I couldn't help but laugh out loud.<br/><br/>I also think the main characters had the talent and charisma of a slow painful death.<br/><br/>I left the theatre asking anyone who would listen how this film got made, because undoubtedly this got through a number of edits, and this was the best.

"inventcreativity","Null","7","9","12 December 2008"," God awful film. Decent enough books.
","The film serves as a collage of well-lit slide-shows for Twilight series. Tragically, that's the lonely upside. Just about every aspect of the film-making beside cinematography was poorly executed. Poorly scripted, poorly directed, poorly edited, poorly acted (why Bella and Edward can't stop shivering their heads during conversations)... even the set of Cullen residence looked ridiculous. For fans or want-to-be fans of Meyer's saga, save yourself some money, google or fetch photographs online... IMO that proves a superior substitute than bearing 2 hour worth of this dreary.<br/><br/>I believe the director made a grave error filming only the first volume into this film. She should combine both Twilight and New Moon into the same 122 minutes. Meyer's writings spent a great deal of time recreating visuals for readers, visuals for every surrounding, every facet of protagonist's psychology, which quality acting/production would trim away in few strokes. What's left was too shallow for a full length feature to sing. So.<br/><br/>To be honest, the books aren't that spectacular, either. Although, they do grow on you if you have a free weekend, and a few ounces of patience to read through all four at once."

At least her early films had some good actors in them. Twilight is peopled with dead-eyed model-types who clearly had to have slept through their acting classes. Of course, there is little doubt they were selected because they looked ""cool"", which is the modus operandi of Ms. Hardwicke.<br/><br/>As long as Hollywood will keep throwing money at this bad director, it will continue to be in deep trouble."
"FinalDestination019","2","21","34","5 December 2008"," Painfully cheesy adaptation of a good book
","*A bit of a late review, since I saw this on opening day, but I wanted to get my opinion out on my new account.* <br/><br/>I liked the Twilight book. It was a little flawed, but it's God compared to the film. I don't know what the critics mean when they say it will ""please the die-hard fans"". Well, I am a fan, and I wasn't pleased. It's not because I'm hard to please, even though I am, it's just because the movie sucked.<br/><br/>I am not going to discuss the plot, it's about love and vampires, but I will discuss the film's strengths and weaknesses. One of the main weaknesses is the leads. Kristen Stewart is quite bland as Bella. Her face is expressionless throughout the majority of the film, and I did not believe her undying love for Edward. Robert Pattinson is, at times, good as Edward, however, his British accent comes through at parts, and he appears to be trying too hard at times.<br/><br/>The digital effects are easily the biggest problem. They were very poorly done. The scenes where the vampires are supposed to be running extremely fast, their feet aren't even touching the ground. It just came off as cheesy and I found myself laughing at parts.<br/><br/>Now, the film's strength comes from the secondary characters. The best were easily Charlie and Mike Newton. Billy Burke, as Bella's father Charlie, is nothing like the character in the book, but he had impeccable timing and he was easily the best character in the movie. Mike Newton was hilarious, his booty dance outside the caf√© stole the whole show.<br/><br/>Edward's family, the Cullens, are more interesting than Edward himself. Carlisle is a bit flat at times, in my opinion, but did a pretty respectable job for what he was given to work with. Esme was very warm and is pretty much everything I imagined her to be. Rosalie is considerably bitchy, and I thought Nikki Reed did a great job. Emmett was not at all how I pictured him, but he was likable. Alice and Jasper are both terrific, though unfortunately underused. Since they are given the least lines, they don't have to utter such hideous dialogue as much as the others.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is unsatisfying and not faithful enough to the book. Hopefully for New Moon, they will flesh out the characters more and increase the budget so the visuals aren't as corny. I'd say wait for a rental."
"kuchynata","3","21","34","24 November 2008"," If you haven't read the book, don't bother
","And, if you have read the book, then maybe you shouldn't bother then either, but for different reasons. Those who haven't read the book might get confused, or in the case of my friend, annoyed at the inconsistencies. Some of those inconsistencies wouldn't be a problem if she had read the book. A person shouldn't have to read the book a movie was based on in order to be entertained, or to know what on earth was going on. Those who have read the book will most likely be disappointed, unless you're a tween girl fascinated by Rob Pattinson. No offense tweenies, I was there at one time, too, and I do remember . . .<br/><br/>I've read all four books and took a friend who hasn't read them. I was bored and I knew the story! You can only imagine how painful it was for my friend to sit through the picture. I had hopes (not high ones) that the picture would take care of the things in the books that I found so unessential and annoying to read (disclaimer - I'm not her target audience in fiction, so not surprising I had difficulty with areas of the books). Stephanie Meyers created an intriguing and wonderful fantasy world, and though her characters aren't deep and rich, they're still engaging. The script for this picture failed to capture what's interesting about Edward and Bella's relationship as well as the fantastical world in which they dwell. The dialogue completely fails. It's choppy and unnatural, except for three or four lines scattered throughout.<br/><br/>It's a shame director Hardwicke chose to hang onto large panning shots -by the 20th one, we didn't care! Good film storytelling would have established the world and hinted at the conflict in the first 30 minutes, then hit the ground running with the baseball scene (where in the book, everyone's roles are firmly established and the conflict begins full throttle). Instead, my friend and I had to sit through an hour and forty minutes of melodramatic dreft before the conflict truly began and by then, we didn't care - though by then I was thankful that I had read the book. My friend was ready to leave - but she toughed it out.<br/><br/>The actors all did fine work, more so since they didn't have good material with which to work. They definitely earned their pay, as well as the adoration that's being sent their way (more than likely though, the adoration is not for their fine acting talents).<br/><br/>Finally, a note to the writer and director - if you have to resort to voice over, neither one of you has done your storytelling jobs."

When i heard Hollywood was making this into a movie i couldn't describe how excited i was.<br/><br/>What they released on screen makes me wish they would NEVER EVER do this again. I'm sorry but at this point the fans should have some say in the quality of acting, not to mention the special effects. The acting between Edward and Bella was cringe worthy, and people were actually laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny. Famous lines (""and so the lion fell in love with the lamb"", etc) were BUTCHERED, most of the time Edward just looked constipated and sounded whiney instead of the brooding but in love vampire he's supposed to be, and don't even get me started about the ridiculousness of him running up the tree with Bella or how he was supposed to sparkle in the sun.<br/><br/>Had i not been a huge fan, this might not have been QUITE as bad, but what makes it worse is to know they followed the plot pretty well but still failed that bad at having even an attempt at decent acting. Alice and Jacob were probably the only two that had decent acting in that whole movie.<br/><br/>All in all, i think this movie was just rushed through and the director was to worried about making it look artistic and poignant rather than focus on the basics, like acting and character interaction. Hell i'd rather have less special effects in the place of more believable acting, rather than forced lines, little to no chemistry, and that constant constipated look on Edwards face at any given moment. Bring the boy some Pepto and re-shoot that whole damn movie. I am just PRAYING they do a better job on the second movie (if there will even be a second movie)."

I didn't believe they were in love and the acting was really bad all around. The CGI was pretty bad as well. To make them look like they were going fast all they did was make them blurry.

","I really wanted to love Twilight. I mean, I'm a fan of the series but I admit that they aren't the best in contemporary literature, you can spend a couple of carefree hours reading them but they are nothing more, so I thought: usually when a book isn't a masterpiece, the movie is better. Man I was wrong, so wrong this time. How can you have a decent action flick when it is announced in January-February, filmed during the spring, post-produced for some months and then released in November? You can't: special effects are rustled up, they aren't acceptable anymore when you have seen wonders like Lord of the Rings or one of the Harry Potters. They seem to come out from 90's, I suppose. And then, the actors: Kristen Stewart is monotonous and shows no expressions or feelings, her Bella almost can't keep her eyes open; Robert Pattinson is gorgeous but can't exactly act; I only liked the castings of Jessica (wonderful Anna Kendrick), Esme and Rosalie. Ashley Green is pretty as Alice, but she isn't given much screen time. Last but not least, the best part in the book is the building up of Edward and Bella's romance: here it's totally cut, they pass ¬ñ in 10 minutes ¬ñ from angst and indifference to great love. I think it's because Bella's introduction in Forks is too long. Dialogues are awful, too.

","Let me preface this by saying that I went to see the movie as a 'parental guider' because I didn't want to send my salivating 14yr old alone into the other 'masses' of salivating 14yr olds who had been waiting what seemed like an ETERNITY (only to them) to see EDWARD CULLEN! & co., no telling what could come of all that! I attended with ZERO expectation of any depth of character, storyline, dialogue, substance, etc. and it did not disappoint. In my opinion it was exactly all of that: shallow characters, so-so storyline, and dialogue that seemed unnaturally forced and to have amounted to about 5 typed, double-spaced pages for a screenplay. I left the movie with something I wanted to stress to my daughters more than anything else that Hollywood has, yet again, painted a false picture of love and how it looks in real life. This movie (and so many others), paints the hero character, Edward, as uber interested, involved, preoccuppied and concerned for the heroine, Bella, which doesn't even come close to real life is! Boys don't think like that. They don't care like that, that don't agonize over teen girls like that. Of course, I understand that he is a vampire has other fictional reasons to be drawn to Bella, but I think it still imparts a false image of what teenage boys are capable of into the minds' of the movie's target audience (young,impressionable, teenage girls). In actuality, it's really quite the opposite, girls can and some do pine and agonize and involve themselves in the lives of their boyfriends, but boys don't. Not that it could never happen, but the chances of it happening in high school are not likely and not desirable¬Öat least not to this mother of three girls. What a rude awakening Hollywood has set up for our girls...if we as parents are not pro-actively dialoguing with our daughters about the realities of love."

Edward and Bella were probably my biggest problem. They always managed to make every scene awkward. Edward seemed to always be at a loss of words, and Bella couldn't even hold a conversation without looking bored out of her mind. I don't think I could even pick out the ""best"" actor in that movie.

It was very hard for me to take it seriously or see it for ""what it is."" ""What it is"" is a just a very boring, slow paced movie with a simple-minded plot that wasn't even executed correctly."
"topazshadow","3","18","29","23 November 2008"," Poorly made movie from a phenomenal book
","After reading the first book within a day, I was in love. The story was beyond amazing, and the development couldn't have been better. I was thrilled that the book would be brought to the big screen, so I scoured the internet for every trailer and movie clip as my excitement grew and grew. On Friday I walked into the theater expecting a seductive romance, but all I got were 2 hours of non-stop laughter, even though that wasn't the intent of the movie.<br/><br/>Many people have already talked about the plot, how much the movie deviated from the book, etc., but I'm going to focus on the acting and how the movie flowed as a whole. The cast was great, except for Rob and Kristen as Edward and Bella. Their actions seemed forced, and remained extremely awkward throughout the whole movie. There was none of the spine- tingling romance that defined most of their relationship. Instead, Bella seemed absolutely terrified of Edward, and her ""I'm not afraid of you"" came out as fake and unbelievable. Now that the New Moon has been green lighted, I'd suggest that Rob and Kristen really get to know the characters they're portraying. The rest of the actors were great- from the rest of the Cullens family to Charlie- because they truly became those characters, and dedicated themselves to their roles. Most of Rob and Kristen's acting were laughable, which detracted from the tone of the movie. In the scene when Edward and Bella meet in chemistry class, Edward's fury looked more like he had caught the stomach virus rather than he was tormented by her presence. Lines weren't delivered with the correct tone so they came out cheesy and amateurish instead of powerful and stirring.<br/><br/>What ruined the movie for me was the fake acting of the two main characters. They needed to believe what they were doing. Some of the scenes also bothered me, such as the meadow scene. It took me until the scene almost ended before i realized that Edward was sparkling. Again, it lacked believability and credibility!<br/><br/>The baseball scene, however, was superbly done. The actors were very into what they were doing, and it met my expectations for what the scene should have looked like. If New Moon had more scenes like that one, it would garner much better reviews.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie that people can skip out on. If you really want to see it, don't walk in with high expectations. Set them as low as you possibly can, and keep in mind that the acting is far below par. The book, however, was amazing, so read it, but don't watch this."

"Lauralie16","3","19","31","21 November 2008"," What the...?
","First of all, I gave it a three because it was so awkward that you just had to laugh. If not for the laughing, i think i would have given it a 1 or a 2.<br/><br/>Basically what i feel it comes down to is a poor director. The movie moved very fast. The ""romancing"" section of the movie was fast and confusing if you have not read the book. It was like, hello, my name is Edward I am a vampire, and Bella falls in love with him right away. Many of the lines were horribly delivered. Now, I don't know if this is the actors fault or more the directors visions of the scene. The scene with edward and bella in the forest and him shouting ""as if you could catch me..."" left me and my friends feeling awkward at the strange acting. This was only one of the scenes that left us like that. And it was at these points that made us laugh because, how else were we to respond? In my own personal opinion, I feel like some of the actors were poorly cast. I did not like Bella. She seemed to have one face as well as no inflections to her voice. I was also expecting more from Robert Pattinson. For me he was a disappointment, being overly dramatic all the time. The famous biology scene was ridiculous, with him covering his nose and making faces. I thought Edward was rigid and stone faced. Though this could have been due to the director of course...<br/><br/>I am going on and on, so let me finish up. Overall, the movie was over-dramatic and poorly directed in my opinion. There were some good parts, i found James to be refreshing compared to all the other actors.<br/><br/>I would not suggest to go see this movies in the theatre. Maybe rent it if you are really curious...<br/><br/>I had really hoped more out of this movie. I believe that if they change the director, they could really change it around, and add better special effects as well.<br/><br/>alright, im done now :-)"
"megggymag","2","5","6","26 June 2011"," No matter how hard I try, I cannot adapt to the movie - especially after reading the book... :(
","Where should I start? With the story itself? With the actors? With the director? Anyway, I will definitely have some negative words from the people who like this movie but every one of us have different tastes, right? :) So I had seen the movie before I read the book so I had no (NO!) expectations. But come on how can you give the main role to someone who can just blink and shake her head all the time?!?! Then came the second disappointment. Robert. He did not act like he was suffering from the pain he was going through but really looked like he had to pee so hard... he should have been something like ""Adonis"" but do not go deeper into the look, I may have a quite twisted imagination of Adonis :))) When I read the book I realized that the actors are the smallest problem with the movie. Why oh why did they write over almost all the scenes??? The best parts had been simply cut out - they wanted to write drama or what? They should have kept the easy jokes and chatting in order to avoid choking the story into boredom...those could show the real side of Bella - a lovably woeful, inexperienced teenager girl instead of a depressive loser. The only thing I can give a 2 is because of the actors chosen for Alice and Charlie - I really appreciate them! Okok, Emmett is also fine :) All in all, if I could start it again, I would definitely not waste my time for the movie but reading the book over and over again (like I do it every day :)). I would rate it with 10 points but not the movie."

The dialogs are too simple and not interesting at all, they are banal. And how can people idealize this love when it just seems wrong. Who would fall in love with this ugly pale scary looking guy? Only the clumsy pale Bella would lol I like Kirsten Stewart but this wasn't for her. I would prefer Emma Watson in this role. She could express the feelings better and make it more believable.

"booboobolhuis","1","5","6","15 October 2010"," How could this of happened?????
","I have read all the books out of curiosity from all the hype. 'Twilight' I picked up at the bookstore only because there was a HUGE promo a month before the movie came out and they had TONS of paperbacks available that even women my age were grabbing up. I couldn't fathom what could possibly be so special about this book that teenage girls and older women were acting like nutcases over at the bookstore for. So needless to say I bought the paperback because I'm an avid reader and assumed it was the new Holy Grail of literature I hadn't heard about. I went into it with NO former knowledge of the Twilight world and honestly I no idea what to expect. The book was excellent...but this is not a book review so I will move on to the movie...<br/><br/>The movie is HORRIBLE and a great DISAPPOINTMENT! Every excellent feature, scene, emotion, and character quality in the book was stripped from this movie (as they usually are but this takes it to a whole new level)and it left the entire movie, characters and story, hollow. Honestly while watching it at the theater (yes I went)I was embarrassed for the actors and the author. I'm not sure how with a story/book so popular and so high profile this could be the final adaptation of the book. With all the tricks of the trade available for today's movie making how could this low budget, should of gone straight to video, movie been set loose on the public? I had to come home and reread the book just to wipe the horrible memory of the movie from my mind.<br/><br/>Another example of taking a great book and ruining it by turning it into a movie. I will never watch it again."
"SteveBC","2","5","6","13 August 2010"," Do expect entertainment, but not a good movie
","NOTE: When I sat down to watch this movie I did it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I did not watch the movie to mock it, for I had no clue what it was about (except: ""something about vampires and werewolves""). I watched the movie in a very objective way, so don't take this as the word of a hater:<br/><br/>Twilight could very well be one of the worst movies of the decade. (I will not say of all time, because there are a whole load of worse movies out there.) The writing was bad, the editing was a joke, the acting was mediocre at best and the visual effects were the most terrible thing I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The writing - I won't go in deep here, because I haven't read the actual book, so I cannot say for sure if it's the original author's fault or if the screenplay-writer(s) screwed up. But this I can say: The story takes place - as I understood from somebody who had actually read the book - over several months. In the movie it seems like a week tops. The dialog is horrible and so corny it made me laugh at serious parts (something I really try to avoid doing). Also the story seems very rushed through and is hardly fully understandable for somebody who has not read the book.<br/><br/>The editing - Not very much to say here: Out of sync talking, terribly shot action- and fighting-scenes. In a word: a catastrophe.<br/><br/>The acting - Although I didn't expect it, Robert Pattinson did quite well here. Him and a few other (secondary) actors portrayed their characters in a believable way. Kristen Stewart however plays Bella in such an unauthentic way, she doesn't even seem like she's really acting. Taylor Lautner's portrayal of Jacob was just as enthusiastic as was the one of Cam Gigandet as James. Namely: not at all.<br/><br/>The visual effects - I will not say anything here, due to a complete lack of words in the English language to describe the terribleness of these effects. You'll just have to watch the movie yourself to see.<br/><br/>Overall - Being one of the worst movies of the decade, Twilight still does two things right: Good marketing and Robert Pattinson. Which (because of all the teeny-girls) kind of go hand in hand I guess (though I personally don't get why). Twilight is a bad to mediocre film - said blandished - and, though I don't recommend watching it for the movie itself, I definitely say it was worth while giving it a glimpse just to see what all the fuzz is about."

","Is there another movie that has so much comments as this one, you have the hatred and the loved ones. Everybody told me to stay away from this movie but after 2 years I thought it was time to spend 2 hours of my life to watch this acclaimed flick. I just watched it so I could talk about it, my wife would like to see it so here we go. People who know me here in my native country or who know me via youtube or this site know that I am a horror geek. So there we have the first problem. All the sites concerning horror are tearing this one to bits. When the end credits were running on the flat screen my only opinion was, let's have a look at the lady. And even she wasn't so much amused with watching Twilight. Our opinion was, this is definitely NOT a horror flick, this is just a romantic movie just to be happening with vampires. I can understand that teenagers who are falling in love are really looking up to this flick. Remembering my youth there was Grease and other romantic movies. I wouldn't say that this is Grease of the 'OO because they don't sing but I can understand that there was a gap for the teenies after the ending of Harry Potter. But to say and understand that grown ups like this flick, that I can't just get it. There is really nothing going on. Just when you think, a-ha now the vampires will strike the movie cuts away to another scene. The only part were really something is going on is the part were a member of another clan is being killed. That part I enjoyed. The other 115 minutes are just talking and talking about why and when and how they should become a couple. The vampire going into the sun is another issue, diamonds look-a-like appearing on his skin, and the fast movements in the woods. No thanks, just give me the old vampires. But again, for me I just would give it a 2, due the reaction of my immortal one sitting here in the settee. But I must admit that I will watch the second part just to see it, no expectations at all...if you are a teenager under 16 you really will love it but if you are older...put a stake through it! It's strange that another teenage flick being released flopped, but there you also had the vampire story in it and there really something went on, I'm talking about Jennifer's Body. But people are people and who am I to disagree with them, me the outcast..."

I definitely wouldn't consider myself one of the ""die-hard Twilight fans"" though. I don't have any posters, no shirts, and I don't own any of the movies. I will admit that I had high hopes for the movie, probably higher than I should have. The acting was HORRIBLE. I am thoroughly DISGUSTED with the choice of actors. Stewart(Bella) is repulsive. I have never hated an actress more than I hate her. She shows no emotion in any of the movies, and I can guarantee that a monkey could play the part better than her. Don't even get my started on Pattinson(Edward) either. All in all, they're worth wasting your money on MAYBE once, if you're willing to sit in a theater with a bunch of die-hard pre-teens that scream every time they see Pattinson on screen. After seeing them, I doubt you'll even want to buy the stupid thing on DVD. I hope to the high heavens that they change the direction they're going so they don't start losing money. Trust me.

","I am afraid to say I almost fell asleep watching this.It was more of scenery and music then a real music. The thing is, what happened to the real deal? Vmapires are definitely not supposed to be ""pretty"" or ""kind"". This so called vampire movie was totally off track and the whole idea was dumb. I mean who wouldn't have one little bit of reaction if they found out their boyfriend was a vampire? Bella was a poor excuse for a character. She was so dull and detailed. Bella was definitely not what I would call a realistic and interesting character. The whole idea of making vampires romantic and talented, ""just like you and I"" was absolutely stupid! Vampires are supposed to be blood sucking, vicious, merciless, revolting, repulsive, frightening, creepy, and unsightly! This movie ruined the idea of real vampires! Yes, I read the book and that pretty much sucked as well. Vampires sparkling in the sunlight? Give me a break! This was an absolutely ridiculous excuse for a movie!"

From my point of view, the inability of acting of some actors has made this movie less special. There is absolutely nothing of the magic contained in the book and I am personally disappointed by this. Whilst I do not criticize the writer Stephenie Meyer, because her books are special and are the most beautiful I have ever read, it should have been better not to make the movie because it does not transmit the same emotions you get from reading the book .

"ZekeRage911","2","5","6","7 April 2010"," Don't let your daughters watch this crap
","I like vampires. I like the night predator aspect, the lurking in the dark danger, and I get the tall dark stranger sex appeal. With this in mind, Twilight wanted me to put a wooden stake in my face!<br/><br/>The story centers around Bella, that's Isabella, but why nitpick about names, they're all pretty ridiculous. She moves from sunny Arizona to rainy, gloomy Washington State, and contrary to the way the REAL world works, is instantly accepted into the popular niche'. She becomes fascinated with Edward Cullen, who is a vampire. Although the fact that no one knows that he and his family are vampires goes to show the entire town must be drinking lead tea to wash down their bowls of stupid. The Cullen family are all pale, don't come out when it's sunny, keep to themselves, and never seem to age. Their eyes are weird looking, and apparently nobody put two and bloody two together. While we're on the subject, why would a vampire hang around high school? Ed the vampire is over a hundred years old, what's he doing in high school? I didn't want to be in high school when I WAS in high school, I sure as hell wouldn't spend the rest of eternity in it!!<br/><br/>Anyway, Bella becomes obsessed with Edward, who is already obsessed with her, and I'm already bored. There's some hints of a plot about unexplained animal attack killings, but it's hidden under a thick, heavy, moldy blanket of boring teen melodrama. This is what girls want to see? Two people who can't get their dialogue right, both apparently born without personalities fumbling into a nonsensical romance just because... actually, that's a good question, WHY the hell are they attracted to each other? Maybe it's because they share an absolute aversion to being interesting. For the two main characters, they're the least interesting in the entire story. I even found myself wanting to know more about the rest of the school's gossip simply because it seemed mildly more interesting.<br/><br/>Eventually, and I can't believe I'm writing this, Edward takes Bella with his family to play a kind of super-powered baseball, and that's when the bad vampires show up. Who are they? More interesting characters that have appeared out of nowhere. Well, the Cullens try to hide Bella, but she's functionally retarded, so she falls for a very simple ploy and is lured into the clutches of the bad vampires. An extremely dull fight scene results, Bella is bitten, but before she's turned into a vampire, Ed sucks the poison out. Oh good, for a moment I thought something interesting might happen like CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!<br/><br/>This is what we're letting teen girls watch? Some people compare this story to Romeo and Juliet, but they're clearly on crack. While admittedly the characters are just as flat as Romeo and Juliet, the story is absolute drivel.<br/><br/>And now for the elephant in the room: Sparkly vampires. Are you kidding me? How is a night predator supposed to hunt anything when his body glitters like he's in a stage show in Las Vegas? When did vampires become so weak and ineffectual? Spending all their time seducing jailbait or moping about their lot in unlife, give these vampires a pair... of FANGS!<br/><br/>In short, bad message for girls, bad story, and you know the entire concept of pacing? Well the director doesn't because there ISN'T ANY!! It just sort of meanders from one scene to the next with no cohesion or tension. I care more about the lint on my rug than the fate of these kids. As a writer/director/living person THIS IS A BAD THING FOR YOUR MOVIE!!!<br/><br/>Though Alice is pretty cute."
"dobrien4587","Null","5","6","28 March 2010"," One of the Worst films I have ever seen
","Movies based on books are released all the time. Some are good like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, some are God awful like Battlefield Earth. Many know this to be true, however it takes a huge amount of effort to be considered one of the worst films of all time. Twilight is one of those rare pieces of crap. The movie is not only horrible written, horrible acted and horrible directed, but even if there was effort put into this film, it still would have sucked. Twilight manages to take the word ""awful"" and give it a whole new meaning. If Citizen Kane is shown at film schools as an example of how to make good movies, than Twilight is shown to tell students how NOT to make a film.<br/><br/>Twilight's first and by far biggest problem is its story, its inconsistent, stupid and Incredibly boring. The thing is, I have never read the book, I don't want to after seeing the film. But from what I've gathered, the book is basically ""O my GOD i wanna hit Edward!"" For 500+ pages. So how do you make a movie based off of that?! The book also lacks any credible dialog. Every line is either dull, stupid, or just unconvincing and awkward.<br/><br/>Like I said before, the story is awful. Other than ""OMG I wanna hit Edward"" we have an unconvincing plot about our main character Bella spending the summer with her father, going to school and a family of ""vampires"". The reason why I put vampires in quotation marks is because nothing in this movie resembles a vampire. The ""vampires"" in this film sparkle in daylight, possess super human speed and strength, and they apparently can turn people into vampires, instead of an army of the living dead. Edward himself is incredibly dull, emo and just cannot act in this movie. He has absolutely NO personality or emotion.<br/><br/>The characters are completely deprived of personality. Bella's lines all have the same emo monotone and are awkward and dull. The same can be said with every other character in this film. The dialog is absolutely horrendous as well. I could go on forever, but let me say this, I first saw this movie with a group I started to hang out with, some of them were girls, and they forced me to see this movie. I have been seeking revenge ever since.<br/><br/>Overall: What else needs to be said? If Son of the Mask and StarWars the Clone wars didn't exist, this would be the absolute worst film I have ever seen! The acting is horrible, the directing sucks, the story is beyond garbage. This film had ""disaster"" written all over it, and the end result is just not worth any sum of money."

I can see why teens may like this with its lame storyline and teen idol appeal of Robert P., who, to me, is a big nothing, with two moles prominent behind his left ear, and one on his face, that, and heavy, heavy eyebrows, although somewhat plucked for this movie. That wig on Lautner was half coming off--you could see right through it. I just thought the movie was stupid, senseless. That baseball game was just ridiculous, as were the bunch of motley characters who seemed to escape from a Halloween party. A fantasy, but just ridiculous, even for a fantasy. A good teen movie, but not for intellectuals. Garbage."
"CranberriAppl","Null","5","6","9 February 2010"," Not as bad as I thought, but not great. Chock full of problems
","OK, count me in the number that could stand to never see the whole Twilight franchise again. It's everywhere: web ads, bookstores, fricken Nordstrom. It's been very hard to avoid everything Twilight. So last night, it was on Showtime On Demand, and I decided to finally watch.<br/><br/>First off, Kristen Stewart's Bella was incredibly deficient in the personality department. Did she have a lobotomy? I mean, granted, it's been 8 yrs since my teen stage (I'm 26), but good grief, her perpetually depressed and moody face bugged me. We had Emo kids in my high school, but even they could crack a joke every now and then. She literally had no presence. In my high school, she would have been the new kid for a day, but nobody would have talked to her bc she looked so depressing. It was hard to believe that there were guys already crushing on her. Why? She wasn't all that nice to anyone, she barely talked, the friends she had, the relationships seemed more one-sided than anything.<br/><br/>Next Edward. I will say that RP is a nice looking guy, but all the fangirl (not just teen girls, either) swooning is a real turnoff. Anyway, when Edward first came on screen, I had high hopes, but when he actually spoke, I was like ""um, is he slow?"" It was as if he had a speech impediment. I had to rewind it to hear it again, and then proceed to laugh. Edward was also a bit of a stalker. I guess if I were 14, I would be turned on by his behavior, but being an adult, I'd be concerned about why he was following me places. And don't get me started on how he admitted he likes watching her sleep.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another point. I get that the author wrote the novel based on a (obviously Fabio-esquire)dream she had, but she played way fast and loose with the vampire details. Perhaps the fact that the guy in her dream was a vampire was secondary. I literally asked my friend ""OK, are they vampires or some type of animals?"" The pale faces weren't enough. I could not believe that it wasn't clear that they were vamps. Then when I saw they didn't have fangs...WTF!! And they must be the only set of ""vamps"" that don't combust when out in the daylight. The sparkle was SO CHEESY. I know I'm giving spoilers, but 1.I marked the review w/the spoiler tag and 2.if you like vampire-based stories, you will be sorely disappointed. Back to my point, when Bella discovers what Edward is, he gets all serious and they focus on his face, but he reveals no fangs!! WTF! Fangs are so basic to vampires. Then I read a reviewer that says they don't have them? Is this for real? The baseball game...come on. What fun is it if you can just fly and catch the ball. Cheesy. BTW, the whole family structure was a tad creepy. The conflict lasted probably 15 minutes and was over so fast. It's less of a vampire story and more of a teen angst/Degrassi-style movie.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on Bella wanting to be turned after her association with Edward nearly gets her killed and she's only known him a couple weeks!!<br/><br/>Someone else had it right: they seemed less like vamps and more like supernatural creatures. If they could walk into anywhere uninvited, didn't burst into flames, can't be staked, etc etc, then what makes them scary? Since when are vampires nice? Even back on Buffy, Angel became Angelus and Spike w/his chip still had his bad boy tendencies. More recently, Damon on Vampire Diaries is straight up evil and doesn't make excuses for himself. Stefan, his brother, is also part of this neutered dog trend (like Edward) which is quite ridiculous if they are supposed to be vamps.<br/><br/>So watch the film (for free on TV) but keep your expectations low. Just think of it as a teen flick NOT a vampire flick, and you should survive. <br/><br/>Before I forget, that bluish-tinted filter that Twilight was filmed in was awful. Just awful. It almost hurt my eyes. Sometimes that adds effect to the film/show, but not when it's that noticeable. It was almost as if it was done to make all the characters seem even more pale and emo. Horrible."

","This comment is not so much a review so much as a Public Service Announcement: If you want to watch a movie with real character depth, an emotionally engaging story, and a solid romance at the core, there are plenty of good movies to see (I recommend Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).<br/><br/>If you want a good vampire movie, there are tons of classics to choose from. (I recommend the various adaptations of Dracula, especially the 1931 version) If you want a strong romance between two developed characters set in a fantasy world, then there are movies you can watch. (Lord of the Rings, for example) But unless you want to endure bad dialogue, writing, no plot, unlikeable characters, bad acting, an underdeveloped supporting cast, poorly framed shots, crappy FX, painfully slow pacing, annoying product plugs, and an overall painful experience......<br/><br/>DO NOT WATCH TWILIGHT!!!!!! I don't even know where to begin with how god-awful this movie is. Bella's character is just plain awful. She's a whiny brat who is never satisfied, and overly pretentious. She acts like she's tormented, even though her biggest pain is having parents that are divorced, even though they are both really nice people who care about her. Furthermore, she also has the glorious distinction of being overly popular, which just shows how much her life sucks. Add to that, she is obnoxiously STUPID!!! In one scene Edward says, ""I wanna kill you and suck all the blood from your body"" and Bella smirks and says, calmly , ""I don't care."" And that isn't even that far from the original As for Edward, there's nothing wrong with him except the fact that he stalks a girl he barely knows and treats her like crap. Aside from that, we don't actually learn anything about him throughout the course of the movie. Oh, and he's about the worst vampire ever to walk the face of the planet.<br/><br/>Add to this, both characters are poorly acted.<br/><br/>Further lowering this film's quality is the plot. There is none. After our protagonists get together, the rest of the film is just watching them get a kick out of not having sex. That's really clever, people. Also, the last scene is almost directly lifted from the 1992 film Bram Stoker's Dracula. ""I want to become a vampire!"" ""No, because vampires are damned for all eternity!"" ""I'm gonna die anyway!"" Sound familiar? I could go into more detail, but it's just a waste of time. This film is horrible. From beginning to end, this movie is just plain awful."

Her love interest is a really old vampire that could be her great grandfather, and yet, neither of them (nor do viewers, apparently) have any problems with that. Message is: it is not important how old you are, looks are what counts. <br/><br/>Director of this movie is not a very good one. She tries her best, but all the washed up colors and odd camera angles can not hide the fact that a hundred years old person is starting a love relationship with a girl who lives with a stereotypical ""awkward"" dad and is, for some reason, adored by the cool children even though she's a mumbling ""outcast"".<br/><br/>It seems pointless even to talk about this movie, it doesn't have at least a minimum of entertainment value. The girl is played badly by an actress that was gorgeous in Into the wild, whole high school setting is as exciting as actual high school and in the process, this garbage manages to produce some terrible and unnecessary ""additions"" to vampire lore, like the whole sparkling thing. <br/><br/>It baffles me beyond belief that a hundred year old person would go year after year to a freakin' high school along with his hundreds of years old family. That alone does not help him be more cool. It helps him look like a moron.

Herr Kross is focused and intense, with an innate sense of pacing, and would be a better talent-match for Ms. Stewart (whose screen street-smarts make Pattinson look even more incapable. I found it hilarious that RP said that Stewart was such a professional that he just shut up on the set when she was around -- good idea.) Kross might actually make the remaining ""Twilight"" movies bearable. His abilities would certainly please the teen set, especially since he is their age.

Perhaps that's the worst part, cause that makes everything look very premature. Book contains a lot of quite important trifles and here it was changed (I didn't like the way how they did it) or wasn't at all. Director (C.Hardwicke) just wanted to show us the Twilight story largely, but I missed those little important things. A lot of my friends said that that's impossible to show that thick book's story in 2 hours, but take a look of Harry Potter's movies! They're much batter in scenario than Twilight. And the other thing - Sure, Rob's great, BUT, I didn't get it - is he really so stiff or it was special for Edward's character? <br/><br/>Maybe it's weird, but I can't wait to see New Moon. Why?

"tonymurphylee","Null","5","6","22 December 2008"," Ludicrous, but in an interesting way.
","Here is a film that just feels wrong in so many ways. The film, as you all probably know by now, is about a girl and a vampire who fall in love. I understand that the idea of a girl falling in love with a vampire is rather fascinating since vampires are often depicted as being very sensual and strange. However, the idea of a vampire falling in love with a human to the point where he refuses to suck her blood makes no sense. It's makes as much sense as a dog falling in love with dog food. The humans are the prey and the vampires are the predator. However, that's just the tip of the iceberg. <br/><br/>I have several questions about this movie and I have several confusions. My main complaint about this movie regards the female characters. They're all weaklings. Why do female characters always get depicted as weaklings who always work in the kitchen and must let the big strong man fight the battles and defend her? Why can't we have a popular movie with a strong female character? It's stupid! There's no women to look up to in this movie. In addition, the main female character, Bella, is just as lifeless as the vampires themselves. I actually thought that she was a vampire at the beginning of the film because she was so much paler than everyone else! There's one scene where she has to pretend to be a vampire and I thought to myself ""That should be hard!"" Then they make a big deal out of it as if it's the ultimate challenge or something. It's really funny! <br/><br/>However, that brings me to my next complaint. The lack of conflict. Why do nearly all the characters, including the head vampire family, have to be so damn unusual and strange and quirky and kooky and bizarre? What is the deal with all the male characters being surrounded by so many women? Why on earth does a vampire's skin reflect and bunch of diamond-like shards? Why doesn't their skin burn? What is with all the racism toward the Native-Americans??? Why are they getting called wolves? Why is the Bella character so popular when she appears to be so anti-social? The sole highlight of the film is Taylor Lautner's character. Taylor is a truly beautiful boy and I feel bad for him that he's involved in such a project.<br/><br/>How does anyone not notice a man stopping a car with his bare hand when he pauses for a long time after he does it? Why doesn't Edward just constantly suck Bella's blood if he can do that without turning her into a vampire? Why do the vampires have to play baseball in the rain? These questions, and many more, which I can't reveal without spoiling the plot, ran through my mind throughout this film. The camera-work is awful. There are so many close-ups that you can never get a good look at anybody a lot of the time. Other times the camera just swoops and sweeps around for no reason. The narration kept on taking me out of the movie and never really matched what was going on in the plot. This film is a complete mess and I'm surprised that so many people are so obsessed with it.<br/><br/>I actually did enjoy the movie, believe it or not, but there is no doubt in my mind that it doesn't work. This film fails to provide any sort of moral. It fails as a love story. It fails as a vampire film. It fails as a coming-of-age movie. It just doesn't work. I'm not going to bother not recommending it since you've probably already seen it anyway. I was just stating my opinion. Years from now, fans of this movie and of the books and of the films to follow will look back at this and feel ashamed. This movie is going to age like crap."
"lily_os2008","1","44","81","21 November 2008"," Another Awful Adaptation
","Many times before, we have been disappointed with bad novel adaptations, and this is perhaps the worst case I know of. The plot is driven too fast and it's outline doesn't have any support at all. It's chronological sequence is very vague and senseless, also dialogues are too lazy. And if this was little, the acting doesn't help at all, the visual effects are not even interesting. Maybe just the music and the photography are worth but the dizzy editing spoils it at it's whole. It doesn't deserve your time, there are other ways to bore yourself, and for free. Just because it's a fashion film it don't necessarily makes it a good film."

","Just simply awful. On every level. I'm only writing more because the review needs at least 10 lines of text. Throughout the film I kept thinking I had missed something. I completely misread situations, because the performances just didn't match what was supposed to be going on. You just can't read any emotion from either of them - it's impossible. It was such a relief when Edward smiled on occasion - at last, a brief moment where I understand what at least one of them is feeling. I don't think I've ever been more confused by a film. The whole thing is about their relationship - and I don't think I ever felt that I had a clue what either of them was supposed to be feeling. They both looked so uncomfortable. And maybe that's because they are supposed to be, but it just came across as two people acting incredibly badly. Amazingly bizarre film. Like a really bad episode of a really bad teen soap."
"rorymacveigh","1","8","11","15 August 2012"," If Misery was a film, this would be it...
","This film is so downhearted and miserable, that I wouldn't be surprised if all the people who watched this movie turned into Manic Depressants and Suicidal's. This film and it's following sequels are a nonsensical mess of Vampire love that goes wrong and a list of people who have no personality. The worst of it all, is the leading lady Bella, a 17 year old who believes she's been dealt the worst card in life and feels that she is tortured from day to day even though she has no problems at all. She then goes on to get enticed with Edward Cullen, a Vampire who doesn't want to get involved with her because of his secret truth. But once she finds out and after Edward has to fight off his siblings before they rip her throat out, she decides that she wants to marry him and become a Vampire herself even though everyone including Edward has said with absolute certainty that it's throwing her life away. So he distances himself from her in order to protect her, only to find that she takes the idea of Attention Seeking to a whole new level by driving motorbikes into trees and jumping off cliffs, this really is a good message to convey to girls who have just lost their boyfriends, Jumping off cliffs and crashing motorbikes is the only way to get him back and teach him what he's done his wrong, the only problem is you may be slightly dead at the end of it.<br/><br/>Anyway, she then goes and gets intimate with another boy who seems much more supportive and caring than Edward, only to find that she dumps him in like a second because Edward looks at her funny across the Cafeteria. This causes another war like situation between the Vampires as to who gets to devour her blood. Eventually, Edward wins and he agrees to marry her, only to find she goes off with the boy from earlier again. This character is the most manipulative and self centred creature I have ever seen in film, and makes me beg the question who the real bad guy is anyway?<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a depressing dunce of sadness, it makes little to no sense, the characters are unspeakably bland and by far the worst part of it is Bella. If someone like her ever existed, they'd probably be a bane on teenage boys everywhere. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid!!"

","I know I will be a head hunted and ""wanted for dead"" now. But this is my honest opinion about Twilight.<br/><br/>Let's face it, Twilight is the new generation of youth films; sexy young vampires and werewolves having that 'special look', and I sat down open minded and wanted to like it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while watching, I kept on thinking Harry Potter with vampires (sorry girls) - all young people learning and finding love killing the evil ones. The only positive thing I can say about Twilight is that it has damn good effects. The story is insulting ordinary, the acting the A-W-E-F-U-L to the max and the chemistry between the actors non-excisting.<br/><br/>I have absolutely no doubt that young teenage girls will fall in love with the drop dead(!) gorgeous Robert Pattinsson, but I doubt that any other will find anything interesting about this all hyped up, ordinary and highly overrated film."
"jacksonh0608","2","8","11","23 June 2012"," I mean... Really?... This is sad...
","Let's go ahead and cut to the chase. This movie sucks. It just sucks. And that's all there is to it. Did I read the books? No, and I certainly won't now. The idea sounded interesting, vampires and werewolves (not entirely original but hey whatever) fighting with a girl thrown in the mix who falls for the bloodsucking Edward Cullen. Doesn't SOUND bad, until you hear the dialogue and acting jobs of these guys. Bella (Kristen Stewart), has the personality of a bucket and Edward (Robert Pattenson) sparkles with a more flamboyant shine than Tinkerbell from Peter Pan. Putting aside that nonsense, we have ourselves a movie with pointless scenes that just kill time (ex. that poorly made baseball scene) and a plot that leads. Well, to nowhere, I guess to the sequel unfortunately. My biggest complaint with this movie is that none of the characters are likable. Edward just complains about being a vampire, Jacob hates him because Bella hangs out with him more, and Bella has the same facial expression for the whole film. It's badly; written, acted, filmed, the list goes on. That's all I gotta say. Anything else you need to know. Watch the movie, I hope you make it through the whole thing."
"westinowich","1","8","11","31 May 2012"," No character in any of the characters
","The unlikeliness in this story simply is too high. Let's simply sum up the main lines in the two main characters: One of them is an ancient vampire, full of life experiences and cultural understanding very few people will ever obtain. The other is a teenage girl, with absolutely nothing in common with this ancient creature, however this is supposed to be the beauty in the story, (the VERY clich√©-like model): The meeting of opposites. HOWEVER this attempt simply is too far out. ALSO, the characters don't evolve during the entire movie, (except they fall in love)... This movie basically contributes with nothing.<br/><br/>This is one of many modern vampire stories, where vampires co-exist with humans in modern society. The latest movie with an attempt at creating a REAL vampire (true to the vampire legend) was Van Helsing.<br/><br/>Twilight is a tier 5 chick flick, and just as horrible as titles such as 'mean girls' and 'sex and the city'."

I came, I saw, I sat to the end.<br/><br/>So yes I won, but at what cost?<br/><br/>Well it's 90 mins I could have contributed something to society with that I'll never get back, however as Bella knows, we make our choices in life and that is that. Twilight is about as awkward and goofy a production as anything I've ever seen. Kristin Stewart, this gen's Jennifer Love Hewitt, loves shaking her head around before and after every line of dialog. I was shaking my head before and after every line of her dialog too. Robert Pattison I believe to have actual talent behind all that white powder on his face, but he phoned in his lines here. Or at least it was on purpose for us to believe he was faking it all along. I'm not sure how interesting it could be really. Twilight is essentially a story about a bad relationship.<br/><br/>Ah I'm giving it far to much credit already. in the end it's completely harmless. There's no mystery why the core story is so attractive for those seeking romantic escapism. You know, Twilight is so bad and so trashy you sort of feel sorry for it.<br/><br/>That's how bad relationships start."
"trixie-k-88","1","8","11","1 March 2012"," An awful movie badly adapted from a poorly written book
","It would take weeks to sum up how bad not only this film is, but all the Twilight movies and Twilight books. This cultural phenomena of poorly written, poorly acted popularity is nothing short of maddening. But, let's just take a look at this film on its own.<br/><br/>Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is a teenage girl who is moving from Arizona to Forks, Washington. She is moving to live with her father because her mother and new husband are moving to Florida and she wants them to have a chance to ""be alone"". (This is our first introduction to the ridiculousness of the character/series. WHAT teenage girl would not only be OK with uprooting her life, but offer to move in with a father she had almost no relationship with?). When she arrives in Forks, it's clear that Bella has an awkward and distant relationship with her father, played just as stiffly by Billy Burke. Bella quickly becomes wildly popular with her unrealistically diverse classmates, who, by their reaction, appear to have never met anyone new. She is also clearly admired by her father's friend's son, Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who lives on an Indian reservation. But Bella has almost no interest in all the boys pining for her affections or girls trying to be her friend. The only person who captures Bella's attention is Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the only young man who seems not only disinterested in her, but seems to dislike her. All the other kids tell Bella that Edward and his adopted siblings are ""weird"" and keep to themselves. Jacob even tells Bella that, according to legend, Edward and his family are the ""cold ones"" enemies to his tribe, the wolf people.<br/><br/>After Edward saves Bella's life by stopping a truck about to hit her with his bare hands, she suspects something even more compelling about him. Oddly enough, no one else notices Edward saved her, and after some internet searches into the mythology of ""cold ones"", Bella discovers Edward is a¬Ö VAMPIRE! She meets with him in the woods and tells him she knows what he is and still wants to be girlfriend. Despite the fact he tries shows her how dangerous, fast, strong, and¬Ösparkly he is and that he avoided her because he desperately wants to drink her blood, the two eventually develop a relationship. Bella meets his family, they play ""vampire baseball"" and end up having to save her from the ""bad"" vampires that actually eat people.<br/><br/>The actors in this movie give a terrible performance. Kristen Stewart is completely devoid of emotion and expression. Robert Pattinson, while a good actor in other films, is so stiff it is difficult to watch. Along with that, he struggles to hide his British accent, and the make-up used for the ""Adonis-like"" Edward Cullen makes the normally handsome Pattison look ugly. Even if the acting was decent the script and lines are PATHETIC. They are groan worthy, but that is probably due to the poor material they had to work with. As for the plot, it is stupid. It is completely unrealistic, even in terms of being a fantasy. The mythology makes no sense and throughout the series, seems to contradict itself just to make the plot work. Bella Swan is boring, bland and so easy to make fun of it's almost silly. Edward is whiny and annoying. He seems nothing like someone who has been alive for a century, as he still acts like a dumb teenage boy. On top of that, the main vampires have nothing vampiric about them. They only drink the blood of animals, never people, they live in a family setting, they can go into the sunlight and sparkle instead of burn, they have no fangs, they don't have sex before marriage, and they are not scary. As for the romance, there is NO reason the two should be together, or have such intense feelings for each other. The only reason Bella pursues and ""loves"" Edward is because she finds him attractive and he seemed disinterested in her. The only reason Edward ""loves"" Bella is because she smells good, and her blood is like his ""own personal heroin"". These are very contrived, lame, and somewhat troubling reasons. I must also add that it is clear there is a message of abstinence, especially with Edward controlling himself to both not have sex with Bella, nor drink her blood. Many parents like this message to teen girls, but the fact that it equates Edward having sex with Bella to him killing her, is nothing short of disturbing. Finally, for such a greatly anticipated movie, this film had horrible special effects. This is surely the worst movie I have ever seen, and possibly the worst ""popular"" movie ever made."

As for the movies (including this one,) there simply exists no excuse. Polish a turd with shoddy ""special effects"" circa-1980, and it's still a turd. ""Bella"" is no more a laudable heroine than were the vapid, wishy-washy airheaded females from early Disney's animated films.

I got stuck in the chair and couldn't squeeze out of it for the life in me. I tried to kill myself by deliberately shoving skittles up my nose and down my throat, but a few weeks earlier I had my friends take a CPR class and were able to help me.

Still now, a few weeks later, I am left with the deep purple bruises left behind. I cannot express my humiliation of walking home from the Odeon wearing the chair, as people took pictures which immediately made their way onto Facebook.

Perhaps if I was a freshman girl in high-school, I could have identified with the main character better, but I'm not, so I was extremely bored and now irritated that I was watching the movie. The first part of this grade is based on it being a bad movie. Horrible effects, sub-par acting, and a yawner of a story.<br/><br/>However, it gets worse. This story involves vampires, but does not follow any of the accepted stereotypes of vampiric lore. If you are familiar with anything written by Bram Stoker or Anne Rice, this movie will seriously make you want to bite someone in the jugular. Possibly even inflict bodily harm on yourself. Count Chockula makes a more convincing vampire than any of the vampires depicted in this film.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This movie is a shining beacon for the demise of modern-day cinema.

Sorry Ms. Stewart, you could use a little Zoloft to help out with that dull attitude you seem to possess in all the movies I have seen you in so far. However, the movie got an extra vote, just because you are cute.<br/><br/>Note of advice to the writer...don't try to rewrite what is already written as common knowledge."

","How can a great story of love, suspense, horror, and, of course, became a mid movie about a couple? Start with a awful casting. Nothing is so far from the book than the casting. Where are the stunning characters? No offense to the good-looking actress and actors, but in the original story (book) the characters where beautiful, stunning, not just ""good looking"". The makeup was so fun, because you can actually see that real vampires have only their face in white (or pale)... the neck are tan. But when I was sure that this movie don't worth it, was during the fight scenes. Where that VAMPIRES? They look the most weak vampires ever. Where are the noises, and the anger? This is just a very romantic attempt to do the wonderful twilight story."

","I didn't expect a true adaptation of the book, but I thought the book read well enough to be an easy translation into a decent screenplay. It is disappointing that the director didn't see that this could have been the next Harry Potter quality of series and instead tried to string together several music videos. If you didn't care at all about the careful building of a very ordinary town that Stephanie Meyer so beautifully crafted, or the key features of the characters in the books, then you might like this movie. The acting was hit or miss, the swirling camera scenes were obnoxious, and anyone who read the book would be horrified to see the compassionate and gentle Carlisle played as a cocky slick haired and insignificant character. The actor who played Victoria fits the description of Esme instead of the wild looking Victoria, but the actors playing Alice, Rosalie, Angela, Mike, Bella, and Edward were more representative of the book. I hope they make more because I liked the story so much, I just hope they will take more care next time to develop the setting and characters next time, even if they feel the need to leave in the swirling music video clips."

","First off, I would like to open that I am an avid reader of the series and have read all four several times.<br/><br/>I saw the movie last night at midnight after anticipating an amazing film. Not only did I think they did a terrible job staying with the book, but even someone who hadn't read them would be bored with this. I understand you cannot put every single detail into the movie, but there was so much time spent on Bella stuttering or climbing trees.<br/><br/>The relationship between Edward and Bella hadn't been developed enough for it to be believable that they truly loved each other. It seems as though they were still tripping over words and being awkward, way too soon for an ""I love you."" As far as casting goes, I liked every member of the cast except Bella. She was absolutely dreadful. Bella was supposed to be shy and awkward, whereas Kristen Stewart just came off as stuck- up. Also, the Cullens' white faces were ridiculously fake- looking. Can't makeup do a better job than that? In short, I am also a huge Harry Potter fan. Not only are their books bigger but they also have a lot more detail. HP does a much better job staying true to the book, and has me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Twilight had me about to fall asleep and more entertained by my cell phone. It was an incredible bore."

","As a fan of the books, the magic that occurs between the two characters is what I found most alluring about the story. I thought the biggest let down of the film was that it lacked the build up of Edward and Bella's relationship. Perhaps if more lines and scenes were taken from Stephenie Meyer's book, the chemistry would have remained.<br/><br/>Edward and Bella do have a spark on screen, but the consuming lust for each other is not conveyed as well as the novel portrays it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some scenes with the Cullen family seemed over-acted and awkward.<br/><br/>I wanted to love the movie as much as many of the other fans, but for me, it fell a little short."

","I had read the Twilight series long before it hit number one in the book stores, I wont lie, I thought the book was alright, over exaggerated and clich√©, but then it really hit me, Twilight is in actual fact a cheap rip off of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, those of you who have read her vampire chronicles will know what I'm talking about. But anyhow, that's another story, this is about the movie isn't it? Well, well, well, to sum it all.. my user name is rather appropriate for this review considering I nearly DID have a nervous breakdown watching the film. The acting was dreadful, Isabella Swan AKA Bella was mono-toned throughout the entire film, and to top that off Edward looked seriously constipated. Throughout the film I thought it impossible to stare at each and everything as much as they did, but once again twilight proved me wrong, you CAN stare at things for an entire movie! Joy to the world.. not. The movie itself was a bore, little happened beside the staring of course. OH! And might I add the effects were dreadful, the crappy blowing of Bella's hair as she walked in, her eyes meeting the constipated vampires, instant love. <br/><br/>Horrible, dreadful, boring. I would love to continue, but I wont, I'm getting bored just thinking about the bore that is Twilight."
"kaicomm","2","14","22","25 November 2008"," Awful director+Awful script=Awful movie
","I read the first 3 books of the Twilight series and the movie is true to the novel.<br/><br/>I think that's what made it so bad. In the book, the character Bella is pathetic & suicidal, and Edward's obsessive and controlling. While you can ignore those traits in the book, seeing them come to life on screen is scary. I don't think that the author realizes that Bella is in an abusive relationship and neither does the majority of her teen fan base.<br/><br/>It looks like the director had mental images of the scenes she wanted to capture when she read the script, but didn't think through how the scenes would make sense within the film. The soundtrack doesn't fit either. The special effects consisted of sparkle powder, white powder and maybe some wire up in the trees tops to capture the flying/running scenes. The casting isn't great either. The guy that plays the dad is miscast, and so is Jacob. The other characters simply can't act, or weren't allowed to by the director or author.<br/><br/>Watch this movie is you want a good laugh and have $10 to waste."

","This movie was a HUGE letdown! The acting was forced, there is zero chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and unless you've read the book you're going to be lost as to what's actually happening from scene to scene! It was almost as if they rushed making the movie just to make money off of fans running to see it. Instead, they should have taken the time to write a better script, make better CGI, get better makeup artists (you could see Robert's contact lenses and his cheeks were flushed in at least one scene!) and find a director who actually knows what the Pacific Northwest looks like (here's a hint, remove the blue tinting--or did they miss that quote from the book about how GREEN it is!)!

Before going, I was hoping it was going to be one of those ""not to bad, but not great"" type of a film. About 30 minutes into it, I started to look at my clock every 10-20 minutes hoping it would end soon enough. This has got to be one of the worst films of this decade. The fact that this film garnered so much attention still leaves my head scratching. The acting was atrocious. I've seen better acting in an elementary school play. The leads had absolutely no chemistry. All the dialogue seemed forced rather than natural. I kept laughing quitely because of the horrible script and how each actor spoke it. I regret not seeing Changeling while it was playing at the same theatres. It's an all around bad film that should've went straight to DVD or cable television. Save your money and time."
"Vampjezzc","3","19","32","21 November 2008"," Doesn't work as a film, let alone a faithful adaptation of a beloved book
","Of three things I was absolutely certain...first this film works as neither a film or an adapted feature, second the two major flaws lie not so much with the story but with Rob Pattinson and Catherine Hardwick, and three the book is better than this piece of drivel and the viewing public should know that. Had I never read the book, had I not been a so called Twilighter, this film would still be a disappointment, and make absolutely no sense. The director and writer assume that those seeing the movie are intimately familiar with the Twilight series, and thus they put together a fast paced confusing ride that rushes a story that takes time to develop. The editing of the film is horrendous and a better attempt at cutting the film might have made a better film, the close ups of eyes, the long expansive shots of trees and so much more leave dragging moments. Robert Pattinson, although he may be the hottest thing in the film, is really what makes it more of a comedy than a romantic drama. His acting abilities lie in his ridiculous facial expressions and body poses that are more cartoonish than the Darcy-like Edward character is supposed to display. The only believable relationship and acting comes from the Stewart and Burke, the father-daughter relationship is compelling and completely believable. They are truly the only saving graces of the film. The make up, the special effects look more appropriate for an 80's cult film, than a cutting edge vampire story. This film really plays more like a Sparknotes high-school adaptation, with an attempt to focus on the fans' favorite quotes, which perhaps just are not adaptable in a visual context. This film works as a comedy more than a drama, more like a spoof of the beloved series, as much of a fan as I am I was disappointed even going in with the lowest of expectations. Although it seems like a cop out to state that a book is not adaptable for the visual medium, it seems that Twilight was never meant to be put into a real world context perhaps because of the lack of ability in Meyer herself. This doesn't work as a vampire film perhaps because of every audience members preconceived notions as to what a vampire should be, and Meyer has created a new kind of vampire. The ending of the film, which I will not spoil here, is clich√© and hearkens back to the old slasher films of the 80's, treating the audience like a mindless, superficial viewer who has to be fed a to be continued ending. All in all, this is a film one watches to do homework during, or if it happens to be on TV maybe you will watch it, the question is should you? Should you condone such a bastardization of a great book? I will wait to give a yes/no answer until the inevitable second film comes out in two years."

Rob whoever looked constipated throughout the entire movie and was so awkward to watch...The camera kept zooming in then zooming out and moving around...I can't even think of the right thing to say to this.

"biggest_twilight_fan","1","10","15","30 November 2008"," This movie was a let down.
","As a huge fan of the books, I was so excited to see this movie. I was obsessed with the movie before it even came out. I watched every interview, every trailer, every spoiler, etc.<br/><br/>So on November 21st I was just about jumping up and down I was so excited to see this movie. I went straight after school to see it. When it started I almost screamed with excitement.<br/><br/>The first 5 minutes of the movie I liked. It pretty much stayed true to the book, but then things were happening all over the place. After that nothing was the same as the book, which made it confusing for someone who hasn't read the books.<br/><br/>So I was throughly let down because everything was out of order, but on top of that, THE ACTING SUCKED! It was boring and monotonous the whole movie. No emotions were expressed at all. Plus, I didn't see this chemistry that everyone was talking about. Kristen and Robert look like they want to kill each other. I blame the director, Catherine Hardwick.<br/><br/>Another thing that bugs me about this movie is the blue-undertone. I guess it supposed to give the feeling of gloom but it carried on through the whole movie and was quite distracting. <br/><br/>On top of all that it looked like it was trying to be made into an action movie instead of a romance. It didn't even touch on Edward and Bella's love at all, which is supposed to be the deepest love ever known.<br/><br/>One good thing that I can say about the movie is that the baseball scene is PERFECT!! Exactly what I imagined it to be.<br/><br/>So all in all it was a let down. I was mad when I left the theater.<br/><br/>So the next day I went to see it again, and after I knew what to expect, which isn't a lot, it was better, because I wasn't looking for the mistakes that the movie is made up of.<br/><br/>So after the second time I think that if you didn't read the books then you would like this movie, except you would be a little confused because it's not explained well. And if you have read the books then I feel that this movie is a let down.<br/><br/>I hope New Moon will be better than this."

"Horst_In_Translation","8","11","17","15 March 2016"," Like it or not, the relevance cannot be denied
","""Twilight"" is the first film from a series of 5 movies based on the literary works of Stephenie Meyer. I do not want to say this took over from Harry Potter as the big movie franchise as Potter was still running at this point, but it had pretty much the same impact on young people back then. ""Back then"" sounds somewhat strange, but the first film is already almost a decade old, so it is an appropriate description. In order to appreciate this film (and the sequels), it is essential what you expect before actually watching them. If you expect a new ""Godfather"", you will of course be disappointed. But if you expect a fantasy film that is not scared of going over-the-top on many occasions during its 2 hours runtime, then you may have a pretty good watch here like I did.<br/><br/>Let us look at the cast. Kristen Stewart is one of the most talented actors from her generation and was a pretty successful child actress before this film already. Needless to say she was the perfect choice for the character of Bella Swan. She carries the whole franchise tremendously and her talent is absolutely visible. Robert Pattinson made Harry Potter fans fall in love with him and this was certainly the role that gave him a shot at playing Edward Cullen. I do think he is a better actor than he is allowed to show here and despite a couple not-so-good moments overall, he works the part. Thumbs up for him too. Finally, Taylor Lautner: He is clearly the least talented actor from the lead trio I guess. Luckily here, he does not really have that many moments to show us his (lack of) talent, but it becomes painfully visible in the next films when his character has a bigger role, also in Bella's life. The supporting actors, especially Billy Burke who plays Bella's dad, are pretty good too.<br/><br/>Finally, the story: Yes the writer here, i.e. Melissa Rosenberg, who also worked on Dexter, totally makes sure we never forget Edward is the greatest, fastest, most eloquent and most desirable male on the planet in general. And Bella is the new queen of their school that every male wants to be with and go to the prom with. It is a bit cringeworthy sometimes and there are moments of schmaltz, such as the ""maybe I am the bad guy"" quote, but let us always keep in mind for whom this film was made. Young teenage audiences that do not see the ridiculousness of such statements and suck them in, even really love them. Let them have their fun I say, we grown-ups can smile at these parts, but not in a condescending manner, and enjoy those sequences that were better-made. There are more than just a few.<br/><br/>What I liked maybe the most about the film, apart from Stewart's star-making turn, is how nicely clean-structured the film is. The first part is about Bella's new life in her dad's town. Second part is about getting to know Edward (and his family) and fall in love with him. Last part is about a gang of actually evil vampires and how the good vampires fight them in their attempt to protect Bella. It's all a bit predictable, but that is not a problem at all in my opinion, because it is nonetheless fun to watch for the most part. And lets be honest here, the music in this movie, especially the soundtrack is truly outstanding. I recommend ""Twilight"", a really strong beginning to a good franchise. It's tough to decide for me if this first film is the best or one of the final two, but maybe you can make a clearer decision. You really need to check this one out. Highly recommended."
"mysteri-2","4","11","17","24 November 2008"," Stiff acting, missing that special something....
","I wanted to like this movie, I really did. However, having watched it twice I am left feeling disappointed -- Here's my key likes/dislikes:<br/><br/>Things I liked - There was quite a bit of humor. The dialog had plenty of one liners that made the audience laugh. The majority of the actors were cast appropriately. Jacob, Alice, Billy, Jessica, Esme, and Mike were perfectly cast. The interaction between Bella and Charlie was probably the most natural and believable out of the entire film. <br/><br/>Things I disliked - The overall cheap feel of the movie. The ""special effects"" were ridiculous. I've seen episodes of Charmed with better effects...and that's sad to me. The cinematography came across cheesy as well- whirling around the characters, tilted frames, overdone closeups. There was an over abundance of angsty stares accompanied by cheesy music, it didn't serve a purpose for me. I felt that Edward appeared angry the majority of the film and Bella was entirely indifferent. The acting was very wooden and I couldn't find a connection between them. The script was rushed, they didn't build up the relationship between Bella and Edward and I'm sure non-Twilighters found Edward to be a bit creepy! The Cullens were almost non-existent, we didn't really get a feel for any of the characters. I feel that they skipped too many parts that really made Twilight reach people. The Meadow scene was murdered! Rather than being the tender moment that it was in the book, it was very angry. <br/><br/>Overall, I was sincerely disappointed. I accepted that there would be changes and it would not match up with the book (and most changes were OK with me). However, I feel that they missed some of the most key parts that allowed millions to connect with the characters. Here's hoping they work on character development, up the budget, and consider a new director for New Moon."

I got to see it twice tonight and during the first time i will admit i was searching for what was and wasn't in the book but the second time around i just sat back and watched and it was REALLY good. Compareing it to the book is unfair and to go in thinking you are going to see word for word scene for scene of the book exactly how you imagined it in your mind is really stupid in my opinion. Just go in with the mind set that you are just going to see a movie that looked good in the trailers and you should be good. don't compare. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have extremely intense chemistry together and even if you are not Team Edward you can't help but root for them.Each other character although they had small parts were all very good as well and the movie has a sense of humor about it that i really enjoyed. All in all i give it a 9 out of 10."

","I loved the books and was very excited for the release of the movie. But boy was I disappointed. The characters were wooden and I think I have seen better acting in a high school play. The casting director must have slept through the auditions. The only characters that came across as halfway believable were Charlie and Alice. Bella had one look, like she was constipated, I don't think she smiled at all. Edward didn't appear to have any depth. The movie took the exciting parts of the book and smashed them together without any character development. If I hadn't read the books, a number of things would not have made sense as there was no attempt to set them up or connect them. In my party there was a 12 year old girl and even she was not impressed. For anyone thinking about going to this movie, I recommend that you save your money. I would go to the next outing with the Twilight Saga, but only if it had a different director, editor and cast; otherwise it would be a waste of time and money"

Luckily, I didn't because by the end of the movie, you would have thought I was Twilight's biggest fan.<br/><br/>First of all, I thought Robert Pattinson did a commendable job as Edward Cullen. I started reading the book today and as I read Stephanie Beyer's words that introduced his character to the story, I realized this. Sure the real Robert is a bit scruffy in real life, but he groomed up nicely for this role! He had the certain eeriness and mystery of Edward and he SURE look GORGEOUSLY AMAZING! His eyes weren't ""dead"" to me---they enhanced that element of eeriness and mystery, if you ask me. And for the audience---gosh---it was like each and every person in the theater fell in love with him as his eyes glistened on the screen.<br/><br/>I don't believe Kristen Stewart looked ""boring"" or ""unemotional"" in the movie. It was more like a certain vulnerability or naivet√© that she brought to her role, and I thought it worked well.<br/><br/>The two had amazing chemistry in my opinion.<br/><br/>The story moved a bit quickly, but that's about the only complaint I have. Oh yeah...and that Jacob guy...his teeth were SO unrealistically light I almost got blinded. He was also a nice addition to the cast.<br/><br/>I also thought the lighting, which was dark and made everyday seem like there was thunderstorm outside was suitable for the theme of the film. I heard people complain about that.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's what I felt about the film. It was well done and if you're not a Twilight fan...TRUST ME when I say you will be after the movie.

","I've got to admit, I have not read the books but know a lot of people who loved the books but as well as me, hated the film series. Sadly though I have saw the film, personally the film basically put me in excruciating pain. The cinematography was poor and some of the shots could have been done by a 5 year old. The make up was shocking enough that the make up artists should never work on a film again. Even the excitement factor of the plot was weak, with a vampire that is technically not a vampire, not having any conventions of a typical vampire, so for me NOT a vampire. Then you've got Mr Six Pack with his lack of intensity and his effect of creating an on screen boredom. But the main man himself couldn't put together a different emotion he just uses that one look through basically the entire film. Yes, i understand that these sort of films make money and that the pre teen generation love this and idolise the stars. Sadly. Considering this is my generation, i am sad to say we don't have many good stars in the movie industry to look up to. In some of the previous generations, they have had Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis and Katherine Hepburn. I am not saying there none but there aren't many. To be honest I believe that if Bram Stoker knew what vampires were being portrayed as in today's world, he would probably end up going insane and wish he was still dead."

No. No it doesn't.<br/><br/>For one thing, as a person who never falls asleep during films, this was so tediously hard to watch I almost fell asleep during the ""action packed climax"" of the film. The acting is dull as a blank sheet of A4 paper, a myriad of pale, drowsy eyed teenagers not finishing sentences and mumbling their lines. The few good actors this film manages to boast are shoved to one side for more pasty, nauseating ""romance"" between our two leads, Pattinson and Stewart. On the topic of the romance, there is absolutely no chemistry between our leads yet the film wants us so badly to believe that this is some kind of breath taking romance.

","Let's be honest. This film is for teenage girls, who are always looking for their prince with a white horse and everlasting love... I heard about this film before, but i still wanted to give this movie a chance. Genre says this is a drama, fantasy, romance and thriller. I did not see anything except romance but the last ""mirror"" part. Lots of women stuff (dress store, girly talks, feminine personalities), no horror, no fear not anything about usual vampire stuff like blood. Honestly how many times did you see blood in movie? I answer it for you, 1 or 2 times. It has weak, powerless and terrible directing. On the other hand the scenario (plot) should be good for a thriller. A depressive town, rain, dusky lights are perfect for a vampire movie. But where is all vampire stuff? Should not vampires burn/dust at sunlight? Oh look at this: In our movie, our vampires become a shiny expensive ornament. Obviously this is not a vampire, not an action, not a thriller and at last not a good movie. At the last parts of the movie shows us and gives clues about second movie, and it looks like it's going to be a lycan-vampire fight. This should(must) get some attention and then maybe it can pick up the pace and maybe become an ordinary cheap movie. So this movie is just another overrated one. By the way, there are a lot of technical crew failures in movie, camera shaking (as it is a ordinary video for public sharing web pages and looks like recorded with mediocre hand-held device), makeups like chalk powder, poor quality of special effects and much more.<br/><br/>My advice is: Do not watch this movie, do not waste your time with this. Let's hope they can make a good one with second movie..."

","... I vaguely remember what knocked me out... was it the moment Bella Lugoswan first met the deathly pale Edward Cullen? That was a like a half-hour into the movie, after chat chat chat with her divorced parents, and then with her too-average-for-words highschool friends... Edward - smelled her. Heck, I smelled her, everyone in the theater smelled her. ""Oh, wow, he's totally awesome!"" my niece remarked - ah, it was that phrase, ""totally awesome,"" it's meaningless generality shot through me like a venom. I swooned. Flashing lights swirled all about me. I imagined I was watching a vampire movie - the undead stalking in the night, springing on their victims with bared fangs, tearing throats open, letting loose great spouts of blood! Then the vampire slayer burns the mark of the cross in the arm of the Prince of Evil, who springs back howling, crashing through the stained glass window of the ancient castle, plummeting to earth where the vampire slayer hammers the stake home just before the sun's first light at dawn rips the bloodsucker's skin into flakes of putrid, decaying rot - ! Slowly I came out of it, only to realize my nightmare had been in vain, I was still watching ""Twilight."" It was nearly an hour later - and nothing had happened yet! - they were still talking - and talking and talking! The vampire glistened in the sunlight. The vampire used superhuman strength to save the innocent. The vampire was ""beautiful,"" and sensitive, and sweet, and very well-educated (he graduated highschool 20 times!) and he supported all the popular liberal causes. The vampire ate... tofu? And he jumped over boulders in a single bound! The vampire was ""so cool"" in a super-hero kind of way, he was... ""totally awesome."" <br/><br/>GAAAHH! My niece has cursed me! I have entered the ranks of those bored beyond death, bored to the point of - undeath! Yes, we victims of this infection must wander the malls late at night, searching for the one screen in a whole multiplex that might actually be showing - a vampire movie! Because ""Twilight"" sure as heck isn't one!"

"anifanmc","2","6","8","9 March 2009"," Awful film
","The poor quality of this movie really sets a low bar for the film industry as a whole. Unfortunately, thanks to a severe addiction to novels, I had the (dis)pleasure of reading Twilight several months before the film came out, and basically took the book for what it was - a semi-erotic vampire story in which Stephanie Meyer took her own ""romantic"" (I use the word loosely) ideal and put it into words. To further clarify, as if it weren't clear enough from the author herself, the book is her own version of erotic fan-fiction. The plot itself is laughably simple and the romance is creepy, and seems to enjoy creating a vampire lore that makes them look about as fearsome as rabbits.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I decided to give the film a chance. After all, I've seen mediocre books turned into good films - Prince Caspian being my notable favorite. Within ten minutes of the film, I was bored and on the verge of leaving the theater. I decided to get my money's worth and sit it out, which was an unpleasant experience thanks to the fact that I and my brother were surrounded by middle school girls - and I think my brother fell asleep. It was probably the fact that the sun, a vampire's *main* weakness, made Edward's skin ""shimmer and glitter"" and the fact that he had no fangs or attributes of a vampire. It probably didn't even help that the basis behind Edward's attraction to Bella was flimsy to the point of being laughable.<br/><br/>There's so, so many things wrong with this film that even the novel isn't responsible for. The acting is on a level of horrid that I would expect from far less seasoned actors. Pattinson is a pretty above-average actor, and coming into the film industry as a teen heartthrob, it's probably enough for him to be on screen and for girls to ogle at his face, but for most other people his acting was stilted and his lines delivered with the fakery that only someone relying too much on his looks could possibly pull off. There is a reason why less handsome or beautiful actors are usually better at what they do, and it's because they have to make up for their visual deficiencies. He obviously didn't break the pattern. The actress, Kristin Stewart, was slightly better, but it was offset by the fact that she overacted her way and blundered through the film.<br/><br/>The werewolf's role was boring, forgettable, and probably not even worth noticing, as were most of the peripheral characters, like the other vampire gang and the vampire in that gang who Edward battles, whose name I can't be bothered to remember. This film wasn't just a waste of my time, it was a waste of money and I *beg* people not to watch this travesty."
"NotWar","1","6","8","8 March 2009"," Poor.
","I only watched this film to save me reading the book, and to be perfectly honest I wish I hadn't bothered. The only good thing that came out of my watching was that I didn't pay to see it, and there would be no way I'd go to the cinema and pay ¬£6 for this.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty poor, as were the character interactions and characters in general. It seemed to me the only characters who had more emotion to their acting were the non-""vampires"", the parents, as opposed to the main characters - the ""vampires"", the students at the school and especially Bella herself, who played like a plank of wood with serious issues."
"AshCaton","2","6","8","3 February 2009"," Undead Tripe - Stick to Buffy
","What's good about this film: Billy Burke's performance of Bella's Swan's Dad. There are some nice landscape shots. Bella is OK. What's bad about this film: The villains appear to be an assortment of undead retards, they maintain a constant threat level equal to cold porridge throughout the film, occasionally spouting some entirely inconsequential dialogue with pantomime-villain false bravado. Robert Pattinson may be good looking as the not-so-fangy Edward Cullen, but his performance would embarrass a four year old Shepard in a Nativity. He has clearly mastered the ""I'm awfully troubled you know/digestive difficulties are getting me cross"" cold pout, and reverts to this failsafe in almost every scene. His delivery of the line ""The venom"" and his initial reaction to Bella are positively cringey and laughable. Avoid this film if you're not a thirteen-year old girl or have enough brain activity to power a muffin."
"kultmagick","1","6","8","25 January 2009"," I could barely see the movie through all the plot holes.
","This movie was horrible on so many levels. Let's start with just some of my minor gripes. Pacing was bad in some places, not so bad in others. Really though, if a movie ever loses pacing then you're pretty much already lost your audience. They can tell when the movie doesn't seem to flow from moment to moment. The chick that directed this shlockfest (Catherine Hardwicke), is also responsible for other such action packed flicks as the teenage angst driven ""Thirteen"" and ""The Nativity Story"", so you can see how ready she was to take on a vampire flick. Next I hope she does a ninja movie, but where all the ninjas are pretty boys, and they don't actually kill anyone, they just wax poetic to their seventeen year old girlfriend. That's another thing. The chick is seventeen, and the dude is born in 1913. You would think that by that point in an undead creature's unlife, that he would want to date someone a little more mature. If Twilight has anything going for it, watching it with a chick or a gay dude, is sure to get you laid, as long as that chick or gay dude is completely lame. Like this movie. I give this movie one severed hand out of ten."
"jenmacfadyen","1","6","8","18 January 2009"," Boring
","It was rather boring, the acting was terrible and the movie didn't flow right, it seemed like a bunch of previews stuck together. It followed the book well and surprisingly enough I don't think there was one scene where Bella cooked dinner. Some of the effects were laughable along with most other parts of the movie. It is somewhat worth seeing if you read the book, but I would never watch it again. Would recommend if you are a young teenage girl, however if you have good taste in men you will be highly disappointed by the appearance of Edward, who in the book is suppose to be extremely attractive. I'll most likely see the second one, but not in theaters."
"balbindersmith","Null","6","8","2 December 2008"," Nothing Special
","I just saw this movie (dragged by my friend) and wasn't expecting much. I thought the commercials looked pretty stupid and I generally hate any movie where they hype it up on the news and there's dozens of thirteen year old girls with signs screaming about how much they love whoever it is that's in the movie. It was a bit better than I expected but not much. The storyline is pretty stupid and the acting is average at best. I hear this is going to be a series of several movies (based on several books?) and I don't really see it doing that well as a series since the novelty will wear off after this film and this film isn't that good. I won't see another one of these movies anyway."
"nct3186","2","50","99","21 November 2008"," Disappointing.....
","Being a fan of the twilight books, I was very disappointed when I saw it last night. <br/><br/>The acting was horrible to say the least. Kristen Stewart is usually great in her roles, but in this she seemed like she wasn't even trying. The character of Bella bored me to death in this film. Robert Pattinson was probably the worst actor in this film. Robert poorly represented the Edward that millions of people became infatuated with. His acting was stale, but that may be do to his inexperience in front of the camera. In the book, Edward was extremely romantic and to millions of people he was the perfect guy. However, in this film there was really nothing about Edward that made him stick out from the rest of the guys at his high school (besides him being a vampire). The scene were Bella in Edward meet in class was laughable and their relationship seemed very forced. <br/><br/>The Edward/Bella relationship was horribly depicted in this film. I did not feel the connection between them was as strong as it was in the book. Their lust for each other came up fast and for someone who has only seen the movie would probably wonder why they even like each other. I personally feel that the director should have spent more time developing their relationship because when/if they make the second installment, I am going to have a hard time grasping why Bella is so depressed about Edward leaving her. <br/><br/>I would have to say that the biggest flaws in this film was the casting and how choppy the scenes felt. This movie didn't exactly flow and the best word I can use to describe it is.... choppy. Twilight would jump from one scene to another in a way that really distracted me from enjoying the movie (especially in the beginning of the film). <br/><br/>Overall, I was very disappointed in a film I've waited so long to see. I hope that the next installment of the Twilight series has a new screenwriter and a director that takes their time to make a great film. The cast will not change but hopefully for the second film they will get better. <br/><br/>Rating: 1.5/5"

","I may be an older Twilight lover, but I am keen enough on what makes a good movie.

The character portrayals were great, but you don't feel the connection to them like you should or the anticipation to each event that makes the story so magical.<br/><br/>I think that to give this movie the fantasy perspective as well as the love story perspective, it should have been done by the same director/producer as Harry Potter or Narnia.<br/><br/>I don't like paying that much to see a movie that I could have made myself with my home video camera.<br/><br/>If they make another, hopefully they will learn from this."
"Pico_66","6","14","23","7 December 2008"," A lamentable movie - not recommended viewing.
","This film was awful. A non event and I would not recommend watching it. It was little more than a disjointed effort leading nowhere with the acting so poor I had to laugh. The scenes between the protagonists were awkward, unconvincing and lamentable. No one character was fully developed. There was much that was alluded to but never fully explored. How much was the budget? The problem here was directorial not financial. Some movies need polishing up; this one needs polishing off! I watched hoping it would get better - like some poor B movie. What I was left with was mild irritation, like a hangover after drinking bad wine. I can't believe I sat through this. I was so irritated at one point by the acting I almost walked out. I'm sorry this review is scathing but there was little to praise. I had little by way of expectation. I read fleetingly, in the tabloids, that it was a vampire movie. Okay, so it was a film aimed at the teenage market - but honestly, are teenagers, these days, so unsophisticated and banal? I suspect many will vote with their feet. I've heard nothing but praise for the book. I haven't read it. Was it meant to be a romantic movie? If that was the case then it was lost on me. The theme floundered like a damp squid. This was really a wasted opportunity. Give me a Hammer Horror movie any day. Movies starring the likes of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are in a different league. Low budget but with kudos. These actors knew their trade and were proud of it. Not sure which genre I would place ""Twilight"" in, but perhaps the bin would be more appropriate. I remember vividly watching a stellar performance from a stunning Michelle Pfeiffer and the inimitable Jack Nicholson jousting with the irrepressible James Spader in the 1994 movie, ""Wolf"". Now that film was truly a joy to watch. I was moved to tears. The story and suspense had your gripped from the start. It was a roller coaster ride with superlative performances. The film evoked emotion. Memorable? Definitely! I predict that ""Twilight"" (2008), will fade with day break and be a distant memory."

You let us down yet again.<br/><br/>Sitting in that seat in the movie theater, I was more interested, honestly, in what was going on around me than what was happening on the screen.

But overall, Twilight was so yawn-worthy, I walked out of that theatre thinking...<br/><br/>""Thank God I got in free."" <br/><br/>If you think it's worth 2 hours of your life, go on and mosey to see it.

"peggycovault","2","72","148","21 November 2008"," Twilight- Awful, Bad, Horrible
","I was one of the many who went to see Twilight at midnight. What a huge disappointment. After the movie ended I wanted my money back and the two hours of sleep I missed. The movie was disjointed to say the least. It was evident that they did not have a large budget and that good actors were hard to find. If you never read the series and saw the movie you would walk out of the theater confused and asking ""why the hype"". If you did read the series, you walked out disappointed and asking ""what was that?!"" Is that it? Is that what I was waiting months to see! Here's the deal. The beginning of the movie was seriously rushed. They took different parts from the Twilight book and created scenes¬Ö not a movie. It didn't matter where those scenes where in the film as long as it got in. The order of the events as they took place in the book obviously wasn't important to the director. It's like they wanted to cram everything from the book into the movie but didn't care about the films flow from one scene to the next. In truth, there were many scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor. These scenes were just made up and didn't add anything to the story line; not that there was an actual story line. What a mess! This film looks like it was created by a first year student film maker. The acting in this movie was awful. It was more like watching a high school play rather than a motion picture film. I really expected better acting skills from both Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. Actually Robert Pattinson wasn't that bad, but the movie was so bad it transferred to him. Their performance was mediocre at best in some scenes and in others it was down right bad. As for their co-stars, I pray they have other aspiration outside of the world of acting. The background music in this movie sounded like the music you hear on your favorite afternoon soap opera. Listen, I love the Twilight books. True, they are not great literary works, C+ at best, but what made the books so popular was the story itself. It brought you back to a time when you got your first kiss, the first time you fell in love and the feeling that you couldn't breath or your day couldn't start until you saw that one person; the love of your life. The Twilight movie totally failed to capture the essence of the book; the reason fans love the series. It failed to do what the book did, get the audience to relive the feeling of falling in love for the 1st time. If it wasn't for Robert Pattinson's good looks the film would have been unbearable. They need not make another ""film"". And for those who think Twilight is the new Harry Potter. Please! The Twilight movie has nothing on Harry Potter films. Harry Potter films have good writers, a great director, action and a fluid flow of events and coherency. Twilight was lacking in all areas. I plan on rereading the book so I can block out what I saw the movie. The directors and writers ruined this movie and Stephenie Meyer gave this junk her seal of approval. She needs to complete and published Midnight Sun to make for this horrible film."
"alvinvigil","7","63","128","19 November 2008"," Stands on it's own as a love story between a girl and a vampire
","About a year ago I was already reading and hearing about a new film, something called Twilight, which was going to hit in the fall of 2008. Well, the buzz is bigger than ever and the film finally opens this Friday. Gathering from earlier preview screenings, this film is going to be big. Based on the very popular books by Stephanie Meyer (there are 17 million books in print), Twilight is a unique vampire movie about a girl, Bella (Kristen Stewart) who moves in with her estranged father (Billy Burke) in Forks, Washington. Having always been different, she meets an even more mysterious guy, Edward (Robert Pattinson), who at first is disgusted by her (she's human, he is not) but then takes a liking to her. He's unlike any boy she's ever met and finds that Romeo and Juliet connection. Edward's family is unique; they're all vampires but don't feed on human blood, as a matter of fact, they don't eat at all. They live comfortably in a ""green house"" somewhere in the forest. His dad (Peter Facinelli, Jenny Garth's husband) is a doctor at the local hospital and they have gobs of cash (the books reveal how well off they are, but in the film, there's no explanation). A clan of new vampires are passing through and they threaten the little Pacific Northwest town feeding on the small population, but one in the group James (Cam Gigandet), is out to get the young Bella. <br/><br/>This modern day love story is the strangest vampire movie I've ever seen. It's sort of a cross between The Lost Boys and Gossip Girl, which if you think about it, is a pretty enticing combination. I have to admit, having not read any of the books in this four-part series, I didn't know what I was in for. I knew it was about vampire teens in some Washington coastal town and that's about it, but I was intrigued from the start. The young cast look like your every day teen, and the vampire cast are as pale as Casper the Ghost. Some move swiftly, some sprint up trees and some can see into the future, fast-drawing her visuals on paper. It's all quite impressive. The story primarily belongs to Bella and Edward. The teen vampire hasn't aged in 90 years and finally finds someone who isn't afraid of him. Unfortunately for him, she's mortal. She's definitely not afraid of his blood-thirsty needs and he fights off the temptation of human blood. I'd say he's sort of like an addict that keeps fighting his urges. See... I told you, it's unlike any other vampire movie I've seen. Twilight is certainly no Interview With A Vampire (my favorite vampire movie) or Bram Stoker's Dracula (my other favorite) but it certainly stands on it's own as a love story between a girl and a vampire; it's passionate, exciting, intense and the Northwest locations are beautiful, you just want to drive there for a weekend get-away."

We go to the movie to see our favorite books displayed out in front of us to see how our minds and visuals compare. <br/><br/>Bella was suppose to be funny, she was way too bloody serious! Kristen go get some facial expressions, terror is not love and looking insensitive all the time is not what the character Bella is all about! She's so clumsy it's funny, she's sarcastic, you took out ALL of my favorite lines! And their should have been more chemistry between Jacob and Bella, it's like hey look their vamps, haha now you can leave. She's comical, did you even read the book? <br/><br/>Edward, don't' look so constipated all the time. Like jeez you're suppose to be tense, not looking like you had too much carbohydrates and not enough water. Not only that you didn't' portray Edward's genuine gentleman side at all, the loving chivalrous side! And where is that infamous half smile! Honestly i'll make a list for all of your characters! An essay about each and everyone on how readers want them portrayed and what scenes we could do with out.<br/><br/>Alice was awesome, Jasper, very nice! Rosalie, hell down pat! Emmet, please face baseball cap forward, it's annoying. actually don't wear hats, Emmet's not wangster and you look hot without it. Carlisle please cause some more fatherly emotion but good! Esme, you do alright. <br/><br/>One question plagues me though... WHY WEREN""T THEY GIVEN MORE LINES? Like jeez! I understand your need to save time because no one wants to sit through a six hour movie but if it had to be three and a half hours, we'd enjoy it! <br/><br/>Jacob Black, awesome casting!!!! But give him more lines, I saw Tyler Lautner in Sharkboy and Lavagirl, he's a really good actor, ACTUALLY why don't you JUST FOLLOW THE BOOK!! Come on everyone loved Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I read those books and especially in Harry Potter didn't' have any troubles with their movie adaptations, actually i didn't realized when they changed something! OK maybe some chapters were taken out but it didn't ruin the overall point and it was funny loving and mischievous. I loved those books and those movies. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Bella and Edward was lacking. <br/><br/>I actually didn't care to get up and go bathroom in between, i pretty much didn't' care to miss any of it. THIS IS A POPULAR BOOK! You're adaptation sucked major insignificant crap. I mean just look at your movie rating! For a book that beat Harry Potter's final book, I mean best seller's list and it was Eclipse the second last book of the series and it beat out the final book to HARRY POTTER. Couldn't you have taken a little more time on it. And where was Alice and Jasper and Rosalie and Emmet at the end in the prom scene? <br/><br/>I honestly do not care if you continue on with the movies, actually I'd prefer it if you didn't. You have ruined my vision of it, you're killing your fan base. Unless you guys give the next one some extra spark and actually start listening to your fans, you can forget about a wide fan base. I absolutely hated the movie. I felt sorry for those who didn't read the books because they had NO CLUE what was going on it was so choppy!!! I couldn't even tell when the next day started, all of a sudden, Edward ""I would like you to meet my family"" next two minutes, ""wow you have a really nice house..."" um... hello did she sleep? DID I FALL ASLEEP? I think i missed something, oh no wait, you did. It's called nightfall. Where was the talk about twilight? How it is the beginning and ending of a day...? Or about her talking in her sleep. He looked like a weird serial killer stalking her in her sleep. WHERE WERE THE FUNNY PARTS! I had more fun and made my friends laugh by making my own commentary during the film, i even made people i didn't know who sat in front of me in the theater burst out laughing from my commentary then your boring movie did.<br/><br/>As readers we expect the book to be taken seriously, and adapted to screen, NOT BASED, ADAPTED!!!!!! I've taken Communication Production Tech class in my high school writing my own scripts, so I know script writing agony, i'm also writing my own book. So if i was to ever sign off my book to make it a screen version I'd make darn sure it took more than a few SLOPPY months to make, with a CAST WHO READ THE BOOK FIRST AND RESEARCHED THEIR CHARACTER! Honestly, can you seriously give me an answer about how many cast members actually, i mean truly read all the books? I'm sure hardly any of them did.<br/><br/>This by far is the biggest disappointment I have seen in years and I'm only eighteen.<br/><br/>ADAPTION IS NOT THE SAME AS BASED ON!!! PEOPLE HONESTLY! Anyone who says they loved the movie did not care much for the characters or shares the same love as Stephenie Meyer does for her books. This was rushed, unorganized, ill plan, deceitful, and horrid.<br/><br/>You're lacking the spunk, zest, fire, passion, integrity, and the complete ethics of what made the TWILIGHT SERIES!"

","I am a fan of the book series, but this movie left me cold and hollow; kind of like Harry Potter 1 when the first movie opened. Like Harry Potter 1, the movie tries to do justice to the book by remaining very faithful to the actions and dialogue, but when all is said and done, there's none of that eerie, magical feeling behind it. Hopefully if this film leads to a sequel, the sequel will be a better overall experience. Kirsten Stewart is perfect but the rest of the cast, even Robert Pattinson, is overly melodramatic. I must say that the effects and make-up are kind of weak, also, ESPECIALLY for 2008! Sometimes the fight sequences seemed straight out of the last decade. Well, I suppose I'm going to get hate-mail from all of the die-hards now, but here it is anyway: My opinion- Meh."

","I gotta say I literally became so enthralled in the books that i sat in my bed for an entire weekend reading, only taking a break to eat or go the bathroom. so when the movie finally came out i was beyond excited. well after the movie i left very disappointed. I feel like the cast was excellent and what they had to perform wasn't at all good.People have been knocking the cast who i think are all great actors. They only perform what they are given and i don't think what they were given was at all good. I feel like they added unnecessary parts to the movie and kept out things that would have been more important for the viewers to know for the future movies. The Cullen family should have been more important in the movie. They only got a couple of minutes in the movie. The whole James clan killing people completely not needed. I think the director spent more time on the scenery than the love story it is suppose to be.I don't think the director got across the urgency and terror of Bella having to leave, didn't quite capture the love Bella and Edward actually have or the importance of the family and how they came to be. The director opted to add things that weren't important like all the scenery shots to cut things like the telling of the families' past. All in all I was picturing the book being told on screen knowing that there would be things taken out for time and need but i didn't imagine they would do such a bad job. I compare it to watching the Davinci Code or happy potter after number 2. The books were great and the movies sucked. Im starting to feel like there are just some books you cant recreate on the big screen and i think twilight is going to be one of them."

I am not so in love with the series that I was going to be angry when the movie strayed from the books, but I found no REAL errors. The one thing that bothered me was that Edward wore a t-shirt to school and was sitting right in the window on a BRIGHT overcast day. This would never happen. Also, Edward's car is a Volvo hatchback... which it shouldn't be. Another thing that seemed odd to me was that Bella has no real reaction to Edward being a vampire.<br/><br/>Anyways... I felt that Catherine Hardwicke added a certain humor to the film- the audience laughed out loud very often. I was pleasantly surprised with Kristen Stewart- I was expecting to be completely disappointed by her portrayal of Bella. I felt that all of the Cullens were cast very well. I especially enjoyed Robert Pattinson (of course) and Esme. I also felt the cinematography captured the beauty of the Pacific Northwest very well (it is where I grew up and live currently).<br/><br/>The one complaint I have about the film is that Edward and Bella seem to RUSH into a relationship. There is no build up to it. I felt that if a person had not read the books they would not understand how all of the sudden these two young people are so completely in love. The beginning of the movie also seems pretty choppy but it's nothing too serious. I also found myself laughing out loud when Jacob explains the legend to Bella and the movie cuts back to the members of the tribe confronting the Cullens in the forest decades earlier. It was hilarious and I'm sure it wasn't meant to be.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the baseball scene as well as the scene in which Edward sneaks into Bella's room(!). The thing about the movie that bothered me the most was the soundtrack. The lullaby was nothing special (they really had an opportunity to make the song beautiful) and the emo/indie music all throughout the movie made everything seem TOO serious at certain points and NOT serious enough at others. The music (for me at least) distracted me instead of enhanced the experience.<br/><br/>Overall, however, I really enjoyed and loved the movie. I liked that there were parts you could laugh at. Edward and Bella also had excellent chemistry and Robert Pattinson did an amazing job of giving Edward that ""outsider"" quality. I think the movie was very entertaining and also set up very well for New Moon."
"blu75","2","7","10","15 March 2014"," Cringeworthy. I don't need to say anymore, except for this.
","OK, so this movie is about a teenage girl named Bella Swan who moves to Washington to live with her dad. While in school, she meets a boy named Edward Cullen who she later finds out is a vampire, and they soon fall in love with each other. Don't let the interesting plot fool you.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart (Bella) can't act in a drama for her life - she just can't. The main acting she does in this movie involves shrugging, staring awkwardly, and blinking; yes, blinking. She... just...never...stops!<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson (Edward) is almost just as bad. Even though his character is already whiny and melodramatic, he only makes it worse.<br/><br/>It's not just those two-almost all of the main acting is horrible! The terrible acting really reflects the bad direction, the special effects and stunts are shoddy, and the dialogue-oh, the dialogue! It will only make you laugh, like in one scene where Edward is about to climb a tree with Bella on his back, and says to her ""you better hang on spider monkey"". <br/><br/>Try watching this movie for twenty minutes without getting annoyed-just try. There are just so many parts that make you want to cringe and look away, waiting for it to be over. Bottom line: Twilight is an unintentionally funny bad attempt of a movie with an otherwise interesting premise. <br/><br/>Rating: 2.0/10"
"Theraxorterminate","1","7","10","23 January 2014"," The problem with ""Twilight"" and it's franchise is because it's boring and unoriginal.
","NOTE: My review does not contain any kinds of trolling thoughts but I'm still being honest and try to explain the flaws of this franchise.<br/><br/>I do remember the time when everyone was talking about this franchise and telling how awesome it is, but also hearing a lot of hatred to it at the same time. After seeing the trailer I thought the premise of it looked pretty lame but I gave it a chance when I didn't have anything else to do and wanted to take a closer look of it's creation.<br/><br/>So how was it? Well to be frankly it wasn't that good. Not even ""so bad it's good"" it really was that bad. The look of the movie is incredibly dull and the tone was not interesting at all. The story is just so unoriginal and it makes the vampire monsters look bad if you look how the author Stephenie Meyer did. The story feels like the author took the liberties to make the vampires (in her vision) look more immortal by turning them into this sort of human-diamond when they are in the sun and don't die? OK? I know it sounds pretty messed up but it really is. Not only is that one of the problems but the dialog is also very cheesy, unoriginal and poorly executed.<br/><br/>The characters are so boring and dull you really can't relate to them not to mention that some of them are ridiculous. The main girl Bella looks like she can't decide if she wants to be with the vampire Edward after learning to know him. That's one of the biggest flaws of this franchise, it looks like the characters seriously can't decide what they want! The romance is also very cheesy if not dull. I was actually starting to fall asleep when I got to see their love scenes because they wan't it to be passionate but manage to be dull than expected.<br/><br/>The acting isn't really that good or anything spectacular either. I really can't understand how this franchise has to be so dull. And I still think it is one of the most boring movies I've seen in my life.<br/><br/>Is it recommended? If your'e looking for an entertaining movie, please don't pick this. And yes it's true that it won the MTV Movie Awards for Best Movie, but it only won because the judges (have also admitted that they) wanted to protect the creation of it and it's fans. And I know that MTV Movie Awards is supposed to be meant for entertainment and pick the movie that certainly is entertaining. But I'm afraid that they made the missteps when giving the awards for one of the most boring franchise of all time."
"Harple44","1","7","10","9 January 2014"," Why is this successful?
","It kills me that this movie and this series is so successful when there are dozens upon dozens of great movies out there that have only seen a fraction of this success. Catherine Hardwick is a terrible director. Her movies come across wooden, amateurish, ill lit, and quite frankly, childish. <br/><br/>Just look at Twilight and that awful Red Riding Hood movie. It's incredible that she still has a career. <br/><br/>Kristen Stewart had promise early on in her career. I enjoyed her in Speak and thought she would one day make an incredible character actress. This movie made me hate her. <br/><br/>And that $%#!&*#$ wig they made Taylor Lautner wear. Seriously?! Who the hell looked at that and said, ""Yeah, looks great"". It's terrible! The whole damned movie is terrible. The books are terrible. And this drivel, while popular with 14 year old teeny boppers and 40 year old attention starved women alike, is just that.. DRIVEL. Thank you for helping dumb down America. Jesus $#!&!^*#$ Christ."
"paul-888-783284","1","7","10","7 January 2014"," Awful, awful, awful
","Like the book, it's a terrible excuse for storytelling. Don't waste your time with this wish-fulfillment, Mary Sue melodrama unless you truly wish to lower the bar to all-new depths.<br/><br/>This is honestly the only movie so far that I've fallen asleep too, meaning that, as far as overall entertainment goes, you'll be better off putting your money on ""Glen or Glenda?"", ""Battlefield Earth"" or ""Freddie got Fingered"".<br/><br/>The truly tragic thing is that this summary actually puts it marginally ahead of the book itself. Don't bother with this film unless you have a death wish you want to act upon shortly."
"laurasxoxo","1","7","10","21 August 2013"," Shockingly bad!!
","This is seriously without a doubt one of the worst movies, if not the worst I have ever seen. Yes like most other people I have read the books.. But even I hadn't, I still would of thought it was absolute garbage. Where do I start? The acting is just atrocious!! From the whole cast.. Just woeful, I cringed watching pretty much every scene. The special effects and the corny lines, ugh!! Kristen stewart is such a wooden actress and robert pattinson's attempt to be ""sexy"" was laughable as the whole movie he just looks constipated. I actually found myself bursting out laughing for a lot of the movie at the ridiculousness of it all. I don't want to write anymore as it annoys me that I wasted 2 hours of my life on this complete drivel!"
"cristina-gloria-lopez","1","7","10","21 April 2013"," Was able to watch only watch 30 minutes of it, so I apologize.
","You will hardly ever meet a biggest fan of vampires. From 1920's Nosferatu to True Blood, if there are long scary fangs I never say no.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is, there are no long scary fangs anywhere. ""Vampires"" not only walk happily under the sun and go to the beach but attend to high school too: Why in heavens do they go to high school? the are like a hundred years old. Perhaps they do it because they look young and they want nobody to notice them? well, in fact they behave in a really bizarre way and are the main subject of everybody's gossips over the place. Oh wait, if it's really sunny, they don't go to class. That does not happen much because the town seems to be in a perpetual Siberian Winter. When Bella gets into the classroom for the first time tho, her long mane is hit by a fan, like in a shampoo commercial. The town is covered of snow but they have this fan on just because. Details like this happen each two minutes, taking you out of the stupid story even more, if such thing is possible.<br/><br/>I'd like to offer now a first conversation between the two main characters: <br/><br/>-So are you enjoying the rain? -What? You're asking me about the weather? -Yeah, I...I guess I am. -Well, I don't really like the rain. Any cold, wet thing, I don't really...<br/><br/>Parts like these make you feel so embarrassed for, I don't know, the actors, the script writers, the poor humans who actually worship this movie, that it is almost like seeing your grandmother in her underwear.<br/><br/>Edward character is not a vampire it is some sort of bipolar fashion victim emu teen and Bella character is obviously trying to figure out who's farted all the time. The movie is so slow that you only wish Blade came around and fixed the whole situation with an XXL sharp sword."
"PommeraieVasundhara","1","7","10","20 December 2011"," Absurd, pre-pubescent, sloppy and badly made.
","I only watched TWILIGHT because it was lent to me by a wonderful friend...alas, whose intelligent mind has been liquefied by this pigs garbage. It fails on every level imaginable. A book constructed for young girls (who have yet to understand that true relationships are not as sugar-coated or romantic as the one that features in the story) is turned into a bald, oozing, one-dimensional script in 6 WEEKS. Out of that effortless pile of starry-eyed, pouting slush is produced what must be the worst film of the 21st century. It tells us nothing about life, about reaching out to another, about sympathy, empathy and desire...it can't even successfully entertain because it's so slow-paced and uneventful (as it has to be, seeing as the one interesting thing about the film is it's cinematography).<br/><br/>No wonder feminist film critics have called the TWILIGHT franchise insulting. Bella Swan is a drip of a woman. She let's the men in her life walk all over for her, backwards and forwards and then backwards again. Her obsessive creep of a boyfriend promises that he will protect her, only because he equates her with heroin and cannot tolerate the idea of having to share her. He separates her from her friends and family, only to take her to the worst realms of physical and mental pain a teenage girl can endure. Does Bella protest? No. What an absolute dope. Watching Kirsten Stewart blink and gasp and mutter her way through this already exasperating excuse of a story made me want to tear my own head off-first of all because I've seen better acting coming from college students, and second of all because her personality and behaviour are maddening.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson can only be called attractive by youngsters who have a very insipid and unrealistic idea of what men are like (I do not say so as a sweeping generalisation). His wide eyes, flat nose, aquatic pout, Tsunami-quiff and shuddering monotone made me yell at the screen ""HOW can ANYBODY-teenager or no-find this man attractive or sexy?!!"". As for his character...can one even be said to exist? Tormented romantic he is not. Obsessive stalker he certainly is. And this is what kids these days are being made to feel is desirable? Well, let them have him I say...so long as they save all the charismatic and interesting men for me! And you won't find any of them in TWILIGHT, that's for sure.<br/><br/>The script is full of holes. No character is developed or communicated beyond fluttering eyelashes, moist lower lips and monotonous delivery. The absurdity of the plot is, in fact, the one thing about this film that grows and grows and grows. I especially loved the bit where teenage Bella decides Edward is a vampire after googling him and stumbling across some rubbish home-made Geocities webpages. You can't always rely on the authenticity of the internet. Maybe I'll google ""strawberry-pink cyclops giraffes living on the moon"" and discover that's real as well.<br/><br/>All I can say is TWILIGHT is a ridiculous fantasy that can only make sense to teenagers-who believe they are the centre of the universe as it is. Vampires and werewolves have been culturally dumped, reduced to the stuff of fairy tales, due to trash like this. Don't put yourself through it unless, like me, you enjoy seeing just how bad some films are. 0/10"
"amadeusw-1","1","7","10","7 January 2009"," They call this acting?
","This is one of the worst acted movies I have ever seen. I have no problems with movies being retranslated from book form. Retranslations are not supposed to follow the story line exactly. They should be in the spirit of the book. Sometimes they work, sometimes not. That wasn't the only problem with this movie. The acting itself is disastrous. These are supposed to be professional actors, right? There are children who do way better jobs than this. Even the special effects don't make up for the terrible, terrible acting (and even they left a lot to be desired). Don't pay to see this movie. If you can view it for free, do so. Better yet, find someone to pay you to see it. You'll still be disappointed. It doesn't matter if you read the books or not. That will not change the fact that this is still the worst acted movie in history."

It looked like they might have actually made a movie that was better than the book. Sadly enough, it was. And that's a difficult prospect to grasp, because the movie was terrible.<br/><br/>I can't believe people actually enjoyed watching this. Just as it was in the book, the characters were bland and shallow. The acting was mediocre at best. And the writing... Well, the writers did pretty well considering the material they had to work with.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time or money on this movie unless you are interested in reading the book.

PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE FILM TOOK PLACE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!!!! Apparently now they just glow and show their ""true form"" Really? What's next, werewolves will start drinking liquid silver for breakfast? Frankenstein becomes a fire twirler? Might as well, the rules of movie monsters apparently do not apply anymore. When the main vampire (I didn't care enough to catch his name) said ""We consider ourselves vegetarians"", that was all I could take. Everyone involved with this film should have stakes shoved through their hearts for conspiring to create this garbage. Anybody who likes vampires should agree with me.

"vavoomm","1","8","12","1 January 2009"," Am I Missing A Joke?
","I'm beginning to think that the majority of teenage girls are attracted to sappy story lines, idealistic lifestyles, and fantasy lovers. Bella Swan is an average looking girl who moves to Forks and meets Edward Cullen, absolutely the perfect male. The books couldn't go one sentence without describing how pretty this boy is, let alone a paragraph without mentioning that Bella is liked by about four boys at once and still claims to be an average looking teenager. The movies, at least, have got this right. Kristen Stewart is strikingly homely and, along with Robert Pattinson, a very attractive young actor, the two make the ideal couple. How quaint.<br/><br/>So, this dream-guy, he mets Bella Swan (Translated to meaning 'beautiful', 'graceful'. COMPLETELY average, right?) and the two are instantly in love. The movie displays this quick affection in what seems to be a matter of days. Besides the clich√É¬© plot, the Romeo and Juilet story line, and having to deal with Stephanie Meyer calling herself the modern day Shakespeare, it's the bad acting you have to put up with. This is mainly due to Kristen Stewart's horrible ability, not Pattinson's. She spends most of the film making a face as if she's sucked a lemon dry, and talks in the deepest voice ever heard. Why is this girl an actor? <br/><br/>So, it didn't help that I think the books are a slap in the face to literature. It doesn't help that I couldn't stand in a room with Stephanie Meyer or Kristen Stewart. It also doesn't help that I prefer good writing, a good plot, and good actors. But, if you're going to go see Twilight, bring your iPod."

"Kiss_is_alive_IV","3","12","20","21 November 2008"," Not very good by any stretch of the imagination
","I haven't read any of the books, so all i knew going in was that it was a romance that involved vampires. What I got was a facefull of crap actors and absolutely TERRIBLE special effects. The whole forbidden love thing has potential as a story, but it gets it's fudge thoroughly packed by the script, which i must say elevates missing the mark to an art form. The writer apparently wants us to just take his word for it when he says that what's-his-name and who's-her-face are in love instead of writing in any actual character development. All of the emotional love scenes in the movie equate to blank stares and heavy breathing.<br/><br/>The nature of this romance seems to take a page out of the book of Romeo and Juliet in that two people can fall in love for sake of plot convenience without getting to know each other first. I mean come on! he's in love with her because she smells good and she's in love with him for........... actually we never find this out because it seems like the writer wrote a complete and logical plot and then blasted holes in it with a 12 guage shotgun.<br/><br/>There were a couple of parts where what's-her-face's voice offered up a couple lines of poetic (yet often irrelevant) diologue and these we're actually quite well written. So it seems to me like the novels are actually pretty good even though they seem to be following in the same cashgrabby vein as harry potter and Darren shan only with the target demographic tweaked slightly.<br/><br/>I'm gonna call this movie like i see it. A cashgrab. crap actors (you're not fooling anyone with that accent Robert), absolutely (and i cannot overstate this) ATROCIOUS special effects, plot holes up the rear and a bad case of headache caused by disorienting camera angles (the epic rotating lord of the rings camera isn't the be all end all of directing guys... come on... don't distract from your crappy movie by showing off the scenery). Honestly there was one part in particular where the two ""lovers"" we're standing in the woods, just standing there, and they did the epic rotating lord of the rings camera angle around them for about 30 seconds... the logic here seems to be that spinning cameras will keep the audience busy so that they won't notice the hundreds of unnecessary silent moments.<br/><br/>One thing i found really annoying was that in EVERY SINGLE SCENE the main character with the pointy teeth and an external genitalia showed off his vampire powers at least twenty times. Seriously. WE DON'T NEED TO BE REMINDED EVERY TWELVE SECONDS THAT HES A VAMPIRE! There was one scene where the male protagonist's car drove up with the female protagonist in the passenger seat. Whats-his-name got out of the car and insisted on vampire running 3 feet to the other side of the car to open his girlfriend's door. WE GET IT! HE'S FAST! I think the director overestimates his special effects budget judging by the amount of redundant leaping and running the vampires do.<br/><br/>Oh and one more thing... There is no conflict in this movie save for a ten minute period between a baseball game and the end. There's a whole thing about whats-his-name not being able to resist killing what's-her-name but it never feels like a genuine threat because the vampires in this movie are officially the lamest incarnation of vampires in fiction ever. I thought the ones in Darren shan were bad, but seriously... Sparkles? come on. They seem more concerned with having incestuous relationships and playing baseball than about maiming something, torturing it and the exsanguinating it like all the manly vampires over in Underworld or Dusk Till Dawn.<br/><br/>All in all the story is kind of interesting but it gets a massive axe in the chest from the crap writing and the terrible acting. check it out if you're a squealing teenage girl who digs the whole thing about lovers sharing a silent moment staring into each other's eyes and holding each other close without having any good reason to love each other at all."

It was actually awkward for me to sit there and watch them on screen. The action was weak and the special effects were awful. the music didn't really match the mood of the scenes either. I also found myself laughing at romantic and even sad parts of the movie because the acting was so bad. In the end, this movie will only do well because the thousands of brainwashed moms and teeny bopper girls will think it's the best movie ever. I gave it a chance and in the end it was a let down.

","I can't begin to tell you why I love the Twilight Saga Series so much. Because it appeals to a younger genre, it took me a while to get interested. But, once I did - I was hooked almost immediately. I have all the DVDs and almost all the Sound Tracks and Scores. Carter Burwell is amazing! Anyhow, having lived in Seattle for nearly 9 years probably swayed me just a bit. I can't say there is tremendous acting, but there is enough here and there that you start to form a ""relationship"" with the characters. I am probably an oddball, but I like Kristen Stewart, and have watched her in several films. I kind of wish they had cast her in Hunger Games, but that's just me. I have watched all 5 Twilight's now probably close to 100 times, and each time I try to find something to hate about it so that I'll stop this infatuation, but I just cannot. Call me old-fashioned, but there is just something about a good love story that gets me every time, and for the story to include a gawky, awkward little girl falling in love with a suave and gorgeous vampire - well, you got me! You can have the werewolves, just don;t find Taylor Lautner all that hot."
"clshrum89","10","11","18","3 May 2009"," Twilight
","The movie Twilight is a love story about Isabella Swan and Edward Cullen. Bella moves to Forks, Washington to live with her dad after her mom moves to Jacksonville, Florida. Once Bella is in Forks she meets Edward Cullen and discovers that he is a vampire along with the rest of his family. She tells him that she is OK with the fact that he is a vampire. While playing baseball with Edward's family one day, the group of bad vampires, notice that Bella is a human and James, the one bad vampire, goes after her and starts to track her. Bella escapes to Phoenix, where she use to live, with Edward's brother Jasper and sister Alice, while the rest of Edward's family tries to distract James and get to him so he won't bother Bella. James gets Bella to come to a dance studio in Phoenix by making her believe he has her mom. Edward has to try and get to Bella in time to save her from Jasper. Once Edward is there, he realizes that James has bit Bella and has to decide whether or not to let her change into a vampire or suck the venom out of her blood. Bella and Edward have to fight throughout the whole movie to make their relationship work and he has to try to not kill her. I think that this movie follows the book very well, represents its genres well, and has a lot of good aspects in the film including the acting, lighting, and music.<br/><br/>The movie Twilight is classified as a thriller and a romance. I think that the movie represents both genres very well. It could be classified as a thriller because there is a lot of action and fast paced scenes within the movie. I think the very beginning quote of the movie lets you know that it is a thriller. At the beginning of the movie Bella says, ""I'd never given much though to how I would die. But dying in place of someone I love, seems like a good way to go. I can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face to face with death."" I think that this shows that it is a thriller because a lot of time thrillers have somebody dying or one of the main characters comes very close to dying. This lets the audience know that Bella is going to come ""face to face with death"" and sets the movie up to be a thriller. Also it fits a thriller because the end of the movie kind of leaves you wondering if Bella is going to turn into a vampire. I think that it fits the genre of romance very well too because the main storyline of the movie is the love story between Bella and Edward. I think when Bella and Edward are in the woods together and Edward says to her ""And so the lion fell in love with the lamb,"" this is when their love story starts and then we get to follow their relationship throughout the whole movie. Also when Bella says in the movie ""About three things I was absolutely positive: First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him-and I didn't know how dominant that part might be-that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him,"" I think this quotes shows that this is not a normal love story, but that she was in love with him and would do anything to be with him. Therefore I think that Twilight fits both the genres thriller and romance because you can clearly see how it is both.<br/><br/>I think there were a few aspects of the movie that could have used a little improvement. I think the director did a good job picking out the most important events from the book to put into the movie and did a good job with putting the movie all together. I think that overall the actors did a good job playing the roles of the characters. I think that the actor and actress who played Bella and Edward could have had a little more chemistry to make the film better and seem like Bella was more caring about the relationship and not look so uninterested all the time. I think that the lighting and colors of the film did a good job a representing the plot. The story took place in Washington where it always rains a lot, so the fact that it was gloomy or darker in most of the scenes was good. Also the fact that there were vampires in the movie made it seem like the scenes should have been darker and gloomier than in just a normal romance movie. In my opinion the music in the film was very good. I think the songs they choose for the film were not your ordinary real happy upbeat song. I think these songs fit the movie though because the movie overall was gloomier and darker and I thought the music and scores fit the movie very well. I also think like that they didn't use ordinary songs because Edward and Bella's relationship wasn't ordinary.<br/><br/>Overall I loved the movie and have watched it over and over again. I think it is a good change from all the normal love stories where there are things stopping the people from being together like somebody else or other repeated scenarios that keep them apart. This also has a lot of action and keeps you on the edge of your seat while watching it unlike most over romances and love stories. I would recommend this to anybody who loves romance stories or just out of the ordinary scenarios. In my opinion I think it is better to read the book before watching the movie because you get a lot more details and now what is going on a little better in the film."

","'Twilight' had potential. Harry Potter proved that successful book to movie adaptations could be done. I mean, as a huge fan of Harry Potter, I was very pleased with at least 3 of the 5 movies.<br/><br/>However, Twilight just fails. I am not that big of a fan of a book, I actually read it just because I wanted to see what the big deal was. I wasn't blown away at all, but it was fine, and I suppose I can figure why every female I know is nuts for it.<br/><br/>But again, the movie fails to do the book any justice. It isn't really a mess up by anyone in particular. Just the overall effort to make it an adequate adaptation seemed to be seriously lacking. It almost felt as if they were rushing to get it made. Some of the lines are just terrible. I never thought the actual writing of the book was that sophisticated, but the screenplay just takes the already corny lines and butchers them that much more.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the book, avoid. If you want to see a movie for the sole purpose of making fun of it, go for it."
"chocolatevibe","6","34","68","22 November 2008"," Not terrible, but terribly hilarious
","I admit, I am not a fan of Twilight. I tried the books, thought they were boring, and forgot about them. I don't hate it, but I can't say I'm a fan. Somehow, though, I ended up going to the midnight showing with a group of friends, all of whom were fanatical Twihards.<br/><br/>This movie was extremely entertaining to me, but for all the wrong reasons. I found myself laughing at the cheesy, often poorly-delivered lines, Rob's stony, creepy expression, which he retained throughout pretty much every scene, and the headache inducing, cheap special effects. I wasn't the only one; there was plenty of nervous, sometimes incredulous laughter from almost everyone there once the screams died down. In several scenes, it seemed almost as if the director was parodying the book, rather than trying to make a serious movie.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, this movie was not terrible. I liked the setting, it was pretty beautiful, and Bella's father's acting seemed quite believable. The plot also sped along a bit faster than the book did, making it less boring to me. However, Bella's actor seemed wooden, and Robert Pattinson seemed awkward and uncomfortable at times. Sure, he's pretty to look at, but he didn't convey emotions very well and dropped lines in a disinterested, bland way. After a while the movie began to get extremely dull and repetitive to the point where I felt like tearing my hair out.<br/><br/>I liked how they fleshed out some of the lesser-known characters and gave them more personalities, and I loved Jacob's actor. The lack of climax was disappointing, and I found myself getting very annoyed with Bella quickly.<br/><br/>Even so, most Twilight fans will probably enjoy it, but people new to the story (especially adults) will probably be confused (my mom was) and left with an empty feeling. I didn't feel as though I was being tortured by watching it, but besides all the unintentionally comedic parts it didn't entertain me that much."
"allisoncone","9","43","89","19 November 2008"," Fantastic for Fans-Critics will be Critical
","Considering all aspects of this film, it's fandom, and birth from a very long, tough to condense book, Catherine Hardewicke, Melissa Rosenberg, Kristen Stewart, and Robert Pattinson worked some serious movie magic. Fans of Stephenie Meyer's series will be, for the most part, thrilled with their interpretation of this vampire love story.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg, with the help of Stephenie Meyer, created what I believe is the best possible script, dialogue, and scenes. Condensing over 500 pages into two hours of screen time while still conveying the major issues that are so important to fans is no easy feat, and she succeeded admirably. I think that any flaws should actually be blamed on the fans themselves, and their insistence of certain key phrases, that, while perfectly played out in the imagination, would sound slightly corny even said by say, Streep and Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>That being said, the actors who portray the main characters, vampire with a heart Edward and every-girl Bella, are explosive. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart played the roles to perfection. Instead of falling into the expected lovey-dovey, stary-eyed version the characters seem to call for, they seem perfectly uncomfortable with the entire situation, and each other. Instead of being like two magnets who are drawn to each other, they are like polar opposites, pushing away from each other. This dynamic gives perfect credibility to their should-be unattainable love affair. After all, they should not feel comfortable with each other; Bella's life hangs in the balance every second she is with Edward. Edward's fear of hurting his ultimate love, and the self-loathing he has for himself are constants in the novel. They prevented this film from becoming a sappy, camp, teen love story, which would have probably appeased critics, and lost 98% of their fans.<br/><br/>While critics will criticize everything from the lack of big-budget stunts to show off the remarkable skills of the vampires, the sometimes cheesy dialogue, and the staring actors for what they will undoubtedly title ""emo"" performances, fans will know better. They will see how the tempestuous emotion and drama of Edward and Bella are perfectly executed by Kristen and Rob, neither over- nor under-done; they will see the impression of vampiric feats that truly no studio could recreate, regardless of the budget. Most importantly, they will see the distilled, concentrated version of the story they love so much, brought to life by an amazing cast and crew.<br/><br/>Bottom line-if you're a fan, enjoy the movie in and of itself, and leave your book comparisons at the theater door. If you're a critic, well...don't be surprised if people ignore your probably plausible jabs at the film's imperfections. The magic of movies is that they affect each person differently, and each person impresses their own vision onto the film. Hardewick and Co. have given us just the right amount of our vision and theirs, turning out a film destined to be talked about by both critics and fans alike for years."

I actually laughed out loud in this film several times and at times where it wasn't supposed to be funny. I'm still laughing at the facial expressions of Jasper. The acting was atrocious..the white make up was horrible..and what was up with all the extreme closeups?? Bad Bad Bad. The good parts of the movie was when no one was talking.

","This is for all, those who did not read the book, and those who apprehend the talent of Kristen Stewart.........<br/><br/>First time when I saw the movie, I had no idea that it is based on some famous book. I saw it as one of my friend asked me to do so. I don't know if the book was better or not, but I swear, I did find the movie perfect. And by the way, how can you compare, from every point, a movie with a book? <br/><br/>The beginning was fantastic. The first half will completely get you on the character and plot. I never saw such a brilliant use of songs in a movie before. The track 'The full moon' by The Black Ghost, which opens the movie will do get you interested about the new journey of the Bella. No parts of the movie will make you feel that anything is shown in extreme. But, as the movie had a very simple story, it could not go critical (perhaps that was a plus point) and ended predictably.<br/><br/>I don't know why I watched this movie many many times.<br/><br/>12/10 in acting! The role of Isabella and Edward played by Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson is priceless.<br/><br/>Isabella Swan is little insecure, clumsy and introvert in nature. She always has complex thing going in her mind. All these things shown by Kristen is so perfect. The acting was so deep that it can get you obsessed with Bella. I think this is the height of acting: to make someone to have a crush and obsession with a character. Kristen, now in 19, has already shown her talent. No other actress have got such stardom in this young age. I think that one day she will be considered as one of the best actress in the history of Hollywood, and I know, that day is not very far."
"arnauteri","1","144","336","21 November 2008"," Disappointment doesn't quite cover how I feel
","The only thing I felt was right about this movie: the actors kind of resembled what the characters should have looked like.<br/><br/>The only performance I enjoyed was Charlie. I personally always thought of Charlie as a more rounded person, but I adjusted to a slimmer version (makes sense seeing as Bella is slim...but then again all Charlie does is fish, watch T.V. and sit at the police station since there's no problems in Forks. Makes me feel like he would have a slow metabolism). I actually believed the words coming out of Charlie's mouth when he said them.<br/><br/>I expected more out of Kristen (Bella). I figured Rob (Edward) would ruin the movie, I came prepared for that. What I did not expect was Steward's inability to complete a sentence (any one else notice how she started and interrupted her lines with a lot of scoffing and stuttering? Note the hospital scene: ""Wh- what? What...uh what are you saying? Like- wh- like what are you even saying? I don't- don't...i don't even know what you're saying"" (Neither do we Kristen) ).<br/><br/>And Rob lived up to my extremely low expectations. He tried too hard. That's an understatement. He tried so hard that I felt the veins in my forehead about to burst. Every scene between him and Steward is awkward. Were they going for awkward? Because that's what it was. The book's charm was truly absent in this movie. Perhaps Meyer's talent and vision is something no one else can try to reproduce on screen. <br/><br/>Alice was mediocre. She's supposed to be more bubbly. And she would have never let Bella go to prom in that blue JC Penny dress with the grandma sweater. And why is Victoria showing up at a high school prom? She's supposed to be licking her wounds and planning her next attack of revenge, not watching Edward and Bella dance!<br/><br/>The rest of the vampires didn't get enough screen time for me to really judge them. Like I said, they looked the part. But so did the leading roles, until they opened their mouths.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the books that I have come to love were portrayed like this. I have waited for months, checking Meyer's website daily for any new clips, interviews...anything! And it came down to me and my not happy b/f shaking our heads sadly when we should have been in complete awe.<br/><br/>The only thin worse than this was watching Hayden Chrisensen play an emotional Anakin...Jedis don't cry, you wuss."

","I've never wanted to walk out of a movie so badly. I think you should give the film a chance to develop fully before forming an opinion. This was certainly not a ""film"" with any substance. The acting was horrible, the script was horrible, the whole thing was rushed and insubstantial. For being such a predicted box office hit, given the already large fan base, the budget must have been dismal. I think you would need to be no older than 10 to enjoy this film, but the kissing scene in Bella's bedroom was too passionate for a kid's movie (Bella's in her panties!?). In the books it takes them a long time to move forward with their physical relationship. The story was clearly written with teens in mind but still enjoyable for adults. The movie was a cringer."

The Film tries to stay true to the book, but it all takes place to fast at an awkward pace. There is almost zero character development and in the end your left asking "" what""? In all fairness most movies don't stay to close to the book so this was to be expected.<br/><br/>Most shocking was the horrible acting and all the unneeded close ups. I felt more like i was watching a Episode of something on BBC rather than a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>The make up and special effects were laughable at best.

","The movie we have been anticipating all year has finally come out! Sadly... it felt rushed and left the viewer sort of unfulfilled. Granted, compared to Eragon in its book vs movie comparison, Twilight did bring much of the book onto the big screen. The actors were... Dull, boring, and monotonous. Stewert, while being in some good movies, just does not get the emotions out. Robert did an excellent job of Edward, but the movie, like the book, focused WAY too much on him. Most of the movie focuses on the two main characters, while this is expected, the others are sort of ""not as involved"". Some of the characters were very dull and you learn so little about anything. Had I not read the book first, I would have been VERY confused with this movie. In some areas, the characters have awkward moments(in fact too many) that left me seeing this movie as a corny and bad impression of some of Twilight's more dramatic moments. All in all, this movie was one of the biggest letdowns, that will only draw in profit from the inflated hype blimp created by the fans. If your a die hard fan, you will be disappointed, otherwise I recommend reading the book, before seeing the movie, otherwise you just won't get half of what is going on."

I get that she doesn't tan, but she does still have a pulse according to the book. (Maybe you should read it. I mean, it is just based on the written version of Twilight.)

"soutexmex","1","31","64","3 December 2008"," Abercrombie & Fitch vampires
","Mind you I was FORCED to see this film, 'Twilight'. I had no desire to see teenage vampires, followed by the American female tween crowd like sports commentators on ESPN. But when I did see this much heralded film, it was worse than I had anticipated.<br/><br/>Anyway, basically, it's a retelling of the Romeo & Juliet story. This time Romeo is a 109-year- old-man lusting after a 17-year-old Juliet. I guess I was the only one offended that some old dude who became a vampire at 17 waits almost a century for his true love. Come on, seriously. This guy waited almost a 100 years to fall in love? Man, and I thought my dating career is a disaster. <br/><br/>But needless to say, I am not the audience this move was made for. I sat in on a weekday matin√©e and there were already enough younger girls skipping school to see this cinematic wreck.<br/><br/>Because I watch so many movies, I thought I would find something redeeming about this movie. The director is a woman who did the courageous movie, '13', which is a scary film for anyone who has a teenage daughter. This blows away 'Lolita' by miles in the power of a young girl's desires, like a young cobra snake, not knowing the power of its venom. With that said, the directing was malleable. <br/><br/>But I thought, this had to be a low budget movie - why? Because most of the scenes take place outside, in the forest. No need to pay extras for those scenes. Additionally, no need to hold back crowds as you film scenes.<br/><br/>But the thing that really got under my skin as a film lover is the lack of development of the screenplay. They spent so much time in the protracted, plodding relationship building between the two leads that I was wondering, where is the main conflict? There it is, in the last 10 compacted minutes of the film. Even the danger seemed manufactured. It was as if the producers thought: you know, how do we end this film? The film is based on a series of four books and this is the first one. Still, they really needed to spend more time on the conflict to make the inevitable sequels better than the initial production.<br/><br/>To compare, contrast it to the another vampire film based on a book, 'Interview With A Vampire', this conflict is too subtle, along with the whole notion of being a vampire. These are vampires as envisioned by Abercrombie & Fitch, afraid to bare fangs, get bloody, destroy. Apparently they have a pact with the Native American Indian werewolves to keep a peace between them. I am not making this up. Everyone is so bloody nice with great table manners that I was saying enough! Someone BE proud to be a vampire and do some damage. <br/><br/>Yes, I was rooting for the bad guys. <br/><br/>I guess to maintain an appropriate rating, no viscera was shown, as any other indication that these vampires were remotely dangerous other. The ""vampire"" family that is the hub of the film are SO damn nice, I was wondering if they weren't modeled after The Munsters 1960s t.v. series. <br/><br/>The father is the local doctor and looks so young, it would make a normal human wonder why such a young guy and wife adopt so many children who are almost the same age in appearance. They could be a traveling Manson brood, clad in J. Crew flannel apparel. And the father is a doctor, requiring him to touch people to examine him. No one ever notices this guy is cold as ice or has no heartbeat of his own?<br/><br/>It would be easy to slam this film but I did find the divorced mother character appealing - why? Not because she was out of the loop as a character but because she was traveling with her husband, a baseball player. Having the daughter live with her father as the mother wandered the country seemed the only original part of this story line.<br/><br/>This movie is for young girls waiting to meet their own ""Edward"", the cool misunderstood rebel obviously based on James Dean, to include the hair. But Edward is 109-years-old. He really needs to get over himself, just like me writing protracted musings about a film not made for me. <br/><br/>Did I tell you I was FORCED against my will to see this movie? Just needed to remind you."

","I bought this book on a whim this summer for my daughter and for my wife. They loved it. My daughter says it's the best book she ever read. So, being pleased that I actually purchased something for the ladies that they liked I decided I'd keep being a hero and surprise them with tickets to this on the opening weekend. '<br/><br/>I'm not their hero anymore.<br/><br/>I got to the theater early as we all wanted to sit together and we were expecting crowds (not as big as we thought), but my son (age 9) and I got seats while my wife and daughter (age 11) got popcorn. I was a little uncomfortable as we sat in the theater before the movie started with the noisiest bunch of women this side of a Beatles' concert. <br/><br/>I was excited, but I was also realistic. This didn't need to be ""Casablanca"" to make me happy. Just give me a 7 star flick. <br/><br/>At some point I started hoping their would be a scene with enough light in it for me to check my watch. At another point my son whispered to me, ""Dad, this is a HORRIBLE movie."" I never knew the fellow to not like anything (other than church). <br/><br/>First of all the two glaringly bad things. The make-up made ""The Munsters"" look subtle. The special effects looked like they were done by a middle school video club. <br/><br/>The plot was very slow and their was no conflict for the first 90 minutes. We got Bella sitting around talking to this unrealistically nice friends (One boy didn't realize he was gay, but maybe that comes up in a later book). Her worst problem seems to be that she has two great parents and every boy in the town wants to take her to the prom. We do have a 4-second action scene. Bella discovers almost nothing for herself. She does go to the book store and check out a book, but then hardly uses it and instead goes on the Internet and finds out that Edward is a vampire. <br/><br/>Still, after that he just tells her everything about being an umpire (uhhhh, no that's a different scene)...vampire. The Vampires, I understand, are supposed to be incredibly good looking, but they're not up to speed in those regards (except for about four of them). <br/><br/>There is an incredibly stupid baseball scene where they actually wear baseball uniforms which just comes across as absurd (and why, if they want to protect Bella so much, would they take her out during a thunderstorm?).<br/><br/>After waiting forever for some conflict to happen, it finally does, and is over in about 5 minutes. <br/><br/>It also seemed that Edward was attracted to Bella because he wanted to eat her worse than other humans. Huh? I mean I really wanted to eat my candy in the theater but I wasn't really attracted to it in that way. <br/><br/>The ending of the movie seemed to just be tacked on. <br/><br/>I was fascinated by the other Vampires (both good and bad), but learned nothing about them, except that one of the ""good"" vampires was grumpy about Edward dating Bella. I was also fascinated with the ""Native Americans,"" but we only got a couple of none-to-subtle hints about what they were. <br/><br/>The thing is, I felt like this movie made the mistake of telling me what was happening instead of showing me what was happening. No matter how good a book is, a movie has to be a movie, and this was mostly just a lot of talking.<br/><br/>My daughter was depressed the rest of the day as she had been so excited to see this. My wife said, she could have taken it being slow, but that the make-up ruined it for her. My son was just ready for some buffalo wings and refused to talk about the movie at all. <br/><br/>Still, the scenery was beautiful when they got in the woods, and this only increased my appetite for a thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail. <br/><br/>All in all, I'll take almost any episode of ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"" over this."

It keeps the same feeling of the story, the general idea that got people excited in the first place.<br/><br/>Only a couple of things annoyed me, the special effects were a bit over the top. A couple of cringes here and there, but apart from that,I really loved this movie, and I look forward to the sequel next year.

I read the books, was not that impressed, so I thought I would give the movie a chance. Believe me, this is coming from a completely unbiased point of view. In my opinion, you can't just rate a movie based on how ""hot"" the actor is or how ""cute"" a relationship is.<br/><br/>Every scene just fell short of what you expect, and left me thinking, ""Oh...I wish they would have done this instead of that..."" The scenes were choppy, and the camera was often at awkward angles. The music often did not match what was on the screen at all. I understand that romances are hard to make as it is, not even mentioning adding the vampire aspect of it. But this movie evoked no emotion whatsoever. Even as Bella lies on a hospital bed hooked up to an IV, you can't help but scoff at her cheesy, scripted lines. Everything from how the actors dress to how they take themselves so seriously is hilarious in an unintended way. Even how the movie is colored is depressing - its like the gray monotone of a bad horror movie. I hope the director learns her lesson and takes more time to make the next Twilight movie worth watching, not just hoping that fans are so blind that they'll like it no matter what.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, if you haven't read the book and aren't obsessed with the series, my suggestion is to wait to rent it and then laugh at how badly it was made. Or flip through some soap operas and you'll get the same effect.

","Why is this one of my favorite movies ? Its certainly not Academy worthy. It isn't the Shawshank Redemption, Terms of Endearment, or the Wizard of Oz. They are on a whole other level, but I think the draw is the uniqueness. There have been many attempts over the years to replicate or do something similar and they just don't cut it. Bella is not the perfect, beautiful main female character that you would normally see in a movie like this. She is quirky and pretty, but she doesn't wear the perfect clothes, makeup, and isn't the most popular girl in school. She has a quirky relationship with both her mother and father who are divorced which also makes the story unique. This movie - and its subsequent series, will always be remembered because it is quite simply, different. Whether you like Kristen Stewart or not, I thought she was the perfect fit for the role of Bella, because she is naturally quirky. <br/><br/>Also, I must mention the other draw for me - the beautiful scenery. Who doesn't love mountains, tree's, and waterfalls ?<br/><br/>I gave it an 8 out of 10 because of course it has its flaws and even at times is just plain ridiculous, but still manages to remain addicting."

But, there is a difference between measuring up and falling frighteningly short.<br/><br/>PROS: The storyline wasn't messed with too much, 1/2 of the main characters were cast well, the scenic shots were beautiful, 30-40 minutes of the movie (from baseball to hospital) were great <br/><br/>CONS: 1/2 of the main characters were badly miscast, over an hour of the movie was very slow, and lacked development in the scenes.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if Rob Pattinson had trouble with an American accent, or if he just couldn't portray the passion (either for love or thirst) for bella appropriately but most of the time he just seemed constipated and a little slow- rather than conflicted and passionate. I was let down because i was expecting more. His acting fell incredibly short and in the end if he couldn't pull off passion he shouldn't have been cast. (yea start booing and hissing at me now....) <br/><br/>I was let down with the casting of Carlisle, Rosalie and Jasper- the biggest problem being that forcing bad peroxide jobs just made them look scary, not at all the beautiful creatures they should have been. The one character that was a home-run for me was Alice. She was spot on for what you would expect- definitely the bright spot for the rather small role she played. I would have liked her friendship with Bella to be developed, but that just seemed par for the course- read on...<br/><br/>But more than bad acting and casting was the lack of character and relationship development. The movie read as a checklist for events in the book, not an evolving and growing love story. Edward and Bella seem to go from not knowing what to make of their encounters to saying they can't live without one another without ever having a progression of their love play out. There's no chance for them to FALL in love, nor for the audience to fall in love with them. <br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: I was left bored, and detached from what should have been the start of a passionate love story."

","What can you say about one of the most ridiculous stories and one of the worst films of all time? I have seen the whole 'saga' (the last one ‚Äì the only watchable one ‚Äì in a movie theatre, the proper way) and due to some outside pressure I have had to sit through it several times, but it hasn't got any better. I admit, I've come to appreciate certain elements, especially after I realised that the story is actually about transgenderism (though it was probably never the author's intention), but the first instalment has remained just as atrocious as before. It's dismal even for a Twilight-movie, and that's saying something.<br/><br/>It's not that I don't like chick films and romance in general. I do. But here, the plot is shallow and contrived, the characters are shallow and illogical (and on top of that, Kristen Stewart's 'performance' is an all-time low), the music is just schlock, the visual effects are bad, and the action sequences are painfully badly directed and edited (unfortunately, I have seen Catherine Hardwicke's Thirteen and Red Riding Hood, as well, which makes her a three-time Razzie-worthy director for me). The whole thing would be just laughable, if it wasn't so unbelievably boring.<br/><br/>There's one saving grace, though. The scene where Edward reads people's minds in the restaurant (though frankly, his talents in this area are not very sophisticated) and senses nothing but utter darkness in Bella's head. Simply hilarious. That scene pretty much sums it all up."

","A seemingly normal but shy teenage girl discovers that vampires exists and falls in love with one only to realize there is more at stake for her affection than she is aware of.<br/><br/>Horribly clich√©d with terrible acting and a dull and senseless script. When one conveys emotion through the same facial expression throughout not only this film, but every single one to follow. This film while hugely popular has its niche audience in young adolescence girls. Much of this film is left to be desired, the effects seem mediocre as does most of the film, undeserved of the attention and mindless praise it gets. A different spin on the vampire mythos that detracts from the true definition of what they are supposed to be, having gone on to spawn several less then impressive sequels, i find that these films have its built in audience and largely is not impressive in its clich√©d story, bad acting, horrible direction and overly cheesy dialog. If your under the age of 17 then this is indeed the film for you. For true lovers of vampire films id suggest a dozen others that not only stay true to the mythos of the vampire but do so in a more professional manner."

","An emo girl caught between her choice of love, Necrophilia or Bestiality. She seems to choose Necrophilia. The plot is completely stupid, the actors have no talent, Edward looked like something that died in the bathtub and then was magically reanimated and continued to look like he spent too long submerged in the water. The idea of vampires is pretty cool but this movie makes them all look like a bunch of losers. Sometimes I wonder why people make movies like this. Is it to invoke a reaction of disgust from people? it could be, they problem enjoy taking the money of they people who had the misfortune of watching movies like this and laugh as they know that those people can never get their money back."

","I'm not the type of person who loves the paranormal romance genre, maybe that's why I didn't like this film.<br/><br/>It all started a few years after Twilight came out. Back in middle school, I kept hearing about this book series called Twilight. I thought to myself: What is Twilight and why's everyone into it?<br/><br/>So a few days later (or so according to memory), I asked my mom to buy a copy of the book, so I could read it and see if it was as good as people said. I took the book home, read a few pages, and was instantly bored from the beginning. I didn't even finish it to this very day from which I post this review.<br/><br/>Sparkling vampires?! Really?! Last time I checked the definition of vampire on Wikipedia, vampires DO NOT SPARKLE. (well maybe in Stephenie Meyers' imagination, sure.)<br/><br/>Sorry. I got a bit carried away with the book. Now let me review this title.<br/><br/>This is what Twilight is about (in a nutshell). Girl moves to Oregon and lives with dad. Girl is a new girl. Girl meets boy. Girl finds out that boy is a vampire, a SPARKLING one. Girl is introduced to sparkling vampire boy's family. And, I don't feel like explaining everything else because Twilight was just too boring for me. (:P)<br/><br/>Character development: I didn't finish the book or movie so I don't care. ???/10<br/><br/>Dialogue: Seemed pretty bland. Still boring. 3/10<br/><br/>Plot: Boring. Just boring. The vampire werewolf thing is just clich√©. 2/10<br/><br/>Characters (in general): Too boring and unlikable. Edward is ugly and not as ""hot"" as people say he is (at least in my opinion). Bella is too dependent on Edward and is therefore a weak main character. 1/10<br/><br/>CG: I thought it was okay in the trailers. Not sure if they used it in the movie or not... (.-.) 5/10<br/><br/>Casting: Again, I didn't care. ??/10<br/><br/>In conclusion, I didn't like this movie. Awful. Poorly written. I'd deliver my thanks to Stephenie Meyer for the ""good"" book she had written that became a movie."

","I finally caved and watched this movie for the first time last night...I'm not a hater, I try to give objective reviews, I'm a male, I'm straight, I love all types of movies including vampire movies. But I'm sorry; this movie was awful. Here's why: - No character development= This is a two-hour film and that's more than enough time for the movie to set up it's characters and make you care about them yet aside from Edward and Bella, everyone else seems like they were only in the movie for four seconds. NOBODY leaves you with the impression that they matter.<br/><br/><ul><li>dry pointless dialogue= it felt like at least 90 minutes of this film were Edward and Bella staring at each other. The only significant dialogue I remember is him saying how he wants to murder her but will fight the urge to do so and somehow that made her fall in love with him. Aside from that it was all ""high school stuff"" pretty much. Which would be fine if it was interesting in any way.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>cardboard cutout characters = As I said earlier, none of the characters get any development, Bella shows up on her first day at her new school and basically gets a whole group of best friends. Yes they established she knew some of them from when she was what, 4? But it was just way too convenient and lazy writing that they all meet her and say ""Hey wanna hang out? I value your opinion on everything even though we just met."" and everyone she bumps into all happen to be in the same clique.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>terrible acting = Absolutely zero chemistry between Edward and Bella...ironic seeing as how they were dating in real life. I know some of the actors in the movie are actually pretty good so I chalk up a lot of that to the dialogue and directing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>incoherent pacing = The three evil vampires, shirtless Channing Tatum stand in, evil chick who was in the movie for 5 seconds and black dread-lock dude. Who go around brutally murdering people. Then black dude shows up at the Cullen's to warn them about Channing Tatum's stand in for no reason at all. Then he just leaves and that's that. So that whole threat lasted about 4 seconds when the Cullens all kill the sh*t out of him. The romance between Edward and Bella...he does all this creepy stuff that literally would cause any woman to file a restraining order makes her fall in love with him, then they play vampire baseball and then bad vampires hiss at them and then disappear.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>no plot = girl moves to a small town, falls in love with creepy guy, then there's the threat of 3 evil vampires that gets solved in 5 minutes. This could have been a 42 minute after school special.</li></ul><br/><br/>You could use the excuse that ""You should read the book to fully understand everything!"". No actually I SHOULDN'T have to read the book to understand a movie. The whole point of film adaptations is to convert the book into a visual narrative that may alter/remove/add things in order to tell the story more cohesively on screen...but to throw a bunch of crap together and say ""Well, people should read the book to like the movie better"" are just lazy and suck at their jobs.<br/><br/>Yes, it is tailor made for teenage girls. However, it's also saying that teenage girls are stupid and will eat this crap up because it's made for them. You can make something for teenagers and still have it be good. Sadly, they know they don't have to put the effort in because teenage girls DO eat this crap up. It's really a sad testament to society these days."

","To read the full review, go to:<br/><br/>http://filmstudiesforyou.blogspot.com/2012/02/chronicle-review.html<br/><br/>Never have I felt so uncomfortable watching a movie before in my life. This made Cop Out (2010) look like it had a chance of giving Chinatown (1974) a run for its money, and I didn't even see Cop Out! If it makes you feel any better, I watched Twilight in a film studies class back in college, so it was not a matter of seeing it just because my hypothetical girlfriend ""made me,"" but more along the lines of seeing it so I could pass. And no, the A was not worth it. The class was called film theory and criticism.<br/><br/>This is where the CRITICISM of ""film theory and criticism"" really starts to spread its wings.<br/><br/>Obviously with any film, in this case, a movie, you need to take notes about how it relates to the subject you are studying. I took notes on Twilight. Not on the thematic material, but more like notes you find on a rough draft. A ROUGH draft. Instead of using them to help myself write a paper, I should have given them to Catherine Hardwicke because nobody else apparently did. My evidence? Twilight is a 5.4 on IMDb.com. Eclipse is a 4.8. Breaking dawn is a 4.7. Given this trend, BD part II will be around a 4.5, which, by the way, was a preview for the film I am supposed to be doing a review about. Why am I using IMDb? Because everyone can vote. Including those who didn't even see the movie. Good job, guys!<br/><br/>I can't remember everything that was wrong with Twilight, and I am not about to watch it again to remember.<br/><br/>Number 1: Anna Kendrick.<br/><br/>In an interview with Anna Kendrick, she vowed to never do a nude scene in a movie. She won't sell out. Fair enough. But if that's the case, then why did she sign on to Twilight? Anne Hathaway got naked in Havoc (2005), and got, quite literally, thrusted into success. I guess selling out is a term we throw around quite loosely. However, I digress. It's a game well played if you can go from starring under Kirsten Stewart to being a supporting actress to George Clooney.<br/><br/>Don't worry, Anna. You are but the shore in my sea of hatred for Twilight.<br/><br/>Number 18: The Truck.<br/><br/>There's always that first several sequences of a movie that makes us believe in the protagonist. It's what's used to get us to root for them. It's those things they have that separate them from everybody else. Trying to keep with this important law of screen writing, Bella's father gives her a truck more beat than a dead hooker in a motel of the Las Vegas outskirts in a Tarantino film. When she gets to school, some jock jokingly says ""Nice truck."" I noticed that the same beat up old truck was just like half of all the other modes of transportation at that high school, so if that was some kind of attempt to make us ""feel"" for Bella, it ran on empty.<br/><br/>Number 37: The Fan.<br/><br/>No, not the Twi-hards. How dare you make a Die Hard pun to describe someone who likes this garbage! You know when a model is at a photo shoot and a fan is there to wave her hair about in a sexual manner? When Bella and Edward first exchange glances, a fan, seen in the background, thrusts Bella's hair about in this same fashion. I have one question. What the hell is a fan doing in a classroom in Forks, WA? If you ever crack that code, run me down and tackle me if you have to. I will understand.<br/><br/>Number 86: Edward's Family.<br/><br/>Why weren't they the least bit reluctant to accept Bella? I mean, they are a vampire family, and they take her in and tell her everything? And not one of the family members is initially opposed to it? Where is the conflict?<br/><br/>Number 112: The baseball.<br/><br/>Edward and his brother leap up for a baseball and they collide in midair. The ball is seen zooming past both of them without any indication of slowing down. When we see Edward and his brother lying on the ground in pain, the ball lands right beside them. While it remains an indisputable fact that the writers of Twilight do not understand chemistry, the editors haven't the slightest clue about the fundamentals of physics.<br/><br/>The verdict.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, Chronicle was pretty cool. I'd watch it If I were you. B+."
"Doylenf","Null","6","9","28 October 2011"," Vampire yarn without much of a payoff at the end...
","Nothing much really happens in TWILIGHT except that the script attempts to tell the touching story of a boy and girl who meet in school, fall in love almost immediately and find that they have a strange attraction for each other that turns them into soul mates.<br/><br/>Even stranger is the fact that the girl (KRISTEN STEWART) is played in rather indifferent fashion by the actress who is supposed to be the girl that turns all the male heads in her direction the moment she appears on the campus. She is neither pretty enough nor charismatic enough to deserve all that ogling in my opinion. But, hey, that's what the script says so we have to accept that no man can resist her. And stranger than that, the boy just happens to be a pale-skinned Vampire.<br/><br/>The boy Edward Cullen (ROBERT PATTINSON) with the pale skin and red lips, turns out to be a member of a Vampire family who develops an overly protective attitude toward the girl, as well as an overwhelming desire to fall in love with her. I suppose this is the sort of thing that set female hearts beating quickly--the sight of a handsome lad setting his eyes on a vulnerable girl who only gradually learns about his true identity. And then, what is she to do?<br/><br/>Catherine Hardwicke has directed this tale of tender love about to blossom between a girl and a Vampire with a keen eye for some glorious woodland scenery and gushing music that gives the young lovers the proper romantic background. Pattinson convincingly plays a Vampire who doesn't want to harm the girl and would rather keep the relationship more distant, but the girl has fallen for him so completely that this becomes an obstacle he cannot overcome. The ending affords little in the way of a resolution.<br/><br/>Easy to see why the tale became a teen favorite when it first appeared, but this was my first exposure to the film which was showing on the FX channel on TV. It's not as bad as some of the comments would have you believe but it stirs up only a mild interest in seeing further films in this series should I come across them while surfing the channels for a watchable movie."

","Yeah. The first part of the second worst thing to happen to the world after Hitler, Twilight is a romance movie of a seventeen year old characterless, gutless and spineless, gooey mass of a girl called Bella Swan (Kirsten Stewart) who falls head over heels in love with a hundred and four year old, glitter-in-the-sunlight vampire (Robert Pattinson) who has occasional homosexual tendencies and also suffers from erectile dysfunction since vampires don't have blood circulating through their body. Are all the normal guys in town dead? No. Is she a necrophiliac? Apparently. And they make out, fight other vampires and it all ends happily ever after, which accidentally is also the best part of the movie since this mega-pile of kangaroo dung finally ends!

I think all the actors did a great job, but it would have been nice to see more of the Cullen family and the ""human"" friends.<br/><br/>I like the look and feel of the movie.

"pyrocitor","4","139","350","7 December 2008"," Vampiric romance lacks real 'bite'
","After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer's literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels. <br/><br/>Few Hollywood productions have the concern of appealing to both the demographics flocking to romances and supernatural action films, and as such, the impression is frequently given of Twilight biting off more than it can chew. This indecision between concentrating on the supernatural or romantic facets of the film leads to one of the more glaring flaws of the picture - the sense of neither being devoted enough focus to truly excel. While the climactic battle is gruesomely effective, for the most part, the film's special effects appear rushed, under-budgeted and just plain sloppy, coasting by on horrendously unconvincing slow motion to represent vampire super-speed and making moments which should have been filled with wonder and awe instead evoke unintentional laughs and groans. However, Meyer's revisionist take on vampire lore is intriguing, and the viewer wishes the film had delved into the technical aspects of immortal vampire lifestyles further - a sequence where protagonist Bella slowly begins to suspect the true identity of the mysterious boy she has found herself involved with is impressively eerie and chilling. Such moments are aided incalculably by the tremendous musical score of Carter Burwell, whose bold mix of brassy Gothic themes and eerie, chilling motifs perfectly compliments the intensity of the film. <br/><br/>However, Twilight's main concern lies in its script, which boasts some particularly gruesome patches of dialogue apart from the general lack of characterisation one has sadly grown to expect from the teen romance genre. Similarly, despite director Catherine Hardwicke appearing to be the perfect candidate to helm such a film (with directorial debut Thirteen demonstrating a keen knowledge of the teenage girl mentality), her handling of the source material is unfortunately shaky.The film repeatedly falls prey to the ""Harry Potter syndrome"", feeling somewhat clunky in its almost robotic adherence to its source material, giving it the sense of jumping awkwardly from plot point to plot point and lacking the necessary cohesion and narrative flow. <br/><br/>But most importantly, for a film revolving around its central romantic attraction and sexual tension, the audience is never really given the chance to FEEL the romance, to be drawn in by the mutual lust and entrapment of the two leads for one another. In an oddly rushed sequence, the budding romance between protagonists Bella and Edward is reduced to a couple of nonchalant sessions of hanging out, mostly demonstrated through montage, after which Bella's (largely unnecessary) narration declares her unequivocal love for Edward. This rather abrupt transition would toe the line of appearing satirical of teenage romance were it not for the fact that the viewer realises the moment is meant to be completely heartfelt. What was likely far more effective in literary form, with the chance to understand Bella's emotions and mental process making the romance far more credible does not translate into film. As such, with this crucial central romance lacking the necessary spark which made the novel such a success, Twilight, for all of its periodic cinematic potential, just feels somewhat unnecessary. <br/><br/>The film's casting is perfectly passable, supplying a sufficient variety of up and coming pristine teenage beauties capable of essaying their character types, yet for a book which was driven by such genuine intensity and passion, one can't help thinking of all the performances as somewhat listless and flat. While Kristen Stewart makes a passable romantic lead as headstrong Bella, she lacks the necessary charismatic spark to truly make the viewer warm to her, making her teenaged-angst interludes harder to empathise with. Robert Pattinson does his best as teenage dreamboat vampire Edward, sharing strong chemistry with Stewart, even if his ""sultry, moody glances"" delve into the melodramatic to the point of verging on comical at times. The rest of the cast give rather bland but serviceable performances, the standouts being Cam Gigandet who is mercifully given the chance to gleefully chomp on scenery and generate sufficient menace as sadistic villainous vampire James and Ashley Greene who essays the ideal balance of being sweetly charming without being overly chirpy as Edward's kind-hearted sister Alice. However, despite his best efforts, Billy Burke is forced to wade through ""stern but absent father"" clich√©s to the point of being almost invisible as Bella's emotionally stunted parental figure, and Taylor Lautner fares little better as mysterious prospective love interest Jacob. <br/><br/>While Twilight is hardly a failure on all fronts, with a sporatic peppering of effective moments, the word which most ably describes the film as a whole is 'passable', lacking the necessary intensity or impact to truly hit home. It is easy to envision the adaptation being far more satisfying if done as a smaller, independent production outside the shadow of Hollywood, one which would not shy away from capturing the true passion and intensity of the central relationship without baulking at the prospect of a simmering yet sexless teenage relationship. As is, Hardwicke's film is content to succumb to clich√© and sloppy, complacent storytelling, making it far too 'bloodless' to truly satisfy. <br/><br/>-4/10"

The film was just not good, and since the books garnered such critical acclaim, I'm guessing this film is much worse than the books. The lines were poorly written, the acting was nothing to write home about, and the plot seemed incredibly clich√©. Again I haven't read the books, so I could be wrong, but it seems like this was one story they should have left simply as a novel.

So I'm not going to spend this review comparing things that were off and so forth. I think its sill to do that, anyway, as a book and a movie are COMPLETELY different things and a movie is an ADAPTATION of the book; of course it can't be exactly the same.<br/><br/>Anywho, back to the review. I didn't go into this movie with any kind of expectation, good or bad. I have been known to enjoy the occasional vampire flick and I am always good for a romance. And that's what this movie is: a romance movie that happens to have vampires in it. <br/><br/>I am officially in love with Edward Cullen, by the way. I think the chemistry between Bella and Edward was electrifying. The way he treated her when he first smelled her was perfect. As a female, I can tell you that her reaction was perfect for a teenage girl. Can you imagine how that would make you feel?! The scene in which they first kiss is one of the best. The emotion and passion was almost too much! Edward's intense eyes make you hypnotized.<br/><br/>I look forward to more character development on the rest of the Cullen clan and of Jacob and his Native American tribe. <br/><br/>The scenery of the Pacific Northwest was amazing and the camera angles were great. I thought they ended the movie well, having the audience craving more. I'm looking forward to the future installments."

","let me just start out by saying i read these books religiously. i have had to glue them back together i have been reading them for so many years. <br/><br/>*******************MILD SPOILERS*********************<br/><br/>I went and saw twilight twice last night. i have been following the movie since MTV had the rights. and from the commercials i was worried about the wire work/action graphics but i felt confident that Catherine hardwicke was going to deliver the movie the way i wanted it. i loved the actors they choose. Nikki reed, Kristen Stewart, Ashley green, just to name a few. and i really liked Anna Kendrick. she was hilarious. i thought i was going to hate Taylor as Jacob but i actually liked him. he was the warm Jacob i like. i just didn't like the way it was directed. i didn't like how they had so many face shoots, or the swooping camera. i also didn't like how choppy the scenes were. i didn't like how Edward was such a pansy. in the book, sure he wanted her, but when he made the decision to be strong he was strong and i think that got lost in translation. they played too much to his weakness for her blood, then for his strength to be with her. like how he couldn't stop in the end, in the book he made himself stop. i wish the movie could of been just 30 minutes longer. little things like he only watched her sleep once, and he never made fun of her truck, he never made fun of mike... just little things. i think they rushed too much to get the nomads into the picture. but i mean its understandable, you can't put a near 500 pg book into two hours and make everyone happy. again its all chalked up to the director. i love this movie and i will see it again before the weekend is over, cause i want them to have a bigger budget for the next movie, they are going to need it to portray the wolves. i just want a different director! and i'll be happy."

","There's an atmosphere to Twilight and that much you simply cannot deny. I can't help but be engrossed by the way that this movie captures the beauty, dreariness and nature of the Pacific Northwest. A memorable score and soundtrack heighten Catherine Hardwicke's broody, yet still enchanting tone. Elliot Davis' cinematography under her direction replicates the indie flair prominent in her other features, this is what separates it apart from the commercially realised sequels that followed. It's a hot and cold, gothic romance with just enough high stakes to enchant you until the very end. If it's raining, you can best believe that I'm slipping into something comfortable and putting Twilight on."

","I've been watching quality films all my life. This movie, in my humble opinion, is a cinema masterpiece. <br/><br/>Don't believe the bad reviews. They are jealous of the main characters who found true love on screen. It was the first movie in a decade I had to watch back to back, because you will probably miss a lot on your first viewing.<br/><br/>First of all, Kristen Stewart is excellent. The way she portrayed the character is unlike anything I have ever seen. She gave so much depth to Bella, it was even better than the Book (also brilliant). I don't the hate she gets for this role. She should have been awarded with at least a golden globe nomination.<br/><br/>Second of all Robert Pattersen is really handsome in this movie and also very good at acting. The best method actor currently alive. He dove so deep in this role, I don't know if he will ever recover.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was also good.<br/><br/>I didn't like the bad guys. They were stupid and ugly. I hope they never act again.<br/><br/>I hope you like my review."
"PoisonKeyblade","10","21","44","28 November 2008"," Teen Drama with Real Bite
","Being a huge fan of the book series by Stephanie Meyer, it's pointless not to admit that I have a certain bias towards Twilight. I was expecting great things, and my expectations were fulfilled, so I wasn't in the least bit disappointed. The entire movie is just brimming with confidence and a true love for the material, making director Catherine Hardwicke an absolutely perfect choice for the director's chair. The movie is lead by two fantastic performances from Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, who bring the book's iconic Edward Cullen and Isabella Swan to life with energy and emotion.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated, Twilight is essentially Romeo and Juliet with vampires tossed in the mix. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) reluctantly moves to the small town of Forks to live with her dad Charlie (Billy Burke). Being the new kid at school, Bella finds the outcasts, the Cullen family, to be particularly interesting, especially the unreasonably gorgeous Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Needless to say, there's more to the family than meets the eye, and much conflict along the way.<br/><br/>To be quite honest, for a book to film adaption, Twilight was unbelievably close to its source material. Honestly, you can't get much closer to the book than this. Initiating Stephanie Meyer to help write the screenplay and give word on slight changes was an incredibly clever decision, as fans that complain about the movie will only have Meyer to blame. The last three Harry Potter films have left entire sections of the book out, in addition to characters and such. Twilight does no such thing. The leads have great chemistry (which was practically required for a film like this), the core of the book is kept intact, the acting was top-notch, and the length and pacing was just right. What more can a die-hard fan ask for? Of course, there are some changes made to the movie. Some things needed to be a bit more cinematic. There are literally around 20 pages worth of descriptions of how gorgeous Edward is, and these descriptions can basically be summed up in less than five seconds. Mike, Jessica, Eric, and Angela may be a little different from their book counterparts, but it's mostly for the better. The group of friends serve as the movie's primary source for comic relief, and it works very well. Much of Bella's first day of school is missing, but it was never really all that important to begin with. Not to spoil anything, but both the battle and the prom scene were absolutely gorgeous and well-done, even though they may not have been exactly as described in the book. There were a few more things here and there, but nothing really to complain about. The only thing I was a little annoyed about was the lack of Carlisle's backstory. However, seeing some of your favorite book sections transformed onto film (especially for things like the Cullen introduction and the baseball scene) is a feeling that can't be rivaled by any other.<br/><br/>While some people may not have been fully satisfied with the acting or thought it was laughable, I loved every minute of it. I would use the phrase ""shines in her role"", but I would be using it almost every sentence. There are no clear shining stars here, as everyone is simply that fantastic. Kristen Steward basically has the entire movie on her shoulders, but she did a great job. The big emotional scene towards the end was a huge stretch for her, but I bought it all the way. Robert Pattinson may have received a lot of fan hate initially for being selected as Edward, but his performance proved that he IS Edward. You can't see his accent at all, in fact, he pulls off being American quite well. Congrats to the makeup artist because Rob looked absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>The directing from Catherine Hardwicke was perfect, and if she returns to film New Moon it will be interesting to see how she helps translates some of Bella's more emotional scenes. Hardwicke has a true vision behind the camera, and there's lots of close-ups. I can't wait to see more of what Hardwicke has to offer, as she pulled amazing performances out of every single person involved and gave the movie a definite heartbeat.<br/><br/>Twilight fulfills its purpose for sure, and then some. It's one of 2008's finest films, and probably would have been regardless of how close it actually stayed to the book. With a story this great, its difficult to make a bad film unless you're trying extremely hard. Overall, I absolutely loved the film and it went above and beyond in every way imaginable, becoming one of the best adaptions in recent memory."
"Lil_z_is_pimp","1","50","119","20 November 2008"," Really disappointing and stupid( Obviously)
","If you thought this movie was going to be good you are dead wrong. This movie sucks not only acting wise but the whole series of books are just puke-in-your-mouth cheesy. The actor that played Bella sucks and all the other actors suck also. Sadly to say but this movie will bring in a lot of money mainly for the success the book has had with teenage girls. and this movie probably will have sequels like the book series but they also will be terrible. This will ruin the actors careers and it should because the all suck and do not no anything about method acting. The whole idea of this version of Vampires suck. Vampires do not Freiking ""Sparkle"" in the daylight seriously. And its way to much of a gushy chick flick. And on a last note of wisdom: A good vampire movie has to be rated R. All I want to see is a good vampire movie with dynamic characters and were the protagonist isn't the main character I want a good anti-hero damn it!!! Bottom line the movie sucks and don't watch it especially if you happen to be a fan of the series it will ruin the already sub-par books for you i guarantee it."

"angiejr-2","3","21","45","21 November 2008"," No Chemistry
","I didn't go into this movie with blinders on...I had seen reviews that weren't overwhelmingly positive, but I so adore the book that I deliberately pushed anything negative I had heard aside and practically *willed* the movie to be good.<br/><br/>It wasn't.<br/><br/>Seriously, I went in with the attitude that I would forgive almost anything and there were small irritants that I was more than willing to overlook. Continuity issues exist, but that is to be expected in a long book being made into a movie. Some scenes were left out, others were combined in ways that didn't necessarily make sense to me. The makeup was overdone in some ways and lacking in others. The special effects were....cheesy is the nicest word I can come up with.<br/><br/>All of that is forgivable in my eyes.<br/><br/>The real star of this movie should have been an electric chemistry between Bella and Edward, just the same as the book. That was the most critical part of the film and, in my own humble opinion, was the part that was a dismal failure. There was absolutely *zero* chemistry between these two. Not a single moment that made my breath catch, as the book did. Parts that should have been serious were almost laughable.<br/><br/>In fact, almost *none* of the actors portrayed anything like real emotion, as far as I could tell. By the end of the movie, there was no attachment to any of them whatsoever and even if the portrayals had warranted attachment, the storyline was so fast and choppy, it would have deterred me regardless. Pretty much the only standout was Billy Burke's performance as Charlie Swan, which ranked as the most nuanced of the entire film and provided the few moments of genuine humor I saw in it.<br/><br/>Overall, a truly disappointing film treatment of a wonderful book. If the same major players follow through with the series, I will likely be giving the rest of the films a miss."
"tamarenne","10","16","33","2 September 2009"," fabulous movie 10 STARS
","I read with a certain amount of sadness the negative comments posted here about this film, and note that most of the criticism pertains to the fact that this movie as one ""enlightened"" critic put it ""has ""woman"" written all over it"". How sad that in this era of supposed female emancipation, that any film that does not cater to the adolescent male need for blood, gore and action, is vilified. This movie is tender, atmospheric and extremely entertaining. It is not another boring special effects movie, a cop movie, a war movie, or any of the other endlessly boring (to me) movies that spewed like bile by Hollywood.<br/><br/>A lot of the vampire fans are totally upset because the Vampires in this movie are not out killing people and because they are not the standard gore film Vampires... I wonder what all the fuss is about? Every Vampire film tends to change and modify the Vampire legend. In some movies they are killed just by exposing them to light. In some movies only a steak to the heart can do the job. There really is no standard behavior for Vampires people make it up... because Vampires don't really exist! It's a STORY people.<br/><br/>So in my mind it's just that this movie is more poetic and is something ""girlie girls"" of which I am a proud card carrying member, can love. So of course it is despised because I guess all forms of entertainment are expected to cater to males and male tastes.<br/><br/>Anyway I loved it and that is the first time I have been able to stand a movie about Vampires."
"Jodierah","4","11","21","1 December 2008"," Low expectations, still managed to walk away disappointed though.
","After finding a decent book that i couldn't put down and read in an entire day and then rushed out to buy all the others from the saga, i was a bit indecisive of whether to see the film at all. Directors always seem to miss the point of the book, and therefore more or less the whole plot is lost. This was the case for this film. I'll admit, some scenes were okay. Robert played a semi convincing Edward, but he didn't fit him completely. The character in the book, was a lot more smug, which, if transfered to the film, would have set the scene nicely for the remainding films. Kristen however, was not Bella to me. In the books, Bella is needy, clingy, constantly needing to be protected, almost childlike in the way Edward holds her and looks after her, completely innocent and lets emotion slip through with almost everything she says, even when she doesn't mean to, yet in the film, we get hard faced Kristen, a girl who wouldn't need protecting in any situation, a girl with no emotion. Bad choice, in my opinion. Jacob, also did not fit the expectations. And where was the story about the vampires and the wolves? Completely missed out, so hard to set the scene for the third book. The rest of the cast, fair enough, they fit completely. The editing was not great, either. The director changed half the settings for the scene with no reason to do so, why bother? All in all, i expected low expectations and walked away disappointed still. Looking forward to see how Catherine manages to fit everything into new moon, when she's made it seriously hard for herself by missing all the important bits out. <br/><br/>For one thing, why miss out all of the characters flaws when they basically set the story? Why miss out the most important line of the book ""ready for the twilight of your life"" the whole point in that being in the book was to make a point of why it was called twilight, but no, got missed out for no apparent reason, what's another 10 seconds added to 1 hour 53 mins? Why couldn't they go with the whole wardrobe settings when they were obviously so significant...and for the main question why mix around the scenes and settings so it made no sense whatsoever? Slightly pointless film, if you ask me. Directors say, how can you make a film from a book without missing parts out? The answer is, just don't."

","My wife is a fan of the books so I agreed to go with her to the movie on opening night. What I was not expecting was the horde of swooning fangirls that descended on the small theater in droves. Every time that the ""hero"" would come on screen, I was audibly assaulted by a never ending deluge of OOOOOHHHs and AAAAAAHHs that gave me the almost irresistible urge to pour gasoline on myself and light a match. Even as such, if the movie had been at least engaging I would have been able to tolerate this part of the experience. The acting was dry, the effects were horrible, and some of the lines were the cheesiest things I've ever heard outside of a book store bargain rack full of 1 dollar romance novels. The first time that Bella comes into the classroom and sits next to Edward, he acts like he's about to vomit all over the desk. The ""speed"" scenes where the vampires are supposed to be displaying their super speed looks like they are running on a treadmill with a conveyor belt scene moving behind them. All things considered, this is the third worst movie I have ever subjected myself too.<br/><br/>P.S. I would like to request that IMDb make negative user rating numbers available in the near future"

","There were flaws, of course there were flaws, the book is over 500 pages and most scripts in this type of font are only about 60-180. That means the writers can not adapt everything to make all the fans happy with the film. The directing was amazing and the effects were around the B area, but the film itself is good. We all know that vampires don't exist, but it's a fiction. I really truly did not want to see this. But I was forced in and when the first ten minutes started, I was gripping the edge of my seat for the rest. It was very riveting and enjoyable, I'm sure most people will enjoy it and love it. I'm on book three and can not wait for the New Moon movie."
"dbarnett-iphone","5","17","36","24 November 2008"," Doesn't Live Up to the Hype
","This movie wasn't near what I expected it to be. There are lot of things I want to say, but so much so that I am not sure of what to say.<br/><br/>The first forty minutes of the movie felt extremely rushed. I think this is where the director did the worst job. It felt like the first two-thirds of the book was shoved into the first thirty to forty minutes. The acting for the character of Edward seemed almost forced during the first few scenes. Rather than looking like he was bothered by a strong odor, he seemed as if he was going to have a seizure in the school lab.<br/><br/>From there the forced romance only got worse. It seemed like in the first ten to fifteen minutes that Edward absolutely hated Bella, and five minutes later he was saving her life. Five minutes after that, he was telling her he didn't want to talk to her ever. Another five minutes go by, and Edward is telling Bella that he can't stay away from her. The entire bond between Edward and Bella that was built over a very long period in the book, could have been missed with a short trip to the concession stand. I would say this has to do with bad directing.<br/><br/>The visual FX were also a thorn in the side for this movie. I was disappointed with the way that everything was blurred to make it seem fast. Those kinds of FX worked in the seventies, but I mean come on... I agree with the commentators that said the director needs to watch a few more action films before trying to portray these scenes again. It was almost appalling to see some of the ""high-school computer lab"" FX done in this film.<br/><br/>The only reason I even stayed to watch the rest of the movie, is because I enjoyed the book so much. I can only hope that they don't ruin the next few books with the same horrible directing job they did in this one.<br/><br/>As for the characters, I believe that almost everyone was wonderfully portrayed. Edward was a good pick, except for he looks like a bean pole in some scenes... maybe a protein shake would help this guy out. Bella did a good job as well, and her expressionless face seemed to be what most of us fans expected. The acting of Edward and Bella both could have been improved if it was less rushed. I believe that the best character portrayal of the entire book was Alice; she was EXACTLY what I expected. She was really upbeat, and ""in your face"" nice. The scene in which she said, ""It's okay Edward! Me and Bella re going to be GREAT friends"", was perfect. Laurent and Victoria were what I would have expected as well. The only character I really had a problem with was James. I was expecting a slightly older, wiser, and more cunning-like character. James seemed to be a let down, and was EXTREMELY hard to take serious."

But man, it is not very often that my expectations are exceeded as much as they were here.<br/><br/>It was terrible, for all the wrong reasons. The acting was decent, and Cedric Diggory (I don't know his real name, but it doesn't matter. This is what everyone is going to call him for the next few years anyways.) was actually pretty good most of the time. The lady vampire was angsty and annoying, but not to the point that it ruined the movie. The plot was pretty bad, but in better hands it could've worked. The scenery was pretty neat. The special effects were underdone but not absurd. And even that horrific camera work only accounted for about 10% of the pain (it was terrible, though. I understand zooming into the background and going out of focus is an accepted technique for transitions, but not several times throughout each scene.) No, people.<br/><br/>It was the dialogue.<br/><br/>I have never seen this amount of suck in a movie driven solely by dialogue. The script was melodramatic, boring and absurd. The narration was too obvious and unnatural. I left for 7 or 8 minutes in the middle to go to the bathroom/cry and when I came back, I had missed NOTHING. NOTHING. Things are supposed to happen in movies. If I had tried that during, say, the Dark Knight I would've walked back into the theater completely confused.<br/><br/>I say go see the movie just so you can experience watching something that can be so bad just because of the script."

","Every afternoon before she returns from school I search my daughter Emma's bedroom for anything that might contribute to her moral decay. And every day throughout the years my fears were joyfully unfounded as I rarely had found anything morally questionable. My little princess has consistently maintained a clean, morally upright personal character. That is, of course, until I discovered this PG-13-rated, sacrilegious DVD in the back of one of her drawers, conveniently hidden beneath some of her Bible study materials.<br/><br/>Never in her life have I been so disappointed in my otherwise bright, beautiful daughter.<br/><br/>When she returned home from school that afternoon I confronted her wide-eyed and furious about my findings. She denied it was hers at first, but eventually admitted to receiving this item as a gift, claiming she had only seen parts of it at her friend's house and liked what she saw but had not yet seen the entire thing. I went ballistic, yelling until I was physically weeping and red in the face as I told her how seeing something like this would ruin her mind and scar her for life. Then I grounded her for two months to hammer the point home. She tried to explain to me that the movie was ""not evil,"" that it was ""tastefully made"" and that I would not object to any of its content. ""Right,"" I scoffed. Then, confiscating the ""Twilight"" DVD I smirked in disgusted amusement as I thought, ""she'll watch this DVD over my dead body."" About two weeks later, with nothing better to do I took a deep breath and decided to watch this DVD. I was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful love story that unfolded before my eyes amid an ugly world of despair, vampires, and werewolves. The innocent love shared between the two main characters was real. It was palpable. The effects were amazing, the acting outstanding. This is storytelling at its best.<br/><br/>My sweet little angel is still grounded (a little over one month to go!) but I will start letting her out of her room to eat with the rest of the family and use the restroom at night.

","Just finished watching this movie, I actually didn't want to watch this but curiosity got the better of me(all that bad reviews and such). In hindsight i should not have believed people when they said it was so bad it's good, for me it was torture.<br/><br/>1 major complaint from me is that IT WAS BORING. Scenes of the same nature/conversation keeps repeating over and over again. These scenes also are dragged on and on AND ON. It is like this movie was on 1/4 the speed. You just want to scream at them to JUST MOVE ON! ""I GET IT, YOU THINK SHE SHOULDN'T BE WITH YOU BLAH BLAH BLAH, PLEASE MOVE FORWARD"". It is unbelievable how little substance is in this movie considering the runtime is approx. 2 hours.<br/><br/>Also, this was a horrible romantic movie, you'd think a romantic movie would be about how they interact, getting to know each other's interests, quirks and falling in love. With these 2, I feel like they just knew each other for 3 days and they SOMEHOW became obsessed with each other. This due to the fact that they gloss over their interactions in just rotating shots around them, staring at each other with dead eyes. I WANT to know these interactions, I WANT to get a chance to actually see them together, I WANT to see them as characters with distinct personalities(regardless if likable or not) so that I CAN AT LEAST TRY TO SEE WHY THEY ARE OBSESSED WITH EACH OTHER. I feel like if they explored this part it could be salvaged(like 0.1% chance), at least it would be I.N.T.E.R.S.T.I.N.G.<br/><br/>(subjective) I immensely dislike how Bella treated the father, I hate how cruel and mean spirited she was. She DEFINITELY could have gone another route to let her go. Especially since she doesn't have to say that last line(""if I don't get out now, I'll just be stuck here like mom."") where he was definitely going to let her go. What an insensitive little tw*t. I can see she feels mean about doing that to her dad and i was looking forward to seeing how Bella apologises for her actions and they forgive each other and GUESS WHAT? IT NEVER HAPPENS. Put this in perspective, there were tons upon tons of bullshit scenes that do not add value to the narrative, sub plots that just flatline because there is no time? All to be filled in for the utterly necessary awkward silent moments the director seems to love. It's almost like a running gag that just make everyone annoyed and awkward.<br/><br/>From the movie i feel like the director is just summarising what ever is in the book into a minute. She must have thought ""well the books have it i guess i'll have to put it somewhere to get it over and done with"". It feels rushed and pointless because it does not delve into anything, it is just saying the lines from the book. So, if the scene would be pointless WHY PUT IT THERE. It is an adaptation, we understand, there are bound to be differences between the novel and movie. You have to trim the fat leave the essence, boil it until it is thick and delicious, not diluted and tasting of nothing.<br/><br/>There are movies like harry potter that make you want to run straight home after the movie and read the original books it was adapted from and then you have twilight that makes you want to burn the books.<br/><br/>People whom i can see enjoying this films are actually only the book lovers. They can add in the contexts that aren't in the movie from their contextual knowledge, these probably fill the gaping holes of the films.<br/><br/>At least I can say I survived the twilight movies, will I ever watch another from this trilogy(or like 5-logy?idk) NEVER.<br/><br/>**Elaborating on my summary, I started off sprouting out everything i feel is stupid, unnecessary or illogical and became angry, i rid on this wave for like 3/4 of the show just getting angrier and angrier. Until I was screaming and growling into my hand, i realised how crazy i was becoming and i just told myself to relax and just watch without talking. Well it did not last long, i was soon finding myself tiredly questioning the sanity of the movie. I could have easily stopped myself from watching this, but i found myself unable to stop as i needed to prove that i can survive a stupid movie to it's completion. If cinemasins could watch it five times why can't i? After the movie ended, i felt my brain in a state of mush that i don't really want to get out of so i started writing this review, now that this is finished i feel like a SPIDER MONKEY as i just dumped most of the bullshit that i am capable of putting in words into this review :) <br/><br/>Screw this movie."
"brandon-jimenez-644-272895","1","6","10","18 December 2013"," Undoubtedly the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen in my Entire Life
","Let me tell you about my own personal experience with the Twilight Franchise. I was in High School when the first movie was coming out. I went to Private School, and it was a 30 minute long commute, and I did not drive yet, so my Mom would drive me and my eleven year old sister in the car (she didn't like being home alone). My Mom and her would talk endlessly, literally endlessly, about the Twilight Books during the Commute for months. It was so boring! So by the time the movie came out, I sadly knew the book front-to-back, and I could easily tell it was a terrible book. So when the movie was coming out, I was thinking to myself: ""That is going to be the Worst Piece-of-Sh*t Movie of the year."" Luckily, I didn't see it in theaters when it came out, but months later, when I had to watch over my younger sister, I was essentially forced to watch her DVD of the movie. So I saw it with her, and boy was I wrong, IT WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST PIECE-OF-SH*T MOVIE OF AT LEAST 10 YEARS. And on top of that, each movie was also in their own right just as horrible. <br/><br/>The Twilight movies are the worst movies I've ever seen. And believe me, I've seen a lot of terrible movies; I've seen Batman & Robin, Baby Geniuses, Catwoman, Disaster Movie, Jack & Jill, and The Last Airbender, even the Garbage Pale Kids Movies. But Twilight is worse than these all these terrible movies combined. It makes me cringe just writing about it now. <br/><br/>What do I hate about it? Pretty much everything. The Acting is the worst I've ever seen. I did not believe once that the actors were actually trying to give a good performance. Kristen Stewart is such a bad and annoying actress, and her character Bella is the worst character ever made. She has no personality, only cares about herself, does not change as a character AT ALL, she is weak, she never takes responsibility for her actions, she is overly dependent on all the men in her life, and throws her life away for some guy she has no real relationship with. There's not a single positive or even Meh thing to say about her. Edward is such a terrible character as well, I mean he is only in one mood (Stoic) for the entire saga and because of that has no personality. He is obviously not a 100 year old vampire, or even really a vampire, because he does not act like a 100 year old vampire. He is creepy, he is bland, he is the worst vampire ever. And Jacob, My God, WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH A NEWBORN BABY?! THATS NOT CHARMING, THATS SCARY AND CREEPY. <br/><br/>On top of the bad characters, the story is terrible as well. Stephanie Meyer obviously had no what a vampire was, so she created her fantasy image of one. I don't even call these things vampires, because they are not. Who makes Vampires glitter in the sun? And why do they have X-Men like powers? And why are they Immortal? And why do they not drink Human blood? I don't care what reason they put in there, but a vampire not drinking blood makes no sense. I don't even think the vampires in the movies even have fangs. <br/><br/>The effects are terrible, the cinematography is awful, the lighting is the worst I've ever seen, the entire movie is literally blue. The Dialogue is terrible, and I did not believe once, ONCE, that Edward and Bella were in any form of relationship. Their relationship in the movie was so creepy that it is perverted, I mean a 100 year old dating a teenager? Are You Crazy! WHO DOES THAT AND FINDS IT CHARMING?! <br/><br/>Okay I've gone on enough, but this movie is terrible. Its stupid, it's boring, it insults the audiences' intelligence, there is nothing salvageable. This is the textbook example of how Not to make a movie. When I have kids, I will NOT allow them to see the movies or read the books. This is a movie nobody should see. I hope it burns in hell."
"dndcullens","1","6","10","2 March 2013"," Don't have to watch it
","Okay so how do you know a movie is good or bad before you see it? For instance you read about or hear about or see a trailer for a movie and you make your decision to see it or not to see it. Never mind what you hear about it from friends...those are the movies you are undecided about. So how do you make that decision? You go on instinct, I suppose. Let me give you an example...well, let me give you two. First of all I saw the trailer for THE GOLDEN COMPASS and soooo wanted to see it that I managed to borrow a pirated copy from a friend, intending, to buy it when it came out. What a pile of do-do that turned out to be. Then there was all the broo-ha-ha about a movie about wizards going to college which put me right off but actually Harry Potter was not all that bad. So instincts can be wrong sometime but not always and more often-then- not you end up watching a flick which, at the end, your sub-conscious tell you ""I told you so!"" Now everything I have heard, or seen or watched about this movie tells me that I should not waste my time, torture my sub-conscious, or extend the range of my wrath by watching this shyte. So instead I'll give it an awful rating and hope that this insult to the Bran Stoker legacy (and there have been a few) ends up were it belongs....in the grave."
"joyjoy04","4","9","17","24 November 2008"," Get a new director and screenplay writer for the sequels
","I completely agree with the others who, like me, could not bring themselves in giving this film a good review. I understand that budgeting and time doesn't allow for every detail of the book to be written into the script, but surely the the screenplay writer and director could've found a better way to transition from scene to scene without leaving so many holes and gaps. It was so incredibly ""choppy"" that I felt unstable walking out of the theater.<br/><br/>The cast chosen was great. I think they are a group of talented, as well as extremely good looking, actors that did a great job morphing into the characters of the book. Charlie was definitely entertaining. Carlisle and Esme - charming. Rosalie and Emmett - great couple. Jasper and Alice - exactly as I pictured. Edward - beautiful and perfect but can relax a bit on the lipstick. Bella - also beautiful but could've added in a bit more delicacy and emotion. If you found that there were awkward moments during the movie, don't blame the actors. It isn't their fault that the director pointed them in that direction.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm hoping the remaining books of the saga will be made into films. But the only way I can think of the films actually being good is to find a new director and screenplay writer. They failed to bring life to the fabulous work of Stephenie Meyer."
"nunuva-yerbizness","1","15","32","21 November 2008"," Worst. Vampire. Movie. Ever.
","In short, this is a hugely disappointing experience - more glorified after school special than feature film.<br/><br/>It's not bad enough that this is a self-indulgent, vapid waste of time... the story well oversteps poetic license and offers a fully revisionist vampire mythology. If you want to sit through 2 hours of vacuous, spineless teenage romance then this is the movie for you. If you like your vampires as fangless, baseball playing, daywalking ""vegetarians"" - by all means, indulge yourself.<br/><br/>As for the rest of you... save your time and money. The only bloodletting here is at the box office."
"overniteredhead","6","13","27","22 November 2008"," Twilight ? how about twidark !
","Im not familiar with the Twilight series and I didn't hear about this movie until a couple days before it was released in theaters so I didn't know what to expect when seeing this movie. I felt that the main characters Edward and Bella were exceptionally ""dark"" as though both characters have been long oppressed. This isn't the case though as we see that in Bella's new school everyone makes a huge effort to befriend her. I felt as though the supporting staff including Edward's family could have received more on screen attention. I realize that the film is a love story between teenagers but their romance was intensely PG rated for me. I only recall them sharing one or two kisses. The romance reminded me of the movie Cry Baby starring Johnny Depp. The violence, on the other hand, was more intense then the romance aspect. There is a clip in which a young vampiress snaps the neck of an enemy. The enemy is subsequently burned. Lastly, for individuals who are not familiar with the Twilight series this film does a poor job of explaining how Edward's vampire family developed. I was hoping to learn a bit more about Edward's past and that of his family. Not much is known. As a suggestion to older audiences, I would wait to see this film until it comes out in stores or I would wait until the hype dies down because the majority of the audience was young anxious teens screaming and jumping around the theater."
"Leofwine_draca","4","5","8","30 August 2011"," Sparkly vampires & one awful leading lady = a film that's tough to watch
","I'm about as far from this movie's demographic as you can get (I'm no 12-year-old girl), but in the interests of vampire cinema I forced myself to sit through this film in the hope of somehow enjoying it. Of course, I was bitterly resulted by what I saw, which is nothing more than an angsty teen romance that tries, and fails, to be a hip vampire movie. Vampire movies have long contained simmering sexuality ‚Äì Chris Lee positively exuded it in his Hammer outings ‚Äì but the theme is reduced to a superficial level in this film, as vampirism is just yet another problem ‚Äì like acne and the in-crowd ‚Äì that our young lovers have to deal with.<br/><br/>The movie's po-faced efforts to tell this story seriously (I mean, you want me to take sparkling vampires seriously?) make it all the worse. The overly familiar plot never once attempts to bring anything new to the table, and the late-stage introduction of a supposed villainous character is a real fail. The film's nadir has to be the baseball set-piece, in which a family of vampires use their supernatural skills to beat the opposing team. Cinema doesn't get much more embarrassingly bad than this.<br/><br/>Then again, if sullen teenage heroines with faces you want to slap (Kristen Stewart, I'm talking about you) are your thing, and your have a penchant for spiky-haired loners in white makeup, then by all means give it a go. You never know, you might even enjoy it. Unlike me."
"DoctorWhy","2","22","51","21 November 2008"," Twilight.
","Let me start out by being completely honest: there is NOTHING cool about ginger-haired vampire love stories. Vampires are supposed to kick ass, not make out with random Arizona girls. Since this is more or less the storyline, the book was shall we say, not all that great (not to mention it reads like a badly written high-schooler's essay.) So that should just give you an idea of what I thought of the book.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a friend of mine insisted that the book was simply fantastic, so I read it, and, well, didn't like it. At all. Then, after I had shared my view of the book with her, she insisted that I come see the movie with her. So I did. I wasn't disappointed... but I wasn't expecting much either.<br/><br/>Firstly: badly adapted from the book. The book was gross enough, don't make me sit through something even worse. Secondly: not very well acted. Although I do admit, it was probably more the script's fault than the actors' fault. Thirdly: the special effects were just so-so. In this day and age, you really have to step it up to please the masses, and this movie just didn't cut it.<br/><br/>All in all, I did not enjoy this movie, and not just for the storyline. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly far from the best. I know it seems a bit harsh of me to just beat down this movie's credibility without a second thought, and I'm not denying that some people think that both the book and movie were great (why, I'm not sure... but I digress), but it's really not worth that second thought, and definitely not worth the $8.00 it cost me to get in.<br/><br/>(On a side note, my friend {the one who insisted that the book and movie would be great} didn't like the movie all that much either.)<br/><br/>Twilight earns a 3.4 out of 10."

Kirsten Stewart looked like she was working with a very painful stomach ache (she didn't smile once!) With all the money that went into this movie, I'd have thought they'd at least hire better actors (at least better looking ones anyway...)

All this freaking film had was stares being the catatonic Stewart, and glitterly Pattison. Nice lipstick edward, you looked ridiculous. As my prayers were finally answered and this film ended, I heard the distinct sound of Lugosi spinning in his grave. And Christopher Lee spinning in his grave. Max Schreck as Nosferatu spinning in his grave. I am sure if the great Gary Oldman were deceased he would be spinning in his grave at this insulting addition to vampire lore. And they made MORE?

","Ah, 2008, the sixth grade, so many lousy memories... but living in a small town that didn't even have a mall, movies were what teens used to occupy themselves more than anything else. When Twilight came out, all the popular snobs and emo kids were overjoyed. Vampires, romance, murder, mayhem, what's not to love? Well, wanting to fit in, I pestered my mom and dad until finally it was downloaded for me and the three of us watched it along with Village of the Damned (1995). I realized, about five minutes into Twilight, that I'd made a big mistake.<br/><br/>Bella is an average, frankly sort of ugly, typical melodramatic teen who has moved into a small town when she meets the mysterious Cullen family, mainly Edward, the guy every girl wishes they could date. As she becomes more involved with him, she realizes he and his family are a tribe of vampires, calling themselves ""vegetarians (because they only drink animal blood, right... they need a better dictionary).<br/><br/>Well, Edward was the guy the popular kids in my class called sexy and swank. You know, he's the one who is always wearing lipstick in all the posters so he looks more pale than normal? Well, I've seen so many vampire films, from Dracula to Martin to Salem's Lot... not one of them glittered in the sunlight. That makes no sense whatsoever, and it makes me question what the author was high on when she wrote the novel series.<br/><br/>Bella was so average looking it was obviously intended, and half the time she was muttering so I couldn't hear her talking. Her romance with Edward involves leaping through trees behind his house like a baboon, among other bizarre events that really make me wonder, who the hell is enjoying this film? Towards the end is a scene where Bella starts bleeding to death, and for no explained reason her mouth hangs open like a dead trout and she acts out a dramatic scene that reminds me of holy rolling.<br/><br/>I honestly thought the film was stupid, pathetic and often boring, full of sappy yet messed up romance. I have not watched the continuing films, nor have I read the book series. Honestly, the only way you'll enjoy this film is if you're a melodramatic teenager who fantasizes about boys too much. Twilight was nearly as awful as The Hunger Games, certainly not worth your time."

Nowadays people consumes every crap they could made for them , a bit of plastic, commercial music, nice faces and its done. The worst its there's actually a lot of people who enjoys these crap movies, and they made 2 more (i didn't and i will never watch them anyway). This looks like juvenile daily soup. Before watching this movie i was watching The Stand by me from 1986, and its a complete different quality, even aged the ''Stand by me'' shows normal and real characters, and younger ones, here it shows a completely bad acting plotting directing that really take me out of serious, cant stand these uninspired movies.

I don't know how people can say that this is a good Book/film, and I paid √Ç¬£7.99 for that book. Rip off. I think the only reason it actually did so well was because of Robert Pattinson, if he wasn't the main vampire (Edward) I think it would have been a huge flop.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that because, let's face it the film only did so well because the ladies think he is hotter than the sun (He is according to Heat Magazine and the internet) . He is actually a good actor and I can see him playing someone in something apart from vampires. Like in Little Ashes (Which I have not seen yet) did alright.<br/><br/>He has a few films that have nothing to do with the Twilight saga thank god. One with Hugh Jackman which will probably do quite well helping his acting career. The sooner the Twilight films have finished the better.<br/><br/>BUT....<br/><br/>I'm going to be a bit Hypocritical now when I say I will see how the next one (New Moon) comes out because having stars such as Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning, two bigger names which will probably make the film a lot better. If you haven't looked up the pictures of them in New Moon then look now! The makeup artist should be sacked for the job He/she's done on Michael and Dakota.

","I don't like to overgeneralize but, it seems most of the crowd that loved this film are in their teens/early 20's and I'm not necessarily their target audience. Personally, I wasn't particularly interested in seeing this film because I've been so disappointed by over hyped productions in the past and have always been let down... this was no exception.<br/><br/>I give it credit for being somewhat different in it's approach to the vampire mythology. As for the vampires themselves, they were at least more (pardon the pun) 'fleshed out' than the humans. You could almost sympathize with the vampires on a certain level for trying to fit into society and letting go of their infamous past indulgences. The humans on the other hand were cookie-cutter stereotyped high school students without much depth.<br/><br/>As for as a storyline here, don't expect much. If you want to see real characters involved in a good vampire/human love story, watch True Blood on HBO or the first two Underworld movies (although I think the romantic interest may have been a werewolf, but nonetheless).<br/><br/>The movie plays out like the atypical 90210/Melrose Place type of teen trials and tribulations, except with vampires. In my own opinion I feel that this is probably why it's done so well with younger audiences.<br/><br/>I was fortunate because, I rented it for $1.00 and so don't feel too bad except for the loss of two hours. It was by far not the worst movie in the genre that I've seen, but it had so many possibilities that were never explored or developed to make this a better film than it could have been.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>My nine year-old daughter decided that she wanted to watch 'Twilight' recently, so my wife and I agreed to give it another try. I had such negative feelings about it the first time around, it was only fair to see if I was just in a bad mood the first time I watched it.<br/><br/>I can honestly say my first impressions were vilified the second time. The story was slow, flat and once again, I couldn't care less about the characters. Aside from a couple of somewhat interesting additions to the vampire mythology it was mostly a uninspiring experience.<br/><br/>The movie is fine for tweens and young adults as there isn't much in the way of 'blood and guts', nor is there any nudity or much foul language. Pretty faces abound in Twilight which is why it has gained such a wide appeal with the younger audiences. I waited awhile before letting my daughter watch it, but she's mature enough to handle Twilight's content and she liked the movie overall.<br/><br/>Aside from the reasons mentioned above for my dislike of this film, I just can't something seriously that merchandises itself to death. While not necessarily a kids film, Twilight sure has a lot of material that's popular at the elementary school level."

","This is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen. It should definitely be shown in all film classes. It goes to show that you can have absolutely no talent for anything in the film industry, and you can still be rolling in the money of teens with questionable intelligence. Thank you America. Thank you.<br/><br/>But in all seriousness, this is an absolutely horrid movie. I knew the books were bad, so I didn't go in expecting much at all. Just give me the lame plot and be done with it. By the time the movie ended I was basically in a catatonic state from the awful. The editing. Oh, the editing. There is probably no possible way to make this movie more choppy than it already is (the shot of the waterfall that went nowhere? Oh great, a waterfall. Now let's cut to an obviously different location!). And lets not forget the ridiculously dramatic closeups of the eyes, how lovely. Maybe she was trying for some allusion to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, who knows. It came across as ridiculous.<br/><br/>I think we all know these books are pretty bad, and that Bella falls in love with Edward way too fast. But this movie took it to new (and bad) extremes. Falling ""irrevocably"" in love after talking...lets say...three or four times? I can't say how many times I laughed out loud during this movie.<br/><br/>And finally, the chemistry. Or shall we say, the lack thereof. It really is a shame because the two are decent actors, but put them together I think Keanu Reeves would give both of them a run for their money. Between the blank stares and monotone, uninterested voices, I had more interest in watching the fly that landed in the seat in front of me. You have to wonder if when they wrote the script (although I may be granting them too much in implying that there was, in fact, a script), they said things like ""No, this isn't awkward and choppy enough, make it worse. No, even worse!"" <br/><br/>One of the absolute best parts of the movie was the catastrophic attempt at trying to convey vampire speed. Yes! Fast forward! Great. Now they're going fast AND it looks stupid! Perfect.<br/><br/>The only thing this film was missing was Mike Nelson and his robots at the bottom of the screen with a sarcastic commentary. This is a Mystery Science Theater worthy piece of work."

"doctorsmoothlove","4","9","18","12 December 2008"," There's a little black spot on the vampire film industry.
","What is it like to be a vampire? Many authors have been attempting to answer this question since John Polidori's short story The Vampyre which was first published in 1819. Here were are nearly two hundred years afterwards, and filmmakers have taken this challenge upon themselves as well. There are many great vampire films. One of them (Let the Right One In) was released this year, but a stinker was too. Twilight isn't a great vampire movie, nor is it a good romance movie. It's a postmodern vampire flick with no ounce of originality. It's portrayal of vampirism is incomplete and its depiction of women is distressing.<br/><br/>The plot is remarkably easy to summarize. Imagine a stereotypical romance novel from a pharmacy store, throw in a vampire for the male lead, and you've got Twilight. Bella Swan moves to Forks, Washington from Phoenix to live with her father. She is an intelligent and attractive girl but finds few real friends at school. Suddenly, she becomes acquainted with Edward Cullen, a shy yet handsome boy. Edward and Bella become friends, but she realizes something amiss when he saves her from a car crash with his bare hands. Romantic urges bloom and the two start dating. We finally get to meet Edward's family, apparently all vampires, who travel from place to place.<br/><br/>After some painful scenes of two people deciding to fall in love, the plot picks up when a rival vampire gang takes sight of Bella. One of its members, James, takes interest in Bella because she ""smells good"" and decides to hunt her. The Cullens hide Bella but James outwits her and nearly succeeds in killing her. Unfortunately, James loses and is killed off screen. I was disappointed since I thought James added some backbone to the feature. He actually follows some pre-conceived expectations I had coming in to this boring film.<br/><br/>Yes, it's very boring. Half of the movie introduces us to many unnecessary secondary characters whose names I cannot recall. Their purpose is to praise Bella's ability to land a good man. Why include them? Maybe the assured sequel will give them meaning. Aside from his father, Edward's family is also too conclusive. He has many brothers and sisters some of who receive no dialog. When we don't meet needless characters we are treated to overextended love scenes with Edward and Bella. I am surprised that throughout all of them, I never learned very much about their personalities. Don't be upset, I know I'm over-analyzing. God forbid a movie with more than a niche audience.<br/><br/>However, my largest problem with this film is its complete abandonment of nearly all vampire tropes. Vampires can walk in the day, enter rooms without an invitation, and even survive on animal blood. Their absence would be difficult to properly address but Twilight fails to provide any way of doing so. It becomes Stephanie Meyer's decision to hope that audiences will accept the story's (and movie's) premise as sufficient. I would have enjoyed back story on how vampires came to such a point. <br/><br/>Meyer's treatment of females reminds me of old horror movies in public domain. One I watched recently was Condemned to Live (1935) which was similar to this movie. In that one, a young woman must meekly await rescue from her husband-to-be who happens to be a vampire. She never acts of her own volition. Her admirer comes to aid as she sits idly. Bella is similar. Twilight portrays her as helpless without her boyfriend. Even when he sneaks into her home and watches her sleep, she still falls in love with him. No real woman would react that way. I can forgive Condemned to Live given its age but not Twilight.<br/><br/>Despite its utterly underwhelming story, the film looks good. Elliot Davis, as cinematographer, includes many overhead shots of Forks and surrounding areas. Rarely are there any shots in full lighting. Most of the frames are either dark or de-saturated. The cinematography is effective in establishing atmosphere of a vampire movie. If only there was story to go along with it. The script consists of various ways of altering how two people can say they love each other. It comes off as cheesy, but the worst line is when James' group says that they don't ""play with their food"" when hunting some guy.<br/><br/>Perhaps with better source material this movie wouldn't suck as much as it does. Oh wait, there is a better version of Twilight! It's called Let the Right One In. That film addresses many problems which afflict this one. It actually portrays vampires as, you know, vampires. Edward Cullen is a hottie who happens to be an undead guy but not a vampire. Nothing about this film establishes him as anything other than Bella's love interest. Bella is the same way. I don't recommend you see this movie unless you have a child or friend who wishes to watch it. Wait for the Blu-ray release of Let the Right One In and read the novel it's based upon in the meantime."

","I thought the book was bad, but the movie just topped it off. The CGI effects looked like they came right out of the sixties. All of the makeup made the vampires look pasty. And the hair. My God, the hair. It's not natural for hair to look that way! The actors couldn't even breathe life into this shallow plot. There was no chemistry between Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewert whatsoever; they were straining just to look at each other. And whenever they saw each other, they looked unfathomably shocked. Even though there were high expectations for this book, I set my sights lower, and still got disappointed. Most of the fans were complaining about how the actors don't suit the characters (who are impeccably beautiful, I might add), but I was complaining about the overall poor quality. The shots were meant to look shifty and cool, but it only made it seem like the cameraman was having a seizure. Overall, even though it did well at the box office on account of the numerous teenage fans, the movie was a bore that took itself too seriously."

","One word to sum up this movie: Abortion.<br/><br/>As an author, Meyer is decent. Obviously a book targeted toward teenagers. To be specific: raging hormonal teenage girls. But, I enjoyed the book. Girl falls in love with guy, guy falls in love with girl, guy is a vampire and wants to kill her and almost does... it's all good stuff. Reading the books, I understood what the hype was about. The movie earned ten times as much hype and after watching it tonight, I thought out loud: Whose idea was it to make this movie and where do they live so I can shoot them in the face? <br/><br/>From start to finish, the movie was terrible. A slew of problems everyone in the audience could see. Even the die-hard teenage Twilight readers (who proudly wore 'Team Edward' shirts) laughed at the movie. The biggest problems: the director (Hardwicke) and the screenplay (Rosenberg). Hardwicke's biggest films were Lords of Dogtown and Thirteen. Rosenberg's biggest contributions were to the fabulous movie Step Up, the amazingly intelligent TV show The O.C. and don't count out a production credit on the long running , brilliant TV show Birds of Prey. Oh, and yes, I'm being sarcastic. Put these two in charge of steering novice (but earnest) actors such as Pattison and Stewart and you have an absolute disaster.<br/><br/>Honestly, did anyone read the book before yelling 'ACTION'?"

I have been obsessed with Twilight ever since the first day i read it, and have imagined it as the epic love story it truly is. Edward fights for Bella, and they fall into a forbidden love. This movie took the book and played it into the movie, but didn't show this love in the true way it should be showed. They took the ideas in the book, but put them into a whole different way, they made it funny, and some of the parts seemed way to scripted, not the way a teenager would talk or act. Also, they added parts into the movie that were never in the book, and some parts seemed too scripted. I had high expectations for this movie, and maybe that is why I am disappointed.

","I had just finished reading Twilight yesterday and was prepared to go to the midnight premier with high hopes of criticizing the movie based on the book. All-in-all, it wasn't a horrible movie, however, there were some small flaws that I found quite inaccurate.<br/><br/>First off, Edward seemed more awkward than graceful. In almost every scene, his words flowed almost hesitantly from his mouth. The book describes his dialogue as ""silky,"" ""velvet"" and ""warm honey."" Also I had imagined him to be more confident than he appeared in the movie.<br/><br/>Another book-to-film ""mishap"" that irritated me was the speediness of Edward and Hella's relationship. In the book, it seems to build up and Edward is EXTREMELY cautious and reluctant to even touch Bella. The film completely overlooked this, considering the first day Edward and Bella were together, Edward threw his arm around her as if he had no problem controlling his thirst.<br/><br/>The final aspect that irritated me was the ""meadow scene."" This scene was absolutely atrocious! I'm not going to spoil anything, however, I think Twilight could have used some nice special effects for this scene.<br/><br/>This is not a must-see, but it was still worth my $9.50"

","I've read the Twilight books, and although I don't loved them, I was looking forward to the film adaptation. When the reviews started appearing, they were so negative that my expectations were very low. The movie was a bit better than I expected. It is a very flawed film. First of all, the acting is mediocre at times. Many people have said that the two main actors had chemistry, but I found their relationship to be rather awkward. There was no wit and flow in their relationship. This might have also been a result of Catherine Hardwicke's poor directing and the weird shots she used throughout the film. My last complaint is what most people have been upset about. The Special Effects. It is not the crew's fault that they had a low $37 million dollar budget, but the special effects were one of the worst I have ever seen. It made the movie quite laughable. The film wasn't a complete failure however. Robert Pattinson had his shining moments, and Billy Burke(who plays Bella's father Charlie) was a scene stealer. Mike Welch was also surprisingly good. The soundtrack was also very nicely placed. Melissa Rosenberg(the screenplay writer) did a very good job in adapting Stephanie Meyer's god-awful writing into a fair script. The script, unfortunately, was ruined by the poor deliverance of the actors. From the beginning, Summit Entertainment has made it clear that the movie was made for the fans. The bad side is that not everyone is a fan, and after watching Twilight, I doubt anyone will become one."
"askcaeser","4","11","24","21 November 2008"," Similar to the book, unfortunately
","I've been a fan of the Twilight series for years, and as I've moved on to the classics I've decided that the essence of the Twilight series is that it's entertaining and endearing rather than well-written.<br/><br/>The movie, Twilight, just brought out that aspect for the masses. Stewart played Bella very flat, but the Bella in the books wasn't all that dimensional anyway. Pattinson, who I first thought wasn't a fit for the the role, played Edward very close to how I imagined he would: intense, emotional, a loner, slightly controlling-sounding at times. I believe the rest of the cast was picked very well appearance wise, but there were several parts of the movie that you just cringe because of the bad acting. Pattinson and Stewart has some kind of chemistry, sure, but I'm not sure how much of that was motivated by their pure awkwardness toward each other. Sometimes endearing, usually overly dramatic and emotion, Twilight is a good movie to watch to motivate you into reading the classics or hey starting a countdown to the first showing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince."

","I went to see this movie with my girlfriend (we're both 23). I love vampires, I have an astounding infatuation with them...so, I figured ""why not, it seems like it may be a pretty decent movie."" I got the full shot, on opening night...seemingly hundreds of adolescent girls screaming every time a male character appeared in a scene. And THAT, folks, is the entire point of making this movie. These books have fairly recently become a phenomena, and someone decided it would be a wonderful opportunity to make a barely mediocre film about it and just rake it truckloads of cash. Well, I believe they achieve their goal with shining success. As far as the film goes, there is no substance, the acting is teen-drama level, special effects are just...not right...for some reason, never quite figured out why. I basically thought that this movie was terrible, and could be made into a wonderful film given a different...well everyone! If say, someone like a Tim Burton would have done this movie, it probably would have been astounding. Unfortunately this movie doesn't deliver on the vast potential the story has. We could have had passionate and sultry vampire goings on within a wonderfully Gothic /classic American setting, but what we get instead is a mountain of teenie heart-throb stuff, and vampires never looked like they'd fit into a Norman Rockwell painting so well.. It's a pity, this movie could have been REALLY great. :-("
"lathespianage","5","9","19","1 December 2008"," Not worth the $12. (**SPOILER ALERT**)
","Where to start? The stark disappointments for leads? The ""this has to be a joke"" cinematography? The overall bland and uninteresting quality of the film as a whole? I mean, when I saw Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in the promo pics and the few relatively dialogue-less trailers for the movie, I was satisfied. They both got the look down (despite my personal distaste for Pattinson and his unruly physical appearance in real life), that was for sure. However that was really the extent of it. Though Pattinson was passable, Stewart was the big disappointment. Here she is, playing the lead heroine of the movie - someone who, no matter what the level of accuracy in relation to the book, is a fundamentally genuine, sweet, semi-naive and kind of socially awkward character. I didn't expect the movie to be exactly like the books or that it would follow every detail in them; I understand the limitations and difficulty of transitioning books into movies. And honestly, I thought the script was immaculately written for the big screen. There, I was impressed. HOWEVER, don't cast a girl who fails to grasp the essence of the character she is supposed to play and portray it convincingly. I'd rather have a girl who didn't quite resemble Bella as well physically, but who could embody the character sufficiently, over the opposite. Stewart's incredible awkwardness throughout the film that, though sometimes fitting with the character (in very few moments), was just overdone. She walked a very fine line between shy/awkward and awkward/bitchy. And never in the whole Twilight series (and a part that undeniably should have translated in the film) would you EVER think Bella is bitchy.<br/><br/>More oftentimes than not, in situations with movies like these the supporting cast seem to outshine the leads in terms of characterization and performance. The only exception was James, who totally didn't step up to the game. Which was a big bemusing to me after seeing Cam Gigandet's performance in ""Never Back Down"" He never provoked a single hair to rise in alarm. He just didn't scream 'Death Threat! Death Threat! DANGER!!!' to me. I was never worried after he showed up in the movie. They should have chosen someone who could really pull off being a supremely evil and sadistic villain. Another disappointment to add to the list. (As a semi-related-but-not-really side note: Bella's friend, Jessica, was ridiculously HILARIOUS. A fabulous comedic relief character. I just loved her! Wasn't exactly like the book, but who cares? She was just adorable!)<br/><br/>Now, one of my favourite characters in the Twilight series ... Jacob Black. I wasn't sure, when I saw Taylor Lautner cast as the wonderfully passionate ""werewolf"", if he could step up to the part. He really didn't look anything like Jacob to me. But I was pleasantly surprised. No, he's not identical to the Jacob I envision when I read the books, but who cares? That's never going to happen anyway. He did do a great job building the character with what little screen time he had, managing to slip in his little crush on Bella and that ice-cold glare at Edward at the end in like the total 15 minutes he was probably on the screen for. I look forward to seeing how he develops the character should the movie continue into a series.<br/><br/>But off of the casting and what REALLY bugged me about the movie. The filming itself failed to do any justice to the fabulously-written script. I really REALLY strongly believe if you're going to do a 360 shot around characters, you need a really really REALLY good reason to do it, and you can only do it once (sans flashbacks, maybe). That being said, the horribly executed, overdramatized 360 shot that I noticed in particular during the woods scene was just pointless and unprofessional. Not only that, they did waaay too many over-30-degree shots (for those who are unaware, what I'm referring to is when you make cuts in the same scene and the angle of the following cut is more than 30 degrees away from the original angle. Take my word for it, there's a reason it's a rule in media arts not to do it - it looks messy and awkward, not unlike the 360 shots.) Overall, the cinematography itself looked like a low-budget emo band's music video. Also, can I quickly mention, the soundtrack was so ... bad. Like actually. The only song I like from the movie soundtrack is Paramore's 'Decode' and that one didn't even come on in the film. The songs were random and completely unfitting and took away from the scenes and movie in general.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it like a 5 out of 10 stars. I was unentertained throughout most of the movie, and the only reason I finished it was the hope that there would be a turning moment where I'd go ""Oh. Well that was worth it."" And as a fan, I just needed to see the whole thing. Disappointment, the repetitive word I keep returning too, is the sum of it. Worst of all, the excess cheese they put into some scenes (like where Edward 'exposes' himself to Bella in the sunlight and then they lie in the meadow and stare at each other - gag me NOW.) never for a second convinced me that this was an eternal, true, binding, timeless love ... it felt like two actors feebly attempting to play it out that way. And that's just the worst thing for a movie to ever allow."
"verite98","5","9","19","21 November 2008"," Twilight - a review from a non-fanatic
","I am not really a fan of Twilight or the series. I have read all four books out of curiosity and I do admit that the first book is pretty good. However, I haven't followed Twilight as obsessively as I have with Harry Potter. I did watch the midnight showing of it - a friend had an extra ticket so why not? - but I already planned to watch it because I am a Kristen Stewart fan, and was curious about how Robert Pattinson would be like as a lead. Though screaming fan girls did ruin parts of the movie for me - I have to say that I was not as impressed with the film as I wish I should have been. Firstly, the trailers set a very somber, moody, atmospheric tone that I expected to be played out throughout the movie. Instead, the movie ended up being more comedic than I expected. It was a surprising, and a nice change. The script was awful. Though Catherine Hardwicke said in an interview she had the script rewritten to be more true to the book, the lines could not have been more cheesy. They may have come straight from the book but in the book, it made more sense. The script did not seem to build up enough of Bella's interest in Edward - rather, she seemed more or less apathetic and cautious towards him rather than completely drawn in. This can be either due to Kristen Stewart's acting skills or due to the script; I like to think that the script did not give Kristen enough to build on to make it more understandable why she said certain things. In addition, though it was necessary to cut a lot of things out because of time constraints, I felt that if you had never read the books then you would not be able to understand the characters' lines. And the voice overs? effective for some parts - not effective when Bella listed her three things that she was positively sure about. That was too much exposition without enough visual elements to support it. I also would have liked to see more about their courtship - I felt the only scene that really supported it was when he drove Bella to school one day. Then the next thing I knew, she was meeting the family - HUH!? Too sudden and again - not enough build-up. If you're going to build up the whole ""stay away from me but can't help it"" part, then you should build up the whole ""i think we're soul mates"" part. Catherine Hardwicke's style of directing was also very distracting. She had too many close- ups and too many camera movements. And the one time that she lets the camera be still during the ballet studio scene where Bella was bitten - that was the one time she should have been moving the camera and going in and out of focus. The actors on the other hand were perfect. Not just physically, but also acting wise - I think each actor was able to fully embrace their characters and act exactly how I would have expected them to act based on the book.... that glare that Taylor Lautner/Jacob Black gave Edward Cullen at prom - INTENSE! Jasper was the best - you could completely tell about his conflicted state and pain that he had to undergo - I truly wish he had more lines though and would not be stuck as a visual comedic relief for audiences. One scene I was most disappointed with was the sparkling-Edward scene. I had the impression that he was going to sparkle EVEN MORE than he really did, and not look SCALY. In addition - I think Stephenie Meyers' cameo was such a campy, unnecessary move - totally made for the pleasure of fans and if you were not a fan or did not know who she was, then the meaning of it would have been completely lost on you. It can't really stand alone as a movie - so much of it rests on the assumption that the audiences have background knowledge of the story. II felt that there was also greater emphasis on the sexual tension between Bella and Edward instead. The extreme close-ups, the lustful glances, the broodiness... really. Now if you spend your time showing off the undeniable chemistry to the point that it looks like sexually-repressed-virgins on screen AND insist that they truly love each other as soul mates BUT give no spoken evidence supporting that... then the movie just cannot stand alone. It has a story - but a very shallow and fragmented one at that.<br/><br/>So overall - I'd say that I was not very impressed with this movie given all its hype. I might buy the DVD though - sure I'll admit that - to check out the director's commentary and ogle at the great acting of the cast. But story wise - so terribly disappointing an adaptation. It was almost as laughable as The Golden Compass. And look at how that ""series"" turned out..."
"colorfulreverie","5","9","19","21 November 2008"," Not the worst movie in the world, but not that great.
","I have read the books before entering the movie theater to see this production with not much hope of it being great. But, in the end, I did end up enjoying certain parts and aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>And I should definitely note before I go further...if you are one of those teenage girls who thoroughly enjoyed the book, you will enjoy this movie. Not necessarily because of the acting, but because the movie seemed to try to stay as close to the book (both in terms of the plot, and how it was presented). And of course, there are many gorgeous actors in the movie.<br/><br/>For myself, I honestly was not a huge fan of the books, or the movie. Edward acted a lot differently than I thought he would and his acting was a little deadpan at times, but I do believe he did a better job in showing more emotion than his co-star, Bella. She was very pretty, and certainly looks how I imagined Bella to look, but her acting wasn't nearly dynamic enough to pull of Bella's character. She seemed to deliver most of her lines the same way...no matter what the occasion--and she always had the same look on her face.<br/><br/>I do give props to a few of the supporting actors who I thought did a great job--such as Bella's father, Carlisle, and Alice. I thought the cinematography was stunning. I would've liked to see more effects, but the film was shot very, very beautifully, especially the scenes out in the forest. Another huge strong point of the movie was the humor. There are a few cute wisecracks that made it a little more enjoyable for me as well.<br/><br/>However, the stoic dialogue and the weak acting of the two main characters really offset the strong points of the movie for me. The movie also felt as if it had no real climax--it didn't come remotely close to having as colorful a plot as the series. They also glanced over a lot of the relationship developments in the movie. I won't spoil what happens, but some of the relationships went from hostile to friendly, or uncertain to best friends in a snap with no real depiction of how the relationship came to develop that way.<br/><br/>I believe the fact that the movie tried to stay as close to the book may have lead to the blandness of the plot. Most of the book occurred within the minds of the characters, and it's really difficult to show that on screen without voice overs. I think they should have had more dialogue (or at least richer dialogue) between the characters to make up for this. Also, I think they should have depicted the relationship between other characters in the movie besides Bella and Edward. I know the whole tale is about them, but it would've really helped the tension to see where the other people stand with the two main characters and amongst themselves.<br/><br/>And again, a huge thing that would've helped the movie is more dynamic acting on the part of Edward and Bella, and showing more of the development of their relationship.<br/><br/>So, for me anyway, the movie wasn't painful to sit through, but I would not consider it a good movie. If you've read the books, I think it's worth seeing in theaters, if you haven't...eh, wait 'til it comes out on video. In general, the people who I've talked to who hadn't read the book and saw the movie said it was ""extremely cheesy"" and it ""dragged and felt as if nothing really happened."" But they did enjoy the little bits of humor and the cinematography."

","This is possibly a contender for the worst book to film adaption ever. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's absolutely impossible to say. So many little details and so many large ones...there's so many problems with this movie that you really can't tell them all. First off is the acting, I'm not even going to bother naming the actors because they were so god-awful that it would be an insult to them to name them. Let's just say the actor who played Edward was trying way too hard to be good that it ended up worse than if he had really tried. And whoever played Bella was just so bad that it almost worked in her favor, her playing a teenager and all. The special effects were reaching for a, it's so bad-it's-good vibe, but they just couldn't reach it. The moment with Edward in the sun is particularly cheesy. Those are the main problems besides the fact that the whole story is completely skewed. I still don't know how the books became popular, but they really weren't any good to begin with. Taking a bad book and making it into a film will always end in disastrous results. When will Hollywood realize that?"

","This was by far the worst movie based on a book that I have ever seen.I would go as far to say that it is one of the worst movies period!! I am not quite sure what some people are referring to when they speak of the 'magic' and 'chemistry' between Edward and Bella because all I saw was complete indifference. Though Bella's character could be characterized as somewhat stoic, she is also sarcastic, witty, clever, clumsy,self conscious and extremely perceptive- none of which was illustrated by the clearly one dimensional acting. Her expressions and tone remained static throughout the entire movie except for the deplorable and extremely laughable hospital scene where she feels she may lose Edward together. UNCONVINCING!!<br/><br/>Edward was too obvious in his animation and never seemed like a vampire trying to blend with humans. Instead he looked like a human trying to look and act like a vampire. This in part was due to the amateur makeup application. He is suppose to be the pillar of beauty...what with the stubble, the lipstick, and whats with the white makeup applied ONLY to his face (you can clearly see that his neck and arms are a different colour). <br/><br/>I felt that most of the other actors supported there characters fairly well except Rosalie who definitely did not awe me with her beauty and grace nor bitchiness. <br/><br/>The story line moved so quickly and erraticaly that had i not read the books I would have been confused as to many reactions and scene changes. For instance, when Bella and Edward were at the bus to go?? -Edward tells Bella they shouldn't be friends with her replying its a little too late for that......FOR WHAT??? They had barely strung to sentences together and now they are FRIENDS?? There trip to Port Angeles was also strange and erratic. What happened to Angela and Jessica and why is Bella suddenly walking alone,and WHO IS ANGELA for that matter, I hardly recall them even introducing her, and definitely not enough that the unread would be able call her by name. Questions that non twilight readers may be asking.<br/><br/>All in all the movie lacked character and plot development. It left too many holes for the audience to fill in themselves. I am glad I read the series before watching the movie because I doubt I would have bothered reading the books after watching the movie. <br/><br/>Hopefully they will increase there budget for the next movie so that there will be qualified and skilled people employed to enhance cinematography, lighting, makeup artists, editors....well everything. While there waiting hopefully some of the actors can go take some more lessons and maybe read the book!!!"

","Okay, I love the Twilight series and I practically killed to get all the books. Now with that said I thought the movie was going to be better than it was. It looked like it was sloppily put together and then there were scenes in the book that were major to the book that were either altered or just in general cut. Like for example, Bella never entered the bookstore that's why she was down an abandoned area. And when Bella tells Edward that she found out the he's a vampire they were in a car. And what happened to the meadow scene?! It was where they declared their love to one another. That was one of the most major scenes!!! That and to me Alice was odd, quirky, but not hyper enough. Rosalie was okay and Emmett was...odd. Jasper was okay and Carlisle and Esme were probably the best (though Carlisle's make up was a bit heavy) And on a random note: Is it me or does Robert Pattison have a big head? I mean I keep on waiting for her to tip over or something."
"simplydani99","3","88","277","21 November 2008"," What a letdown
","To be honest, I was extremely disappointed with the way this movie turned out.<br/><br/>The hype for it was monumental and I am a die-hard fan of the series myself so I expected a lot from it. I'm still in shock with how fantastically horrible it turned out.<br/><br/>The acting, for one, has to be the worst I have ever seen. Robert Patterson was supposedly perfect for the part of Edward, but not only was he not handsome enough to be Edward but he completely butchered all the lines that Edward had in the novel. His voice was too slow and hesitant, whereas Edward was supposed to be composed and highly intelligent. The changes that he underwent in the novel were not at all apparent once they were transferred to the screen. As for the part of Bella, Kristen Stewart suited Bella very well physically, but when it came to acting she also fell short. Her speech was consistently monotone and both her and Edward had a problem with saying the word ""um"" or pausing abruptly when there should be lines filled with quirky sayings or questions that they throw at each other. Most of the other actors were actually okay, but the lack of skill portrayed by the two main stars completely ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>The scenes were also very different from the book. Perhaps showing multiple scenes of the mountains and the lake and trees was the Director's way of distracting the viewer from the horrendous slaughter of the Twilight novel that this movie was? Not only was the high school a LARGE high school, unlike that in the book, but very few scenes took place in there. No lunchroom chats between Bella and Edward took place except for one short one while standing in line. The Biology scene where they meet was excessively melodramatic and almost sickening in its portrayal of their initial reactions to each other. The majority of the scenes took place in the surrounding forest, which honestly did not play a large part in the book. Plenty of other scenes are butchered by this movie, but the worst one of all was the field scene where Bella and Edward were to have their first date. Rather then make it as romantic and planned as they had it in the story, they introduce this scene by having Bella somehow magically walk all the way from her school up into the woods where she tells him that she knows he's a vampire and then he drags her up to a field to show her what he looks like in the light. They have a short confrontation (that does follow the lines in the book, but is acted so horrendously that I many women in the theatre groaned with dismay) in which Edward pulls a tree up and then they lay down (in an extremely uncomfortable and unnatural position) and the scene ends.<br/><br/>The melodramatic nature of the entire movie, heightened by a score that was not at all suited for the true nature of Twilight, was a complete mood-killer. Even the action scenes were very old-fashioned and could have been done with better technology and filming. Overall, it was a huge letdown. I have to say that I don't think I'll ever be able to read Twilight again. This movie is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. Plenty of you fans can attack me for this comment, but the simply fact of the matter is that the Twilight movie could have and should have been so much better."

","Im sorry but i don't understand you guys who are being so negative! Remember your imagination is a VERY powerful tool so a film is never ever going to beat a book and that is the case with twilight, but come on!!! the film is excellent! <br/><br/>If you go in there to watch it and just sit there comparing it to the book then of course you are going to be disappointed!! its never going to be exactly as you imagined it!! I think they did so well with the 2hours that they had- very well cast and i liked the way they made links with the next books for the die hard fans (like me!!)<br/><br/>I can rarely watch a film over and over again but I've already watched this 3 times and intend to again very very soon! <br/><br/>If you want to go and watch twilight don't go in there expecting anything, just sit back and enjoy it for what it is and you wont be disappointed!<br/><br/>I cant wait for the next one!!!!"

","""Twilight"" is a flatfooted, pedestrian, earthbound, dull movie. Which is odd, because it's about a teen girl who falls in love with a vampire. I mean, ""The Exorcist,"" about a teen girl who turns into Satan, was so incredibly exciting, scary, controversial. Is this movie so bad because Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of teen girls? Hollywood cranks out blockbuster after blockbuster for teen boys, all with huge budgets, innovative art design, and high production values. ""Twilight"" is a dull little trifle that could have been shot by an amateur cast and crew with hand held cameras. The soap opera, ""Dark Shadows,"" had more going for it than this. In fact, skip this non-entity and watch ""Dark Shadows"" on youtube, or ""Death Takes a Holiday,"" starring Frederic March. That handled the ""young girl wants to have intimate relations with really bad boy"" so much better than this movie does.<br/><br/>Not much of anything happens. Kirsten Stewart is Bella. Stewart may have given the single most annoying, PMS, chronically depressed and droopy teen girl performance in film history (and that's saying a lot). Even in a scene meant to be romantic, where her boyfriend plays piano for her, she has a look of vague disgust and catatonia on her droopy face. Be honest ¬ñ don't you just want to slap some life into this chick? At her high school, Bella stares at a guy named Edward. Edward is very pale, wears heavy lipstick, and tweezes his eyebrows. By staring at him, she falls in love with him. Nothing happens between them before she falls in love. No witty repartee, no heroic deeds, no sharing of day to day life, no thrilling, teasing competition to see who wears the pants in the relationship, no heartwarming discovery of shared interests and goals. She just stares at him, and that's it. So much for sweeping us off our feet.<br/><br/>Edward and Bella have endless, dull, flatfooted conversations. ""Oh, you are a vampire."" ""Yes, I am a vampire."" ""Do you drink human blood."" ""No¬Ötofu metaphor."" I wish she had AT LEAST asked for recipes.<br/><br/>No mystery. No magic. No imagination. No cool special effects. No haunting evocation of the wilder, darker side. Just the most boring, lifeless ¬ñ in all the wrong ways ¬ñ movie.<br/><br/>Teen girls, please don't be satisfied with these crumbs Hollywood is tossing you. Demand better."
"superbrian","5","8","17","23 November 2008"," Interesting ideas but poorly executed
","Judging by the commentary and discussion of the movie I've seen so far, I think it's important to say that I have NOT read the books, though I've heard good things. Therefore I can only judge by its actual merits as a film.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was lackluster, to say the least. The story made sense, though it was incredibly rushed. There were several cringe-worthy lines, possibly because they were not properly delivered or were not in context with the book. (""You're my own personal brand of heroine"").<br/><br/>The movie was marketed to appear much more action-oriented that it actually is. That is an understandable attempt to sell tickets, and is not the fault of the artists involved in the film. But when that situation happens, there are going to be disappointed viewers and negative reviews.<br/><br/>In the end, Twilight seems like more of a made-for-TV movie than a theatrical release. There were too many characters, and none with any real depth. An intriguing character would be introduced, and never to be heard from again. These are common problems in films made from very detailed and enthralling books. As a person who never read Twilight, I can still tell that the movie tries to do too much in too little time, resulting in a shallow film that, while based on interesting concepts, leaves the viewer with no real connection."
"audreyvendetta","4","8","17","22 November 2008"," Not what I expected...
","I watched the movie yesterday evening and I was really, really excited to see it, but in the end it was not was I expected. I knew from the very beginning, that this movie will not be like the book, but I don't know what they did to that beautiful book... As someone, who did not read the book, I can imagine some parts where hardly to understand - for example Bella's Lullaby - they didn't mentioned it and to me it seemed forced in that movie. But let's start at the very beginning.<br/><br/>The opening scene was okay. But then it starts - and on this point I have to say I'm a huge fan of details - why did Billy and Jacob came? They got introduced much later in the book. And why the heck is Jacob such a sweet, little boy? I totally imagined him different and honestly, why couldn't he just wear his hair closed, like in the book? The wig was pretty nasty by the way. Bella in school - everyone had kinda fancy cars, totally strange for Forks. Her human friends were okay, I guess, but were were Lauren? It's not like I ever liked that girl, but she was just part of the group.<br/><br/>I liked Bellas and Edwards first meeting in Biology, that was kinda funny and very well played - but boy everything was so fast. I didn't had the feeling that Edward was gone for a few days. The hole movie I had the feeling they were in a total rush. Did anyone mentioned the missing Emmett scene from the Teaser Trailer? I really wanted to see that scene (""She's not one of us!"") but they just cutted it.<br/><br/>What I really hate about that movie, is that the Cullens didn't had such an important part. I love the Cullens, but where the hell have they been in the hole movie? And why had Alice such a small role - she is so important for Bella, I mean they're going to be best friends. I as a huge Jasper fan was totally disappointed, that they didn't filmed the hotel scene :( Man Jasper just had three sentences or so... disappointing.<br/><br/>Another thing what I was asking myself, why did Bella had to buy the Quileutebook? In the book Google was enough. And while I'm just writing about the Quileute, why did Sam looked like a ugly, little boy? Man he is much older as the others and he always looked grown and mature and in the movie? Aye... poor Sam, in my imagination he always looked pretty masculine and strong... Also Bella knew that Edward is a vampire, after Jake told her the legends.<br/><br/>Oh and the meadow scene... CATASTROHE! Boy that scene is so important in the book, in the movie it was about 10 seconds, the meadow was pretty small and not very beautiful and Edward... boy he was barley sparkling... man I always imagined it like he was going to like a prism and the light breaks in him and he looks pretty beautiful... but in the movie... the people in Volterra would barley recognize the sparkling young vampire in part two... that was just bad. If there haven't been the sound, I don't know I have even recognized...<br/><br/>Then the Cullens house... why was is not white? Were has Esmes song been? Why did nobody said, that Edward was playing Bellas lullaby? How should a not book reader know? Why was Emmetts Jeep white and not red? Why did Bella didn't wear something blue, the first time she went to Edwards home. Wh didn't they showed Carlisles office with the picture from Volterra and Aro, Caius and Marcus? Why did James bit Bella in her arm and not in her hand? Where was the airport scene? Where was the hotel scene, where were all my Jasper scenes? Why did they killed so many people - I mean with James and his coven? Why did they had such a big role? Nonsense.... why did the directly showed the relationship between Victoria and James, which is not solved before Bella met Laurent again... ( in the book)where was Taylor asking Bella for the prom (i loved that scene in the book) - where have been all the conversations between Edward an Bella? Why didn't kissed Edward Bella Goodbye? THis kiss was so important.. just for the second book, when he's gone again... And then to go back to Jasper and Alice, hell why did Bella know Alice visions, if the didn't showed the scene (when she tells Edward, that Alice saw Bella becoming on of them). Why did Alice didn't have black hair? Ashley was wearing a wig, why couldn't she wear a black one? And also at the first hospital scene, where has Edward been? The biology Blood incident? And.. and.. and... so many missing things... and some where so small that nobody would get hurt, if they just had changed it.<br/><br/>Oh and the prom... hello? Where have the others been? I was soooo disappointed with that scene... and then the Victoria scene at the end... unnecessary!!<br/><br/>I'm so not happy with that movie... :( I really wanna know how many deleted scenes are there...<br/><br/>Edit: I watched the movie a second time, with a friend and I recognized more missing elements. Nothing got mentioned about Alices past - i mean James ""confesses"" to Bella, that he was tracking Alice and that she was his only victim which survived, because her Vampirefriend changed her. Also Edward didn't mentioned Jaspers special abilities, which are also very important (and it would also show Jasper more often in the movie)."
"angenuit","5","8","17","21 November 2008"," Not quite what I'd hoped for
","I went into this movie knowing it wasn't going to be as good as the book, but I'm sad to say that it was one of my least favourite book-to-movies I've seen. The Twilight series, while not necessarily the most extraordinarily written books, are captivating because of the true humanness and relatability of the characters (even those that aren't human), and the tension and emotion that you feel throughout all of the books. For me, this is the element that the movie truly lacked.<br/><br/>Firstly, the script was awful at times. The actors seemed awkward, and a lot of their lines seemed very forced. The dialogue was not natural, and seemed to be trying to make small-town kids sound like they came from a major city, perhaps to make them more relatable. The effect was just awkward conversations that had me laughing in embarrassment.<br/><br/>The interactions between the characters were awkward as well. I don't know if that was because the actors didn't know each other well and didn't have any connections or just bad casting, but I hardly felt any chemistry between most of the characters, and you hardly get a sense for who any of the human characters really are. There was something off between Bella and Edward, a weird tension that's quite different from the romantic tension felt in the book after Edward's secret is out in the open. The only interactions I really believed were between the Cullens. You both get a sense of family dynamic and the separate relationships in the family, not just between the couples, but the hatred between Rosalie and Edward and Jasper not quite fitting in with the family just yet. The baseball scene, with only the vampires and Bella seemed to me the most natural, and was certainly my favourite.<br/><br/>I found myself laughing at the movie in the most awkward of places, such as the action or romance scenes. I feel like the movie took itself too seriously; the actions scenes were unbelievably tense, even in a movie about deadly vampires, and the romance scenes were so cheesy and clich√© at times that I just couldn't help but laugh. If you're going to have that much drama in a movie, you have to tone it down or else it gets overwhelming and makes it seem like the people behind the movie are just trying too hard. The books were much more subtle, though I understand with a limited amount of time it is harder to get some things across.<br/><br/>Something seemed incredibly off about Bella. In the books, Bella is a bit sarcastic with a very stubborn edge, who can't see her own weaknesses or even the true danger that she is in. The Bella in the movie was fully aware of Edward's deadly potential, but didn't seem to care. The scene when Edward is trying to prove to her that he is dangerous while Bella simply stands there, looking and sounding like she's about to scream and run away but saying that she doesn't care makes her look less like she's desperately in love with Edward and more like she's just stupid. A few of the other characters, such as Angela and Edward, seemed off too, something that became rather distracting after a while. Only the Cullens seemed to me to be as close to their characters in the books as they could be.<br/><br/>I can only hope that New Moon will have both a different director and writer. Perhaps the actors will feel more comfortable with each other the second time around, and hopefully the dialogue will be more natural. The movie wasn't terrible, but it didn't live up to the book at all, even with the limitations of time. I believe that for those who have read the book, the movie will be so-so, with some parts that you are able to appreciate, and others that you feel embarrassed about, but for those who haven't read the book, I think this movie will be a bit confusing and have you wondering why so many people are into Twilight."
"terror_adagio","4","9","20","29 November 2008"," I love you so much, I want to eat you for dinner!
","You can totally tell this was originally a novel, because it lacks anything really filmic at all. You could tell it was from the mind of an obvious soap opera loving female author. I went into this film having never heard of Twilight before and having gone with two fans. I came out of the film with a two for one really in how not to make a love story and vampire film.<br/><br/>Here are some tips for if you WANT to make a bad love story/vampire film like Twilight: 1. Have countless scenes of your lead actors just staring at each other in a large room. This was really quite ridiculous. It is so clich√© and how shallow can you be to believe that is what falling in love is. Staring. Absolutely boring. This is why the film clocked in at a needless 2hr running time.<br/><br/>2. Write terrible clich√© dialogue for your leads. I don't know how many times I had to hear such contrived dialogue. The scene for example where Bella is in the forest with Edward telling him she knows what he is. It screams being artificial. And plus, throughout the whole film we know already and you would have to be stupid in this day of age to not know immediately. It was so bad in parts people in the audience were laughing. One part I never understood was the amount of times Edward came up to Bella and said you have to stay away from me and Bella would respond, no I don't want to stay away from you. From what I could see, Bella did a good job in the beginning of keeping her distance and it was Edward who would constantly come up to speak with her.<br/><br/>3. Rewrite vampire mythology.... badly. Your skin looks like diamonds in the sunlight? Excuse me? This was the kicker for the outbursts of laughter in the theater. Maybe it works better on the page or something, but visually this looked stupid. And am I expected to believe anyway that this town has a cloud of overcast the whole time? Not buying it. And when you are turned into a vampire you immediately become pretty? Um... okay then.<br/><br/>4. Have one of your characters in love with the other person and the other person in love with eating them. Did Edward ever say he loved Bella? Actually did Bella really ever say she loved Edward? For me, I never got any great sense that this was love between them. Edward really just wants to eat Bella throughout the film, but for some reason doesn't want to. I guess there is nothing more romantic than portraying your love than telling them how hard it is not to eat them for dinner. What a turn on. And Bella gives off the impression she just has the hots for the hot guy at high school and wants to have sex with him.<br/><br/>5. To give off the impression you are still making a vampire film show off their powers in a baseball game. I admit, I did enjoy the scene a bit. But really it was just an excuse to inject some kind of action in this otherwise pretty much anemic action film.<br/><br/>There is much more but I restrained myself to five. As the credits rolled, I begun to wonder if having three main creatives being women actually hurt this film. Its quite clear the director and screenwriter being women was not a coincidence. I asked one of my female friends why did they think they hired them. Their response was that maybe because women understand love and romanticism more. I laughed at this response and began to think how absurd a response that could be, considering the majority of the greatest love stories ever told were written by men. I cited Romeo and Juliet on the novel side (a clear inspiration for this story and a bad one at that) and James Cameron's Titantic on the film side. Perhaps what this film needed to make it a bit better was more testosterone in the mix. By the way, the two Twilight fans were also quite disappointed with the film.<br/><br/>The choice of lead actors is quite poor. Never have I seen such boring leads in a teen-aged aimed film. Kristen Stewart is young and fresh, but completely lacks any personality. Throughout the film she plays the same dull emotion. Her character is also fairly unlikeable considering how much she ignores everyone else around her other than the dead guy. There are any number of other young actresses who could have better played that role. Robert Pattinson has the same problems as Kristen Stewart, although more interesting to watch, his dialogue is constantly forced, but so is the writing, so it is a double edge sword constantly.<br/><br/>On the technical side, the cinematography was hideous. I couldn't tell the humans from the vampires since everyone looked pale. I have heard a sequel is going to be made and I would think it could only get better, because I wouldn't want to think it could get worse. However, the people in charge of this would be better served at bringing in a whole new creative team who actually understand how to tell a proper love story and exciting vampire film and a proper lead cast who equally understand. There are much better vampire films out there people and equally better romantic films.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 If the film didn't have that short but fun scene with the vampires trying to play normal humans at the house while meeting Bella for the first time, it would have got 3 out of 10."

They are very compatible and you can feel the emotions and the chemistry between both. I hope all books comes on the big screen . And don't forget it was a low budget film. And all are very, very young actors at the beginning of their career.They still need to gain experience. I'm sure they gets better and better with each part of the saga.

","I watched the film prior to reading the book. I watched it thinking it would be some crappy, mystical rubbish because my friend wanted to see it. It got my attention from the first second. The style of the film was encapturing, the ""quiet"" feel to the acting drew me in completely, it was true directing talent. I don't know what people are saying when they can emotionally connect with the screen version of Edward Cullen. I don't think I could connect so well in the book, had I not seen the film. As for the character of Bella, she cannot think on screen, therefore some element of her would inevitably be lost, but it has been managed to the extent that you can understand and feel the love they share."

"joestank15","5","6","12","12 December 2008"," Entertaining, albeit completely unintentionally.
","Twilight - Based on the popular children's novels, Twilight is about high schooler Bella (Kristen Stewart), the palest resident of Arizona ever, as she moves to be the palest non-vampire in Washington. She meets smoldering young-looking vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and the two have the most awkward courtship in the history of film. Then he fights some of the most ridiculous and un-scary looking vampires ever to grace the silver screen with their presence.<br/><br/>That's really all there is to the plot, and man is it stretched over two hours. Luckily, the film is hilarious, albeit entirely unintentionally. All intentional attempts at humor fall flat. Basically Twilight seizes you with it's big awkward fist immediately, and rarely lets go. The best example (and there are many) is Bella's relationship with her dad, the always uncomfortable looking Billy Burke. There are spaces between their lines that you could drive a truck through. It's all just painfully awkward.<br/><br/>Some things kept running through my mind. Edward is supposed to have spent 108 years on this planet. In those 108 years, couldn't he have picked up some basic social skills? Pattinson seems to have watched Charlie Sheen's performance in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" for research on the undead, because he spends most of the film staring bug-eyed like he's strung out on meth. He gets the American accent all right, and that's the best I can give him. He's supposed to be cool. He's often just antisocial and creepy, especially with lines like ""I enjoy watching you sleep."" This line was hilarious by the way, and there are many that are almost as good. He has absolutely nothing interesting to say, and the makeup people have covered him in glitter for his sunlight scenes, presumably as the final rite of emasculation.<br/><br/>I expect so much more from Melissa Rosenberg, a writer on my favorite show Dexter. Stick with TV honey! Teen fantasy does your creepy off-beat writing no favors. I think the script was about 70 pages long, so they filled the rest with awkward silence, during which everyone seems to be struggling for their next line. Sweet jeepers, half the responses the actors give each other aren't even human sounding. What I said for Rosenberg goes for amateurish director Catherine Hardwicke, who should stick with her day job of production designer. She cannot film action or direct actors to save her soul. She has tried to give this the feel of teen angst but has instead come up with an awkward monstrosity that could put the combined talents of Michael Cera and Larry David to shame.<br/><br/>Bella is boring and, as mentioned, criminally pale. She's pretty, but I hate her, and her voice is bothersome. It's annoying to have followed a character that does not seem to give a crap about anything, and spends the entire film frowning. She also has the keen observational abilities of a squirrel for not guessing Ed was a vampire, or at least some sort of freakish being, two seconds after he stops a car with his hand. Neither does this freak out or intrigue anyone else in the vicinity, strangely. It's not Ed's weird behavior, aversion to sunlight or mind reading skills but his cold skin that tells Bella he's a vampire, thanks to the magic of Google. Thanks Google! It's so campy, silly and shoddily made that I should hate this film by all standards, but I had a great time. Ironically the less attached to the books the more fun you'll have. I'd give it a D for all fans but the youngest and most devoted. I haven't read the books but I'm sure it has been ripped to shreds on the journey to the film. But I had an wonderful time laughing at the film, minus puncturing points of boredom and a few times where I looked at my watch.

","Twilight follows Bella, a high schooler who, upon moving to a new town, falls in love with a boy at her school. However, as they grow closer she begins to realize that there's more to him than she initially thought. <br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie there's a part of the climax that, although I knew exactly how it would end, put me slightly on edge. I felt a little tense and worried for the characters. <br/><br/>Other then that, this movie is a steaming pile of poop. <br/><br/>Where to start, the writing, how about there. Holy cow, it's awful. From start to finish every line of dialogue is absolutely awful. Everything sounds extremely scripted and unnatural. You could argue that its the actors, but trust me, I'll get to that. Most of the lines are far to elaborate and poetic to sound like a real conversation. <br/><br/>Now the characters. Flat. That's all I can think of. There's no character development, everything the characters say is important to the story. No one has any real conversations about stuff that isn't really important. While it is possible to develop a character while they explain things, this movie is incapable of understanding that fact. The characters present every line of information with little to no emotion, and it sheds little on who that person actually is. Furthermore, the characters act like they have fallen in love, and the movie acts like that's true, and yet the main characters have zero chemistry and no development of their relationship. Whenever the movie has the opportunity to develop them it just skips past it, or shows montages of them talking with music over it, so they aren't actually saying anything that we as an audience can hear. And yet I'm supposed to believe that these people are in love? That's unlikely. By the end I felt absolutely nothing for these characters. Even as I write this I feel nothing. <br/><br/>Now on to the acting. To start, I like Kristen Stewart. I've seen some of her newer movies and I've liked her. But she's embarrassingly bad in this movie. She makes these weird moans/snickers/groans or something before and/or after every single line of dialogue, and whenever she talks she shakes and moves her head awkwardly. Its super distracting and awkward, and if she's trying to play a socially inept character then she's doing a horrible job of it. Besides, its clear that she isn't socially inept. She's able to talk to people right off the bat of meeting them pretty easily, and somehow manages to fall for a boy in half a school semester. Not that that means a whole lot, though. There were even a handful of scenes where I started laughing at how bad her delivery was. Every other actor is, while not as bad as Stewart, pretty mediocre. Anna Kendrick in particular doesn't suit her role. <br/><br/>Whenever the vampires fight or move the movie uses special effects to make it look like they're moving faster, but it just looks cheap and dumb, and really doesn't add a whole lot to the movie. If anything, it makes it feel more like an anime, only it's live action. Yeah, those always turn out good. <br/><br/>When the climax finally rolls around it's stupid. It's so incredibly rushed, forced, and unexplained that it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Like the movie suddenly realized: ""Oh shoot, we need an action-packed climax for this vampire movie. Let's just throw some more vampires in and make them fight for some unexplainable and stupid reason."" It's just so out of nowhere. Now I don't usually have a problem with climaxes that just kind of come out of nowhere, but this movie rushed into it so fast and treated it like it was a developed conflict that had been building up for this entire 2 hour movie. <br/><br/>Yes, this movie is 2 hours. How it pulls that off, I haven't the slightest clue. The worst thing is, it only gets worse. While its not exactly boring, it does start down that path towards the end. <br/><br/>Overall Twilight is one of the most unpleasant movies I've ever seen. The acting is wooden, the writing is awful, the characters are flat, the climax is awful, and so is basically everything else. The only reason this review isn't longer or more elaborate is because I simply can't remember everything and I'm not really in the mood to write a long review right now. Plus I feel like I'm just rewriting what so many others already have said. In the end, this movie is awful. Don't watch it."
"roedyg","7","4","7","26 September 2014"," much better than I expected
","As a gay 66 year old man, I am clearly not part of the intended audience for this film, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The film is filled with handsome teenage males, and many homely ugly- Betty goonily-dressed females, including the lead Bella. The boys either strut around looking pretty, with blank expressions, like runway models, or they act like silly hyper active grade 4 school boys. The boys are so inept in their attempts to impress the girls. Bella rudely dismisses them all with a look that says, ""You have got to be kidding. You thought I would have anything to do with you?""<br/><br/>Bella is cranky, rude, not very bright, without interests, hobbies or talents. However, she is new to the school, which gives her some appeal.<br/><br/>Edward, is considered the ultimate dreamboat by all the girls, but he allegedly considers himself too good for any of them. I thought the explanation was that he gay, but it turned it out was because he was a vampire.<br/><br/>All the ugly girls get cute boyfriends in the end, but that fantasy- fulfilment story is very much in the background.<br/><br/>To my great surprise the plot of the first half of the film unfolds with the ponderousness of a Jane Austen novel. I never expected that from a teen movie. There is great push pull between Edward and Bella. Edward is trying to control his urges to kill Bella and drink her blood. Bella blithely ignores what he is telling her. The reticence builds an incredible tension. It is similar to the sort of tension people in an earlier day felt trying to avoid sex before marriage or gay sex.<br/><br/>What makes no sense is why Edward is attracted to Bella but not the other girls. I decided to pretend it had to do with scent or some vampire-only discernible attribute. The real reason has to do with fantasy fulfilment.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson does a brilliant job of portraying Edward the vampire. His approach is similar to Stephen Moyer playing the courtly vampire Bill Compton in True Blood. He is calm, patient, breathy, intense, old- fashioned. He is handsome, but in an almost non-human sort of way.<br/><br/>At one point he says roughly, ""I am the most dangerous predator on the planet. Even my face, by voice and my scent are designed to lure victims."" You look at him, and imagine his exotic scent, he is speaking literal truth. It is like an electric shock. Photographs of him are not sufficient to show what I am talking about.<br/><br/>Like the Superman I movie, Edward gradually reveals his powers to Bella. Unlike Lois Lane, Bella is completely unimpressed.<br/><br/>The movie shifts gears to comedy, when Edward takes Bella home to meet the ""family"".<br/><br/>Then the movie shifts gears again, stealing the special effects from Superman II, where the titans battle.<br/><br/>Bella always chooses the most dangerous possible thing to do at each stage. It obviously helps the plot, but it made me want to smack her for being so stupid.<br/><br/>Bella within almost minutes of meeting Edward decided she wants marry him. Then a week or so later she decides even marriage is not sufficient commitment. The want him to commit for eternity of life as a vampire. The belief that there was only one true love for me caused me untold misery. I might even go so far as to say it ruined my life. I hate seeing that poison being sold to unsuspecting young girls."

","It was hard to believe my eyes.All my class has been talking about that movie for weeks and when i finally saw it , i just felt that i badly need fresh air outside the cinema.Still i pulled myself together and stayed to the end.I must admit that i haven't read the book but many things about vampire nature surprised me.First i found out that on sun light vampires sparkle better than just-cleaned bathroom...and they have no teeth so children better throw away your vampire teeth for the next Halloween, you don't want to be out of date don't you.The so called romance was terrible, i don't know why but i didn't feel one bit of real emotion, they didn't even kiss normally (don't count the final kiss).Now about the white faces, it's OK for the vampires they're dead anyway but the whole high school was like some kind of Nazi-Gothic heaven.Some might say this was the rainiest town in the country, yes but that white color of theirs is just like ill(or dead) person O_o. The acting was wooden few times but after all I've said it was supportable.Unfortunately the storyline wasn't.The whole idea of vampire-human relationship is quite familiar to the public (at least to me) and the end was confusing i mean i really though he will bite her and they'd live happily ever after.I really hope that the book is better.<br/><br/>my score 3/10"

","I cannot believe they even tried to attempt to make this movie! I only give them 3 stars for trying. Not that they tried very hard! I know i am being really mean but i was about to start crying about how bad this movie was! The acting was terrible for instance when Edward was all ""say it, out loud"" Bella said ""vampire"" and she looked terrified when she isn't supposed to be scared at all. I think Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart are talented but they just didn't show it. Robert Pattinson has an accent where he sounds Spanish! I know he can't help it but why didn't they just pick a new Edward(i vote for Matt Dallas or Chace Crawford).The graphics were horrible- like when he steps into the sun.Plus Edward should be ripped, but I'm sorry to say that Robert isn't! I know I'm harsh but i am begging them to make new moon better. I am considering buying this movie just so i can make fun of it!"

","I have to say I went to this blind with my 12yo daughter and had no idea what I was going to be watching, and I was very tired so I didn't really remember it well the first time round. My daughter had already read the book and she has a habit of telling me what is going to happen next which can be a bit of a pain, but hey, she is 12.<br/><br/>We went and saw it again a week later after I had read the book and I have to say it was a very well done adaption of the book. Some changes were made but in the most part it followed the book very closely and that was pleasing. I read the book in just over a day and had trouble putting it down. I have to agree with other reviewers that the actors in this were extremely well suited for the parts.<br/><br/>Keep an open mind and be entertained instead of looking for flaws and you will really enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>I am an over 40 male so I could not be called a teeny bopper, which the book series is aimed at I believe.<br/><br/>I hope that the other 3 books are also made into movies of the quality of this one.<br/><br/>I give this one an 8."

I have watched it 3 times thinking to myself, maybe I just wasn't thinking right and it wasn't as good as i first thought...but no, I am really truly addicted to these characters.

"liz-berry","10","7","15","11 April 2009"," Enjoyed it probably more than a married woman almost 30 should have...
","I didn't care to see this movie in the theatre. I've heard of the books, but not read them. There just seemed to be too much ""hype"" surrounding the entire thing: the books, the author, the movie, the characters, the actors - everything.<br/><br/>(I actually just caught Kristen Stewart in ""Adventureland"" and realized she has some chops... I'll give her that.) ... but as I strolled through my local movie store today, I picked it up... practically looking around to make sure no one watched me do it. It felt like a guilty pleasure... like a carton of ice cream or something (even at 27 I'm far too mature for such nonsense, right?) BOY, WAS I WRONG.<br/><br/>And just like a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed every second of it.<br/><br/>I wished I were Bella... even if that meant going back to school - just to have a freaking awesome hot, romantic, protective boyfriend... one with a delicious secret that only I was privy to.<br/><br/>It had that very ""us and our love against the world"" feel without being overly dramatic or cheesy.<br/><br/>This is definitely the kind of book I would have picked up about fifteen years ago and gotten a wicked crush on Edward just like everyone is now.<br/><br/>I might even go back and pick up the books before they make any more movies.<br/><br/>Guy or gal, any age -- I would recommend this movie w/o a second thought. It was a lot of fun."
"Tomasz-Wegrzanowski","10","7","15","5 March 2009"," This is a different genre than anything I've ever seen
","I'm a guy, I'm giving Twilight score of 10/10 that I very rarely give movies, and let me explain why I'm doing so. Yes, I see it has very little in terms of plot, action sequences, or well-developed believable characters, or anything else of what makes most movies good.<br/><br/>It has something else instead - the kind of romance than 16yo girl wants. There's a bad boy (but not really bad) who falls in love with you so madly that he wants to be good for your sake, he desires you so much that he cannot even have sex with you and keep his sanity intact. He brings with him mystery and danger, and feels that protecting you is more important than his own life. Everything you might want when you are 16yo girl, except magnified 10x. This magnification is essential, because you the movie watcher are not really Bella, and to get protagonist's feelings into your mind across the movie screen they need to be exaggerated.<br/><br/>I see this romance and tension between characters done so artfully as I've never seen in any movie before. Of course it's not mature or anything like that - its target group is 16yo girls. If you aren't one, you must be willing to turn yourself into one while watching the movie, to think and most importantly to feel like one. If you can do so, you will agree with me that Twilight is a masterpiece. If you cannot, there's really little point in watching it."
"gossipgirl4031","5","7","15","1 December 2008"," Umm.. hello film-makers? Yeah.. You kinda missed the whole point of the plot. Kthnxbye!
","When i first heard about the movie i was waaaay excited. finally i would be able to see all the people (even the undead) who had successfully kept me up all night reading and re-reading the series. Some places i haven't been disappointed, most i have. Honestly i would have never understood the movie if i hadn't read the book, but i had and when i saw the movie i still felt sort of incomplete. First the cast- Rob made an excellent Edward, i doubted it before but now I'm in love. Rosalie (Reed), Esme(Reaser), Carlise(Facinelli), Jasper(Rathbone), Emmet(Lutz), Charlie(Burke), Mike(Welch) and Jessica(Kendrick) were PERFECT! It's like they practically jumped out of the book. Jacob(Lautner) would have been perfect too.. except for that horrible wig.. Bella? Stewart is a wonderful actor but Bella is NOT supposed to be so scared all the time. The rest of the cast was alright. <br/><br/>The movie only concentrated on Bella and Edward's relationship. None of the Cullen's stories are told, especially Carlisle's, which is a very important part of the whole plot. Twilight is also about the struggle of being a ""vegetarian"" vampire. the only struggle we see is Jasper looking like someone is pinching him and Edward occasionally closing his nose. And hello, have the film-makers not understood the whole concept of Edward-REALLY-thirsts-for-Bella's-Blood? because i can guarantee that if a person thirsts for someone's blood, they would NOT be able to make-out like that. which is also the point because it takes Edward a lot of time to really be able to do that.<br/><br/>i liked the improvisation on many scenes but they missed out on many important parts to incorporate the Bella-Edward moments. AGAIN, Twilight is NOT only about the two of them.<br/><br/>James(Gigandet) was AMAZINGLY real. Loved him and Laurent too. But Victoria? No true twilight fan would ever be able to accept the Blonde(Victoria has flaming hair!), cute Lefevre as Victoria. <br/><br/>The movie is good and a person with basic Twilight knowledge might like it, but to the addicted it's like an insult."

","i went to see this movie opening night with my gf and my roommate who have both read the books. (one of them several times) i have heard them both talk about the books but i never read them. one more thing i should point out is that i am a guy, and this movie is obviously geared for the ladies.<br/><br/>with that said, i liked the film more than the book-read friends that accompanied me. and not because i thought the movie was well made or that the acting was that great. the movie was funny intentionally, but funnier when it was supposed to be serious. that is why i enjoyed it. i understand that the book is from bella's pov so a lot of the story is thought not said, but kristen stewart overacts to a point of hilarity at times. the side cast is also hilarious. and when edward first ""smells"" bella, the whole theatre cracked up. i can't help but compare this to ""bring it on"" and its several sequels. (note; i liked bring it on...)<br/><br/>all joking aside- as a movie, the timing is terrible. the romance is very rushed when it shouldn't be, and drags on when it could have made the point and moved on. the cullen family is pretty ridiculous, in fact, most of the script is cheesy and totally unrealistic, and the action scenes leave something to be desired. character development is absolutely abysmal. and like i said, although this can be said about most movies based on books, the whole film felt rushed. and like i said before, i cant help but to compare this to ""bring it on"" as far as the age range this was targeted at.<br/><br/>on the bright side there was Alice, but she was not used to her full potential.<br/><br/>so basically... it wasn't terrible, but it could be a whole lot better. i see the appeal, but it wasn't executed well.<br/><br/>so, what professional wrestling is to 13 year old boys, twilight is to 13 year old girls. it doesn't have to be ""the godfather"" for it to not have a following."

","I have read all the twilight books and many other books turned movies and by far this one was the worst!!Wow, what a waste of time. I can't believe twilight was that bad!!! Not only were the the special effects bad, but the character development was horrible. There was not any attention to detail that was so emphasized in the book. Most of all how can you have vampires without the teeth??? Its like having an alcoholic without any beer!! It could of been so much more with all the book had to offer. Typical Hollywood screw up, go low budget on a worldwide best seller. If they make a second movie hopefully they will use all the money they ripped off everyone from the first one to make the second one much better."

I admit the editing is kinda choppy and I've seen better FX, but I understand they were on a tight budget.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Kristen Stewart was really good as Bella Swan, our heroine. She is totally relatable to many girls and she radiates a pure natural beauty. Congrats K-Stew! Now for Edward Cullen. When I first heard Robert Pattinson was cast, I had some doubts. Now I have been proved dead wrong. (no pun intended). He completely IS Edward. His performance truly surprised me in a good way. Now we have New Moon to look forward to later this year.

","I can honestly say there are not words to describe how terrible this movie really was, and I'm crushed. I loved the books and was so hopeful going in, but after coming out I felt I needed to go home and watch a decent movie to get the awkwardness out of my head. Really, it wasn't the actors' faults. They did their best with what they were given, but with the cheesy script, terrible direction (I think this director should consider combining forces with Uwe Boll), sub par make-up and costuming, and more close ups than a covergirl commercial there was no way that the cast could salvage the film.<br/><br/>If you're considering going to see this movie before it leaves theaters (which will hopefully be soon), you should definitely see a matin√©e. And, really, just save the money and rent it when it comes out. I'm sure that irregardless of how terrible this movie is they will still continue the adaptations, because they're going to make money. I just hope that some of that money will go into hiring more experienced and qualified staff next time."

","As a reader of books you can say that when a movie is written about them you say, what? In this newly adapted page to screen book it is fairly decent. This is not like anything you can say the negative talk about. Sure you say that the book has more detail but when you read, the author writes out the detail and on screen the detail is already there. So go see this movie after reading the book and just enjoy it for what it is and don't listen to critics. It just makes you hate movies that you may like.

Compare it to so many others of this ilk, even as far back as 'The Lost Boys' when there was nothing like the effects of today, they managed to inject some style and action. Look at 'True Blood' sex, gore, excitement, action, all the things this didn't have. I realise they didn't want a rating that meant young girls couldn't see it but give it some erotic content, isn't this what vamps are supposed to be about? Glamour!

The chemistry between Rob and Kristen is so captivating, the director was so passionate, the cinematography is gorgeous and the soundtrack and the way it accompanies the film and adds tension, especially to the romantic scenes, is beyond awesome. The baseball scene has to be one of the best scenes I have ever watched. It is just ridiculously romantic and artistic and I was totally and utterly sucked in. Unfortunately, I loved it so much I decided to read the books which were ridiculously bad and ridiculously addictive in equal measure. So, I read the whole saga as if it were some kind of drug and now the beautifully romantic picture created in the film has been slightly spoiled.... I would say, if you like this film, please use restraint (just like Edward :-)) and do not read the books (except the first one which I admit is pretty good if you are a corny romantic soul like me). Catherine Hardwicke is a brilliant and dedicated director and the casting was fantastic. This is an absolutely brilliant film."

The visual effects is rather bland and quickly made me thinking ""Oh I am seeing a normal movie after all"".

The cast is perfect, i mean when i read the books i imagine Bella like Kristen Stewart, so the actors really fit in their roles. Also i like the music, it's perfect.

"Chalice_Of_Evil","10","5","10","11 December 2008"," Only people expecting a perfect adaptation will be disappointed...
","It had always bugged me (hearing people constantly complain about stuff left out/things that were changed in movie adaptations of books). I'd never read any books that films had been based on, and therefore was able to enjoy the films for what they were, rather than comparing them to the books they were adapted from. With the Twilight series, however, I finally decided that I wanted to see things from a different angle. I wanted to read these novels and then watch the film so that I could get a different perspective on things. I started reading the Twilight novels after hearing that a movie was being made based on the first one. Although I'd heard it was a series targeted at girls, I thought the books were worth giving a shot and went into it with an open mind. I actually really enjoyed them and couldn't put them down, they were that good. As for the movie...<br/><br/>Bella & Edward - I can happily, and with all certainty, assure people that Kristen Stewart has been perfectly cast as Bella. They could not have found a better fit. She embodies the character completely and absolutely does her justice. Robert Pattison's Edward is suitably cold in the beginning, but soon warms up and you can tell these two actors have the chemistry needed to make the Bella and Edward relationship believable. Although they are given questionable dialogue at times, they both pull out all the stops - and thank heavens, as this film rests almost completely on their shoulders. That isn't to say the other characters in the film aren't important. Far from it. Every other person in the movie is crucial, and I'm glad to see the casting was spot-on with almost every single one of them.<br/><br/>The Cullens - They are given limited screen time (some more than others), but manage to make the most of their time on screen. They're ALL good in their roles. Peter Facinelli and Nikki Reed (as Carlisle and Rosalie) are probably given the best chance to develop their characters, whilst Emmett, Jasper and Esme are sadly underused. I was annoyed with how briefly Alice was on screen (she was my favourite character from the books and Ashley Greene was another superbly cast actress. What little we saw of her, however, was spot-on. She *is* Alice).<br/><br/>Mike Newton, Jessica Stanley, Eric Yorkie, Angela Weber - The actors playing Bella's ""friends"" (I use the term loosely, because she doesn't exactly treat them as such) are given a surprisingly solid amount of screen time to develop their characters. They all manage to define themselves within mere moments of Bella meeting them (Anna Kendrick as Jessica probably being the stand-out of the lot). They provide some of the film's funnier moments.<br/><br/>Charlie and Renee - Billy Burke and Sarah Clarke (as Bella's parents) are both memorable, given their limited screen time. The awkwardness between father and daughter is something that's stayed faithful to the book. So has the mother/daughter relationship. Billy Burke is especially good as Charlie (he provides some amusing moments).<br/><br/>Jacob Black - Sadly, like quite a few other important characters in the movie, Jacob's underused and we don't really get to know him as well as we should. Taylor Lauter does the best he can, though. He shows promise. Jacob's father (Billy) has even less time, but still gets a couple of laughs.<br/><br/>James, Victoria and Laurent - Although Cam Gigandet is somewhat over-the-top as James, Rachelle Lefevre's Victoria has the quiet menacing thing down.<br/><br/>Directing - Catherine Hardwicke makes the movie visually interesting. She has a very distinct style, which I think the film benefits from. Hardwicke's directing keeps the film grounded, and it has a 'realism' about it (which is quite the feat, considering). The scenery/atmosphere is amazing and the *look* of things is very faithful to the book. There's an incredible amount of thought and detail that's gone into the movie. The film's soundtrack is used exceptionally well. It never feels intrusive, but is just there in the background to enhance things (in a subtle way). The visually-stunning baseball scene is a perfect example of this. It's one of the best parts of the film. I also liked the wide sweeping shots of Bella and Edward high up in the trees (where 'Bella's Lullaby' was used to great effect).<br/><br/>If I had to pick one negative, it would be that the film feels a tad rushed. It felt as though there was SO much to get through, and certain things/characters weren't lingered on long enough. But this is a minor quibble. What's most important is that the heart of the books is maintained, and I believe the film has achieved this. Twilight isn't full of CGI, which makes it a better film. It's much more subtle/serious (though there's still plenty of humour, as well as some action. The film's humour was actually something I really enjoyed). Twilight may not be totally perfect/flawless, but I think it comes pretty close and remains very true to the books. Overall, I think this movie is successful at translating the first of Stephenie Meyer's books to screen. It's very enjoyable (I saw it twice at the cinema) and I cannot wait for New Moon. Make sure to stay for the end credits, they're well worth watching."

","A movie about vampires and werewolves usually will get two thumbs up from me¬Öunless the movie happens to be a chick-flick¬Öand then I would avoid it. I actually saw this thing and (this is where I hang my head) enjoyed it. I did not read the book so I cannot compare the cast selection to something like 'I expected for ‚Äì like so-and-so to play this part ‚Äì like you know' or say something like, 'Like I wish they did this that way ‚Äì like - lol', or 'omg ‚Äì they left this out ‚Äì really ‚Äì like¬Öhahaha!!!'. For those of you in that boat, I felt the entire cast did a fine job reading their lines and that's okay by me. One cast member I thought did a good job was the guy playing the girl's dad (sorry girls/women I did not catch or remember any of the characters' names ‚Äì so like you know - omg). The girl did a good job as well. I guess I can call her Girl-Vampire Wannabe and I will call her boyfriend, 'Boyfriend-of-Girl-Vampire Wannabe Smith' (this way they have different last names and there won't be any hint of shenanigans¬Öhahahaha¬Öomg). The guy playing the werewolf was good and I will dub him, 'Wannabe-Boyfriend-of-Girl-Vampire-Wannabe Jones' (again adding a new last name to avoid any shenanigans). The way Boyfriend-of-Girl-Vampire Wannabe Smith and Wannabe-Boyfriend-of-Girl-Vampire-Wannabe Jones interact is really well done and telegraphs of a future vampire/werewolf smack-down. And you know ‚Äì you absolutely know ‚Äì this girl ‚Äì you remember - Girl-Vampire Wannabe is eating this all up.

","I thought this was a great movie - I have 3 daughters (ages 10 to 15), all of which saw the movie. It wasn't the regular vampires, even though there were three of them seen in the movie, but it was a nice twist. I just hope that they don't come out with a new movie where Bella & Edward are no longer together. It's a great movie, no cursing and this is hard to come by in movies nowadays. Most vampire movies show the other side of the vampire, the ruthless blood sucking animals. This is a family of vampire that have cut themselves off from human blood and only consume animal blood. I'd like to see them found out and accepted into the population without having to worry about their safety ... not that that would really be an issue!!!"

","There were flaws, of course there were flaws, the book is over 500 pages and most scripts in this type of font are only about 60-180. That means the writers can not adapt everything to make all the fans happy with the film. The directing was amazing and the effects were around the B area, but the film itself is Very good. I think that Robert Pattenson and Kirsten Stewart were brilliant on screen the chemistry between the both of them was fantastic. The film kept me wanting more and i think that anyone who can't see that , probably need to learnt about the true meaning of ""art"". And...come on !! Twilight box office stats are 168 million gross. That is 5X the investment. Big budget films such as ""Dark Knight"" (155 million) grossed 533 million at the box office. Only a 3X margin. I wish they worked on Bella & Edward's romance bit more, but i guess you cant have your cake and eat it too. Cant wait for the next part !! And for those who wanna complain and whine abt it .... Please Enjoy it for what it is."

","Not being a Twilight fan at first, I was pleased to read the books after the film, and what an adaptation! Obviously some scenes in the book were edited/deleted but the essence of Meyers writing was evident, and dialogue from the book was well incorporated in the film. Casting of the main characters was pretty much perfect, with the exception of a few. Some of the dialogue was a bit of a cheesefest, it is a good story and told well.<br/><br/>Be careful who you see it with though, e.g. teenage girls who talk about what is going to happen in the film is not good when you're seeing it for the first time! Looking forward to the next films!"

"emeraldgirl1","7","6","13","30 December 2008"," high expectations shattered
","I was so excited when I discovered they were going to turn the book Twilight into a movie. The books were amazing apart from breaking dawn, which for me was awful. That aside, I was really looking forward to seeing Twilight on the big screen. I had so much hope because in most of the interviews I had seen, Catherine Hardwick made the movie look so spectacular that even non twilight fans wouldn't say no to this movie.<br/><br/>When I had been to the cinemas to watch it I was left devastated that I had waited more than a year to see this overrated film. It wasn't a patch on the book and definitely didn't meet my high expectations. The only thing I loved about the movie was Robert Pattinson who was practically a newcomer to the big screen but was actually a pretty good actor. He almost made me cry in some scenes, he was that believable. Apart from the ending of the movie Kristen Stewart really lacked in emotion, for most of the movie she just looked like she was completely bored and that this was a complete waste of her time. As for everyone else, you couldn't really get into their characters due to their lack of screen time. I couldn't believe this was a 2hr film. Half of the scenes were missing from the book, which were replaced with really short scenes like when Edward was explaining to Bella how humans become vampires. Suddenly they were wet and the next they were dry and in a different location wearing different clothes, it didn't make any sense at all, considering they were discussing the same subject in both scenes. Also some of the scenes they actually spoke in didn't have audio, they didn't even bother to let the audience hear their conversations, like when they were on Bella's bed and when they were up in the tree. That annoyed me because we want to hear what their saying, even if it is cheesy, its supposed to be a romantic story therefore we, the audience want to hear everything. What happened with the flashbacks, these were really poor and again really short.Also where was the airport scene? Catherine Hardwick mentioned this in an interview, she said, wouldn't it be good could if we could see this on the big screen because this wasn't in the book.<br/><br/>I thought the script was poorly written; there wasn't much hunting scenes going on, or James chasing Bella at night, or everybody running about scared wittless. You didn't fear for Bella's life once. Maybe the writers need to raise the action in the second movie and get everyone on the edge of their seats, hiding behind the sofa, whatever!!! Just give the audience this time, big expectations and meet them. There was so much hype about the movie, but frankly it just didn't deliver, it was just too slow, not enough drama and very small scenes, which ended right in the middle of a conversation for example the restaurant scene., and did anyone notice that Edward didn't even mention to Bella that the song he was playing on the piano was Bella's lullaby, it was made for her but, for anyone who had not read the books wouldn't know this. This movie made me laugh most of the time instead of being afraid for Edwards and Bella's life and taking their predicament seriously. All that summit need to do now is fire the writer and follow the new director around with a big cattle prod in the hope that he can rescue this great book series and save us all from a devastatingly bad sequel"
"Isuzi","4","6","13","4 December 2008"," Bad, really bad!
","If you want to have a big sarcastic or ironic laugh than go and enjoy, because that's what happened to me. It's the worst ""book made into a movie"" piece I have ever seen. First of all, the main lead, Bella, in my opinion was more dead than the actual dead person - Edward. The reactions were slow and lame, I have no problem with the actress in other movies but this was just pathetic. Edward was BLUSHING all movie long. I mean, dang people, how can a vampire blush when he's dead and there is no blood in him, it's like sandwich with cheese and an interesting book - Are those two even related! No they are not, that's the same with Edward and his bloody cheeks. And about Edward, he was a whiny cry-baby(of course, vampires can't cry, but in this movie is everything possible, so I wouldn't be surprised). He was so manly in the book and so gay in the movie, he lost his manhood in the first few minutes when he started to talk. Not so smart, not so smart, would've been better if he didn't talk(poetic, isn't it?). Second, Jasper was way too depressed and sad, I mean I had an impression that he was seriously beaten by his dad or whatever whom when he was young. Rosalie was okay, Emmet needed to be more teasing and sarcastic but it was bearable. Esme was cute and motherly, that's exactly what was needed but Carlisle was weird. He had too much make-up and he didn't look dead but he was like ""I want to be a vampire like others but my powder ended and now I'm sulking"", it was way too weird, not what I expected. Alice was cool, I liked this actresses image so it was the closest to the real thing from anyone in this movie. Charlie was funny and a little annoying but still very suitable. Jacob was....well he was a retard, his long haired wig was creepy and those Hollywood white teeth were disturbing. I am telling you he was not so lame in the book. He is not a mechanic, he is definitely not a werewolf, he is a retard who is bullied at school and flashed in the toilet pot. That's the story of mister too smiley. Thirdly,I had an impression that the producers, directors or what so ever didn't open the actual book, because it was like I was watching ""How to slice a steak in the early and rainy mornings"". Come on, there was no storyline in this movie it was too separated between scenes, if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't understand what was it about. And Finally, the five or six boy's who attacked Bella was a gay gang with no balls. I felt like Bella took action and care about her own business. And Edward afterwards when he ""rescued"" her from these sleaze bastards did something even I didn't understand what. He was looking scary or was looking for a boyfriend? That remains as a mystery to me. All in all, I will watch the up-coming second movie but it doesn't seem promising. Probably will end with this kind of a review."
"bese_la_lluvia","6","6","13","24 November 2008"," The Utter CRAP that was Twilight
","Okay so they tried. But the movie isn't worth spending $7 to see. I felt like I was watching a spoof of Twilight, kinda like Another Teen Movie but really bad. The only good part was sitting next to my girlfriend, holding her hand and sharing popcorn. The movie was good, but you can't call it ""AWESOME"" like some people have...even if you are a Twilight fan. Hell, ESPECIALLY if you're a Twilight fan. A real fan would probably have flipped at that movie. Yeah, it was exciting getting to finally put faces with characters and things like that, but the movie itself just didn't hit right. Edward was way to...forced, I guess. The dude tried way too hard. Edward is suppose to be charismatic not weird. The ""Hold on spider monkey"" comment by Edward was also really uncalled for and had the extra crap like that been left out the movie would have been much better. There were just too many key scenes left out, and I think it may be difficult to transition into New Moon without dropping out even more of what made the novels enjoyable. All in all it was maybe a 6 out of 10. Hopefully New Moon will be better."

","OK, so I picked up the Twilight books about a year ago and I was ecstatic to find that they were making a movie. My roommate kept telling me that there were awful reviews but I still walked in with an open mind and not to high of expectations that it would be like the book. After seeing the movie, I am not very sure if I liked or I didn't. I felt that the acting between Bella and Edward was very awkward and lacking the chemistry that many reviews said they had. You could tell that Robert Patterson was trying to cover up his British accent. Also they developed the story a little more in some places rather than others which is where it should have been. I know that there was no way the director could have fit that long and that amazing of a book into a few short hours and expect everyone to be somewhat entertained however I expected a lot more. At least with Harry Potter, the director stayed very close to the book and allowed every single movie to have its magic even though it was changed a little bit. In order to determine whether the movie was good or not I will have to see it a second time and I suggest that anyone who goes to see this movie if they already haven't to be prepared for something that does not really have any extremely wonderful in it."
"shebelly12","5","6","13","23 November 2008"," Terrible.
","I think I've been a fan of twilight for about two years. I read all three books in less than a week, and I and a few of my friends attended the release of the fourth book in the Twilight series. It was about that time when I realized the many flaws in the books. They are too numerous to write about at the moment, because my main focus is the movie. I had long awaited the movie, for almost an entire year. I was so excited, I found out one of my favorite actors was going to be cast as the main character, and I, along with many other twilight fans, eagerly waited as each character was cast. The hype for the movie was phenomenal. Everyone was talking about it, twilight fans, people who hated the books, people who never even read the books. Good Morning America had a special about the movie; there were trailers all over Myspace, you couldn't check your email with out some story about Twilight flashed in your face. It was supposed to be the Action/Romance/Thriller of the year. It wasn't. Let's start with the actors. The character Edward Cullen was supposed to be a sincere person, who cared about the people who he loved, and would do anything to protect them. In the movie, he came off as a psychotic stalker. Many scenes involving him were awkward to watch, and he wasn't even to blame. The script was poorly written, and most of his lines were clich√©s. Bella, the female protagonist, was equally awkward. Her character was naturally supposed to be a clumsy, awkward girl, who was selfless, and understanding of others, but Kristen Stewart's performance of Bella was sometimes painful to watch. She had no emotion, and even when she shouted, her facial expression didn't change. She was monotonous and boring. The Cullen family was Edwards's family, consisting of the man who turned him into a vampire, his ""father"" and his ""brothers and sisters"" who were also turned by his father. His brothers Emmett and Jasper, and his sisters, Alice and Rosalie, and even his father Carlisle, were all extras. They had five lines or less, and the story could have continued if they were all erased from the picture. <br/><br/>The plot was like a gigantic puzzle. It made no sense unless you had previously read the books and knew what was going to happen anyway. The director skipped scenes vital to the stories plot. The whole chunk of the story where Bella is supposed to fall in love with Edward was skipped. It went from Bella learning that Edward was a vampire, to Bella's becoming frantic at the thought of losing him. It just made no sense, the script was so confusing and there were incomplete thoughts and sentences pulled out of no where. Many people thought that the movie would be aimed at a younger audience, as the books are aimed for, but the movie wasn't aimed at anybody unless they enjoy boring movies with too few comedic moments and vary bad acting. It was a shoddy performance, and if not for the few funny scenes, and the far too far apart action scenes, the entire movie would be a flop. I blame the director."
"drcean","6","6","13","22 November 2008"," Missing the magic
","I have to admit the movie lived up to the low expectations I had for it. How can you capture the intensity, drama, and emotion that the book contains, when most of that goes on in Bella's head? I thought the writers tried too hard to include phrases from the book, but didn't quite know how to do it. Thus, the lines seemed cheesy when delivered. Half of the actors were believable as characters from the book. Others, mainly Robert, fell flat. His gorgeous face was fine, but he didn't show the range of emotion to be a believable Edward. Robert was too weak a character, especially when he talked. Some of his scenes he was absolutely Edward, others he was a gawky teenager trying too hard to be romantic. To give him credit though, how could anyone live up to our expectations of Edward from the book? I give him kudos for trying. My favorite scenes were when Bella and Edward were shown together in the tree while the camera panned around them. That wins for incredibly unique setting. We didn't have to listen to strained conversation while the actors fumbled around. When we can see just their faces, they are very believable. The fight scene at the end was marvelously well done. The mirrored dance studio was far more elaborate than the one Alice sees in the book, but it made for awesome special effects. With that said, I wish they would have stuck to the book a bit closer throughout. Certain small details were changed for no obvious reason. For example, James is supposed to bite Bella's hand, but he bites her arm instead. Not a super big deal, but the bite has significance in the following books. And how will Edward squeeze a giant king sized bed, frame and all, into his tiny bedroom when they make Eclipse? In all, the movie was worth the money to see. And I did enjoy seeing Stephenie Meyer in the film. She's certainly created a hit!"
"rascleattop","4","6","13","22 November 2008"," Wonderful plot for a film, but this version missed the mark.
","It's really a shame because this movie had SO much potential, it surfaced with an already dedicated fan-base, the actors cast were promising, and the plot line was unique. Such a combination of potential is a rarity, making the shortcomings of the film all the more disappointing.<br/><br/>The love between Edward and Bella was far too rushed, to the point it was unrealistic, immediately leaving the audience detached from their romance, and unfortunately ruining the dynamics for the rest of the entire film. This was especially disappointing because Twilight is supposed to be a LOVE STORY. The author has even said her inspiration to write the book came from the play Romeo and Juliet, obviously the romantic aspect is a huge reason for why it has been so successful, and the films failure to properly convey the romance partially explains why it's such a flop in comparison. Crucial character developments from the book were completely omitted in the film, and the melodramatic music and poor quality ""blue tinted"" lighting instilled a creepy and suspenseful feel, not a romantic one.<br/><br/>The actors should almost be embarrassed for having the title on their film resumes. I feel bad for knocking Kristen Stuart for her pitiful performance, because the Bella Swan in the book seems she would be an incredibly difficult character to convey, but Stuart's delivery was much worse than one would have expected, every single line of hers sounded contrived, and her performance removed much of the film's potential. She was perfect looking for the role, and that's pretty much it. As for Robert Pattinson, while his role was awkward and rushed, he deserves to be commended for his wonderful performance, there's not much one can do when he's given an awful script.<br/><br/>All in all, the film was rushed, and literally laughable, the audience giggled in awkward embarrassment during the emotionally tense scenes, partially because of the contrived emotion in the lines the actors had to rehearse, and partially for having spent money on such a god awful film.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Twilight, the book, to anyone and everyone, but the film is only worth seeing for those of us who have already read the novel, and even then I wouldn't completely recommend it. I would look forward to enjoying a cinematic version of Twilight, the book truly deserves it's own film, and it would translate nicely, but this particular cinematic translation of the book did not hit the mark."
"hohoho-21","5","6","13","22 November 2008"," A little disappointment
","I went into the theater expecting a cheesy, melodramatic, low-budget film adaptation with little resemblance to the plot of Twilight. It was a little bit better than I'd thought.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Twilight fans, I am completely with you. I LOVE the books and obsessed over this movie for months before it came out. It's almost painful for me to admit that this movie didn't live up to it's full potential when I really was hoping that it would.<br/><br/>I'll start with the bad things. The film was lacking some of the wittier quotes from Twilight that I had really hoped to see portrayed by Rob and Kristen. The way that the vampires moved was beyond cheesy; it was pathetic. The way Edward talked at the beginning was awkward and melodramatic. Oh, and Catherine Hardwicke completely robbed Twi-hards fans of a proper meadow scene. Bella's instant belief in the supernatural is laughable. Edward and Bella's relationship seemed rushed, and if I hadn't read the books I would not understand how two teenagers who have spoken to each other about three times can decide that they want to risk their lives to be together. And Edward sparkles ALL WRONG!!!! OK, so the film had it's issues, but it could have been much, much worse. Even though some great quotes were taken away, a few really funny ones were added. The cast was amazing. They could not have picked a better Edward, Bella, Alice, Emmett, Rosalie, Esme, Carlisle, and Charlie. I have to admit that though they got the type of Volvo wrong, Edward's driving is fantastic. There were a few very funny, unexpected parts. The movie was pretty close to the book.<br/><br/>So here's a summary: this movie could have been much better if they took 5 minutes to add the quotes twilight fans crave or just to develop upon the Edward-Bella relationship. It also could have been worse. I will buy this movie on DVD when it comes out. If you're a Twiilight fan, go see the movie and decide for yourself. If not, just skip it."

","The movie had potential to be very good. Edward and Bella were actually well cast, as were several of the other characters. However the main characters had little or no time to develop their relationship. Many scenes that could have showed character development were skimmed over with music instead of actual dialog. The cheesy music is what really ruined it for me. When Edward's skin sparkled in the sun (inconsistently) a tinkling/sparkling sound came on. Maybe if I put it on mute I'll enjoy the movie more. I felt like I was watching a bad soap opera or made for TV movie, not one I had paid ten bucks to see on midnight of the opening night."

","I wanted to see ""Twilight"" because expected beautiful, gloomy film with intriguing story of love. But, most likely, it was not fated to become true therefore as film has left negative impression. And that is why.<br/><br/>If to begin with a plot here it is necessary to tell, that anything new Stephanie Mayer has not thought up: love between the vampire and the usual, mortal girl and serious troubles because of it. But the director of the given picture had an excellent chance to create beautiful story to the spectator; so that it was interesting to him and bewitched him. Alas, it was not possible.<br/><br/>Probably, main reason is worthless game of actors both their improbable retorts and dialogues. Especially I was amazed with the beginning of film when protagonists cannot connect even two words to get acquainted. Of course, I understand that they maybe rather shy persons but in the senior classes it is time to learn how to communicate with people.<br/><br/>As if to actors I was simply in a shock. I did not expect such sheer failure from Kristen Stewart. In my opinion,she has played disgustingly. Even more I was amazed with Robert Pattinson: too nervous the vampire has turned out from him. But new faces, in particular, executors of roles of members of family of eternally seventeen-year-old vampire have obviously pleased. Have perfectly consulted with the work. Offset.<br/><br/>In the conclusion, I wish to note one more obvious plus of the picture - the magnificent nature. It has added mysticism and romanticism in this tiresome and tightened film.<br/><br/>3/10"

","Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Twilight series (well, at least the first book), but this movie did nothing for me. I think the filmmakers largely missed the mark in some of the casting-- Robert Pattinson's acting ability was sub-par. He never delivered his lines with any credibility. And I'm not sure if it is the fault of the screenwriters or whomever, but Edward (at least in my estimation), was supposed to be smooth, eloquent, and confident, not stumble over his lines and seem at a loss for words.

"Stampsfightclub","9","8","19","3 January 2009"," Stunning dark and intense fantasy romance
","Bella Swan's (Stewart) life changes when she falls in love with vampire Edward Cullen (Pattinson) Based on Stephanie Meyer's series, Twilight was the eagerly anticipated teen film of 2008 after the move of Harry Potter 6 to 2009.<br/><br/>The 4 novels have grossed millions worldwide and is no surprise with the heart stopping romantic fantasy about an ordinary girl and a vampire who want to be together and after fulfilling teenage girl's fantasies, this film had a massive weight on its shoulders and thankfully it has managed to stay grounded and do justice to the first novel and will undoubtedly fulfil fan's requirements.<br/><br/>The imagination of the book to take a love story and put a fantasy twist right at its core was genius by Meyer and this adaptation is far darker and more action packed than the novel, which is a great thing. If there was one thing the novel lacked it was a strong middle. There was a lot of repetition that dragged but here we see intensity and a strong hold on to Bella's tale.<br/><br/>The story never lacks and whilst die hard fans may feel disappointed by scenes missing from the book, it is a wonderful adaptation that generates that same strong feeling of love and lust.<br/><br/>If there is one film out there that has the most attractive cast then this is it. Everyone is slim, groomed, interesting and no doubt what teens want to see.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart (Into the Wild) continues her rise to Hollywood with a wonderful representation of Bella but it will be Robert Pattinson's (Harry Potter 4) portrayal of the vampire that will get the fans talking. Dark, mysterious and attractive, he is the eye candy of the film and simply IS Edward Cullen right down to the bronze eyes.<br/><br/>There are great performances all round by an excellent supporting cast which in particular has a dark turn from Cam Gigandet as evil vampire James.<br/><br/>The settings help justify those from the book and there is a fantastic moment when Edward takes Bella up a tree to look at the lake below, which is romantic brilliance.<br/><br/>One stand out factor of this film was Hardwicke's choice of direction. The continuous use of extreme close shots of the character's eyes helps generate that feeling of intensity which ultimately gives the film that tense and exciting feeling.<br/><br/>Twilight is a fine adaptation with an attractive well performing cast that just about betters the best selling novel."

","For all of those who feel the Twilight movie is not good, you're wrong and I'm not sorry for stating it.<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga books are excellent. You ask: ""How can that be?"" Well, books that are not good do not make the country's best seller list. Also, the authors that write bad books are not nominated for writing awards. It's sort of like 2 + 2 = 4. Stephenie Meyer wrote the Twilight Saga books. These books have been on the best seller list since they came out, the books have sold millions of copies worldwide, and Ms. Meyer has been named and nominated for various awards. Additionally, Stephenie Meyer's first book, Twilight, was made into a movie. Guess you didn't see that one coming, did you? Another question: How can a bad movie be number two (2) in the United States and world? Financially speaking, Twilight has broken a lot of box office records.<br/><br/>You have to love books in the first place. You have to know that Stephenie Meyer wrote Twilight because she had a dream about a couple in a beautiful ""meadow."" The young man in the meadow was a vampire, but, the young woman was an average-ordinary girl.<br/><br/>Also, you have to believe in true love. A young couple cross each other's paths. By common standards, their love is doomed, but true love conquers all. This may all sound like sugar-sweet, candy-coated garbage to some, but, what about a man or woman who returns from war and is severely physically damaged. By common standards, love for this person is not conceivable. But, then, his/her path crosses with someone who sees the real person - not the physical limitation. It's the same for Bella and Edward in Twilight. The circumstances may be different - but it's the same story. Love conquers all.<br/><br/>For anyone who wishes to ""trash"" the Twilight Saga - okay. That's your opinion. I choose to thank Stephenie Meyer for sharing her dream with the world. Anything good does not hurt. Good always makes life better.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the Twilight Saga, read it. You will be surprised when you can't put these books down. They're wonderfully addictive. And, if you're gonna have an addiction, Twilight should be your ""heroin"" of choice."
"dorkyj2002","4","7","16","28 November 2008"," This was... Bad
","***Spoilers*** Simply atrocious. Out of the 2 hours running time, only 20-25 minutes of this film actually worked. While I loved Stewart & Pattison as our ""lion & lamb,"" they just had horrible lines. They did great with what they had. About half (if not more) of the lines were taken directly from the book. The cinematography (I hope I spelled that correctly) was awful. It looked like a Lifetime special. I know, I know- they only had $40 million budget. Guess what? If I were Meyer, I would've gone to some other studio who would've ponied up the dough. If this was all they could get, then that should've rang a bell there. It wasn't good enough for Warner, New Line, Revolution, Dreamworks. Here's a hint: When they wouldn't back the project, re-do it.<br/><br/>Anyways, I also loved Bella's dad, Dr. Cullen & Mrs. Cullen, Alice, Emmett, Laurent and Jessica- everyone else was just wrong. I thought James was okay. Wasn't ""bad"" enough for me. Bella's mom wasn't neurotic enough for me, Mike was just plain creepy. Didn't think Tyler was right. Rosalie was a little over the top. Jasper, IMO, was the most terrible outta everybody. He wasn't the cool, charismatic sophisticate the book plays him out to be.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ballet studio scene, the meadow scene, the ""baseball"" scene (up until Laurent and gang), and the beach. When Edward and Bella first met in the classroom, the close-up on his eyes... oh my goodness. Wow. Absolutely spine-tingling and breath-taking. That's when I knew that that was ""my Edward,"" so to speak. These were the only credible scenes for me.<br/><br/>What upsets me most, is that they already have screenwriters for the rest of the books of the series. I hope some other studios sign for the other films. If not- I'm boycotting the movies and the books (haven't read past Twilight). I'm not wasting my time any further if I know that Summitt will continue to trash this franchise."

","This film is definitely aimed at teens. If you're not a teen, you probably will think it's lame and fingers-down-your-throat bad. I was 12 when I first watched this, and I loved it to bits, I would have given it 11/10 stars at that age! But now, I'd give it a lot less. But, to give an accurate review, I thought I'd better put a rating that was in the middle ground between my two opinions.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is mediocre. Occasionally, there's the odd time where you think ""that was actually convincing acting!"" but at others you kind of cringe and think ""oh that was baaad!"" This is one of the reasons that I think it is aimed at teens, because it wouldn't seem as cheesy to a young mind, particularly if they're seduced by Robert Patterson!<br/><br/>The script is kind of lame, and I don't know whether this is because the books were lame or not, because I've never read the books, but either way the script needs a serious rewrite if it will ever impress mature viewers."

"Badmoviessuck","3","3","5","2 January 2019"," Bella like shiny man
","This movie is terrible and i truly hate it.<br/><br/>THE FIRST 50 MINUTES
The first 50 minutes were the worst.
For the first the acting was horrendous and the interaction between Bella and Edward was very hard to watch cause they couldn't even speak properly.
Edward was talking quietly and took pauses every sentence.
Bella said a bunch of short answers and barely speaked at all.
The beginning was also bad.
They had to explain to us what was going on and what was happening in the beginning of the movie instead of showing us that through visuals and dialogue. And it was easy for them, all they needed to do was remove Bella as the narrator and add some dialogues between Bella and her Mom and Dad.
There was this one funny scene tho.
It was when Edward couldn't be near Bella, Bella thought it was cause of her smell, and we never got to know that until later so we just get to see this scene were Edward is avoiding Bella which was hilarious to me.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
Bella is an annoying character.
throughout the movie she barely speaks properly.
She is always so silent and say a bunch of short answers and she barely has character development.
Kristen Stewart probably thought barely speaking properly meant you were and introverted shy girl.
But there were these moments when she speaked properly that was when it was convenient for the plot.
Edward was better he actually went through an character arc even though it was a bad one which dosen't really make sense.
His desire is to be with Bella and the thing holding him back is the blood but he manages to control himself without any explanation and how he manages to not kill Bella in the end is by Dr Cullen doing a little pep talk.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
The Villain James is the worst villain i have ever seen so far.
He just shows up sees human and then goes beserk.
James was with a gang and they did this crime where they killed a man in s boat. What was the point with that?
They were setting up these evil trio but then they just abandon the set-up they made and decided to make a random person in the trio with the least screen time the main villain.<br/><br/>ROMANCE
The romance between Bella and Edward was the worst romance i have ever seen.
They barely spend time together before Bella knew that Edward was a vampire but she just says ""I'm not scared of you"" ""I wanna be with you"" like they were hanging out with each other for a long while and the time they did hang out with each other was to move forward the plot, not expanding their relationship.<br/><br/>CGI
CGI was horrendous, looked unnatural when Edward was running.
He ran normally but the background was moving quicker than he ran which looked weird.<br/><br/>VERDICT
This movie fails at being what it was supposed to be, a romantic film with some fantasy elements.
This movie is disgusting"

"goreilly40","1","3","5","1 July 2017"," Boring and more wooden than the Amazon.
","For a movie about vampires, werewolves and romance, this movie is really bland, with a capital B. So many scenes could only be described as a waste of time, with nothing happening, and I mean nothing, just close up shots of Edward, Bella, Jacob or some other minor character whose name, surprise surprise I've forgotten, put it another way this movie has more stares than the Empire State Building. The plot was just, well I can't describe it, simply because at times there isn't one, teenage girl moves to town, falls in love with other moody teenager who warns her off to save her from him, turns out moody teenager is a killer vampire, all be it the most unconvincing I've ever seen, girl doesn't care and goes after him, even after he stalks her, controls her and even threatens to kill her (face palm). In fact the relationship, and I use that term loosely, could be described as Edward being controlling and manipulative the early warning signs of domestic abuse. Anyway moving on, the acting was wooden, unemotional and dull, the dialogue was awkward and misplaced and the imagery was laughable, and what was with the glow in the first place, I don't know. Some other people found it unintentionally funny but I didn't, the two hours I spent watching it I'll never get back. Unless your fan of the book then avoid this like the plague. I wasted two hours watching this crap, don't waste your time like I did."

","When this movie came out in high school, my heterosexual male stoner buddy saw it in theatres ten times. <br/><br/>Ten. Times. <br/><br/>Each time he'd come out a little higher and a little gigglier than the last, riding on the wave of exhilaration that only comes from watching something so nonsensical that it can only be enjoyed with the help of pharmaceuticals. And yet. Somewhere between viewing four and viewing seven, his language about the movie changed. He started calling the actors by their characters' names. Started mouthing the ridiculous dialogue along with them, started saying things like, ""You know, the baseball scene is actually kind of genius. I mean, they used a Muse song. MUSE!""<br/><br/>And thus through self-induced Stockholm Syndrome, my friend became a Twilight fan, one of the legions who obsessively ponder the stares between Bella and Edward. I can only imagine that his method is the only way to properly enjoy this movie, because I, who saw it once completely soberly (viewing number five for him) and without having memorized the dialogue, found so little to redeem this waste of humanity's brain cells that I can barely recount the plot here. I remember that there were a lot of panning (or should we say ""padding"") shots of the Pacific Northwest tree line. There was Kristen Stewart at her glassiest (perhaps she too had discovered that the best way to make it through the script was with the aid of pharmaceuticals?) and most monotone. There was Robert Pattinson, whose character clearly hadn't gotten the memo that all-over body glitter went out with the demise of the 1990s. <br/><br/>There was a plot about a girl who moves to a small town, meets the hot guy at school, becomes hot guy's obsession, becomes hot guy's stalking object and then becomes hot guy's faithful lover because of course she does. Gentlemen, to really win a lady's heart, kidnap her at high speed through a forest, take her to a deserted field, and then tell her it is highly likely that you will at some point in your relationship try to kill her and feast on her flesh, but only because you love her scent so much. Then stare into her eyes without blinking for a really long time. Then play some baseball, throw in a ridiculously contrived villain who ALSO wants to kill said lady and feast on her flesh because her scent is somehow like crack to the glittery undead, and a vaguely racist Native American who also wants to feast on her flesh but in a metaphorical sense because her glassy-eyed staring is the most attractive thing he's ever seen, and voila. Gazillion dollar movie. <br/><br/>I would say something snarky about that, but it's too depressing to bear thought of. Please don't see this movie. <br/><br/>2/10 TL;DR: Unless you're planning on getting very high, or you're one of the Twilight legion of teenage girls who firmly believe unrequited love and unsubtle emotional abuse is the sexiest thing you've ever seen, avoid at all costs."
"stentygee123","6","3","5","9 November 2014"," fun, adventurous film for the whole family
","Fast-paced and mysterious, I love the way Twilight reels people in through their curiosity making them wonder things like ""are they going to get hurt?"", ""are they in trouble?"" or the general ""what's going to happen next?"". The film itself is packed full of action and thrills and has benefited by basing itself on the amazing storyline of the same name by Stephanie Meyer. The fact that the movie uses a fictional-fantasy idea that is also an action packed thriller it reels in an audience of an age group between around 12 to around 40. Although mainly for the teens and disliked by quite a few people, it had proved to include the whole family on some level. The film uses the latest equipment in film technology to produce amazing atmospheres in the film that make the dark forests and similar scenes seem both captivating and realistic.<br/><br/>Whether the film may have been created to make the idea of the film seem like it could be real life is undermined, though, by the over dramatic performances by the main protagonist, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), and the almost forced emotional approach by the character Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson).<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart was way too over dramatic in her part as Bella Swan and made 80% of her part seem like a sob story or a cry for help, reminding me sometimes of Elijah Wood's portrayal of Frodo Baggins from The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Although she did well to capture her audience by making her entrance as the shy, uncomfortable, new girl seem both realistic, believable and relatable. <br/><br/>Robert Pattinson was overly forceful in his attempt to be emotional as the character of Edward Cullen. While he got the eyes of the audience placed firmly on him, he lacked the natural human expression when feeling a strong emotion. For example: during the first kissing scene of the film he looked uncomfortable and shifty instead of the actual nervous and scared; and when trying to look sickened he overdid it and looked, frankly, constipated (I'm just saying...); and finally, when trying to look scared, he forced it too much and looked overly sad or angered. However, I give him that he did manage to capture his audience and reached the goal, enough so, that he went on to star in the last 4 installments of the book series.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give the film a 9/10 for effort, but realistically given my overall opinion of the film I think it only deserves a 6/10"

I also happen to know that vampires-burning-in-the-sun part of lore was added in 1922 by movie Nosferatu. My problem is that this film had bad script and terrible, ugly photography. Characters were tedious, only colours were ugly grey and sickly blue, and there's basically no plot. Where was richly romantic, elegant imagery? Where was... well, anything? Even hero's ""diamond-like"" sparkling didn't look especially diamond-like. Story is supposedly set in real place called Forks, but this high-school is unrealistically clean place with friendly kids only and not any bullying or nastiness. Why use name of real place? I suppose this is from alternative universe Forks or Stephenie Meyer is home-schooled. If you want movie about vampire romance, look Bram Stoker's Dracula. Imagery is fabulous and cast is perfect."
"bsocc","3","3","5","9 February 2011"," Not your typical interpretation of this vampire filled movie
","The Twilight Saga. You know it because you either love it or you hate it, for the most part. Then there are people like me who just stand by the sidelines watching all of the ""Twilightaholics"" fighting it out, screaming ""I love Edward"" or ""I love Jacob."" Maybe it's just me, but I don't think it's healthy for a bunch of preteen, and teenage girls (or guys) to be absolutely obsessed with fictional characters like a vampire and a werewolf. And lets face it, most of this was caused by the choosing of the actors to play these roles in the movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm an avid Harry Potter fan, but I don't go running around screaming ""Go Harry,"" and ""Voldemort sucks,"" do I? <br/><br/>Although I may not be fully ""Twilight"" qualified, I've seen both the first and the third movie, and I've heard that they are pretty close to the novels themselves. The simple fact is, I don't think I even need to see the second movie to understand what's happening in the story line. Some sad, pale girl named Bella, finds herself with her father, who she only saw during the summers when she grew up, leaving her ""old life"" behind. She's at a new school, so since this is a coming of age book of sorts, she obviously has to have no friends at first. Bella eventually finds herself with decently nice people, and hears of the Cullens, the bloodsuckers of the novel.<br/><br/>The storyline progresses and, of course, there are bad vampires (I know, since when were there good ones?) after her and her soon-to-be lover, Edward, has to save her from them. So their romantic, teen fantasy seems to be perfect now right? Wrong. <br/><br/>Edward, apparently, in the second movie, leaves her because it's ""too dangerous"" for him to be around her. Typical thing for a dangerous guy (or vampire?) to say. So as Bella is dealing with the sadness of her lover gone, a new guy, more prominent here then in the first movie, comes into view, mainly without a shirt on. After staring at abs that looked as if Jacob didn't eat a carbohydrate for about 5 years, we find out that he is in love with Bella. Uh oh. New love interest for Bella. But she is able to restrain herself from pouncing by remembering her lost love. Towards the end of the movie, with Bella safe (for now), she finds out that her friend Jacob is a werewolf, and that Edward was going to reveal his glittering, shining self to humans in order for the Vultori, a vampire council, to kill him, because he thought that Bella had died. How romantic. Does that remind you of something (Romeo and Juliet)? Anyway, the tables were turned and she ended up saving him. Yay. <br/><br/>This fantasy of course isn't over yet. Victoria, the evil vampire, was still out there aching, or better yet thirsting, to kill and/or drink Bella's blood. But multiple vampire related killings and disappearances in her area have both the vampires and werewolf communities going barking mad. We eventually find out that Victoria is starting a new born, newly turned vampire army to raise hell (literally) on Bella's town of Forks, Washington. So the two enemies, the vamps and the wolves, have to work together in order to fight and kill the newly formed army, what a surprise. In the end, after multiple fighting scenes and awkward sexual tension between Jacob, who still looks like he's on steroids, Bella, and Edward, good triumphs over evil, and Bella, along the way, is engaged to Edward. An 18 year old and a 107 year old. Hey, I'm not judging.<br/><br/>But, unfortunately, this is all of my Twilight knowledge. The two-part movie, Breaking Dawn is scheduled to come out in November this year. After all of the teen girls go wait for days in line to be the first ones to see this, and cry their eyes out when they do, I'll be going to the movies, a month after it is released, on a free movie Tuesday, to see the final chapter of the Twilight Saga. Hopefully it won't be a waste of my money. Oh wait"

","Dracula is probably ticked off at this movie for making him look bad, because they did a heck of a job doing it. Bats everywhere probably want to take a huge bat crap on this piece of s**t film. Back in my day, vampires sucked blood, not people's peckers. Let me put it simple; most likely the WORST romance film, let alone the worst vampire film in the history of mankind. The only films that might be worse are its sequels. For fans of the books, this might be worth watching, but that means they really like vampires, or their gay. I'll admit the first book was all right. But the movies just sucked the big peckers.<br/><br/>The film follows the novel in all the wrong ways. Adds completely unnecessary scenes, and doesn't make use of the plot as much as it could have. Plus its just so pathetic and silly it almost makes you wanna laugh. A girl found out that she's been hanging with a vampire, and she doesn't get scared or anything. COME ON! Who would be cool after realizing you were just with a freaking vampire! Thats so freaking dumb. Give me a break! Plus, did someone think the vampires weren't gay enough? Whose bright idea was it for them to sparkle? Vampires do not sparkle, no matter what you do to these!<br/><br/>The actors overdo it, and put way too much work into pulling off their characters. When Edward leaves the classroom after first meeting Bella, he looks like he's gotta take a crap. The performances are just too shaggy. Their not calm at all.<br/><br/>I could go on forever, but I think iv'e covered enough. In short terms, this movie blows the big wiener. Anybody else would agree with me. Only gays and lovers of vampires would love this, and thats their problem. Don't let it be mine."
"eonbluedan-1","3","3","5","1 January 2011"," A strange experience with this one.....Read on
","After much maligning of ""Twilight"" by everyone I know, I stayed well away from it. It later occurred to me, however, that it is unfair to join in with the slandering, having not actually experienced it myself.<br/><br/>Due to so many people's view that the film is utter rubbish, I was nicely built up for a major fall, fully expecting to despise everything about it; when my reaction was rather tepid, it actually felt like a positive! These are things that, to my own surprise, I didn't think were too bad: The idea, on paper, I can see is actually quite a good one. It's an interesting take on the vampire story and though I have not read Meyers' books, I can imagine them to be quite engaging. There is a little allusion to the classic star-crossed lovers, Romeo and Juliet, though if any of the dialogue and character engagements in this film are lifted directly from the book, Meyers is certainly no Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The principal cast do the best with what they are given, though I can imagine in many years to come, Robert Pattinson may look back on this Saga in the same way Kevin Bacon famously does on ""Footloose""; whilst being the making of him, he certainly wishes it wasn't. That said, I was pleasantly surprised to find that, unlike Mr Orlando Bloom, who quite frankly cannot act for toffees, Pattinson isn't just a pretty face and at least has some conviction in what he's doing, the occasional bad delivery aside. Given time, I can see him becoming more solid. Kristen Stewart plays Bella and doesn't do too badly; not much else to say on her really. Oddly enough, possibly the best performance in the film is a character I can see getting rather overlooked; Bella's father, Charlie. He is played by Billy Burke, an actor of subtlety and unquestionable command of what is a relatively small role. The rest of the cast are simply fodder, but it is quite a compliment, in what is a very mediocre film, to say that none of the principal actors are weak.<br/><br/>The original score stood out for me; I found the main theme to capture the drama nicely, and to be dark, aggressive and yet graceful, which compliments the story being told very nicely. It could be argued, in fact, that this was the element of the film that most caught my attention in a positive way. Conversely, however, there are a couple of moments in the film where I did wonder how Catherine Hardwicke, the director, had decided that the music fit, because it really doesn't! It is in fact directorial decisions that are the true let down for ""Twilight"". The efforts to transfer the story's themes of abstinence to the screen, and to create the metaphor of the decisions a girl must make about what makes a boy the right choice, are fair attempts, but are flawed by a bad screenplay and a director who, to call ham-fisted, would be an understatement! We have lingering shots that aren't necessary in any way other than, it would seem, to glorify somebody's cheekbones; badly judged, long pauses that are supposed to hold tension, both sexual and dramatic, which actually just leave you feeling like you should leave the two lovers alone for a while. We then have drawn out montages, in which we think ""Yes, I get it, they fancy each other, let's move forward now,"" and moments that possibly worked in imagination, but should have been the first thing ditched when making the film, such as glittering vampires (the effect of which was actually quite disappointing; I didn't see much difference). We also have rogue ""bad"" vampires, who appear to carry around their very own fog machine. This last element ruined what was otherwise one of the better, more fun scenes in the film.<br/><br/>Another pivotal moment, during which I thought perhaps she had actually managed to shoot something well, is the conversation between Bella and Edward about what he is. It is all going well until we get an out of the blue, unnecessary ""MTV"" moment, with the camera darting all over the place. I assume this is to hold the attention of its audience, but all it does is kill the moment flat. There are many other flaws I could pick out, such as Edward's incessant need to keep returning to Bella every few minutes, only to remind her of why she should stay away from him (I understand it is an attempt to illustrate the idea of not being able to resist someone, but it is pushed too far and looks stupid).<br/><br/>""Dawson's Creek with vampires"" nicely sums up how I feel about this film, even in its tone! The character arcs and conversations feel like they're straight from an American High School TV drama (except this is shot worse, at points), but in that context, it does what it sets out to do. Please note that in rating this film, whilst I would personally give it a one-out-of-five, simply for all the previous issues, I am taking into account the target audience it had right from the start, which I assume is the same as that for the book (coming-of-age school or college girls), and not an audience who perhaps appreciate the ""Vampire"" genre outside of this film. If you fit the demographic, ""Twilight"", with all its awful direction, is likely to still hold your attention."

The location seemed fitting for vampires and having them be teens was a neat twist.<br/><br/>The problem I had is it was like the movie never got started. There was this very minimal love story going on and tacky action scenes that was just enough to bring you out of the coma the rest of the film put you in. I just sat that after an hour plus waiting for the movie to become something: a drama, action, romance, suspense, anything. It only began to become interesting a little before it was over.

","I can review this with unbiased as I have not read any of the four massive tomes-for-books that this movie is based off of.<br/><br/>Now, it's been some time since I've seen this movie, I am just now thinking of the words to review it. My forty-six year old MOTHER bought this movie since she loved the books. And I was a little iffy about it since the internet communities I frequent, were not fans. (Though, many of those same people just hate stuff for the sake of hating stuff).<br/><br/>But finally, one day, I mustered up enough boredom to watch some of it.<br/><br/>I was already unimpressed within the first 30 minutes. So much so I had to STOP watching the atrocity and find something more amusing to do. Like watching golf, or something. But a week later, I got bored enough to finish watching it.<br/><br/>Severely not impressed. First off, the leading character was massively pale herself and would have been confused whether or not SHE was a vampire, if I didn't have some minor outside knowledge already. The confusion didn't end there as she gets a crush and falls in love with this completely emotionless vampiric character.<br/><br/>The massive pitfall of this movie is when I saw that these vampires SPARKLE in daylight. Are you F-ing kidding me? That's their major curse? Their ""Skin of a monster? (Edward)"" Are you SERIOUS. Did the author of the books purposefully NOT research common vampire lore? Now, I don't mind a twist and a change here and there, and I especially don't mind day-walking vampires... But that is such a pointless and, forgive me, RETARDED 'twist' on vampire lore. Completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>And then, the cheesy and unrealistic ""speed"" effects the movie gave. No mention of logical force of movement or momentum. Nothing.<br/><br/>The only times I liked this film were all the times the vampire characters WEREN'T even on-screen. I liked the storytelling and characterization between Bella and her father. I must admit, I did like that (I'm a sucker for character development).<br/><br/>The second thing? I must admit, the final fight scene was well done. Even the aftermath just seemed to be acted better.<br/><br/>I could nitpick but really, there's no point. Twilight fans just drool over the ""hot"" Edward and non Twilight fans will watch and/or read the books and think, ""What's the big deal?"" Complete fail."

The thing I hate most about it is that everyone knows that Edward and Bella are going to fall in love... but it is probably around 1 hour and 15 minutes that they actually do ( I was in the theater so I did not know how long it was into it ) There are so many scenes of them having these little conversations that don't mean anything. I was just like get on with it, get to the important stuff!!! The reason I gave this a 3 and not a 1 is because there were a few funny moments. Awkwardly funny moments that I don't think were supposed to be funny, but they were pretty funny either way. If you are expecting it to focus on horror and romance, then you will be disappointed.

","It wasn't the worst movie I've ever watched, but below average is definitely what I'd give it. I've read the first two books, and I almost resent how teenage girls usually come to mind whenever one thinks of Twilight fan; I'm a girl of 16 yet I scorn the book and the film.<br/><br/>I had waited a long time to see the film; after reading the book, I just wanted to know that someone did a better job at it than SMeyer. I'm not disappointed, really. It really does it for me that I don't have to hear Bella adulate Edward 24/7. Enough about the book/film business, I'm going to focus on the film now.<br/><br/>There are some good shots, although the whole movie seems more or less grey. If that's their intended effect, then I have nothing to say to that. The acting, especially that of Stewart, is impossibly horrible. Her first lines, which, I suppose, were supposed to sound insightful and reflective, was monotonous and flat (as are the rest of her lines in the movie). It might be due to the fact that I just saw the Shining again and witnessed the performance of my favourite actor, Nicholson, but all I thought about when I watched it was how mediocre an actress Kristen Stewart is. I actually thought the supporting actors and actresses (Nikki Reed, Peter Facinelli and Michael Welch, for example) gave a more convincing performance.<br/><br/>The lines were cheesy and at times lame, but could have been pulled off with a little more emotion from both parties (Pattinson and Stewart). Most memorable was the scene where Edward talks to Bella for the first time in Biology, where he talks about raining. When Bella asks if he's talking to her about the weather, the least Stewart could do is act a little more incredulous, but no, it's monotone; her usual. Some scenes, to me at least, are just embarrassing to watch; and some things from the book I wish they'd left out. The first scene Edward appears, to me, was just cartoonish. Jessica was describing how gorgeous he is, yet all I saw was a very awkward grin of his that suggested anything but gorgeous. Another cartoonish segment was the part where he sparkles in the sun (complete with jingling, which was, the most comical above all), after which Bella says ""You're beautiful"". That's the part I wish they'd left out, because to me at least, it's the most childish part of the book. Among other bad lines are the part where Bella says (again, with something like monotone), ""you're impossibly fast..."". Who actually speaks like that in real life? It's been a while since I've read Twilight, and because it's not very memorable, I don't remember all the lines from the book, but I sincerely hope this is lifted from SMeyer, because otherwise it speaks of horrible script writing.<br/><br/>The romance between Bella and Edward is extremely unrealistic; after barely getting to know him (at most a month, I think), she wants to spend all of eternity with him, even leaving behind her humanity to achieve that. She has friends; she has family, yet she'd trade it all to be with a controlling and intrusive boyfriend (he watches her sleep. now that's something), who, as far as I can discern, needs therapy regarding his mood swings (even Bella acknowledges his emotional versatility). The most enjoyable part of the movie, sadly, is not the romance, but their fiasco with James. During the last part of the movie, I'd forgotten it was a romance at all (because their sad rendition of star-crossed lovers is just not memorable); James was what kept me on my seat and I could moderately enjoy that segment of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall (with five being average)? Lead Acting: 4/10 (Pattinson was slightly better, but not enough to salvage that of Stewart) Plot: 2/10 Character Development and Depth: I'd give it a zero. Dialogue: 3/10 Re-Watch: Not worth it, but I'm glad I watched it."

","I have to say I went on to view this film with very little expectations of actually thinking it was going to be good, based on all the ridiculous hype it was receiving mostly from young teenage girls and the fact that the plot and theme looked all around uninteresting to me.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes play out in a general new girl in town, getting used to everything conventional way.. she meets some friends who know some information on the school and therefore point her in the right direction to pursue a character (male) who will go onto become the trail for the plot... yeah it's generic but the setup was at least enough to keep me still interested....<br/><br/>We paddle around for another 20 minutes to inevitably get to a scene where Edward the guy reveals he's a vampire to the girl and at this point the script goes into complete preposterous avenues.... dialogue so ridiculous I was going on to have spasms and cringe from the words being said... Things seem very unnatural and merely written just to move the story along.<br/><br/>At this point I basically lost all faith in the film and I got to say it goes downhill from there. The plot sets up some very uninteresting villains and leads up to a very mediocre climax. Now I know this is an adaptation for a book and maybe it was all a lot more interesting to read rather than watch because I was bored in some spots and still choking down the awful script. <br/><br/>It's a bad sign when I have to look down at the DVD player and see how far in the picture is.. and chanting in my mind ""when is this going to end""...

"aliggrunt","3","3","5","23 April 2009"," i've never read the books and after seeing this i'm never going to either!!
","what a lame movie for many reasons.<br/><br/>firstly- Kristen Stewarts character of Bella is not even essential to the little plot in this movie because the whole way through i kept thinking that this movie could be done in so many ways without her. its not a movie where one would find it hard to imagine without certain characters because the movie and even the book i dare say could have went in a better direction without the inclusion of her character. for example i would have preferred if the love story was eliminated and they focused on the the rivalry between the Cullens and the werewolves or the vampire villains and given them a chance to be a more intricate part of the movie.i have to go back to a previous point because i can gather that the whole point of this series is the romance between Bella and Edward but it just didn't work for me which is why i think a different direction would have been better.<br/><br/>secondly- this movie focuses way to much on belle and Edward which annoyed me because the other characters were given very little screen time. it was more annoying because as i said before Bella is not essential and yet she's eating up 80 per cent of the screen time. there are plenty of characters in the Cullen family but we're not given enough time to get to know any of them and they probably could have been more interesting than the lead roles. the villains suffer from this as well because they're only two scenes before the lame baseball game scene and we don't know them. we just see them randomly attack people and we don't even get to see the attack. a film needs decent antagonists but this misses the mark totally a they have no point or motive other than to create a bit of action at the end. for me a movie is all about the development of good guys and bad guys but this has only good guy development on an uninteresting level and no bad guy element whatsoever.<br/><br/>thirdly- there is nothing interesting in this movie.towards the end i was begging for something interesting to happen and when something finally did ( Bella becoming a vampire) it went back to square one as she is saved by Edward. this was a total waste because at least if she was bitten it would have justified her characters purpose to be in this movie and the lined up sequels.<br/><br/>fourthly- it's too long and seems never ending- major cuts could have been made SKIP THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!! just when you think its over.............It continues!!<br/><br/>fifthly- the special effects in some scenes are awful and since when can vampires run up trees? also its not even true to vampires at all because sunlight doesn't burn them or anything they just glow ( LAME)<br/><br/>SIXTHLY- The performances are nothing special and are laughable in places. Kristen Stewart is lack-lustre but is the best part of this train wreck because she's cute to look at. Robert pattison is just creepy and boring in his role. he has nothing interesting to say except 'i can read everyone's mind here except yours' oh and he reveals that he is the bad guy of the film wtf!!!! sad to say that the sequels are lined up!"
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","3","5","20 January 2009"," Not as insufferable as the novel, thankfully
","First things first: ""Twilight"" is, quite possibly, the single worst novel I have ever read all the way through. Impossibly incompetent prose (the term 'purple prose' is too kind, and the novel consists almost entirely of dialogue out of an especially bad soap and masturbatory descriptions of Edward which rival the descriptions of the token 'babe' in most pulp fiction), hilariously shallow characterization, bizarre, morally reprehensible attitudes about gender equality and a very strange idea of feminism indeed. Plus, Edward is pure cardboard and Bella is the biggest bitch I can recall from any literature I've read.<br/><br/>So, why did I see ""Twilight"" last night? One: an old friend from high school was passing through town and I wanted to see her again (note to self: you stopped associating with morons for a reason). Two: I really liked ""Thirteen"", so I was hoping that Catherine Hardwicke at least did a good job directing this. Three: Kristen Stewart is eye candy, so it can't be THAT bad.<br/><br/>Well, how bad was it? Not as bad as the book. The book is pure torture. I found it laughable for a while but ultimately it became truly hard to finish because it was just so unbelievably, incredibly awful. The movie, on the other hand, is, in spite of the hilariously bad visual sensibility after a certain point and Robert Pattinson's poof haircut and lack of acting ability, fairly entertaining in spurts. Well, not really. Sort of tolerable, though. The entertainment comes through ""Dexter"" writer Melissa Rosenberg's uncanny knack for realistic, brilliant dialogue (much like the source material as well as that 'great' television show she writes for): <br/><br/>""I dream about being with you forever. "" <br/><br/>""What a sick, masochistic lion."" <br/><br/>""You know, your mood swings are kinda giving me whiplash. "" <br/><br/>""I don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore."" ""Then don't."" <br/><br/>""I hate you for making me want you so much. "" <br/><br/>among many such fabulous examples of writing. That said, Bella isn't nearly as obnoxious in the movie as she is in the book, and the movie's over fast enough, so it's not unbearably painful like the 'novel' is. Kristen Stewart gives a good performance, and yeah, Bella's got an attitude and spark in the film that her literary counterpart doesn't, so it works out better in the end. Still a bad film, still loaded with cheese, but at least it's so-bad-it's-good in places and tolerable in others."
"markthomas-1","3","3","5","21 December 2008"," Gagged and bound by its own intentions
","OK- went to see this film with friends tonight and was disappointed. There was far too much ""smell the fart"" acting replacing dialogue and it became obvious in the end that this was because no one could put sensible words in place of visual expressions. The characters were so shallow in the end this looked like a pilot for a series which should never have been given the green light. You can understand that the lead guy is goodlooking and probably will go on to do some decent stuff but so what? Some people just want to get on screen no matter how bad the movie they are in. Im afraid that this is one of those occasions. The 12A rating should have put me off, and i wish it had. Aside from being Dawson's Creek with Vampires this film was very patchy. It was as if the screenwriter couldn't decide whether visual effects were more important than the script itself. The actors seemed as if they were gagged, or prevented from actual expression and it gave the film a feeling that there should have been more to it all than there was and you got the distinct sense that those in charge of this project weren't sure how to convey the story- in long or short format: so they mixed the two. The story didn't really seem to flow and the lines the characters uttered often totally betrayed them visually and contextually. The female lead seemed like either she wanted to be, or was allowed to continue to act as if she was Juno- handling a vampire dude in school. Just bad direction and bad screenplay. The overall result was that this film was funny when it wanted to be serious, and in the end, all it was, was seriously disappointing. I do hope that they don't bore us all with another one, or if they do- at least that effort is made to actually convey something clear rather than something they don't know how to get across. OR: was i just too old for this film?! Either way, lesson learned= avoid this one if you want to keep 2 hours of your life sane."
"sw_ep_2005","3","3","5","19 December 2008"," Shallow treatment from most parties
","I hadn't read the books before watching this film, so I had no preconceived expectations, but this movie has actually put me off reading them.<br/><br/>The direction of ""Twilight"" wasn't too bad, and the heavy use of close-ups did reinforce the fused connection that the main characters had. However, it became too constricting and I honestly don't think the actors dealt with it successfully. Additionally, this movie needed more editing - a lot of the cuts were unpolished.<br/><br/>As for the acting: Stewart and Pattinson did evoke on-screen chemistry, I'll give them that. But there was nothing to support them; their attraction contained no backbone to carry through the romance. Stewart's performance lacked substance. Her narrative fell flat, especially in the beginning. Reaser could have been given more screen time, and with some more mature directing, Welch would have displayed better range.<br/><br/>I believe that the only redeeming factor in this film comes from the cinematography. Aerial, long and cross-angle shots were constructed and produced with care. Davis is obviously meant for bigger things."
"BillCollin","1","15","43","18 December 2008"," Painful and full of cringe
","The film moved slowly and painfully. The story dragged along like a wet rag. It was tedious and the acting by the lead characters, had no passion, no sense of drama and no delivery. There was no build up or tension supposed to be conveyed by their forbidden love. I thought that the lead character Edward was supposed to be a handsome, sophisticated vampire, but was sadly disappointed by the unattractive choice in Robert Patterson. Bella, attractive enough even with all the white pasty makeup couldn't stoke the fires in even the most undead with her unconvincing performance of a love struck teen. Definitely steer clear of this movie, bad special effects, cheesy dialog and full of 'cringe' moments where the scenes are so bad you can help but shun your eyes. A huge sleeper."

","The original story was annoying. They had a chance to turn the mangled story into something beautiful but it was even worse than the book... thanks to the low-budget likes of Catherine Hardwicke- who is she anyway? The main character is weak, whiny, and annoying, devoid of any talent, or specialness- why does Edward like her? who knows. There was no cohesion from the beginning. The 1st 90min of the movie was all close-ups of her lust-filled eyes when she looks into his angst-filled ones... Maybe a few minutes would be catching but a whole majority of the movie???? I will remember to never watch another Catherine Hardwicke-directed catastrophe. If it weren't for the beautiful sceneries and a couple of good actors I would give this movie maybe a 2. This is for sure the most over-rated, awful movie I've seen all year. But then again, i don't believe there's anything else out right now that's very good."

I know I have seen this when it came out, it just haunts me when people I know mention the movie. I decided to review this film even if there are more then 1,000 people already reviewed this.

","A romance movie with vampires is nothing new and could be done very well. However who thought that the boring and weak Twilight series would be a good idea?<br/><br/>The characters are dull. Every director should know that in order to have a working movie you need interesting characters but sadly this movie doesn't. I don't know a thing about these characters so why should I care about what they're doing? The acting is pathetic. I know middle school plays that have better acting. No one seems to even be trying. The story is paced terribly and doesn't even affect our 'heroes' until the third act. Instead the movie drags with zero conflict with the bland characters doing nothing. The romance is awful. I know children's cartoon characters that have more chemistry (Example would be Avatar the Last Air-bender). They hardly know anything about each other and yet they claim that their in love? I bet they don't even know what their favorite color is.<br/><br/>Just don't watch this movie or even the sequels even if you're curious."

I admit the movie is slow, but this allows you to pay attention to the slightest detail and I just love the chemistry between Edward and Bella. Their eye contact, their breathing, their body language... Simply amazing. I can only compare it to Before Sunset/Before Sunrise. Don't forget it is a teen movie, though. If you expect action, blood thirst and broken bones, this is just not for you. However, seeing the relationship between Edward and Bella evolve does leave a sense of fulfillment. When I went home after the movie, the first thing to do was to buy all 4 books and read them. I wanted to know what happened next. No doubt you would do the same thing too.

Overall pretty good with some scenes being corny but what romance, especially one involving a vampire, isn't going to be from time to time?

"tomthumb42-1","8","4","8","5 March 2009"," romance of the decade
","Twilight is a film worth seeing. Then, ""seeing again"" to appreciate what has been created. Reading through some of the comments/reviews for this film, I feel it it being unfairly compared to movies such as the Harry Potter series and Dark Knight. Keep in mind: Twilight's production budget was a paltry $37 million dollars. Is that enough to launch the film franchise of the most beloved book series since Harry Potter? Especially if the studio behind it, Summit Entertainment, wants to convert audiences who have never read Meyer's books? True, the U.S. economy is currently in a crunch. But Summit reportedly wrangled more than $1 billion in financing in April 2007, thanks to Merrill Lynch (who could have used some of that cash a few weeks ago).<br/><br/>To date, Twilight box office stats are 168 million gross. That is 5X the investment. Big budget films such as ""Dark Knight"" (155 million) grossed 533 million at the box office. Only a 3X margin. Yet people insist on comparing Twilight to the big budget films of 2008.<br/><br/>I expect Summit Entertainment will invest much more in the squeal now that they understand that they really blew it on this one in that with a strong budget, this movie could have out performed Titanic. To Summit Entertainment, I say ""pull your head out"" and don't make this mistake for the sequel.<br/><br/>The Robert Pattinson/Kristen Stewart matchup is magic."

I recommend that everyone fall in love with the teen movie that has strong performances and a climax that had me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Ex Potter star Robert Pattinson leads the cast as the Vampire who falls in love with a human. After a shaky start Pattinson settles into a performance that he plays extremely well. Pattinson has great chemistry with the films leading lady. Kristen Stewart gives a performance that is just as good as Pattinsons. All together Twilight has a great cast. I can't wait to see the wonderful cast return in New Moon.<br/><br/>A very weak part which the filmmakers seemed to have trouble with was the visual effects. Pattinsons exposed vampire skin in the sun light looked weird and some of the other effects could have been better.<br/><br/>The Twilight series is already better then Potter and i hope it continues that way.

","Let me preface by saying that I have never written a comment about a film on the internet before; however, I feel so passionately about how bad this film was, that I felt, as a person that paid to see the film, entitled to comment.<br/><br/>Yes, I read the book and am currently on the third book. The books are incredible! Stephanie, the author, made me giggle, cry, and swoon on every page from the sensual chemistry and love between Edward and Bella.<br/><br/>The film was terrible! I have a degree in film-making and I could have done a better job! The script and the cinematographer was awful! The actress that played Bella was horrible! She seemed to be having an epileptic seizure the entire film, ""i...u u u uh...um...i i i...what's wrong?"" Her performance was so distracting it took away from each scene. The film also played that way. The director tried to cram some of the important parts from the book into the movie, but not successfully. This film played like some staccato jumble. In fact, she (the director) negated some key points if ever there is to be a sequel.<br/><br/>Even if the director wasn't trying to follow the book, the film was a disgrace. There were also key elements not translated from the book about the relationship between Edward and Bella. This made the development seem unnatural and forced. I can't even comment on the scene in the secret meadow, where the director decided that Edward jumping around trying to reveal some plot line would be a good idea.<br/><br/>The one aspect that did save the film was Edward, he was magnificent. If only he had had a better co-star, they could have had significantly better on screen chemistry. Even my husband, in which I felt terrible in the end for having him take me to the film and having him sit for 120 minutes, thought that there were a lot of holes in the film and he didn't read the book.<br/><br/>The other redeeming thing about the film is ended with a Radiohead song.<br/><br/>Overall, terrible movie. It is possible to express emotion on film without over doing it, and this was too much. I think it should be redone with a better screen play, director, and lead actress."

In fact Edward is immortal, a vampire who may have found his soul mate in Bella. Edward can read everyone's mind except for Bella, perhaps fate. The noble Edward must resist his own powerful natural instincts condemning his beloved Bella to the life of a monster. However, innocent Bella invites this transformation saying, ""I dream about being with you forever."" This is the world of yearning and suffering in Director Catherine Hardwicke's ""Twilight"".<br/><br/>""Twilight"" is based on the first novel of the bestselling tween vampire series by Stephenie Meyer. Melissa Rosenberg wrote the screenplay for the Meyer book. Apparently Rosenberg's screenplay is loyal to the book which may be paradoxically a mixed blessing. Pattison and Stewart authentically enroll us in this Gothic world with their powerful performances. However, some of the dialogue borders on cheesy. This is really just an observation, and an artifact of the novel's adaptation. When Edward reveals the amazing secret of vampires in sunlight, Bella is entranced. Edward reminds, ""I'm a killer!"" In the climactic battle between Edward and the powerful malevolent James (commanding and strong Cam Gigandet), he screams, ""I'm strong enough to kill you!""<br/><br/>Surprisingly, ""Twilight"" works as a moving Gothic love story of yearning and eternal love. Yes, we are talking teen love story in the world of modern day vampires. Ultimately, Pattinson and Stewart elevate the story and the movie. Stewart is an amazing young actress. She conveys a vulnerability, strength, keen intelligence, and accessible loneliness. As Bella she displays a quiet beauty and trust. Robert Pattinson is going to be a big star. As Edward he embodies a brooding and charismatic presence reminiscent of James Dean. Pattinson also possesses a natural lightness that balances the suffering of his character. Together Pattinson and Stewart have a palpable and electric chemistry which drives ""Twilight"".<br/><br/>Bella (Stewart) is a lonely teenage girl from Phoenix, who chooses to come to live with her Dad Charlie Swan (solid and concerned Billy Burke) in a small town in Washington, when her Mom decides to go on the road with new minor league ball player husband. Charlie is a sheriff in the town. Bella meets her Dad's friends Billy and Jacob Black (Gil Birmingham and Taylor Lauter). Being the new kid at school, Bella gradually settles in. She soon encounters the mysterious Cullen's. Apparently, they are the adopted children of Dr. Carlisle Cullen (cool Peter Facinelli), who lives in a mansion on the fringe of the county. Bella finds herself strangely drawn to the sullen Edward (Pattinson). One day Edward displays amazing physical prowess when he saves Bella from certain death. Bella thanks Edward, and questions who he really is. Edward dismisses all as an adrenaline rush, and warns her to stay away. Bella is determined to uncover the truth.<br/><br/>Jacob (Lauter), who secretly is in love with Bella, tells her of an Indian legend surrounding his family and the Cullen's shrouded in the supernatural. The Cullen's are sort of ""vegetarian"" vampires, surviving only on the blood of animals‚Äînot humans. Edward is falling in love with Bella, and suffers with his instinctive blood lust. He can not allow himself to destroy the object of his love. His turmoil abounds when the human blood lusting vampires arrive: James, Laurent, and Victoria (Gigandet, Edi Gathegi, and Rochelle Lefevre). They and James in particular will kill humans to satisfy their blood hunger. Edward must protect Bella from James, and ultimately from himself.<br/><br/>Catherine Hardwicke orchestrates the furious action and Gothic love story with engrossing style and passion. ""Twilight"" has a slick and stunning visual style. Granted in a modern vampire tale, vampires are beautiful with killer abs, and haunting consciences. But then again, that is just the deal. Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart are powerful and compelling, and we care about their characters and ""Twilight"" as a whole."

","this film is a must see especially for those who have read the gripping novels!<br/><br/>i have seen this one FOUR times and every time i sit there through all the credits and want to wait for the next screening! Kristen Stewart as always is fantastic, she conveys Bella so realistically. Robert Pattinson really proved his worth as an actor as well as the pretty face- needless to say every girl in the cinema screamed when he first comes on the screen! Twilight is one of the few films that as an avid reader i feel that the novel has really been studied when writing the screen play and the actors have a true understanding of their roles in the book as well as the films plot. The soundtrack is perfect it flows amazingly, i believe the author had a great deal to do with the film and it really shows. Seeing it on the big screen is something else seriously go see it!"
"jaredmobarak","6","6","14","20 November 2008"," I don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore ¬Ö Twilight
","For some reason, vampires are making a huge comeback and while the youngsters can't watch the swearing and nudity featured with Sookie Stackhouse, they can swoon over Edward Cullen and wish to be Bella Swan. And unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately in a purely entertaining, surreal way), the girls at my screening did just that ¬Ö shrieking as the title came on screen, clapping and whispering characters' names once they appeared, and actually having panic attacks when young Robert Pattinson finally graced us with his presence. How can one not enjoy experiencing a phenomenon such as this first-hand, especially when he didn't know it was part of our youth's lexicon, let alone this big a chunk? I honestly never heard of Stephenie Meyer's series until the marketing machine started churning out the trailer for the film. Well, while it is no southern belle macabre tale as I've grown to love every Sunday night on ""True Blood"", Twilight definitely is something. What that something is, I can't quite grasp yet, however, I will say this ¬Ö it wasn't that bad.<br/><br/>One can definitely see why the tweeners love the vampire tales so much. It glorifies the life of an immortal, vaulting it to the status of godlike and virtuous. I mean, we are dealing with ""vegetarian"" vamps here¬óthey have stifled their thirst by drinking only the blood of animals, thus allowing them to integrate with society, playing human yet never revealing their true identities, (sound like manufactured Tru Blood for mainstreaming vamps? It does to me). Now don't get me wrong, I am sure these two literature sagas have nothing to do with each other, but it is an intriguing correlation considering they have come into the mainstream almost simultaneously. But Twilight has something on the scale of godlike itself¬ólegions of adoring fans, young teen girls that will do anything in order to have their parents quench the bloodlust for a glimpse at this world, one they dream of living in, to find their own hottie vampire able to save their lives whenever necessary.<br/><br/>No one would have been surprised if Hollywood, needing to market this thing to the greatest common denominator, took the tale and made it about good versus evil, the kind immortals against the evil ones. But that would have been too easy and above all else, unnecessary. The millions of people around the world, (yes, it's been translated in over 20 different languages), wouldn't have stood for anything less than the love story they have grown to adore. It is about Bella and Edward finding each other and becoming the perfect couple in Forks, Washington. Differences aside, catering predilections forgotten, these two kids truly love each other despite the reality knocking at the door telling them they should get as far from each other as possible. There is just enough conflict, just enough of a taste for the vampire feuds and dormant rivalry with the Native Americans in the region¬óa none to subtle foreshadowing of werewolves¬óto keep your interest and not hurt the romance holding it all together.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I bought into the relationship completely. Kristen Stewart and Pattinson work together as a couple with all the awkwardness of teenagers. I acquiesced to the strange courtship and eccentricity of it all because here is a man afraid of what he might do to his love. It may come across as comical because of the slowness of it all¬óthe overlong anticipation for that first kiss¬óbut it is actually completely serious. Edward needs to know for sure that the kiss won't turn into a bite, giving him the taste of blood that he won't be strong enough to fight against. With that said, there is a lot to chuckle about here. The romantic moments may play unintentionally funny, but the rest of the movie is very much intentionally unintentionally funny. That's correct; wrap your head around what I just said. It's not ""so bad it's good"" it's ""we want you to laugh, but we are going to pretend we don't, so whether you think we did or not, your laughing or lack of will both be justified"". Yes, they pander to us, hoping that whatever our reaction is, that's the reaction we are supposed to have.<br/><br/>But you know what? I loved the humor. What new kid in school gets the kind of welcome that Bella gets here? Most films will have stuff thrown at her, the cliques laughing and calling her names, only the geeks giving her the time of day because finally they aren't the butt of the jokes. Instead, Meyer has made these kids love Bella before they even know her. It was the most surreal thing in the world; I thought I was watching a ""Twilight Zone"" episode, and maybe, (due to the name), that is exactly what I was supposed to feel. She becomes Miss Popular as soon as she steps foot on school grounds ¬Ö fantastic. And with the clunky, clich√©d one-liners like the title to this review, the lion and lamb metaphor, and Billy Black's ""I'm down with the kids"", how can you not smile? As for those involved, an admirable job all-around. Hardwicke gets a bad rap sometimes, and it could be justified, but here she does what's needed. Nothing too flashy and because of the inherent campiness that appears to be wanted, the moments that seem cheesy actually work because they play that way. Even the parents, Sarah Clarke and Billy Burke, do well. And who doesn't love that Hardwicke found room for the girl that jumpstarted her career, Nikki Reed. Probably the most intriguing vamp of the bunch, she's not given much here, but hopefully the subsequent entries will beef up her somewhat jealous and spiteful mind. Yes, I believe I might actually see those sequels myself to discover if Edward and Bella can truly live happily ever after."

","i have seen many movies lately, but not even one film has impressed me like this movie. i was swept off my foot when i saw this movie, after the movie got over i was like thats it, its over!!! Edward may have not been so good in portraying his character, but he did justice on his part. the chemistry between him and Bella was so good i wasn't able to move my eyes off the screen, they were superb and the story is so nice. when i first heard it from my friends, who watched the movie i thought, 'what a vampire loving a human, the writer must be out of his mind' so i didn't watch the movie, but now i watched it due to my close friend who forced me to see it. at first i thought this movie is going to waste my time, but after the movie got over i was so much into it. so i thought it is better to watch a film first and then comment on the writer or the film.<br/><br/>amazing love story to watch"

","I've read about 4 pages of people on here writing practically essays on here on how much they hate this saying the same thing as the other (examples: too much makeup, kristen sucks, pattinson is turning into a zac efron). I agree they could of toned down the makeup on edward but it wasn't that bad. Im tired of the nonstop computer generated graphics and effects in the harry potters. Im a straight dude and i hated this movie too before i saw it because i didn't want to watch a pretty boy love story. But after i was dragged into the theater, i was surprised how good it was. I mostly just like watching it because Alice and Rosalie are freakin hot. But the story is better than i thought it would be. The scenes are cool especially the baseball one. If you don't care for the love story stuff, there is still enough other stuff to keep you interested. After seeing this i wanted to read it to see the differences and it was really nothing big. Kristen Stewart plays her the way she is in the book. I don't get why people hate her so much. You should go see this before you judge it."

"devilblack","10","5","11","12 January 2009"," Go into this with an empty mind and you will love it beyond belief
","I had read reviews for this prior to viewing and I didn't have my expectations high. I had read three quarters of the book but abandoned it due to being very far behind in a class novel which I had to write an essay about. So a few months later a movie version was released, and I still hadn't finished the book, but I thought I would just see the movie anyway because although I liked the book it wasn't something I was completely gripped into... however things have changed since then.<br/><br/>A lot of the criticism for this movie has been about Bella's acting. However I feel the intentions of the people who claim this is actually because while reading the book people have imagined themselves as Bella. Another reason is the actors in this play the characters very very very real, while the situation they are in is very fantastical and requires some suspension of disbelief. However, the story wraps itself around your imagination and becomes a film that you cant help but enjoy. Die hard fans of the book claim that the movie 'sucks compared to the book' but true fans will appreciate the movie because it wasn't until the movie that I went back and read the book from start to finish again. Robert Pattison is cast very well as Edward Cullen capturing the role very well, not quite as frightening as the book but still very very good job and it would be hard to imagine anyone else in the role.<br/><br/>The only parts of the movie I didn't enjoy is when the word 'chillax' was used. And the very UN-subtle and obvious cameo where Stephenie Meyer is handed a coffee with the waitress basically screaming into the camera 'THERE YOU GO STEPH' other than that... rather brilliant :) Oh yeah, Im seventeen, male, straight and still loved it. You can love this movie without being in love with Edward Cullen ;)"

","I usually hate vampire movies, and as a matter of fact I didn't even want to see it, but i was dragged to go and see it anyway. The movie was a vampire movie with a twist, loved the plot and thought the movie was great. It left me wanting to see more, if they bring a sequel i would definitely go and see it. Would recommend the movie to anyone. Have never read the books so I enjoyed the movie in all its glory.For those that commented on the actors makeup and all that other crap, are being ridiculous, who cares if the actors makeup wasn't perfect, it never is, its makeup! ANd for all the readers and other people that judged the movie didn't give it its rights. A lot of people didn't see the movie because people thought it was just another vampire movie. But for those average people that did were quite impressed, when i say normal i mean the people that aren't all obsessed with vampires and warlocks."
"melly47-1","10","5","11","7 January 2009"," I love Twilight!!!
","I saw this film just yesterday and I'm already planning to see it a second time at the cinema! Its so romantic.<br/><br/>The acting from the two main stars were great. 10/10 for the acting! They were very realistic as the fantasy Romeo and Juliet. The romantic dialogue gave me the chills.<br/><br/>In case you do not know what it is about or if you're thinking about seeing it, this is what is about. Its about teenage girl Bella who moves to live with her father in the city Forks. She quite quickly makes friends at the high school, but then her life is about to change forever when she meets the strange Edward Cullin. Bella is fascinated by him, and they begin to get close. Then when Edward saves Bella from a car about to hit her, by pushing it away with his bare hands, she realises that there is something strange about him and his ""family"", and she intends to find out. The results of her investigation equal only one thing..... Edward is a vampire. Bella confronts Edward, and he confesses to the fact. But now Edward and Bella are in love, so its too late to turn back. The closer Bella becomes with Edward's family, the more she endangers herself. Sorry, you'll have to see it to find out what happens to the lovers.<br/><br/>I loved it, and for me.... thats all that matters."

On Screen Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart play these characters so well. The tension, the passion was all there and i instantly fell in love with the whole thing.

I've read the book, its very addicting and it was well adapted into a movie, for the most part, i wish they worked on Bella & Edward's romance bit more, but i guess you cant have your cake and eat it too. Its not Godfather or Slumdog, its a teen vampire romance, and it helps that Rob Pattinson is dreamy, if you're into skinny pale rocker type ;) Enjoy it for what it is.

"tvillanueva","10","5","11","1 January 2009"," Worthwhile and compelling film!
","Twilight, being dubbed as the next Harry Potter, is the modern day Romeo and Juliet. Bella Swan, an ordinary girl, grudgingly moves to the small town of Forks WA to live with her father Charlie while her mother travels. To her surprise, all the boys vie for her attention, but she is drawn in to the one exception: the mysterious and alluring Edward Cullen. Initially utterly repulsed by the strongest scent he's smelled in his 108 year existence, Bella uncovers his secret and they soon fall in a forbidden love. When 3 nomadic vampires arrive, including a tracker who makes it his mission to kill Bella, Edward and his family fight to protect her.<br/><br/>To avid fans of the novel, Twilight will not disappoint you despite weaknesses in the movie. E&B chemistry may seem quite awkward, and Jacob & Esme are just faces in the movie - no personality, no story, no lines. The Quileute scenes are somewhat disappointing because they have been scrambled and lack appropriate time. The biggest disappointment was how Alice's past was never mentioned, and how can that possibly be written in NM? The special effects of a sparkly Edward were exceptional, which compensated for the insignificant meadow setting and emotionless scene. However, I enjoyed the E&B tension and chemistry, as well as the Ballet Scene (exceptional acting!). Viewers are sure to laugh at the characters (Emmett & Alice in particular), and the baseball scene is a personal favourite. For those who haven't read the book, Twilight will fail to disorientate you with the arrival of the nomads as they are given a good back story.<br/><br/>Overall, despite missing significant scenes, characters and the E&B tension that allures readers, Twilight is my personal favourite, and is a worthwhile experience to see the movie which follows suit to the book despite its flaws."

","I read the books- ALL of them- in a week. I couldn't put them down. I found myself falling in love with Edward. How ridiculous, I know... a 28 year old falling for a character in a young adult novel. Trust me, I felt as stupid as I sound:) I REALLY wanted the movie to be great. I was so excited I had almost all of my coworkers go with me to opening night at the movie. I should have known by the ridiculous little girls waiting in line with me that it was going to be cheezy.<br/><br/>I felt like they SMOOSHED together a lot of unrelated scenes from the book to make a teeny little scene in the movie. And Bella!... Oh Bella... in the scene where she admits to Edward that she knew what he was?... She's telling him she's not afraid of him, but her frigging shoulders were up past her ears! If you aren't afraid, act like it!! Jacob is all wrong... I couldn't stop looking at his fake tan and funky nose to listen to much of the poorly delivered lines he had... I don't remember Victoria having any speaking parts in the first book either. She was not nearly as scary as Stephenie Meyer explained her to be, I think the talking helped with that, she was so much more mysterious before she opened her mouth...<br/><br/>I dunno... I think now that they see how much people love the characters, the next movie should be far better. I'll be there for that one... unfortunately, my coworkers and husband may not be. I found myself defending the characters and telling them they had to read the book to see what I was raving about.

Robert Pattinson on the other hand did the best he could with what he had and really did a surprisingly good job. The plot, if you can call it that, is actually dumber than the book- which is a magnificent feat. There is no character development. The viewer has no idea why the characters like each other or what's going on for that matter. The sad thing is the book and the movie aren't that far off.

Stewart is terrific as the curious teen who goes from new girl in town to becoming the girlfriend to a vampire. Her desire to become a vampire herself certainly indicates that her self outlook is lacking. Robert Pattinson does well as the vampire whose family eats animals only. That is a sneaky method of making them the good guys even though it is merely tacky. Billy Burke plays Stewart's father who moves her into town and then is involved in a string of murder investigations. Featured among flat supporting roles are Peter Facinelli as a fellow vampire in the clan. Ashley Greene plays another vampire who came make predictions into the future based on one's choices. Interesting theme regarding relationship gaps within a totally warped worldview. Score: 5 √Ç¬Ω / 10"

","The Mormon allegory about resisting sexual impulses finally reaches the big screen with Twilight. This is, of course, the film adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's teen sensation novel and should be the first of about four in the series. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke, this bit of cornball vampire-romance schlock is the buzz of the preteen-to-teen set and the talk of everyone who hasn't seen another vampire movie or read another vampire book, like, ever.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart stars as Bella, perhaps one of the most annoying protagonists put to film in 2008. She's a dreary, gawky, breathy teen with no personality and nothing to latch on to from a cinematic perspective. Bella moves to Forks, which according to Meyer's book is an incredible rainy locale, and lives with her father on the rugged Washington coast. She heads to a new school, where apparently every student has read her bio before her arrival, and makes friends easily despite having no discernible social skills and no actual likable qualities.<br/><br/>Eventually Bella discovers the one and only Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) in biology class. She is drawn to him instantly, as he is to her. Their breathless exchanges, their constant blinking and biting of lips, and their mumbled phrases abruptly blossom into a romance for the ages. One catch, of course, is that Edward is a vampire desperately trying to resist his ""thirst"" for Bella. Bella, on the other hand, seems to have no problem putting Edward through absolute hell if it means she can be with him.<br/><br/>We meet Edward's family, a strange crew of pale-faced nobodies, and a plot develops in which another vampire thirsts after Bella. Edward and his family only consume animal blood, thus making them vegetarians. Go figure. With Edward and Co. resisting the blood of Bella, they find time to play baseball and hang out with her. They take to her right away, just like Edward did, and soon enough they're risking it all to protect her from vampires who in reality do nosh on human blood.<br/><br/>Twilight carries on a basic idea of denial in that the ""good"" vampires manage to rebuff their instinctive longing for blood and apparently never take human blood no matter how burly the impulses are. No matter how much heavy breathing Bella does, no matter how much she bites her lip, and no matter how much she mumbles over her words in that mouth- watering adolescent way, Edward doesn't dare move from his staunch position of abstemiousness.<br/><br/>As a film, Twilight is terrible. The performances are awful from top to bottom, with negligible flashes of actual personality and life from the characters. Performers mumble, stumble, and stagger around the screen in an attempt to introduce us to these characters, but nothing really takes hold and the end results are colourless and ripe for Airplane!-style satire. Stewart inhabits Bella with such breathiness, such irritation, and such idiocy that one has trouble feeling any concern for her character at all. After all, why would we?<br/><br/>Pattinson might look the part, I suppose, as Edward, but he sure as hell does little to act the part. His is the most unexciting vampire of all time, I daresay. Part of this is Meyer's fault, sure, as Pattinson can't help the ridiculousness of ""getting all shiny"" when the sun comes out or the daft logistics of sucking the blood out of a deer. Pattinson's leering, gloomy, mind-numbing performance does little to drum up interest in the character beyond the phony morons of the eighth grade.<br/><br/>But enough is enough. Let's set aside the pitiable constitution of the motion picture for a moment. Let's ignore the fact that the movie manages to leave its established first person set-up to explore a pair of scenes that we really don't need to see. Let's pretend we never saw Bella shake a squeezable ketchup bottle. Let's imagine that the soundtrack wasn't a sweltering turd of tacky music set at the worst conceivable times. Let's imagine the movie had even one segment with some humour or wit. And let's pretend that the closing credits weren't among the most ostentatious and garish of all time.<br/><br/>What we're left with are the bones of a poor vampire movie that attempts to teach us a lesson about self-abnegation. It's about negating desires, about resisting life, about abstaining from impulses. This may or may not be a laudable message, depending on where your morality lies. But one thing Twilight and Stephanie Meyer's complete bleak, cowardly, decomposing empire is is a spineless and brainless excuse for literature. And it's a howling shame that this preposterous excuse for literature became a boring and dire excuse for a film."

","As an avid fan of the Twilight saga, I was very nervous about the film adaptation of my favorite story about a girl and her vampire love, but the cast and crew of this movie did an absolutely amazing job. I don't think I ever could have anticipated a better, more loyal portrayal. I'm not going to say that the movie is a perfect adaptation of the book, because it's not. There are differences between the two, but I think that those differences are what makes the movie so amazing. The movie would have been incredibly boring if every aspect of the book had been translated to the screen. On the other hand, if some of the material that was added to the movie to enhance the story had also been in the book, I think it actually would have been more of a distraction. The side story of the evil vampires is crucial to the flow of the movie, but had no place in the book. I commend Melissa Rosenberg and Catherine Hardwicke for bringing the book to the screen in such a loyal fashion, and I have great admiration for the actors for portraying these much beloved characters in such a way that I can't wait for my next chance to see the movie. Above all, I think that Stephenie Meyers' amazing story has now been proved to be able to translate to a variety of mediums."

","The first time I saw this movie I did like it, but I wasn't sure if the characters they chose were the right ones, or if the variations from the book were a good thing, and I wasn't sure how I felt about some of the acting. It took until the 4th time I saw it before I loved it! I decided that yeah, they changed and added some things, but some of those additions were a good thing like having James and his coven all through the movie rather then in the book where they just show up and then they kill James a chapter or 2 later. That always kind of bugged me.<br/><br/>If you read the movie companion, you'll find out just how difficult it was for them to even get this movie made. That helped me appreciate what we got! Check it out...it's very interesting! <br/><br/>I wish they would have had her talk in her sleep and some other things, but do all the variations and stuff they left out really matter? I don't think so. And some things work for a book but don't work for a movie, so you have to look at the movie and book as 2 different things really. You can enjoy them both even if you'll just give the movie a real chance. Like me...it took 4 times before I loved it. It might take you a while, but I think given time you'll love it! If you don't, you're just cheating yourself out of something amazing! <br/><br/>I saw this movie more times then I've ever seen any movie in the theater, and I plan on topping that with New Moon!"
"hs662","10","5","12","3 May 2009"," Awesome movie
","I loved the movie. I didn't expect anything like that because I have not read the novel. But Its one of my favourite all time movies. Its a perfectly romantic movie, very intriguing, spooky and has all the shades of an all time love story. Robert Pattinson played the character of Edward Cullin very well. He looks hot and portrays the character of the vampire to the best of his ability. He is perfectly believable as the vampire who looks cold and indifferent in the first part and then strong and a true lover in the second part. I am surprised the movie has a low rating because it has a great feel to it, it makes you wanna believe in the fantasy of beauty and the beast and all the other romantic love stories. <br/><br/>I am so looking forward to the sequel .Bella was great too and all the other actors did a very good job as well... I would say to all the people who are planning on renting the DVD or watching it otherwise go head and do it. I am sure you ll love it. I plan on watching it again and again......."
"tim-2404","3","5","12","23 November 2008"," If you have never read the book...
","Before I tear into this movie, I just wanted to say, I know what the director and producer were going for with this movie. They wanted an artsy-type film that followed the book in as many of the important areas as possible. They wanted the acting and make-up to be over-dramatic and scenes to be very surreal. They tried to pull it off, but it didn't quite turn out as planned.<br/><br/>I went to this without having read the book. I saw the previews, and it looked pretty sweet. I was pumped up for the movie, and then it started, and it went downhill from there. First of all, the make-up is HORRIBLE. I understand they are vampires, but Edward and his buddies look like they are straight out of an 80's music video with WAY too much lipstick. Second, the special effects were something straight out of network TV (comparable to Buffy the Vampire Slayer). I'm not saying there is anything wrong with the special effects on network TV, but they have a pretty limited budget to work with. A movie that was going to be HUGE should have had a slightly bigger budget to spend on special effects. The next thing I found sub-par was the overly-cheesy romantic dialogue. They were trying to keep with the text from the book, but certain things just sound better when you read them. All in all, the movie was a complete let down, and should have been a straight to DVD release.<br/><br/>The last thing I am going to say is that I almost guarantee there will be a sequel to this movie. The book has such a huge fan base that even with a movie directed and produced like this, they will make bank. They will try to capitalize on the next book and will probably make just as much on the next movie. All I hope for is that they stray from the text just slightly so it is not quite as cheesy and spend a little more on the special effects. And if it isn't too much to ask, fire the director, producer, and anyone else associated with the production of the first movie."
"rgrein9","5","5","12","21 November 2008"," slow and shallow, but a few scenes are GEMS!
","I have not read the books, so please only take this review from a strictly film oriented point of view. Twilight is a slow film with a juvenile love story and awkward dialogue. Don't judge me for my nerdiness, but I feel like Twilight is on the same level as the last Star Wars film released - most die hard fans will enjoy just because it is the story on film, but the rest of the world could take it or leave it. Mediocre acting, crappy special effects, jumpy plot lines, and absolutely NO SUBPLOT make the movie boring. Two out of the four people in my group slept through most of it. <br/><br/>If you want to watch this movie, look out for the few highlights: - Bella's father is wonderful. This is probably the best acted role of the entire film: funny, but also sympathetic. - Any scene where most of the Cullen family is present. Their interesting dynamic and great chemistry should have been utilized a lot more - The beautiful scenery of the northwest."
"svenjins","1","50","205","30 December 2008"," This movie was garbage.
","Good adaptation? Excellent movie? I hope those of you writing these reviews never watch another movie again. I'm marking it as ""spoiler"" because it MIGHT contain some small ones, but if you go see this movie, it's already spoiled, rotted, and dessicated without any help from me.<br/><br/>This movie stank. It was inept on almost every level. The acting was mediocre at best, the characters were poorly developed, the camera work was painful at times, the effects were laughably bad, the wirework is the worst I've ever seen, and the whole story is so ludicrous that I wanted to rip my hair out.<br/><br/>First off, these aren't vampires. Dracula was a vampire. These ""vampires"" have almost nothing in common aside from drinking blood and being immortal and...wait, that's it. They walk in the daylight (and ooh! They sparkle, because teenie girls love sparkles!), they don't have fangs, they don't sleep in coffins, turn into bats, don't have an aversion to silver or garlic, walk over running water, don't mind crosses...the list goes on. Some of that is forgivable, but all of it? Nope. This is yet another pop-culture pussification of vampires, turning them into something ludicrous and throwing almost all the mythology out the window. Give me a nightwalking, bloodsucking, evil minion of the devil any day of the week. Don't call the Twilight ""vampires"" by that name because, quite frankly, they're not.<br/><br/>Was the director of this movie high the whole time? Did she bother to try directing the actors, much less go over their dialog and realize that no normal human being would talk like that? The culmination of the two would be Bella blubbering in bed at the end for Edward to not leave her. I almost burst out laughing, but by then my soul had been sapped to the point that I thought laughter would be impossible. And I think her only direction for the vampires was, ""Okay, ready, set, ACTION! Okay guys, SMOLDER! SMOLDER! SMOLDER!"", because that's about the extent of the vampire ""acting"" in this movie. Lots of smoldering looks and very little else. And couldn't she have made sure the effects weren't awful? Seriously, who could have seen the fast vampire effect and thought it looked better than Scifi channel original movie effects? Did the director blow all the budget on crack to use while she was making this? And what was with the horrid wirework? Seriously. Watch Edward jumping from his window to the tree outside and see how he moves in a perfectly straight line. Watch the bad vampire jump over Bella and watch how his trajectory dips, then arcs UP, then drops in front of her. It's unbelievable. And did anyone else notice how the camera-work in the woods when Bella says she knows that Edward is a vampire was pointless and utterly distracting? Sorry, but that's not a good way to convey what was happening. Try again. Oh, wait, the studio decided you couldn't. Sorry.<br/><br/>Why the heck is Edward so dreamy? He's a creepy stalker! He sneaks into Bella's room at night and watches her sleep? Oooh, so romantic! I sneak into a girl's room at night to watch her sleep? Pepper spray, a boot to the balls, and lots of community service. He follows her around wherever she goes? Nah, not stalking at all. He's just enamored with her and it's sooo dreamy! What a hairy load. Setting aside his saving her life twice (a contrivance so they can speed things up and they don't have to make them fall in love the old fashioned way), Edward could do anything to her and it would be so wonderful. I cannot understand that. Maybe that's why so many women will date total jerks and excuse everything they do. It explains a lot, actually.<br/><br/>Sorry, but his movie is crap. Those who love it are likely so whipped up into a fervor about the book being turned into a movie that they'd watch anything with Edward in it. It could be Hostel 3: Vampire Style with Edward ripping limbs off of Bella in a bloodbath and it would be wonderful to them. Girls, I know you're obsessed with this fictional character in ways that only hardcore comic book nerds could ever hope to match, but please, step out of that bubble and actually WATCH the movie. Please. We don't need any more lazy, crappy cinema staining the multiplex screens. There's enough of that coming out of Hollywood these days. My wife loves the books (and I get to hear all about them...groan), but at least she's not so wrapped up in it that she couldn't admit the movie sucked. She's at least got that going for her. Other fans with claw your eyes out if you dare speak ill of it. Makes me wanna puke."

","Twilight is one of best love story made to film. it is best movie series ever. <br/><br/>Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood."
"donnadonut1983-167-897991","9","4","9","30 September 2011"," A good movie but should stick to the book
","Most people have read the books before the movie. For me, it was the other way around. When I watched the movie, I didn't even know there were books so after seeing the film, I was really excited to learn that there was because I liked the film a lot and take it from someone who hasn't read a lot of books, it means a lot to say that this film inspired me to read the books. Sadly, that is the films biggest credit because once I read the book, I was amazed at how much better the book was. There were far too many scenes from the book that didn't happen on film and I know it's difficult to fit everything from a book into a movie but I feel they cut a lot of important things in the movie especially when it comes to Bella and Edward falling for each other. In the movie, it just happened far too quickly which wasn't believable. One minute he was trying to stay away from her and the next he was declaring his love for her. They should have stuck to the book as this was the whole point of the first book. The casting was done quite well. Robert Pattinson plays a really good vampire and the other vampires were believable too. As for Kristen Stweart who plays Bella, Im torn with her because the first half of the film, I really like her role in this but then she just becomes too much for me as she never smiles and it becomes quite depressing to watch. I know in the book, Bella isn't supposed to be your typical girl but I feel she plays this role too much to the extreme and by the end of it, I wouldn't be that bothered if Edward told her to take a hike but in the book I can relate more to Bella.<br/><br/>Overall I've given this movie a good rating because I wanted to rate it based on the very first time I watched it and since I had no book to compare it with, I thoroughly enjoyed it so if you want my advise, watch the movies first because it is a good story and read the books afterwards because you'll enjoy them much more"

","Yesterday I finally got to see the Twilight film, and came out of the theater wishing I never did.<br/><br/>I tried to look at it as if I never heard of Twilight at all. Sadfully, from the get go my mind immediately started reminding me of all the things that are just plain wrong in this film. Little and not so little details that could have made things so much better.<br/><br/>The romantic story was rushed. Twilight is all about the romance between Edward and Bella, and the trouble that romance brings. Yet I feel that their blooming love was rushed in order to have enough time left in the film for the threat that is James, the vampire bad guy and hunter extraordinaire.<br/><br/>The editing in this film is easily some of the worst I've seen in a good long time. many scenes are just cut off, to be replaced by the next and take away the flow of the film.<br/><br/>I know it's an adaptation of a book. And that's always a hard thing to do. Some things need to be left out or changed in order for a film to work. But there are some scenes I feel, they shouldn't have done the way they have. I.E. The meadow scene. Twilighters will know which one I mean.<br/><br/>Knowing this was a fairly low-budget production, I can forgive some of the visual effects, But don't expect to be seeing any high end stuff here. To the production team: Normal movement, or even slow-mo, combined with a blurry effect looking like it was created in photoshop does not make something look like it's going fast, it just makes it look cheap.<br/><br/>There are some good things about this movie. The chemistry between the two leads is great and had me captivated each time. Most of the support characters are decent as well. Some of my favorites being Michael Welch's part as typical teen Mike Newton and Nikki Reed's depiction of Rosalie hale, Edward's ""sister"" in the little vampire family.<br/><br/>The scenes between the lead characters are highly entertaining. But the film fails to deliver the same amount of tension and suspense that the books do. There are too many sudden stops to the scenes for that.<br/><br/>Lastly, the writing could and should have been much better. I cringed at quite a few lines, which tried to be adaptations of the lines in the book. If they're planning a sequel I can say only one thing about this: Some lines are memorable, and great. Changing them and sometimes the context in which they are said is bad, okay? Overall, twilight was an okay film, with bad writing, poor editing and at times it was poorly directed. Fans should see it, and they will but I wouldn't recommend this one."
"aqua230","6","4","9","30 November 2008"," Nothing compared to the book
","As an avid reader of the Twilight books, I was so excited to see my favourite books brought to life on the big screen. Boy was I disappointed.<br/><br/>The whole film seemed much too rushed. One minute Bella and Edward have just met, the next minute they're all ""I'd die for you, you're my life now..."" If I hadn't read the books I would've been sitting there thinking wth are they on drugs or something? Oh, and Edward's first reaction to Bella in Bio is actually laughable. And they didn't even include the blood typing scene!<br/><br/>The Cullen siblings and the school people (Jessica etc) didn't get nearly enough screen time, which is a real shame because they did so well in their roles. I especially liked Rosalie and Alice, they really did their characters justice. They're one of the few reasons I gave more than 2* to this film. Tyler and Eric didn't look anything like I would've thought (weren't they geeks or something). And there was none of the Tyler asking Bella to prom then Bella moaning to Edward about it. <br/><br/>The best scene in the movie has to have been the baseball scene, the music was fab and the scene just worked really well. However the meadow scene (which for people who've read the book, was highly anticipated) was terrible. Edward barely sparkled (they could've at least gotten that swarovski bodysuit from Britney's toxic video). And they ruined the lion/lamb quote- it looked like they'd just got nowhere else to put it so shoved it in quickly at the end. Even the speed running in the forest looked fake and I had to laugh. <br/><br/>The prom scene at the end, seemed like they'd just shoved a load of one-liners from the book in at the last minute. <br/><br/>Basically, if you haven't read the books, don't bother. And if you have, well, prepare for disappointment."
"ubtaught","6","4","9","29 November 2008"," Poorly done in an odd way
","First, the good news: Scene location and set dressing was very good. Assistant Directing, as seen by the fact that the extras and bit players did an excellent job and the job of managing them is usually given to an AD, was excellent. Wardrobe was good as well. The make up was second rate but okay. Continuity was fair to good. The set designer did an excellent job.<br/><br/>Bad News: The musical score was horrid and poorly edited. The music suggested to me a cell phone conversation going on behind me for how it distracted. The screen play was rushed and out of cadence. It suggested that the screenplay was written by a pack of rushed and angry Girl Scouts, some of whom read the book. The entire movie had the feel of a poorly written Cliff Notes read at a slumber party. For instance, who chose that mid sized town? That was a BIG mistake. If you are going to alter the book, do so in a manner that compliments the visual medium of a 'film'.<br/><br/>The main actors had the potential to do well but, in my opinion, their miscues and poor cadence was a directing error and did the main actors no justice. Whomever coached or directed the extras and bit players should have directed the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I was vastly disappointed with the film. Some might say, okay, tell us what you would have done! Okay, first, the washed out, falsely 'indie' nature of the initial scene in Phoenix could have lead to the slowly resolving clear, crisp greens of Forks (ala Wizard of Oz when Dorothy steps out of her house in Oz)as she falls in love. Hell, give me a reason she fell in love (missing from the visual media). The wings behind the vampire (white owl wings) suggested a movie filled with interesting metaphorical scenes (ala an old fashioned 'European' film) but that hope faded as well. Oh, and did I say the sound track was horrid? An after school club full of Junior High students with MP3 players and access to third rate instrument packages found in the toy section of Wal Mart could have done better. The only passable music came at the end.<br/><br/>The movie sucked all the life out of the book and left a dry husk to stumble about in front of a camera whose motions were directed by a disinterested person named 'director' for some reason. In that regard, the movie was pornography with the actors wearing clothing and the sex scenes as washed out and empty caricatures of the emotions barely perceived in the background.<br/><br/>I welcome rebuttal."

Not only was it slow, choppy and full of a few bad actors, it also showed no chemistry between Bella and Edward. It was like they just took snip-its from the book and put it in the film. The film had a major lack of flow to it as well. I believe they RUINED the book and those who have not read the book are not going to be enticed to do so after watching the movie. If they do decide to make the second movie I seriously urge them to find some other director. These books are amazing and deserve better. The movie doesn't do the book justice."

","My family has been raving about these books for months now, so I tagged along with them to see the movie. I figured if I liked the movies I'll read the books.<br/><br/>The general consensus from the ""fans"" I was with is that the movie was ""OK"" but ""didn't really do the books justice"". I can only hope that the books are a HUGE improvement. My main beef was that the acting was just awful. The plot seemed to jump around way to much, the fans I was watching with told me a bunch of stuff was skipped over. To much in that case.<br/><br/>The only thing that saved this movie was the delightful seen of the Dad cleaning his guns when Edward showed up to date Bella. This is only funny cause that's exactly what I plan to do when my own daughter (another Bella) starts dating. :-D If you want to see a good conversion of a vampire book series I recommend ""True Blood"". Hopefully the filmmakers will take some cues from this for the sequel.<br/><br/>Oh and the books? I read the first one to see if I was in for a pleasant surprise. I ended up reading all 4 and for a fantasy teen romance they're OK I suppose but I don't plan on reading them again."
"dffrntsilver81","5","4","9","25 November 2008"," Rushed
","All in all, I felt that the movie was rushed. Yea, it hit the high points for the most part, but too many of the subtleties were left out. This is by no means the worst book to movie adaptation, that spot is reserved for the horrid Harry Potter movies and the White Fang movie (which didn't share anything with the book except the title and a wolf!). It was OK. I've been hooked on the Twilight series since page one, and in turn have hooked many others. It was better than I expected and Edward and Bella grew on me as the movie went. But for the movie being 2 hours, I really just felt like it hopped from one major point to another without explaining the relationships between the characters. If you hadn't read the book you might get confused (I explained a lot of it to my wife who hadn't read it but wants to now), but you'll get the gist of it. And basically, that's all it was. The gist of the major points of the book. In one word, RUSHED."
"Len9876","6","4","9","25 November 2008"," Read the book. It's so much better than the film.
","I did not like the acting, directing, or screen writing in this dull and awkward film--but, primarily, the blame seems to be on Hardwicke and Pattinson. His characterization, however, was intriguing.<br/><br/>Stewart sulks a great deal. The best scenes were with her father. But, the sparks between Bella and Edward never seem to catch on fire.<br/><br/>Part of the blame seems to point to the film's lack of development. Relationships are or should be an integral part of the film, but there seems to be no attempt at getting to know what motivates and stimulates the characters.<br/><br/>The film lacks emotion and poignancy, moves too fast, and gets stuck on a subplot--which, in my opinion, could have been deleted from the start or edited out after viewing the rushes (if scenes mid-way into the film ended up on the cutting room floor, they never would have been missed).<br/><br/>Special effects were poor, but were obviously added to compensate for the poorly-developed script. Hardwicke came through with the teen, but was absent in some very-important scenes, but this may be a problem with the direction rather than the acting.<br/><br/>""Twilight"" misses out on effectively probing the things that each of the characters wanted, but could not get. The film is a metaphor for sex, but fails to tell a compelling story to hold one's interest. Because the focus is blurred, there is little or no clarity. And, the film is not well grounded.<br/><br/>I rank the film a 6 out of 10--but, if the film was better developed, it would hold more promise. As is, the chemistry does not really work. ""Twilight"" ends up leaving its audience completely in the dark."
"pgtmatrix","5","4","9","23 November 2008"," A letdown even though some things were done right.
","Okay. So first thing's first. Twilight just isn't a good movie. even if you haven't read the books. However there are some things that were done right. Some things that were done horribly wrong.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: -The scenery was perfect. Almost exactly how i imagined it in the book. Very well done.<br/><br/>-Edward and Bella were almost perfectly cast, even though their acting at most parts was sub-par.<br/><br/>-Bella's Lullaby was a great song. I'm surprised at how good the song itself was.<br/><br/>-The baseball scene was exceptionally well filmed. This was by far my favorite part of the movie.<br/><br/>-The casting for the most part was pretty good. My favorite character was definitely Alice Cullen. She was gorgeous and she played her part perfectly.<br/><br/>-I think the music for the most part fit the scenes.<br/><br/>-There is a notable amount of dialogue that is taken directly from the book.<br/><br/>THE BAD: -The acting was just flat out bad. This is especially noted by Bella's constant erratic blinking and Edward's first scene in Biology where he looks like he is having a bowel movement.<br/><br/>-The transitions. The movie had terrible pacing and the transitions were choppy. This is a result of poor directing and editing.<br/><br/>-Visual Effects were extremely low budget and very cheesy.<br/><br/>-The storyline was not just tweaked a bit to adapt the book to film. It was butchered. Things were in the wrong order, characters were added, important details were completely removed, and some details were awkwardly placed or barely mentioned so it would be confusing to someone who hasn't read the book.<br/><br/>-Cinematography. Okay. So the scenery was beautiful. But the angles and camera movements were comparable to a high school film project.<br/><br/>-Many scenes that were meant to be serious were unintentionally funny. And there was some added intentional humor which didn't fit the tone set by the book.<br/><br/>-My BIGGEST gripe with the film is that the book is a love story. And the movie was so incredibly cheesy that it didn't even feel like Bella and Edward were in love. Moreso awkwardly infatuated with each other.<br/><br/>VERDICT: -If you've read the book you will obviously want to see the film. no mater how bad the things you heard about it are. But the bottom line is, even if it wasn't based off a popular novel, it still wouldn't be a good movie. paying 10 dollars to see a film of this quality is ridiculous. I honestly think that if this film were to be redone with a higher budget, better director, and had the cast actually read the book, it would be 10 times better.<br/><br/>Awkwardly enough, even though i KNOW that this movie wasn't good. I want to see it again. So they must have done something right. Maybe its just because i love the book so much. I honestly hope they will remake this movie and capture the real magic of the book properly on film. Because the story is very film worthy. It just wasn't done correctly.<br/><br/>And to anyone who compares this movie to the harry potter films or the lord of the rings films. Please stop being biased because of your love of book. Because the main difference between those films and this one, is that those movies were actually GOOD.<br/><br/>SCORE: 6/10"
"cheerbaby_hottie","7","4","9","23 November 2008"," My opinion
","Well for starters I am a twilight fan. I have read all the books and was very excited to see the movie. I was a little disappointed. I believe that the movie felt very rushed. I as also disappointed about a few things they left out. For example in the book when they are in the ballet studio James tells Bella about Alice. In the movie Alice was never mentioned. I also felt that they did not show as much of the romance between Bella and Edward. With that said i do not think the movie was as bad as a lot of people on here are saying. I have seen far worse movies. I have actually seen the movie twice already because I went with family. I have to say I liked it better the second time. I think I just had all these expectations. There was really only one scene in the movie that I absolutely hated. I could not even stand to look at rob when he glittered in the sunlight. It was so cheesy looking I could not help but laugh. It looks like they just rolled a whole bunch of body glitter on him. Overall I think the movie was very comical. I would recommend seeing it for yourself because everyone has different opinions. Don't let what one person said stop you from seeing the movie. I hope the sequels get made."
"jungmin88","5","4","9","23 November 2008"," Twilight Movie Review
","Honestly, I was pretty disappointed with Twilight. First off, I think Catherine Hardwicke was a really bad choice for a director. The first half of the movie was bad because she kept changing the story. I understand that it's BASED on the book and isn't word for word, but she left out too many important details. The most important would be the beginning of Edward and Bella's relationship, and how it developed into what it is. Twilight was meant to be a love story, but instead it lacked a lot of the romance that it was supposed to have. The acting was somewhat mediocre, aside from a select few. I like Kristen Stewart as Bella, but I think she overdid it with some of the scenes. The worst acting in the movie was all of Bella's friends at school. Not only was their acting horrendous, their lines were awkward and others were all thrown together at the same time. It was just chaotic when they were around, I felt like I was watching a bunch of little kids with no experience trying to act out a funny scene. I did, however, like the way Hardwicke moved scenes around a bit in the beginning to save time and to fit her budget accordingly. One unexpected but pleasant change was that she made Twilight into a bit of a romantic comedy. It would've been good if she didn't add too many opposing themes; funny and light at the beginning, but extremely serious and dramatic at the end, with absolutely no transition. What I really didn't like was her need to throw in a bunch of sloppy and ""artistic"" camera angles. They were too fast-paced and also took the focus off the main characters at the most critical times. The second half of the movie was a lot better because there were so many major things going on that she didn't focus on trying to make the scenes complicated looking, and she followed the script without any alterations. The soundtrack was good, but half of it was added to the film very poorly, while the other half was perfect. Twilight was supposed to be about Edward and Bella, but you couldn't really see or feel the intensity behind their love until later in the movie. It would be very confusing for someone watching it who has never read the book or understood the dynamics of their complicated relationship already. This movie had so much potential, but Hardwicke diminished the possibility of it being a hit. She tried too hard to make it look like a very modest indie film, when in fact, it isn't. The special effects weren't very impressive either, for instance when Edward walks into the sunlight. I was skeptical about watching the movie at first because I had a feeling it would ruin the original story. It definitely didn't do the book any justice. I think if someone else besides Hardwicke had directed, someone who knew what they were doing, Twilight would've been a huge success."
"thilesgirl","5","4","9","22 November 2008"," Needed Help
","I went to this film with an open mind. However, I found the movie sorely lacking. The script was terrible, the lines in first 45 minutes of the movie seemed to hint at something dark and ominous; each was line said as if it had a deep and terrible meaning. Unfortunately, for those movie watchers who had not read the book (or even in truth, for some who had) this was more than a little frustrating and confusing as more and more ominous lines came hurling at the audience with no explanation. A little foreshadowing is perfect for this story, but it was carried to the point of sheer annoyance. Other meaningful dialogue between characters was delivered flatly, utterly lacking in emotion and unimportant to the audience as it was interaction between a main character and someone who the audience didn't care about. However, the movie did have some good qualities. It was filled with artful filming and good songs by popular artists, most notably Muse and Linkin Park. Nevertheless, the movie left me feeling like I had just watched Romeo and Juliet with vampires, infused strongly with some soap opera melodramatics."
"croupel","4","4","9","22 November 2008"," Twilight Movie Review
","Unless you are a female between the ages of 8 and 16, you will find my review handy before depositing your $10 for a movie ticket to see Twilight.<br/><br/>This film does not rate in the worst movies ever made. However, it lacks much in way of entertaining anyone with a good eye for book to screen translations. To begin, the beauty of the novel is a blossoming love between an ordinary girl, who almost agitates with her self-image of unworthiness, and a devastatingly handsome immortal being who thought he did not have the capacity to love. This is lost in a film that does not focus enough on the building of the relationship between Edward and Bella. One scene Edward is overdramatically holding his nose in opposition to Bella's odor and the next they are making out in Bella's bed and all she is wearing is a tank top and underwear?! What happened to all the heart to hearts where the two really start to see what they bring out in each other? Is it a time issue? Then get rid of scenes like the field trip to the nursery! Since the proper foundation is not laid for their relationship, all intimate moments are awkward and unnatural. Next we have the special effects. Why was money spent on making the vampires fly? That wasn't a ""power"" they had. Or how about the glittering Edward? I think I own the same body glitter that they used. Here is what I was talking about with the translation from book to screen. A sparkling man is okay on the pages of a young adult novel. In a movie he should simply have a warm glow about him because the glitter looks cheap. My third issue is the dialog, which also kills the mood because some lines like ""sick, masochistic lion"" are nice to read, but when delivered ineptly in the movie it moves one to chuckles because of how goofy it sounds. It was not a complete loss because the baseball scene was fabulous. Set to Muse's ""Super Massive Black Hole,"" the game plays out just as it should even up to the entrance of the antagonistic vampires. If only the care taken with this scene had been applied to then entire movie, this film could have been superior because of all the potential it held. All in all, the average person does not need to spend money on this film. In the end, this movie will make a lot of money because of teen girls who are too blinded by Robert Pattinson to realize the film semi-sucks (pun intended). The money made will definitely be put toward New Moon, which will also make money. Hopefully, the second film will be more professional and worth two hours of my time."
"justash678","4","4","9","21 November 2008"," Opinion of the Movie
","First of all I'd like to say that I am a HUGE movie buff. I'm not much of a reader because I would rather see the movie(in MOST cases, that is). When my younger sister told me about the book Twilight, to me it didn't sound like a book that I would really get into, but she convinced me otherwise. I read, and, of course, fell in LOVE with the books. I was so psyched to hear that the book was being made into a movie, and just like everyone else, couldn't wait for it to come out. When the trailers first came out, I was a little skeptical of how it would turn out, and right away knew that it wasn't going to be like the book. So, I went to the movies last night at the midnight premier with low expectations, hoping that they would be lifted by the end of the movie...BOY was I WRONG! <br/><br/>First off - I did NOT like how they first introduced Billy and Jacob. Was that added scene really necessary? They should have just kept it at how they met in La Push, would have been MUCH better.<br/><br/>As for the school cast - I thought it was OK. I thought Jessica was a great choice. Very self-centered and all about her. Angela wasn't the best. I was hoping for better. Mike..the same thoughts for him as well. He was OK, but could have been better. And what the HELL were they thinking when they cast Eric? Are they for real? <br/><br/>Now on to Edward and Bella. I thought that Kristen Stewart did a better job than expected. As for Robert Pattinson - HORRIBLE! I was expecting him to be better than he was and now my POV of him just went straight into the dumpster. The whole point of Edward and Bella was supposed to be that they were soul mates,but forbidden from each other because they are two totally different species. They're love story just got rushed completely. You never got to experience them falling in love like you should. It is supposed to be a love story, and to me, with all the added lines it felt like a comedy. I was laughing more than I was aweing. Edward, in the book, is so sweet, sensitive, caring, and compassionate.Whenever he is around Bella he just wants to keep her safe and protected. That is not how it was at all.<br/><br/>Some parts of the book were absolutely a must-have for the movie to incorporate. In my opinion, here are the scenes that SHOULD have been in the movie: <br/><br/>1.Edward skipping Biology class the day of the Blood Typing. You get to see more of how much Mike really likes Bella, offering to take her to the nurse. Plus you get to see more of how Edward is protective of Bella, and the rivalry of Mike and Edward. It also gives them their first chance to really be alone when he suggests to take her home. Making both the nurse and the receptionist swoon over him.<br/><br/>2.Edwards favorite place. I understand that they show him ""sparkling"" but he was supposed to take her to HIS favorite place. Not just in some woods right next to the School. How lame was that..? I was so disappointed in that. They did that scene so wrong. His place turns into their place, and when he leaves her in the next book, its where she goes to ""hear"" him. I don't know what they were thinking there.<br/><br/>3.Their history. When Edward first takes Bella over to his house to meet everyone for the first time, Bella is so captivated by all the art on the walls, especially in Carlisle's office. How they became is such a HUGE part of WHO they are. It helps Bella understand, not only Edward better, but his whole family.<br/><br/>4. The restaurant. The whole point was for them to be sat ALONE away from people. For her to try and understand him better. For both of them to get to know each other a little better. The waitress was supposed to be cute and charming, totally ignoring Bella, and being so smitten over Edward. Not some nasty, trashy, punky girl who can hardly act. Plus on the way home, their talk was supposed to give Bella more of an insight of what he really is.<br/><br/>I fully understand that not all movies can be based on the books and they have to make the movie more appealing to a more wide-ranged audience, but they totally got this movie all wrong. It looked like it was just thrown together in a short amount of time. Like it wasn't thought thoroughly through and so it lacked some key points that they should have touched. Like I said, I was laughing more at the movie and the acting more than I should have been. I wanted to be drawn into their love like I was in the book. I should have gotten chills and I wanted SO BADLY to fall in love with Edward like I did in the book. I was even more disappointed than I thought I would be. I really hope that if they decide to make New Moon into a movie, that they take some more time and put some more thought into how they are going to lay things out. I feel so badly for Stephanie Meyer because she created this great forbidden love story only to see it go down the drain, rather than blossom into something even more spectacular that it should be. I can sit here and BEG you to not go see the movie, but if you've read the book, I actually think you should, because it makes you appreciate the book SO MUCH MORE than you appreciated it before."
"Joseph-White","7","3","6","26 November 2019"," Not as bad as people say
","Admittedly Twilight does have several key flaws however I do think the criticism towards this film and the franchise as a whole is somewhat unjust. This film has a relatively decent plot and I enjoyed the portrayal of the majority of the characters, most notably the Cullen family excluding Edward. The baseball scene is probably the stand out for me in terms of enjoyment, I thought they applied the families powers well and it was nice to have a more humorous scene that contrasted the traditional 'intense' vibe Bella and Edward usually convey.<br/><br/>The main flaws with this film in my opinion are actually the two lead characters, the relationship between Edward and Bella seems very forced and unconformable at times; this does however lead to several instances of unintentionally funny dialogue such as 'I like watching you sleep'. The CGI used in this film is also below par, with the most obvious example being in the forest when Edward jumps and runs with Bella on his back.<br/><br/>However saying that I do thoroughly enjoy several characters and the main plot and villain are also moderately successful. Therefore despite some of the flaws (some of which enhance the experience to an extent) I still believe that Twilight deserves a 7/10."

Review
The film is about a teenager named Bella Swan(Kristen Stewart)who falls in love with a mysterious boy named Edward Cullen(Robert Pattinson) who is hiding a secret. It turns out that his a vampire. Yes I am not kidding here he is a vampire. Bella loves him so much she wants to be a vampire like him too near the end of the film.<br/><br/>Bottom line this is a crap film. It sucks big time. The story is crap,the acting is mediocre as they are all so bland. The chemistry between Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson was just painful. They just don't click like other actors do. E.g. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves or Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. As well as this Kirsten is just so bland. People think Emma Watson sucks well at least she has likeability in her unlike Kirsten who NEVER smiles and goes around like a moody teenager.
If you want to see Robert Pattinson in a good film watch Water For Elephants instead.<br/><br/>3/10<br/><br/>Avoid at all costs"

","I haven't read any of the ""Twilight"" books, and to be perfectly honest, I'm probably not going to attempt to do so on my own. Frankly I don't think I'd read any of them unless someone put a gun to my head. I'm really not into teen love stories, let alone teen-Dracula love stories. I'm commenting purely as someone who has only seen this film.<br/><br/>That said, speaking technically, this is a terrible film. Many film adaptations of literature come off stilted, unbalanced, flawed... But ""Twilight"" is a great example of precisely what NOT to do in a film of any sort.<br/><br/>It begins with the lack of character development. None, NONE of the characters actually develop. Bella's back-story is nearly a mystery, and the character has absolutely no personality or ties to anything around her. Edward Cullen had the most character development of anyone, no doubt because he's obviously author/creator Stephenie Meyer's amalgamation of idealized male traits and characteristics. There is no balance between Edward and Bella, with Bella offering the audience virtually nothing to relate to or care about; we simply do not see her engaged in any ""life"" to speak of. She's deader than any/all of the ancillary, interchangeable supporting characters. The other vampires? I scarcely remember their names since they aren't really involved. And the human characters? Equally if not more neglected and downright aborted.<br/><br/>The next major flaw is the story itself. There is none. It's literally about an hour and a half of trite, hopelessly hackneyed adolescent angst and protracted anguish between a codependent girl and a pasty, gaunt narcissist. Hot, right? Well, it could have been; maybe if we'd been offered reasons they were even attracted to each other. Of all things I expected to see, ""Twilight"" leaves completely absent any reasons for them to be together, or even want to be together. We never really know why Edward ""loves"" Bella. He seems to compliment her scent a couple of times, and tells her that he'd love to consume her blood as it would be ""like a drug"" to him. This mentality in itself isn't necessarily so absurd, but what makes it so absurd is that Bella is so unremarkable and ostensibly devoid of ambition or even opinion about the world around her. And the things Bella says to Edward? A considerable amount of dialog and screen time is devoted to Bella praising Edward for his physical acumen as a vampire. Worldviews are never discussed. Edward just blurs around saying vaguely creepy things while Bella praises him, and absolutely nothing happens in the background. There were a few ""bad"" vampires that showed up at some point, but I have no idea what they were doing or why. They're just thrown into the mix during, of all things, a vampire baseball game in a thunderstorm.<br/><br/>Yeah, a vampire baseball game in a thunderstorm. That thing that to have been the worst vampire-sports sequence I've ever seen. Corny doesn't begin to describe it, but it's honestly just about the only inkling of a plot or story outside of the interplay between Edward and Bella.<br/><br/>I decided the film wasn't 100% devoid of value, however. The cinematography really isn't that bad, and the visual impact is actually quite well implemented. CGI is approaching overuse but it's nowhere near as terrible in other recent films. Camera-work is able though the complete lack of a story robs the experience. You know what? Watch it on mute or in a language you don't understand and you'll probably have a much better time. Maybe get the digital version of it and cut/paste a pastiche of out-of-order sequences and give it a soundtrack made of Dream Into Dust, Flatline Skyline, Bauhaus, and/or Joy Division songs just for some really ironic giggles. Otherwise, just get some friends over and do your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000.<br/><br/>Since the film is pretty on mute and made me snicker and guffaw every few minutes, I gave it a solid 3. Unintentional comedy is never worth a mere 1 or 2 stars."

","I have not read the books the film was based on, so basically I was looking for a good picture. Unfortunately that was my mistake.. Maybe the producers think that they can just put a bunch of popular (doesn't mean good) actors and actresses on one set and they already have a hit. Well, in my opinion it takes a little more than that! The screenplay was totally beyond logic, the scenes reminded me of a primitive way of shooting the film and the image of ALL the characters was simply unbearable for an intelligent viewer to look at! It seems like they made a charade of a story which was initially supposed to be quite good (not original, but good) romance. I'm VERY confused why they are making sequel with the same cast. Another disappointment? hopefully not ;) PS Luckily I've heard that books are MUCH better than the film :)"

","If you like vampire movies,as I do,avoid this at all costs.This could have been a great movie but it falls flat on its fangs, of which there are none. I cant fault the two leads,which are both excellent and the only reason that I watched this until the end, and believe me this film goes on and on and on. The special effects are Buffy The Vampire Slayer style,although Buffey is more realistic, and I think the director saved up all the budget for the ""pathetic "",final fight scene with Edward and the so called""super vampire"" James, think Buffy again. the casting was pretty good in the case of the Cullens,which all look very vampirish except when Edward brings Bella home for the first time,the scene reminded me of the Munsters,I was waiting for the canned laughter. all the other characters were so wooden and stereotypical .And if there are any gore hounds eager to watch this forget it, there's more gore in an ingrown toenail than there is in this film. Overall a very awful film that didn't live up to the hype.Watch 40 DAYS of NIGHT, a much superior film."

","I've read all four books. I saw the movie this weekend and was really disappointed. I thought it was supposed to be true to the book. I personally thought the acting was cheesy and the script looked like it was put together in 5 minutes. They could have done so much better. They added scenes in the movie that weren't even in the book, like the tree climbing. If it's going to look fake, don't do it! I know the teenage girls are all in love with Robert Pattinson, but I am just not feeling it. His lines were mumbled and he did not give off the aura of a person who has the wisdom of being around for nearly a century. They made him too brooding. He was much better in Harry Potter. The character casting I liked the most was Jacob. I can't wait to see what they do with him in the second movie. I hope the new director stays closer to the book, because Stephanie Meyer really improved and enhanced her writing with each book. Maybe she will someday continue the series from the point of view of Renesme and Jacob."
"gsnowdon","3","3","6","20 December 2008"," Complete letdown
","A total massacre of the whole story. The movie does not say enough of Bella and Edward's relationship which the first book is all about. Yeah, there are scenes with lovely views but hell some of them closeup of the forest floor and moving gave me a huge headache and not necessary. Below is a list of things right and/or wrong...<br/><br/>The + - the fight scene with James at the ballet studio, really nice except the biting the part.. - the baseball game, that was wicked. - the kiss ... oh la la it is hot! - even if it is not on the book, I loved it when Charlie flick his shotgun when Bella told him Edward wants to have a word.<br/><br/>The maybes - the monkeying around in the forest... it lack the feeling which is really a bummer - the prom night.. where was the magic? why can't they make it almost as hot as the kiss? I would've like the part where Edward told Tyler Bella is no longer available.<br/><br/>The definite NO - two dead? where is the blasted book does it say James's coven is on a killing spree? - Script... who wrote the script? There is no flow with the conversations. It sounds like a lazy student's summary of a hastily read book. Edward might have troubles when around Balla, but he does not have to sound as if he would puke or constipated. He should not be made to hide his accent but only made to talk slowly. - The important conversations on the secret field and on the way home from Port Angeles was distributed over most of the movie. - Bella can cook and is responsible... she is not shown as such in the film. My husband who haven't read the books thought she was very shallow in the movie. - Bella did not buy a book from that bookshop. She searched the internet about Vampires and not about the legends. - Bella left for the ballet studio not from the hotel but from the airport. - It was the ""girls choice"" dance where the boys want to ask Bella not the Prom!<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with the cast, just the directing and script that really put this whole thing down. Catherine Hardwicke should never have directed this one. I am not going to bother to get a DVD for this movie."
"rainbowpoet","1","3","6","27 November 2008"," The Most Atrocious Adaptation of a Great Novel I Ever Could Have Imagined!
","First, let me say that I wanted to give this experience a 0 out of 10, but that wasn't offered! I went to see 'Twilight' after reading the incredible book series all at once because they were so addictive! Those books were magical; they transported me into a world of storytelling platinum! They were so detailed, so character driven, so developed...and yet so easy to read at the same time! They were quite an accomplishment! Then, the movie opened up in my hometown of Anchorage, Alaska, and I went to see it with a group of friends, hoping I would at least enjoy myself! All of my friends had a good time, and actually liked the film! I was the only one in the entire group who saw it for what it really was: lazy, atrociously written, rushed, emotionally vacant drivel! I have literally seen some porn that was more intelligently written and put together than this movie and its script were! I am utterly appalled! The book laid it all out there, neatly, skillfully and carefully. All the screenwriters had to do was translate it to film without botching it all up! All they had to do was follow the story, without ditching key details and without misrepresenting the emotion of every single character! They just couldn't find the skills in their pea-sized brains to pull that off, despite how much they must have been paid! I find that absolutely pathetic! Let's get into some of the key details that were destroyed; they weren't just lost in translation, they were DESTROYED! First of all, Edward Cullen, played without any humanity, emotion, or personality by Robert Pattinson, who should have been a model instead of an actor, was turned into some sort of boyish twit of a vampire instead of the fascinating, brooding, fully-developed, intelligent, and sensible character he was in the books. His romance with Catherine Hardwicke's vapid, mindless, whiny, incessant version of the heroine in the story was entirely laughable! Still, he was incredibly beautiful to look at, so at least they got that part of the book right! Secondly, the members of his family had no discernible identity separate from him at all in the film; they might as well have just been left out entirely! If I hadn't read the book before seeing this trash, I wouldn't even have known who the hell they were! They were faceless and brainless! I couldn't have even forced myself to care one bit if every single one of them had been slaughtered; that's usually not a good sign in a movie! Thirdly, there were so many key emotional buildups that were ignored! There was the development of the love triangle between Mike, Bella (the main heroine), and Edward, which was made into more of a soap opera than a valid, honest, heartfelt interpretation. There was no development there of any kind; they just jumped right through it, as they did with every other buildup in the film. There was absolutely no explanation of Bella's relationship with her dad; his character just faded into the woodwork like so much lost potential in this movie! They turned the scene where Bella and Edward are in the woods together, and Edward is telling her that he is a vampire for the first time and jumping around like a frog, into a hilariously awful massacre of its events! Pattinson, or Edward, spends the scene trying to act with emotion, and instead acting with constipation! Kristen Stewart, or Bella, spends the scene attempting to display shock and awe, and instead showcasing her uncanny ability to stare into space while pretending to pay attention to the man, or vampire, she's supposedly in love with! What a sham! There are just too many negative comments one could make regarding this movie and its performances and its direction, so I'm just going to leave it at that! This goes out to the general public: for the sake of your lives and your time being cherished, do not go to this movie! There is not enough money or treasure in the world that could make this desolate experience worthwhile!"
"lynda060499-1","1","7","20","24 November 2008"," Disappointed Fan
","I was very disappointed with this movie. The lines and acting between Bella and Edward sounded forced and unnatural. There was no connection or chemistry between the two and also any intimate moment (the kiss) between Bella and Edward was ruined by Edward's face twitches. The story would look detached and confusing to someone who has not read the book. They took very important parts of the book such as the meadow scene, when Bella first meets Edward and also when she was in the hospital and made them into a joke that I literally laughed at. I thought that this movie would be based more on the book like the Harry Potter movies since it has a similar following and in every interview the cast states that they stayed true to the book. It just looks like they ran out of time and money and decided to paste something together to make money. Let's hope that the second movie will have a bit more thought, care, truth and better acting to it. *Spoiler* Oh yea and Edward looks like he has body glitter on when in the sun with a cheesy sound effect. Not worth it."

The special effects are some what over the top obvious, but none the less very good. All the characters are excellent at their roles, and everything was great.

"VENUSSIMCOX","3","47","209","22 November 2008"," Twilight not the highlight
","I attended the Premiere of Twilight the movie. The theater was filled,I must say the casting director really did a great job. The cast members visually and physically reflected the characters in book perfectly. The movie played more like a comedy rather than a suspense or romance. The audience roared in laughter (myself included)to certain scenes that weren't necessarily meant to be funny. Such as the exaggerated facial expressions the main characters carried. The facial expressions although were funny were extremely distracting. Furthermore when Doctor Cullen's initially walked on screen everyone gasped, and not because of his dashing good looks but because of the clown makeup that covered his face. (Jasper's as well) The movie dragged in the beginning but then it sped through, one moment Edward hates Bella the next they're dating? If I hadn't read the book I would've been lost and demanded my money back. The cast was great their performance was fantastic but the movie got lost somewhere in the editing process. The movie didn't end with a kiss as the book instead with a long exaggerated focus on Victoria spying on our main characters at prom. Are you serious? How did director Catherine Hardwicke get away with this? Sure it was nice to see the characters with your eyes instead of imagination but other than that the story was lost.<br/><br/>I don't see how this movie will get a great review it was horrible. I enjoyed it because I read it. Those that haven't read the book and then went to see movie I'm sure were disappointed. Sorry but I sure hope Stephanie Meyers keeps the current cast members and request another director for the New Moon movie. Don't get me wrong I know as with any movie that evolved from a book some parts will in fact get lost. This time unfortunately the entire story and the characters were lost, we don't know why they act the way they do. We don't know why Edward is drawn to Bella, how they're bond was strengthened in such a short time etc... The screenwriter in this movie, director and the entire editing department dropped the ball. I'm unsure if this was a deliberate Spoff on the book or just a product of bad directing and editing. Perhaps 30 minutes extra would've helped, or in the end probably nothing could've helped prevent this horrible massacre."
"chucknorrisfacts","1","45","202","28 November 2008"," God awful!
","I hated ""Twilight"". It was ten bucks and two hours of my life I will never get back. I am not a fan of the books, but I do not have any problem with Stephenie Meyer. In a way, I even feel sorry for her, even though she is making a bundle off this dismal movie. <br/><br/>I have a feeling ""Twilight"" will be a ""flash in the pan"". It is immensely popular right now, but I seriously doubt it will sustain its popularity. This is the sad part for Meyer; she's a passing fad. I am sure this horrible movie, and the almost inevitable horrible sequels it will spawn will be the only time Meyer's work finds its way to the silver screen.<br/><br/>Her series will not be remade like Marvel Comics films ""Hulk"" and ""The Punisher"". After this, that's it. She had one shot and now it's gone to Hell. I cannot understand anyone who tries to defend the ""Twilight"" movie. My guess is they must be die-hard fans of the book and can't stand to admit to themselves how bad the movie sucked.<br/><br/>I think the decision to put Catherine Hardwicke in the director's chair was a huge mistake. If the book had detailed Bella's exploits of promiscuous sex and intravenous drug use maybe she would have been more in her element, but it didn't. She makes a complete and total mess of this movie.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson was absolutely horrendous as Edward Cullen. Never before have I ever seen such melodramatic, wooden acting. All I can say is he better have a financial planner, because he'll have to figure out how to stretch his ""Twilight"" paycheck the rest of his life. I foresee the acting roles drying up real quick once the hype dies down for ""Twilight"". He may have played a vampire in this movie, but he would have been better suited to play Frankenstein with the size of that head! Either that or he could be a stand-in for Robin Williams with those super hairy arms he's sporting.<br/><br/>Seriously, how did he get the part? Was he truly the best they could find? I sincerely doubt it. Even the fans admitted he was miscast, initially anyway. It was only after the decision to cast him had already been made that they decided to ""accept"" him. At that point, did they really have any other choice? They were hoping for the best, but they should have expected the worst because that's exactly what they got.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart was equally bad as Bella Swan. She could not even complete a sentence without stammering or scoffing, it was painful to watch how horribly inarticulate she made her character. There was nothing remotely endearing or interesting about Bella, at least the way she portrayed her. I don't know what she was going for here, but whatever it was she failed miserably.<br/><br/>There was nothing spectacular about any of the other performances either. The only actor in the movie who did a halfway decent job was Cam Gigandet. Other than that, this movie was a complete waste of time. I would give it a ""0"" out of 10, but the lowest it will let you rate is a ""1"". <br/><br/>The cinematography is a joke. What is with all the close-ups and spinning shots? It is jarring and it doesn't look attractive. The film is also very choppy and you don't feel like you're watching a movie, but rather a series of vignettes. It is absolutely horrible! It looks like they just threw it together at the last minute or something. Do not waste your time or money on this. It is not even worth the rental. Skip it and save yourself the bother."

Before going to watch it, I figured I had to read the book just to make sure that I was not totally against the mainstream, preteen ideas about the book. And for the most part, the book was only okay at best. Sure some romance and suspense, but seriously, how many billions of times has that been done in books before this? I even remember back in grade school when I read Animorphs and I'm sad to say that was even better. It had suspense, action, drama, and even romance between the characters. Anyhow, the movie falls way short despite all the hype in the media and talk among teenage girls. The acting was less than sub-par, I was laughing for the most part at how terrible Pattinson and Stewart were. Obvious lack of experience in facial expressions and acting in general. Overuse of film techniques like the flickering and super closeups made me angry at the movie within twenty minutes. Also the deviation from the book seemed too much as they missed some small key elements that I felt were needed. I fail to see how this is the ""perfect"" movie of all time.

When you read the book you imagine Bella's life as you will and no one will have the exact same perception as you so disappointment is inevitable. Also, the directors must miss most of the book out because in movies you cannot describe the way books do, you must see for yourself. As well as the fact that if every aspect of the book was covered then the movie would last 10 hours long!<br/><br/>I loved the tension and excitement of the movie and even though the effects of the vampires in daylight was something to work on, i would recommend it, 100%, to anyone!"

","As many others, I have read the Twilight books, and I have enjoyed them. Only a point of irritation, is the constant whining of Bella; she never stops gushing about how beautiful Edward is and how brilliant he is. I think of her as one of my least favorite characters in Twilight. I don't consider myself as a huge fan, but I was looking forward to see the movie nonetheless. Not a huge surprise to many, if I say that the movie was rather horrible. The scenery was breathtaking, especially the locations were beautifully shot. The camera-work, however,was terrible, it gave me a headache, because it always seemed to keep moving. On to the acting; I thought Bella was horrible. Though I find her tolerable in the books, she showed absolutely NO emotion on the screen. Would it kill her to show a little emotion, rather than this cold and distant performance? The same goes for Edward, in the book he is described as ""a voice like velvet, irresistible and impenetrable"", but I found that none of these descriptions fitted his character. And then the relationship; at one point they can't stand being around each other, and suddenly they have are 'in love'! Where is the passion? Where is the slow-progressing relationship, as described in the books? I couldn't find it. As for Bella's friends; I thought Mike was quite cute, but Angela and Eric were totally different than I expected them to be. I won't even start on Jessica, since she was incredibly annoying. Jasper Cullen had a slightly constipated expression on his face during the movie, which made him a bit awkward. To end my charade; the script. It was horrifying, rubbish, crap and whatever name you can think of. It made the actors (though not all of them) even more awkward to watch. I will end this review with a few good points; I really adored Charlie, even if he seemed different from the book. His dry comments were the only ones that made me laugh during the movie. Also, I liked Alice, Carlisle, Esme and Rosalie. Jacob was also tolerable, although I thought he seemed a little out of character.<br/><br/>I understand that the die-hard fans will be gushing over Edward and saying the movie is 'brilliant', but I thought it was a waste of money."

I heard lots of negative things about this (that it didn't match the novel and looked cheap). While it's no masterpiece it's not that bad at all. It has a good score (especially when Bella discovers Edward is a vampire) and has beautiful locations. The sometimes clunky dialogue from the novel has been replaced (or written out completely) and the story moves very quick (the novel is over 500 pages). There's also excellent makeup and special effects used sparingly (which makes them all that more effective). Also the evil James is well played by Cam Gigandet and the final battle is actually pretty frightening. In terms of acting almost everyone is good--especially Pattinson who is just great. On the bad side--the movie seems somewhat muted (for some reason). Stewart is just OK (but she DID turn 18 while the movie was being filmed so that might have affected her acting). Also Burke is terrible as her father and it had a stupid ""it isn't over"" ending which wasn't in the book! Still, this was well-made and done and worth catching. I give it a 7."

","Each generation seems to take liberties with the past in order to modify or enhance something that came into existence or to prominence before even they did. As a result, we've watched baseball digress into a sport riddled with cheating, popcorn move from the stove-top to the microwave and now rap and hip-hop turned into the formulaic garbage coming out of New Orleans in the form of Lil' Boosie and Lil' Wayne. But nothing has stoked my ire more than what has happened to our beloved Dracula during the four decades of my life.<br/><br/>Dracula was a mysterious, dark figure, with brooding eyes and a penchant for seduction. Dracula was, in part, a recluse who understood all too well that he would not be understood. Dracula was refined, debonair, intelligent and manipulative. He channeled his longing for love into a lust for the blood of those who would deny him happiness. And while these aspects of the lore of Dracula and vampires were aptly crafted in movies such as Nosferatu and Brahm Stoker's Dracula, what we have been given today with Twilight is something virtually inexplicable by comparison.<br/><br/>Twilight gives us a vampire that sparkles in the light like a blinged-out Russell Simmons pendant--a vampire who, instead of creating lust for himself through manipulation and clever social engineering, succumbs to basic living instincts of lust, love and adolescent clinginess.<br/><br/>The main character in Twilight, Edward Cullen, is a love struck stalker. Moreover, his ridiculous body language, disjointed dialog and unfaithful incarnations of vampire lore are pathetic at best. He gets almost every aspect of the character wrong, and it isn't all his fault. The bulk of the blame goes to Stephenie Meyer. Her version of a vampire was marketed in Meyer's books toward teen girls. The ease of reading the books underscores the frantic pace at which people devoured each installment. Nonetheless, the formulaic approach toward spring-boarding the paltry story forward serves to undermine the development of what should have been a genuinely interesting vampire character. This one, in Twilight, is just plain bad. Dracula would eat this guy for lunch...literally.<br/><br/>For those of you reading this and rolling your eyes, please take a moment to rent Brahm Stoker's Dracula, and witness what a talented director (Francis Ford Coppola), lead (Gary Oldman) and supporting actor (Keanu Reeves) can do with Mr. Stoker's creation. I can assure you that if you have a discerning eye and a fascination with vampire lore that you will see the differences immediately and will know that in Twilight all that sparkling you got was just rhinestones and not diamonds."
"Jay_Exiomo","5","4","10","30 November 2008"," Vamp angst
","Stephenie Meyer's insanely popular novel ""Twilight"" hits the big screen, dividing moviegoers into a love or hate affair. It certainly finds its way into many fans of the novel, mainly because of the mere sight of its male lead Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Anyone from the outside looking in might find themselves simply watching an angst-ridden movie tailored for the YouTube generation with blunt metaphors on chastity and forbidden love.<br/><br/>Introvert Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) has just transferred from sunny Phoenix to the perpetually raining town of Forks, Washington in the middle of the semester. She does quickly bond with a group of teens, and later on with Edward, a mysterious handsome guy always hanging out with his foster brothers and sisters and wouldn't mingle with the rest of the school population.<br/><br/>It turns out, he's a vampire, although not of the traditional sort: he does not get destroyed by the sun (he just glimmers in the sunshine), he doesn't hate garlic, does not get killed by being staked on a cross, he doesn't sleep in coffins and he casts reflections. But he craves blood, although because his family are ""vegetarians"", they don't drink the blood of humans, only animals'. Still, he finds Bella's scent so attractive that he initially fights off his feelings for her until he realizes he can't and they carry on their relationship, which eventually endangers Bella's life from other ""non-vegetarian"" vampires.<br/><br/>Director Catherine Hardwicke (""thirteen"", ""Lords of Dogtown"", ""The Nativity Story""), working on Meliisa Rosenberg's (""Step Up"") script, actually starts the film promising enough. Hardwicke's proficiency in making realistic interactions from the daily lives of teens is evident early on, and it's the part of the movie that works. Then things go downhill from there. The script gets confusing with too many characters, dialogs become ridiculously corny and the one-note performances of the leads can't fully support the weight of the middle part. The movie is barely - BARELY - saved by the action scenes in the climax but the visual effects are hampered by the film's relatively low budget.<br/><br/>Without its ties to the novel, ""Twilight"" would have been just another one of those low-budget movies (i.e. direct-to-video) that regularly make their way to screens in this part of the world. It certainly feels like it. But it doesn't necessarily mean it's abhorrent; it's just that one has to wonder what the fuss was all about."
"trinityfairy04","7","4","10","23 November 2008"," Good but not amazing
","*May contain spoilers!!* As a Twilight fan I had very high hopes for this movie. That being said, my first mistake was going on a Saturday when all the tweens in Team Edward shirts were out. They literally sighed in unison when ""Edward"" appeared on screen. Anywho, I thought the casting for this movie was actually very accurate as to how I saw them in my head. Except Laurent. I guess I pictured him differently. I did feel the entire courtship between Edward and Bella was a bit rushed and some of my more cherished lines were lost in translation. The scene in the forest where Edward appears to be TRYING to frighten Bella is very out of place. Never in the book do I remember him flaunting how easily he could kill her. That seemed unnecessary. Charlie was AMAZING! I love love loved him!! The relationship between Bella and him was adorable and completely believable. Alice was charming. I loved the baseball scene. Very graceful....Jacob was a letdown, I must say. I guess I pictured him as a little more rough around the edges. He looked like a girl more than he did a boy. Also, the open hostility between him and Edward at the prom was completely absent from the books so I guess they are rushing Jacobs attitude problems to free up time for New Moon. The entire makeup was pretty awful though. A lot like pancake batter on their faces. And the sparkling scene was a huge let down.<br/><br/>But, for all the things I was disappointed in, the movie was actually very good. If you haven't read the books, it makes PERFECT sense. If you have, you notice a lot left out. But of course, a movie is an interpretation of a book and can never be exact. Maybe if it was a 250 page soft back instead of a 600+ page NOVEL. The only unforgivable mistake I feel they made was the sparkle scene. In the novel, he first shows Bella in that gorgeous meadow he leads her to. Not in the mountains ""above cloud cover"" after skipping class. I feel that was a real detriment to the entire movie because later on in the second book, Bella runs into an old enemy because she was searching for this exact clearing to hold on to memories of Edward. I'm wondering how that will play out now in New Moon. All in all, I feel I got my $8 worth. And I have high hopes for the next movie because I am sure writes and directors can learn from critics such as myself and improve."
"madcrazygenius","7","4","10","22 November 2008"," It's pretty good, but you're probably only ever going to rewatch this if you're in love with Robert.
","First off, I liked the Twilight books, but I wasn't in love with them. Face it, a teen romance series involving vampires and werewolves that ends up with a hybrid baby named RENESMEE isn't exactly going to be literary gold. But Stephenie Meyer did a good job appealing to her demographic, and at the very least, it made teens read.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I thought that the books kind of already didn't set the standard for the movie very high. I can't lie, I LOVE the sound of Edward and secretly sometimes fantasize about him lol, but in the end, neither he nor Bella really have any solid personality of their own. The basic core of the series is just that their love is dangerous because he could kill her, not because one of them is amazingly witty or smart or has any particular special quality to them (not counting being a vampire or having a stupid lack of self-interest or safety).<br/><br/>Sorry, I'll get back to the actual movie now haha.<br/><br/>Anyway, so I wasn't expecting the characters themselves to be extraordinary by any means. Bella, when translated on screen, and though I really love Kristen Stewart as an actress, turned out to seem even more crazy and possessive than she did in the books. I liked Robert's performance better, more so because he changed Edward from ridiculously perfect and romantic to a more nervous and almost insecure guy, which I think would better fit a vampire teenager embarking on a relationship for the first time (that might turn off some hardcore fans though). The problem I had with the two of them together in the movie is that because the filmmakers had to cram so much plot in two hours, the development of their love seemed way too rushed and by the end, puzzling how they could have been so in love that they'd freaking die for each other. And especially in comparison to Bella's friends and the other kids in the movie, Rob and Kristen seemed way too overly serious from the beginning - there was never a light, romantic moment between them at all.<br/><br/>I also didn't particularly like the other vampires. Actually, scratch that, I liked how they were acted (especially Carlisle and Esme, and to an extent Emmett and Jasper), but I think Rosalie was the most miscast. I've seen her in other pictures and I think she's really pretty outside of the movie, but she definitely didn't look like the most beautiful woman in the world in the movie like she was supposed to (sorry for sounding so superficial lol). Neither did Alice, though she was so cute and quirky and fit the role perfectly acting-wise. I think it might have been the make-up that did that; the overly pale and obvious powder and scarlet lipstick was possibly one of the worst movie make-up jobs I've seen in a long while lol.<br/><br/>Other than that little bump, I really enjoyed the rest of it. I loved the humor they put in (I specifically remember Bella and her dad in the diner and Mike humping a bush outside the window ROFL haha), which I think strengthened the movie a LOT and helped better draw in their teen audience (who're all probably already sucked in anyway by Rob's gorgeous smile). That whole crowd of Forks kids, as well as Jacob, I thought were much better acted than either Bella or Edward to be honest.<br/><br/>The best thing about it was definitely the cinematography. The shots were gorgeous and very artsy for a teen film like this, and definitely made the movie more credible and solid than it might have been otherwise. Definitely kudos to Catherine Hardwicke and whoever was the director of cinematography for that.<br/><br/>So yeah, this was a pretty good movie to kill two hours in, especially if you're already a Twilight fan. Still, it isn't something I'd pay to rewatch, though I hoped that it would be. It could have been better, but then again, that could be said for pretty much any film lol."
"bunmouse","9","4","10","21 November 2008"," This is not an action story
","I think the biggest mistake these reviewers these days make, is assuming they're seeing something else than what the movie is about. It's frustrating to watch when actually decent films get bad reviews when the reviewer doesn't do any back up checks. I've heard so many people saying ""I thought this was an action film"", and ending up disappointed because it's actually a drama movie with a love story.<br/><br/>I ask of those who write professional reviews, to do their homework before starting their review. Don't assume, don't go watch a film with big expectations IF you haven't bothered to actually look up the history of the film you've viewing."

","I'd like to write this message to tell everyone not to listen to bad reviews about this film. Sure there were a few cheesy, dramatic scenes, but what do you expect? It's a teen romance, not an adult film. For anyone that is a teenage girl or a middle-aged woman that has read the book, you should love the movie. I saw the midnight showing last night, and it was absolutely fantastic. The lighting was perfect, the actors were perfect, and even though the build-up time for Edward and Bella's relationship went too fast, they had to do it. It takes a few hundred pages in the book for their relationship to develop, and they still had other parts of the book, many parts, to put into the movie. They had to make it simple but thorough, and they did a great job of that. Secondly, Stewart looked exactly how I pictured Bella, and she really did do a grade job interpreting Bella, even if her acting got a little weird at some points. Pattinson looked fabulous, and he was mysterious and unknown but perfect."
"CinnamonSpider1613","8","7","22","21 November 2008"," Better than most book-to-movies...
","Saw the advance screening last night, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. As someone who hates book-to-movie adaptations (the HP movies make me want to kill myself), I can actually say I really liked this movie.<br/><br/>Okay, it wasn't perfect, but I wasn't expecting it to be. There were things that left me wanting or thinking ""Hmm, didn't like that so much"". I would have liked to see more of Bella cooking for Charlie, but I did like the awkwardness in their relationship.<br/><br/>Edward was swoon-worthy for most of it, although he struck me as a bit too emo and grumpy (particularly the scene where he's trying to get his class changed. He's supposed to be flirty and charming, but he just came across as whiny). Robert's accent only came out in a few parts, and it wasn't really noticeable, and I thought that as a whole he played Edward really well.<br/><br/>LOVED Kristen's Bella; very believable, not as soppy as she comes across in the books - she was a modern girl, tough and self-assured even in her weaker moments.<br/><br/>The Cullen clan was great; Rosalie was a perfect bitch, Emmett was so hilarious, Alice was adorable, Carlisle and Esme were spot-on - the only one I have a complaint with is Jasper. He seemed TOO uncomfortable around everyone. They all looked fabulous though.<br/><br/>Liked the baddies - I was kinda disappointed that we heard Victoria talk, and that she didn't have the baby voice we hear in Eclipse, but that's a small thing. Cam was EPIC as James - intense, scary, and drop-dead-gorgeous. The only thing I didn't like was how they introduced them, killing the guy on the boat and all that. It was unnecessary, I felt.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved the movie. It was flawed, but not unforgivably, and the actors all gave their roles substance and definition. Will definitely be seeing this again!"
"DICK STEEL","8","5","14","12 December 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Twilight
","Some friends balked at my preference of watching this movie first in place of other releases this week. I have to admit my interest was piqued at how it performed at the box office amongst the recent slew of less than stellar results by novel to film adaptations. Moreover, there was plenty of talk about how difficult a process it was to find the right cast for the lead roles, and the immense popularity of Stephenie Meyer's novels which had a re-imagining of the vampire/werewolf genre, especially amongst the girls?<br/><br/>Make no mistake, at its core Twilight is nothing but a romance through and through, which explains its fanbase. Set in a high school, it's the usual beautiful, aloof and new girl in town falling for literally the coolest dude on campus who's equally stand offish, but for reasons of course. While Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is fair and has her long brown locks in contrast with her skin colour, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) looked as if he has plenty of foundation applied to his face and neck, with a dash of lipstick to add colour to his look. Oh, and his eyes change colours too, how cool is that?<br/><br/>So while the two hit it off on the wrong foot, a dashing and suave saving of the damsel who was like a deer caught in headlights, provided the catalyst for an intense romance that the two will develop. They consummate their passion in wild forests and atop treetops, and I tell you it's likely any girl would likely be charmed off her socks should a guy pull these stunts off. Standing in the way of the romance are the difficulties that Edward has to face continuously, in not succumbing to temptation to sink his teeth and suck her blood. Being together and hanging out means constantly keeping that vampire base instinct in check, while she becomes the unwitting temptress who has to distract his thoughts if his willpower becomes weak.<br/><br/>There were a couple of departures from the usual vampire characters, and in this case, sunlight no longer is the bane of their existence, only that their skin will sparkle ala having a natural sheen of stardust. Purists of the genre will find this hard to swallow, as with their individual abilities, such as the ability to predict the future, and for Edward, the ability to read other people's minds, except for Bella's, which intrigues him and yet provide for a sense of fear, that everyone in general, fear what we don't understand (Carmine Falcone said this in Batman Begins, which is so apt here).<br/><br/>The movie was destined to succeed thanks to the chemistry of the leads and their sheer charisma. Kristen Stewart had a certain spunk and fearlessness in her when having to deal with her romantic emotions with possibly the best hunter on Earth, while at the same time has a tenderness that we always see whenever she's with family - her dad, her long distance calls with mom, and of course, the love of her life. Robert Pattinson brings about some really jealous protective stance to his object of desire, and if looks could kill, he would have floored their common enemy in a ""normal"" (because the Cullens only kill animals) vampire in James (Cam Gigandet), who thrives on the thrill of the hunt, and sets his sights on Edward's Bella. There was some clinically brutal finishing off of enemies in this film which the camera flinched from, if only to decide not to mar the sweet romance underlying the story.<br/><br/>Special effects wise by Industrial Light and Magic was nothing intrusive to have stole the thunder from the story or the acting, and there were some pretty nifty moments which were impressive, and I particularly liked the entire baseball game sequence which had a right mix of effects, and tension built into the story, which marked an increase pace of urgency thereafter. The score Carter Burwell was hauntingly beautiful, as were the carefully chosen songs to make up the soundtrack.<br/><br/>I thought Catherine Hardwicke did a commendable job in making this film, and the word on the street is that she'll be replaced for the sequel which already is green lit. And it's not easy for such sequels to be approved given the lacklustre performance of novel adaptations such as The Dark is Rising, The Golden Compass and Eragon all getting canned after dismal performances in the box office. Unless of course this franchise of only four books want to follow in the footsteps of the successful Harry Potter movie franchise in having different directors at the helm, I feel that Hardwicke should be asked to return.<br/><br/>Twilight took me by surprise, perhaps because I went in with low expectations and not having read the book (though Wikipedia provided some spoiler filled synopsis which I deliberately looked out for), and thus the final result was nothing less than a refreshing take on a different universe of vampires that we're used to seeing on the big screen, as well as the charismatic leads which I felt was the clincher. Perfect as a date movie, and I guess even more so if you're out looking for eye candies. Set up for a sequel (obviously) with some nice placeholders to develop from, you can count me in for another ride when it comes rolling along."

","I went to see this movie with NO intentions of enjoying it. Up until this point I'd only seen the trailers and hadn't read any of the books...I am an avid fan of True Blood - full of sex and blood...True Blood was for adults, and Twilight is for silly teen girls....I went to see the movie out of boredom. I came out of it hooked and ridiculously obsessed. I came home and read the book, and appreciated the movie even more. I was surprised with how closely it followed the book, almost verbatim, with the exception of some very long conversations that might have been good to include but their omission certainly didn't ruin the movie. The chemistry between Edward and Bella in the movie was electrifying, and the awkward conversations between them develop the intensity of the relationship. Pattinson and Stewart were amazing casting choices, and after reading the book I can't think of any other actors who would have been better in any of the movie's roles. There are so many amazing things I can say about it, too many for now. I am going to see it again in a couple days, watching it twice and reading the book may not even be enough. I can't wait for New Moon to be put into production!!"

I hope they make the whole series into movies but in case they don't I have started to read the books! The actors did a very good job, the movie was actually believable for being about vampires!

"sage0159","8","5","14","21 November 2008"," Keep an open mind
","I kept telling myself as I walked into the theater that I needed to keep an open mind. That was a hard thing to do because as you probably know the book series grips you and keeps you hungering for more and you probably have every scene of the book imagined just-so and like most people expect the movie to be like you imagined it would be. <br/><br/>I know its tough to keep an open mind but I found out that if I let myself just sit back and watch the movie I would enjoy it more. <br/><br/>With that aside, I think they could have taken the movie farther. Some of the wire stunts were very fake looking. I took a friend with me who had not read the books and she was frankly bored and lost. The movie does not depict beginning of Bella and Edward's relationship well. It jumps from the first day in biology class to her finding out. Somewhere in the scriptwriting they forgot to add the playful banter that Edward and Bella go through. Yes it's romantic fluff but that's partly what the book is based on. The plot moves slowly in the beginning and then picks up about halfway through (much like the book). I must say the Final scene was fantastic.<br/><br/>To sum it all up: Wire stunts cheesy, first half slow, second half amazing. Oh I almost forgot The BaseBall Scene is AMAZING. The final scene is AMAZING as well and most importantly try not to go into the movie with preconceived notions of how you think every thing should be, because you'll most likely be disappointed. <br/><br/>Anyways I would definitely tell you to check it out if you have read the books, but if you haven't read the books go ahead and see another movie because you'll probably not find it all that interesting ( my friend said that exact thing)<br/><br/>Keep an Open Mind, Lexi"

"robertmaybeth","10","3","7","1 February 2018"," I'm far from the target audience and I really liked this new take on the old Vampire genre.
","I'm not sure why this movie gets so much hate. Sure there are silly parts, and parts even the filmmakers must realize are so absurd as to be silly. But those parts are few and the director pulls you right back into the story with consummate skill. 
I'm certain I can't watch another movie or TV show about zombies - the genre has been done to death in every way possible. But this new (to me) take on the story of an innocent girl who falls in love with a ""good"" vampire (""we only drink animal blood"") is engaging, well paced and beautifully filmed. Never has the pacific northwest looked more lush and inviting then in ""Twilight"" and it's the perfect backdrop for this part-gloomy, part scary (for small children mainly) and intriguing tale. <br/><br/>Bella is a blank slate, an 18 year old high school girl new to the city of Forks, Washington. She makes the acquaintance of a strange boy called Edward Cullin, who appears to strongly dislike her at first. After he saves her life from an out-of-control car (using apparently super-human strength) it only makes Bella more intrigued by the mysterious Edward. Bella soon learns Edward's secret - he's an immortal vampire who can accomplish amazing feats of strength (Edward climbs a tall tree ten times faster then any monkey, and with Bella riding on his back, no less) and run like the wind. But ""Twilight"" throws out the rest of vampire cliche - these vampires have no problem with daylight, and neither do they have fangs...and the Cullens even seem not to feed on people (""animal blood"") although as we find out, not all the vampires in the story are so benevolent. Bella and Edward soon fall in love, and the rest of the Cullen family (also immortal vampires) rally around Bella to protect her from a gang of 3 wandering ""hunter"" vampires who want to put Bella on the menu (""Looks like you brought me a snack!"" one of them even says). <br/><br/>The movie was, to me, refreshingly unpredictable and I found myself caring about the characters - even the rather wooden Bella (Kristen Stewart). After 10 years I finally watched the entire thing rather then the bits and pieces I had seen over the years, and thoroughly enjoyed it. My advice is, ignore the bad reviews, give this a watch and decide for yourself... as for me, I've got a lot of sequels to watch."
"metalraven00","1","3","7","18 March 2015"," Not Worth Watching
","Many reviews will commonly contain a message about how this movie contains ""poor acting."" However, this is not true. The acting put into this movie is phenomenal. On the other hand, the writing is terrible and the story line is boring and dull. I understand people wanting this series of movies to be original, but a vampire that sparkles? Really? Also, it is entirely unorganized. It flips back and forth between a story line that, in my opinion, is not worth watching. Three other movies were also made, entirely boring with an over-dramatic romance that makes you want to shoot your foot. I will not tell anyone not to watch this movie, however, if my choice was to either watch Twilight or not shower for a week, then people would not wish to be around me for a period of time."

You watch they or the movie will be nominated for and Oscar. If I had to compare or rate Harry Potter to Twilight, Twilight would get a 10.

Finally she meets Edward Cullen in the biology lesson. The first meeting is a bit scary but after he saves her life, they become a couple. She thinks his behaviour is strange and mysterious and adds the pieces together: She finds out that Edward is a vampire. When a group of other vampires terrifies the town, Bella gets in danger. Will Edward save her again? We think that the movie is well made. It's a great story for teenage girls, who love mysterious boys and a bit of fantasy action. The characters are strong personalities and fit together well. The music makes every situation more intense, which is good because the actors cannot show their feelings really well.

The warmth from that fire felt so good that day."
"Zokyah","3","3","7","26 July 2012"," Oddly entertaining
","First of all I have to admit that I only read the first two books and that I didn't like them. The writing is poor (it seems Ms Meyer only knows 3 different adjectives to describe Edward), the love story is completely wrong, the two main characters have no substance, and the action is non-existent. And the film was very close to the book in those aspects.<br/><br/>However I enjoyed it very much in another way. The screen writing was so bad I laughed all the time, always at the wrong moments. Just take the first scenes between Bella and Charlie. I know they're supposed to feel awkward around each other, but in my world awkward doesn't mean BORING. And GOD! The first time Bella and Edward speak, during their biology lesson, what a profound and meaningful conversation! After so many one-word sentences, it's logical they fall in love so deeply. If a guy said ""prophase"" while looking at me like I'm a nuisance, I don't think I could resist him. Especially if he is moody and starts stalking me. Such a charmer.<br/><br/>I am a romantic. Hell, no. I am a HUGE romantic. Which is exactly why I couldn't take this film seriously, even for one second. That's probably the worst romance ever written.<br/><br/>In a way it is not entirely the writers' fault, since in the book the dialogues are very similar, but I thought they would come up with some good romantic moments to make up for the lack of story. However there is always something unintentionally funny in those scenes : Kristen Stewart always looking like she has a bad taste in her mouth, Edward going all disco style when he's in the sun, the fact that their longest conversation must be ten-words long, or the fact that he plays on the cheapest piano like it's a freakin Steinway (okay maybe I'm being difficult there).<br/><br/>And Bella. Oh.My.God. To be fair, she's exactly like in the books, but that's not a good thing. She thinks she's miserable even though she has no reason to be, and she thinks she is so special and mature, even though I know lots of girls who wear jeans and don't like shopping. God, I used to be one! The first thing that came to my mind when Edward told her he couldn't read her mind was that it's because she doesn't have a mind to be read.<br/><br/>Well, I could write a book about the reasons why Bella is such a terrible character, but let's focus on the film itself. Kristen Stewart probably meant to show us how tortured Bella really is, but it has absolutely no effect on me. She just looks the same all the time. Not tortured, but...smelling something bad maybe, which is why she would always have to keep her mouth open. She shows no reaction at all when she discovers what Edward really is. And frankly, if you suspect someone to be a vampire, you really think the smart thing is to skip school to talk to them...in the middle of the woods??? And even an unhappy person can smile from time to time. Especially if they're supposed to be a very private person, because they would put on a good face in society. Even Edward-the-tortured-vampire tries smiling from time to time.<br/><br/>I suppose they tried to make the whole aspect of the film artistic and beautiful, unsuccessfully since our attention is more often drawn to the poor makeup and cheesy dialogue than to the aesthetics. In the hospital scene, I could literally see the line between Carlisle's white makeup and his real skin color. I understand that vampire's skin is supposed to be very white, but with HD on most TV(I can't imagine how it was in theaters), I don't see how you can't see the inch-thick layer of foundation on the actors' faces.<br/><br/>As for the action...I mean, this is a vampire movie, right? You're supposed to be scared, and the story is supposed to lead to a big climax in the ballet studio, where there's a huge fighting between the vampires. Well no. I felt absolutely no tension, and I didn't have time to be afraid for Bella, the rescue team was already there. And did they struggle to kill James? No, it was so easy you wonder why they just didn't kill him in Forks where they could all wait for him to come and get Bella.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the VFX. But then they were actually quite good compared to the second film.<br/><br/>For me watching this film was a little bit like watching ""the room"". It was very entertaining because it was so bad, but why do some adults seriously like it, despite its silliness? The friend who lent me her DVD told me simply : ""I like it because when I put it on I can do chores at the same time, like vacuuming or sewing."" ... Okay, that sentence alone sums it up."
"yespat","3","3","7","26 October 2009"," Lame Teen Film But Edward is YUM!!!
","I have 2 problems with this film. First, I never believed the progression of the relationship between Bella and Edward. He seemed freaky and she seemed freaked out. When he told her that he could no longer keep away from her it seemed like it came out of nowhere. I don't know if it was the fault of the actors or the direction or the script but it did not make sense as it did not appear either one of them had any interest in the other.<br/><br/>Secondly, the cast, for the large majority was very poorly chosen. The vampires were all supposed to be breathtakingly beautiful. Jasper looked like he kept his finger in a electric wall socket for the whole movie, never changing expressions and he was not at all even cute, much less beautiful. And the way they had Nikki Reed made up for Rosalie, she was not at all attractive. I've seen Nikki in Thirteen and she was a stunner. I was surprised this was the same person. And the same with Carlisle. Not good. So I had a hard time buying their performances since the first impressions were so stunningly off character. I did not feel any connection with any of them.<br/><br/>2 exceptions to this are Alice and Edward. Alice was cast perfectly. She was the sprite, energetic and happy person described in the book. But the most perfect of all was Edward. I remember having seen Robert Pattinson in #4 Harry Potter film and was not particularly impressed but in this film, WOW, no one could have done a better job. He was the personification of the perfect chiseled stone the author described. And for added fun, I'd recommend you watch the portion of the DVD where the director, Bella and Edward talk over the film, discussing the scenes. It is hilarious hearing how self-deprecating Robert Pattinson is....talking about how much mouse was in his hair....how he could understand how the other kids in the school would be afraid of him because he wore lipstick and so much mouse in his hair and those clothes. He was a stitch! So, watch the film for Robert Pattinson and Alice (Ashley Greene)."
"native_girl333","7","3","7","4 May 2009"," Contemporary Vampire Tale
","Having always enjoyed vampire-movies I was delighted by the fact that Stephanie Mayers book had been made into the silver screen. This version is contemporary with hit music and hot young cast.<br/><br/>I represent the age when ""Interview with a Vampire"" was a hot flick. Now Brad Pitt has been replaced with Robert Pattinson who started his career from Harry Potter -movies. Twilight is in my belief more appealing to the younger audience but older can also enjoy this. If you can see through the teenage buzz ""Twilight"" can be very attractive. I was drawn by the fact that the movie wasn't spoiled with huge amount of special effects that could have ruined whole movie. Also the quality of darker picture is very nice. ""Twilight"" gets its power from the relationship between the two main characters, Bella and Edward. It is refreshing to have an another point of view when making a vampire film. Bella is Edward's temptation but he doesn't want to change her into one of them. Or he wants, very badly, but his feelings for Bella are stronger. The director Catherine Hardwicke indulges too much of the intensity that getting bored is dangerously close. When the audience already knows Edward's secret it makes watching somewhat numbing. Setting the tempo isn't Harwickes merit. On the other hand she has ability to direct some beautiful scenes.<br/><br/>The young cast is in development phase. Kristen Stewart as Bella is the most soulful of the group. Robert Pattinson is a little bit woody but I think he will make it big in the future if he manages to get more diverse parts."
"ruby386","Null","3","7","28 April 2009"," Why do I like Twilight ?
","Actually I didn't see Twilight coming. I haven't heard of or read the books and suddenly there was this huge buzz about Twilight the movie, Robert Pattinson, and I only watched the movie out of curiosity to see if it is all that it was hyped out to be. I really loved the movie, the cast was excellent and the R-Pat and KS made the movie worth watching. <br/><br/>I think the movie did a little bit more justice to Edward and Bella than the book, thanks to the on screen chemistry between Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson. They're such boring characters as far as the story and plot are concerned. The whole plot is drab and set in gloomy weather. After watching Twilight I thought the books will be magical but it was too boring. As boring as the characters are and the plot is, something did pull me in. I read the next two books. The Edward character really gets too boring and I was rooting for Jake the whole time. The entire suspense of it is whether Bella becomes a vampire and who changes her. Once I read the review of the fourth book, I had no interest in reading the book.<br/><br/>I'd watch the movies though, no matter what the plot is, and I really hope they make Bella a little bit more interesting than she is in the books and also in Twilight. I don't like the books mainly because of the way it is written, i just can't relate to it or something, but the cinematography is definitely better. <br/><br/>I still am quite confused why I watched Twilight over and over again, and am eagerly awaiting the next sequel when I really don't like the plot or the main characters."

","This wasn't much better than the book! But at least I feel safe reading about how hot Edward is (when he's not) and I don't feel safe when an uproar of teenage girls SCREAMING erupts in the cinema whenever ""Count Suckula"" comes on the screen! I hated the book, and I hated the movie more. This movie left a hole inside me, a hole which can never be filled. <br/><br/>SPOILER: Obviously, someone is going to notice if someone keeps repeating school and doesn't look like they are getting older. When I was reading the book the words that she kept saying were ""If looks could kill"" and ""Edward didn't turn up the next day"" but watching the movie was ""You bought a snack"" and ""How long have you been 17"" Did the Cullens just disappear every 5 years and come back in the next 100 years!? How long have the Cullens been in Forks? Why does she bring a cactus when she knows that Forks is rainy and it is going to die anyway? As well as that, Forks looks like any place I know. What's so different about the atmosphere? It looks like that here nearly every day, and I'm in Sydney, Australia!<br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie is Linkin Park and Paramore, but that doesn't pay up for how much this sucks! Thank God that Meyer isn't going to write Midnight Sun anymore. Oh well, that's what the fans get for being impatient. I started reading the book before the movie and couldn't STAND IT (so I stopped reading it.) So I was anticipating the movie, something that I couldn't read anymore.

Seriously, you can't compare the movie with the book! OF COURSE it's not the same, no movie is exactly the same as the book, just look at Harry Potter.

","I know nothing of the books so this review is based simply on the film. This movie takes forever to get moving, almost as if we were watching the first part of a mini-series, but I guess that's whats coming. The characters are just dull and the story is so clich√©d, mundane and just plain boring. What did the author do, read Dracula, the Ann Rice books and a few comic books and then write a new series about vampires? There is nothing creative or new here, just the same old story told through different eyes, every time someone tries to re-invent the vampire tale they all give their vamps some new skill or characteristic, here they glow in sunshine, wow.<br/><br/>Why are they going through high school over and over again? Why can't they supposedly get home schooled it case the law asked questions, if I were 100 years old, had incredible knowledge and super powers would I be spending my time in some crappy town in high school? The parents pull the kids out on sunny days? Where would you get away with that? It never just gets sunny all of a sudden in the middle of a school day or a class trip? The baseball scene is just stupid. This was made for 14 yr. old girls so I suppose I'm being a bit picky. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ"

","For my friends it took a month to convince me to watch this movie. For me first it was just another happy ending love story. Well, that's what it is. But still, horror movie? It is written so in description. But I don't see any horror in ""Twilight"". Of course, if you don't count Kristen Stewart's face. No, I don't mean she is ugly or something. She just doesn't feel what her face is doing and that she shows no emotion in it! OK, I have the same problem, but sorry, I'm not in the movies... After watching it like most of the girls I began dreaming to find some totally gorgeous vampire. And I wanted to read the books. I'm one of those who love Harry Potter, so I had feeling that there's something left on the pages that wasn't screened. <br/><br/>And ¬ñ what a surprise! ¬ñ not much things left only for the readers. The movie isn't something you would count as an art, the book also isn't as good as Rowling's, but the script... No, not the story in it is good (that would make movie good, too) but the adaptation is just great! Almost EVERYTHING what was in the book, was in the movie. Not just exactly how it was written, but still. I'm amazed... Steve Klove can learn something from Rosenberg. Last two movies about Harry were a disaster. If you have read the books. <br/><br/>Let's get back to ""Twilight"". Probably most waited movie of the year 2008. Because of the popular book which has an interesting story, but not good writing. A movie with that same story, beautiful, but not great actors. Maybe somebody waited to see Robert Pattison (He's handsome? Well, if you put enough makeup on him...). Still it's just a story for teenagers. ""The top movie"". And others are going be just as, if not more, waited as ""Twilight"". Nothing to be proud you watch or read this, but I'm still going to watch ""New moon"" and other films. To see that Rosenberg is still a great adapter. And... Well, I'm just a girl with dreams."

","Seeing as I am part of the .0005% of the female population that hasn't lost her heart to Edward Cullen, I'll probably be met with a cavalcade of internet flamethrowers and the like. Casting all fears of cyber-terrorism aside, however, it needs to be put out there how much of a travesty this film really is.<br/><br/>I went to see it with one of my best friends, who is a reasonable fan of the book (and by reasonable, I mean she can read it and not go ""ZOMG EDWARD CULLEN IS MY MYSTERIOUS AND NON-EXISTENT SPARKLY VAMPIRE LOVER LOLZ""). Naturally, she had high expectation for it. I, on the other hand, had extremely low expectations, because as any Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, or Eragon fan knows, movie adaptations of books generally fail. Of course, there are exceptions. Twilight was not one of them.<br/><br/>I gave it two stars for a reason. The first start is because you can't have a 0/10. The second star is because I found myself in complete hysterics for 99% of the movie due to its intensely awkward dialogue, abrupt scene changes, and the amount of sheer contradictions throughout the entire movie. For example, Edward approaches Bella, repeat, APPROACHES BELLA, and proceeds to tell her that she needs to stay away from him. Um, what? You can't convey the same message by, I don't know, STAYING AWAY FROM HER? Congratulations, Edward, you've just ruined anything that vampires had going for them. While we're destroying Edward, I want to know what is up with that coif of his. I'm pretty sure that it's the worst style since the rat tail.<br/><br/>To give the film a sliver of credit, the characters are true to the book, except for Bella, who was 900% less whiny and co-dependent than in the book. There; it just got a third star. However, it also stayed true to the book for making the exposition and rising action last for 90% of the movie, then OH CRAP, WE NEED A CLIMAX! I believe an EPIC FAIL is in order here.<br/><br/>What blows my mind is all the hardcore fans that went to see it multiple times. I could think of a hundred other ways to waste my money, but that's just me. You see, there's this invention called THE DVD where you can watch it as many times as you want, at your own leisure, for the small price of $24.99. Good grief, people. Grow some brains.<br/><br/>Sorry about that last little rant."
"JWJanneck","3","3","7","2 February 2009"," Vampire mambo-jumbo for lame-brained teens.
","An ill-considered promise led to my ending up seeing this movie. Having discussed the novel series with the teenage daughters of some friends, I expected it to be gimmicky, vampire-themed teen trash, which it was, but even given that, it isn't very good.<br/><br/>For one thing, it does not really work as horror, since the vampires aren't really particularly frightening, they are simply Marvel heroes with an awkward appetite. Sure, given their strength, you wouldn't want them to get angry with you, but neither would you like to antagonize the Hulk. As a matter of fact, most of the vampires are actually rather nice, some have teeny attitudes, others are brats or plain nasty, others are quite chipper and BFF material (well, not really ""forever"", unless you manage to get bitten by one of them, which---unlike most of their cousins in film and literature---many seem to be rather reluctant to do). They are even pretty good-looking, in a Rococo makeup kinda way, and snappy dressers, too. The interior design of their abode has also come a long way since the count Vlad Teped in Transsylvania, and even though their sleeplessness has led them to do away with beds, their lack of appetite for, shall we say, regular fare luckily did not keep them from installing a kitchen---apparently on the off-chance that they'd befriend a doughy-eyed mortal chick. As a result, we get to see a gaggle of vampires cook dinner for our protagonist in their designer kitchen, and then go out for a round of baseball. The Prince of Darkness has arrived in 90210 and become the Brats of Twilight, and Mr. Stoker is rotating in his grave.<br/><br/>Well, okay, so it's not a horror movie, but maybe it is a romance? Not really. Dull teen chick falls for equally dull teen vampire, and vice versa. He does not want to bite her, cause he and his vampire colleagues are, and I am not making this up, ""vegetarians"", and he explains his plight by talking about how vegetarian food, while filling you up, somehow cannot, obviously, really satisfy. I wonder what they do with this part of the dialog in India... Obviously, living a really, really long time does not mean you learn anything. Besides the laughable premise, the fundamental problem with the romance angle is that, well, there really is no character arc. Both see each other, Cupid strikes, a little bit of high-school back and forth, and then it takes her five minutes of ham-fisted Web searching and a book order to figure out the ""big secret"" (and, remember, she is definitely not a rocket scientist). From then on it's ""Hey, I know you're a vampire, let's get together shall we? Sure, come on over for dinner, meet the rest of the crowd."" Two teens having a crush on each other, only one of them happens to be a vegetarian vampire. No big deal.<br/><br/>If you think that Hammer trivialized the vampire theme, you ain't seen nothing yet, specifically not this movie. Here, the whole vampire thing has nothing dark, nothing about good or evil, hell, God, Satan, sinful immortality, a painful existence in permanent darkness and seclusion, powerful at night and brittle and helpless by day, loss of identity in death---none of that. In fact, it seems positively attractive to be a vampire. Gone the Gothic feel of especially the early Hammer works and some later variations on that topic. The vampire theme is a gimmick, and because the old staples (cross, stake, water, sunlight etc.) weren't good enough for the iPod generation, these iVampires come with a whole new set of gimmicky attributes that no doubt dazzle the kids and have certainly been the focus of many middle-school discussions.<br/><br/>Okay, so no horror, lame romance, maybe it works as a drama? Alas, for that it would have needed better actors in the leading roles. Stewart and Pattinson simply cannot act, their performances are flat, which is not helped by the fact that their parts lack any depth whatsoever. Ironically, this is best documented by Stewart's voice over which is probably intended to add depth to the acting by making explicit thoughts that are not evident from what is happening on screen. In this case, however, the narration reveals that Stewart's character has just about as much depth as the acting led us to suspect, i.e. not much. It also does not help that Pattinson really does not look that part of a heart throb---I guess it must be that vampire-magnetism thing, but it sure isn't his looks (even with a tan), or his elegant charm.<br/><br/>Is there anything good about this movie? Not much. Burke and Clarke deliver decent work in their small roles. The technical work is mostly okay, but some of the special effects in the action sequences are ""Crouching Tiger""-laughable---they may have edited out the wires, but you don't need to see them to know that they are there. No, unless you happen to be a middle-school girl, you must have something better to do with your time. Come to think of it, even middle-school girls should find something better than watching this dull trash."

","Okay, I just HAD to see this one. Yep, it's a ""tween movie"" (cue horrible 14 year-old girls pegging Maltesers at the back of your head while accompanying adolescent boys earnestly attempt to stick the tongue in). I felt odd even entering the cinema, and I'm only one month shy of 20. But I see no reason why I should have to justify seeing a movie, because movies are fun. Plus this one had vampires and enough forbidden teenage romance/angst to make an Emo Kid weep with ecstasy. And I quite enjoyed it! It's about a lonely, probably mildly depressed 16 year old girl (Kristen Stewart, convincing) who moves to a new school and falls for the one guy she shouldn't't--the icily beautiful and irresistible Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Soon she discovers his secret. He's a vampire.<br/><br/>How far vampire flicks have come since the Nosferatu-days. Movie vampires are no longer rat-like things that cause beautiful damsels to faint in distress and get rescued at the last minute by blandly handsome heroes (""Nosferatu""). They no longer look like Bela Lugosi, speak in a monotone and advance creakily to the ladies boudoir. Instead, they are more likely to turn the heroine on and make the female audience fall in love with them. That includes me. There's something sexy about vampires. Yes, this teen movie is clich√©, has moments of terrible dialogue and the acting isn't that great. But I can see why it's so successful among the teenagers of today. And Robert Pattinson can bite me any old time"

","I'm a guy and I saw this movie and have since read the book. I'm not in love with the series but find it relatively compelling. I think it would be better if I had ever been a girl going through high school, but alas I went through it as a guy. I went to the movie because I know fan girls who love this series and wouldn't shut up about it. I don't like to judge these fads as I once liked Pokemon. I saw this movie not knowing anything about the series other than Edward is a vampire and Bella was in love with him. As someone who has not read the book the story was quite interesting. They made a pretty decent plot out of what they had to work with. Like I said I read the book later and was amazed at what they did. In the book, it felt like it was a turn of the page and Bella is in love with Edward where in the movie, I feel the progression felt more natural with less of the angst filled teenage girl feel. The acting is overdone but I feel it was intentional. If you've ever seen Speak with Kristen Stewart, you know she can act. I feel she probably was acting well and they asked her to stop. The camera never stops moving really unless the actors are moving around. I remember one scene where Bella is talking to Charlie in the kitchen and Bella is filling a glass with water and drinking it while her dad is eating his food. What grabbed me about that scene is I can't remember the dialog because they were moving around so much. There is always movement. I feel all of this was also done for their target audience: Angst filled teenage girls. Let's be realistic, that is who the film was intended for. That's who the books were written for. The camera never stops panning and the actors never stop movie because teenagers have ADD. Despite a myriad of flaws, the movie was still entertaining. It's not the next Lord of the Rings or anything but when I left, I didn't feel ripped off. Let's be realistic, most movies suck these days so just having a film that doesn't annoy me is an accomplishment."

","This movie tells a lovely story about a girl falling in love - with a vampire. <br/><br/>When I first heard about the move and all the hype surrounding it I picked up the first book. I wanted to know what to expect. I usually like seeing the movie first (if it is based on a book), but this time I wanted to be able to see some of the differences between the book and the movie adaptation. <br/><br/>I was not aware the movie was a small budget production. At the beginning it did feel like it. As the movie progressed I started to kindda like it. I liked the fact that the movie closely followed the book and that in a way movie makers preserved the essence of ""Twilight"". Yes it is cheesy but likable."

","OK, before I stepped into the cinema, plenty of my mates (mostly girls) were obsessed with the movie, they've either seen it more than once, or bought the book right after seeing it. I've got zero interest in this movie because 1) not into vampires and all the fantasy talk, 2) just not interested in the movies and 3) it seems all commercialised and well, it's just not something that I will spare the bucks for. But seeing how almost everyone seemed to be seduced by the movie, I decided to give it a go, partly because of the peer pressure from my mates.<br/><br/>Damn. I regretted seeing it. It wasted my time and money. It's not because it's a crap movie that should be bashed, but because the movie just doesn't deserve all this hype. The movie was slow... and the dialogue was just so old-fashioned and corny (spoken by an actress with no emotions whatsoever) - dialogues such as ""I'm not scared, I'm just scared of loosing you"" - do teens nowadays still fall for this kind of thing? I don't feel the connection between the two leads, the action was bad, and well, the actors were just not attractive. I know there's a certain degree of subjectivity to concepts like these, but c'mon - it's just a mediocre so called blockbuster.. about two teenagers falling in love and the conflicts they encounter and that's about it. Maybe I'm two months from not being a teenager, therefore I'm too old to fall for these type of genres, but a good movie will always attract me regardless of genre (I'm not into witches and magic but I liked the Harry Potter series). But this one just doesn't have any surprising elements - what's new about a guy carrying a girl on his back and flying her? The whole thing is just corny and old-fashioned and slow.

","I am a big fan of the ""Twilight"" series; couldn't put the book down, became practically addicted to it, etc. I only started reading the saga, however, after this film came out and the craze began because to be completely honest, I had never heard of it before. Soon people started telling me I had to read these books and I am glad they did; they are a real treat, especially for a hopeless romantic like me. A few of my friends told me I just HAD to see the movie, considering I like the book so much, while others told me STAY AWAY, also considering I like the book so much. I have had my fair share of ""book to big screen"" let downs (Da Vinci Code being a huge one in that category) so I didn't get my hopes up too high. Good thing.<br/><br/>When I first heard Robert Pattinson (who will always be Cedric Diggory in my heart) was going to portray the amazingly beautiful, almost god-like Edward Cullen, I cringed. At first, to me, he just didn't fit into that category. I'm happy to be proved wrong and say he was the best thing about this film (along with Billy Burke aka Charlie Swan). I'm starting to realize his appeal and he has come a long way since Harry Potter. He plays the part of the torn, ""I want to love you but I can't or I may eat you"" vampire flawlessly. Too bad I can't say the same about Kristen Stewart. It's not that I don't like her, she just annoys the hell out of me with her lack of emotion and her twitchy delivery of every line. It almost becomes funny around the end in the studio and hospital scenes, the parts she actually tries to show some emotion and fails. Plus, while reading, she just wasn't the Bella Swan I pictured. As for the Cullen family, I felt the parts of Carlisle and Esme were filled perfectly by Elizabeth Reaser and Peter Facinelli, even if he does look ridiculous with powder white makeup caked on. Both were warm and sincere, almost as if the parts were made for the two actors. I personally thought they could have found better actors for Jasper and Alice for two separate reasons; 1. Jackson Rathbone is just not attractive at all and I would say that's a pretty important feature since he is supposed to be ""God-like"" as well. I felt repulsed whenever he came on the screen. 2. Ashley Greene is cute and I could picture her as Alice Cullen, but her acting and delivery of lines is very forced and not natural. She seems to be trying to hard and too focused on her lines before she even says them to look natural.<br/><br/>On to the film itself. The scenery is perfect and the views are breathtaking.. one thing it has going for it. Other than that, not much. I know that films won't be exactly like the books, but this was a huge let down. The film moves way too fast, almost like the script writers were in a huge rush to get it done. Important parts in the book were left out or pointless additions were made, adding to the frustration and making you wonder ""why?"". You never really get to establish the relationship between Bella and Edward like you do in the book and I know that is what killed it for me. It felt fake and forced, not like they were meant for each other like Stephenie Meyer would have wanted.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book, the film will be a waste of $7.50 and make you feel really unsatisfied if you're in the mood for a love story. Sure it has a scene of romance, but that's it, and it will leave a bitter taste in your mouth. If you have read the story, you will find yourself going over the book in your mind and telling yourself you could have made a better movie yourself. Save your money and just re-read the book instead."

","I know this review is a bit late, only went to see the movie last week to avoid the packed theaters of screaming girls. I went in with a pretty low expectations on this movie, as expected from any book adaptation, and from previous reviews. The movie was just bearable.<br/><br/>The Good: Most of the characters were casted accordingly, kudos to most of the actors for the Cullen family, Jacob, Charlie, Forks students, and Renee. All did OK jobs, and fit the parts quite well. Soundtrack was alright too, not the Evenescence-ish music i was expecting. Thankgod. Oh, and baseball scene was pretty cool. Tree climbing was pretty cool...expect the ""spider monkey"" line, C'MON! <br/><br/>The Bad: Kristen Stewart. I don't even know where to begin. Horribly delivered lines, sounded more like stuttering, clamping her lips together, dull, boring, abrupt stopping at the start of every line, Physically, she looked exactly like the Bella I had in mind. But, puhLEASE! Can the girl show just a glimmer of facial expression?!?! No passion! (c'mon the story is about passionate, undying love for all eternity duh), she didn't even look remotely in love with Edward. Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen was very suitable...physically. I'll admit, one of the most gorgeous guys i ever laid eyes on. Acting wise...eh. You can really tell this guy has little to no experience. Facial expressions in half of his scenes (fist bio class, sucking out the venom from Bella's arm, the weird shot of his face after he tackles James from Bella, etc.) absolutely HILARIOUS!!!! ""I don't know how to make furious, disgusted, livid expressions. so i'll just widen my eyes and brood into the camera"". His line delivery was also pretty poor: awkward, choppy, incoherent, as apposed to the book; smooth and flawless. Sorry Rob, as inexplicably hot you are, you need to hone your acting chops.<br/><br/>Last, I need to scrutinize the writing: Worst. Script. Ever. The awful writing contributes to at least 70% of all the movie's bad reviews. I felt bad for the actors who had to deliver the lines from that accursed script. As for the director...nuff said.<br/><br/>News has it that New Moon will have a different director, hopefully he/she will be able to impress us next time. I can only hope."
"QueenJimmy","4","3","7","17 December 2008"," Not all that impressed
","Why so low? Well, firstly, the narration was very very deadpan. Bella wasn't someone who emoted very well. Her acting seemed very awkward. All the acting seemed very awkward. To me, it seemed like the director said, ""Ok. You're playing Bella and you, you're playing Edward. There's some tension. Some vampire creepy secrecy going on. Now, be awkward. That's right. Now, stutter. Pause. Say 'Um' and collect your thoughts a lot. More awkward... no just a little bit more awkward. Now fidget. You can fidget with your jacket, with your jeans, with your bag, with your hair... just fidget, and be sure to do it a lot... awkwardly. Edward... force your chuckles. And when I mean force, I mean that your chuckles are superglue in a container that has been sealed for months and the last person to use this container of superglue was your clumsy little brother who left lint on the nozzle as well as excess glue which dried and you have to squeeze out your chuckles, smiles, and lines from that. DIG OUT THOSE CHUCKLES AND EMOTIONS BOY!"" After that, it seemed odd that Bella was welcomed so WELL into the new school. I can see how people from a small town might be interested in this prized jewel known as the new girl, since I'm from one myself, but you had to be too cool for school to get in with everyone, considering everyone is supposed to be friends or close in a small town... at least mine was. The warm and continuously warm welcome, if not blazing hot welcome, seemed unrealistic to me.<br/><br/>The glistening vampire thing was handled better than I was expecting. People who weren't fans of the book or movie would giggle and laugh and call it ridiculous.<br/><br/>The rest of the vampire lore was interesting in that it was venom and not a disease, like most books or movies use these days. I also really liked the history of the local Native American tribe and the Cullens. It made a lot of sense and was very cool.<br/><br/>However, a lot of the time I was squirming in my seat due to the whole awkward nature of the film. All the dialogue seemed like a huge struggle for the actors to get out. The movements and actions were awkward. I can't use the word ""awkward"" enough, eh? Bella's friends, with exception to the cool Asian guy, made me embarrassed, because I often get embarrassed for characters on screen for some reason. The ""you're a powerful woman"" delivered in such a deadpan voice made me facepalm.<br/><br/>I didn't like that all Bella could say was ""I don't care"" when Edward was revealing what he was. It was repetitive and didn't make it look like Bella had much coherent thought behind anything she was saying.<br/><br/>Things started to pick up at the baseball game, which I enjoyed more than I thought I would. Acting became more believable, no more awkward junk, and certainly a threatening feel to it. Loved the whole fighting vampire scene and Bella's acting was great as she was writhing on the floor. I liked the video editing and transitions when Edward needed to force himself away.<br/><br/>However, I don't feel that I needed to wait an hour and a half for something to happen that I was interested in.<br/><br/>And, to be honest, I was more interested in the werewolves than the vampires... and they didn't even show up. I wish that they had more bits with Alice. She's claimed to be ""odd"" or ""weird"" and I wanted to see if she was a character that I could latch onto, since I really like characters like that... but there were hardly any scenes with her.<br/><br/>Like the title of the thread says, I wasn't all that impressed."

","Good looking teen vampire story, that looks good and is about teen vampires. Clearly I'm the wrong person for this YA teen angst vampire tale because I found it the sort of thing thats been done before I don't know how many times (underworld,Lost Boys...). Not a bad film, its just the sort of thing that is aimed at its one audience and really no one else. Certainly the story feels YA, much like City of Ember, even if they try to make it more adult. Frankly this is a movie for fans of the book only (then again I know many fans of the book who hate the film). Yes the cast is good, but the plot just doesn't cut it.(Your choice out of 10. The rating is dependent upon how you feel about the source material and how many times you've seen similar stories)"

","When you can live forever, what do you live for? is one of the themes of Twilight, Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novel with the cult-like female fan base, the latest of a string of much-awaited pop lit-based flicks to explode on screen.<br/><br/>The first of a series of four, Twilight is told from the point-of-view of high school transferee Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), an ordinary girl from Arizona, who risks everything when she falls for teen vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). The reluctant beau realizes he has bitten off more than he could chew (pardon the pun) with his choice of girlfriend, when he has to forever fend off every mortal and monster out to get her.<br/><br/>A modernized myth ensconced in a forbidden love story, director Catherine Hardwicke had a similarly against-all-odds task of pleasing audiences, most of which are hard-core fans of the book. Since much of Twilight's power is said to come from Bella's thoughts, this can of course only be visually executed in a limited fashion. The protagonists' feelings are also very reliant on the intense looks and expressions exchanged multiple times, and the actors successfully transmit their frustrations to the audience, despite the widely-held opinion of getting a cast that fit better. Can't please them all! And so, equally moody music like Debussy's Claire de Lune and other more modern angst-ridden faves ""15 Step"" by Radiohead and ""Supermassive Black Hole"" by Muse is interspersed throughout to sustain the teen drama, but could not distract the audience enough to feel the full (over two hours) length of this movie. Not only was it overlong, it was painfully cheesy at several points, but for female teens to fawn over Twilight would be understandable."
"Mehdi_1985","4","3","7","4 December 2008"," Honest review : Twilight
","First of all let me say this, I have read the book, only the first one. I just had to read it, to see what the buzz was all about, why was everyone (female mostly) crazy about it? after reading it I could see why the story was so appealing to most of females. It's quite the love story and I was surprised that I liked it. So like most of the fans of the series I was really looking forward to see the movie. So here it goes: Movie was a real disappointment. First of all, the whole thing looked like a TV special so don't go expecting to see some stylish adaptation. Movie got no style at all and the blame goes to director Catherine Hardwicke, who also directed Thirteen (2003) which was quite good actually. She just couldn't translate the magic of the book into a movie. Most of the small parts were unfortunately miscast like Charlie, Jacob, Jasper and Rosalie. Kristen and Robert did a good job as Bella and Edward, but I have to say that there were couple of scene where they both were laughably bad, I mean the 90% of the people who were watching, couldn't just stop laughing at how horrible some scene was acted and directed. Cinematography by Elliot Davis and Music by Carter Burwell could have been a lot better. There is nothing original about the music and nothing extraordinary about the cinematography. Special effect looking very cheap, ""made for TV"" written all over it. I know how this sound, but believe there is almost nothing good about this movie.<br/><br/>But I could have lived with all of what I just said except one thing. This movie should have been a Rated R movie or at least a good PG-13, except two scene this movie could have received a PG rating. I understand why they didn't go for R rating, but why not make a real PG-13 like The Dark Knight, why not go all the way. I mean The Dark Knight got away with it, movie looked like a R rating movie. All and all a real disappointment and since the whole crew are returning for the New Moon I don't anything going to change for the second movie."
"kittyfelone","5","3","7","2 December 2008"," 50/50 - I was slightly disappointed
","Call me unusual but I didn't find the ""Twilight"" movie to be all that it was set up to be. I read the series once and read Twilight and Midnight Sun twice, so I knew what to expect. Minus the few changes that every book-to-movie should have, the film actually left me a little... disappointed.<br/><br/>1) Kristen Stewart's acting was so lame and boring it was like she had no emotion whatsoever. I saw her in ""Panic Room"" and a little bit in ""Zathura"" and she was pretty good. Upon researching her filmography I discovered she played in many horrors and thrillers; I think she belongs in a thriller and should stay away from other types. Throughout the whole film, I was left wondering if she would always be so dull or if she would get some emotion going on. At the fight, it got better. She does good in these situations but not the situations of boring dull life--not like ""Sex in the City"" type life. And I'm sorry Twilight fanatics but half the time she was talking, it sounded like it was forced--what happened to the acting? ""I'm only afraid of losing you.""--good line but her lips didn't move so it looks like she forced the words from her mouth. Why?<br/><br/>2) I never realized until I saw the film just how slow and boring the plot line really is. I mean, when you read the book you can see more than pictures can show because it's explained better. You see the average life of a teenager, the life we see in teenage movies that are generally realistically based (not these stupid shows that look like sleazy girls are walking the halls wearing clothes you KNOW the school system wouldn't allow.) But in the film... dang, I never thought about how slow the storyline was. As I said, in the book, from Bella's point of view, everything seems to be active so you wouldn't think on how slow the whole thing really is.<br/><br/>3) Was it just me or was the sound on the microphone turned up too high? Why did we hear the rustling of the comforter when she pushed it away? Why did we hear things that aren't supposed to be enhanced? Somebody told me that it was because they want you to hear it the way the vampires hear it, being enhanced and such. This film is through Bella's perspective, which means it should be normal.<br/><br/>4) Besides the sound, I have to say the camera angles weren't spectacular. I've seen films like ""Collateral"" where the action is realistic and the whole thing looks like its happening right in front of you (minus the holographic interpretation of our future) and ""Twilight"" didn't even fit that. I have seen foreign films and independently made films, films from producers just starting out which is also called Backyard Movies (they're now called B-rated Movies), and this didn't even fit those descriptions. It didn't compare against the films like ""Harry Potter"" or ""James Bond"", instead it looked more like a B-rated film, like it was made from somebody just starting out. I'm not saying it was a low budget film. I'm just saying it wasn't as intensely made as the others. I mean, compare ""Twilight"" to ""Dracula 2000""--both films you can tell had used strings for the action scenes but in ""Dracula 2000"" the movie was more intense (and I'm not talking about the plot either).<br/><br/>5) Now I liked the music for the movie, don't get me wrong, and in some scenes where they played the songs it fit perfectly... but why did they play them all the time? Movies such as ""Tomb Raider"" have what is called 'Score Sheets', which means its the listing of songs played throughout the film (not saying they don't play the songs from the soundtracks). For example... in ""Tomb Raider"", when Lara travels into Cambodia, there is instrumental music playing--same thing when she works out her mansion. Now when she fights Simon the robot in her mansion, they play music from the soundtrack, or when the postal guy arrives to deliver a message while the house is being cleaned from a previous attack. What I'm saying here is the songs from the soundtrack were not repeated constantly but rather, used as a variety. In ""Twilight"", the tracks were repeated so much it became boring. Now yes, the piano music was a nice touch to some of the scenes in the woods and the soundtrack song of ""Supermassive Black Hole"" while they played baseball was fitting, but to repeat different sections of the song in different sections of the movie is overusing it.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying I could do better and I'm definitely not saying the movie was a complete waste of time. I enjoyed myself and a lot of the small humor scenes but besides the obvious, I think it could have been MUCH better. The tremendous fan-base from the books was the only thing that made this movie hit so hard. After all, when the soundtrack came out it smashed the billboards. All that I am simply saying is that from a frequent movie watcher's point of view (and an author's point of view), the film wasn't all that it was cut out for.<br/><br/>Sorry again but this is all in my opinion."
"blacklikerain","5","3","7","30 November 2008"," A bit left to be desired.
","**May Contain Spoilers** OK, OK, OK ¬Ö¬Ö. I am a die hard Twilight fan. Here is my take on the first film adaptation. Like everyone I was waiting anxiously for the movie. So there is your set-up, I was excited. A lot of people are bashing Robert Pattinson's acting as Edward, either he sucks as an actor, or he is not good looking enough. Come on people, the description of Edward is one where he is described as having the most beautiful, unearthly looks.. EVER. Well I have never in my life caught a glimpse of anyone with that description. Edward Cullen is brooding, dramatic, misunderstood, and a little creepy. ENTER Rob Pattinson he encompass' Edward's character to a T. He doesn't say much, he gives (mostly) proper looks, and he is creepy. I don't understand how people didn't think he was a good Edward. He fit right into role like he was made for it. Reading a small portion of Midnight Sun I really understand why Edward is the way he is.<br/><br/>I don't feel however that Bella's Character was captured. I am not sure if it was Kristen Stewart, or the script. I am leaning towards the script though. Bella is a very emotional like-able character and I didn't feel like I connected to her movie portrayal. She seemed dull and boring, like an emotionless, expressionless log. I just couldn't feel her as Bella.<br/><br/>One thing that really bugs me about the film is I don't know why Bella and Edward fell in love. It's so disjointed feeling. It almost reminded me of 2 teenagers going ""Hey want to be boyfriend and girlfriend?"" We were thrown into their romance with no real reason why.<br/><br/>Edward gives up way too much information about himself with no justification. ""Hey I'm a vampire, yeah I can read minds. Here have an apple."" Okay I realize they have a 2 hour time frame to squeeze the key scenes in there, but there are so many small things they could have done to make it seem like Edward didn't want to give up his secret. So Edward is a vampire and very keen to protect a girl you don't know why they are in love¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö..That's how it felt. It was slow in the moments it should have been fast, and too fast in the moments it should have been slow.<br/><br/>The problem with films based on books are the expectations, we fans want everything to be at least close to the books, and sometimes Twilight (the film) felt very separate from the emotional vibe the books had.<br/><br/>I liked the movie for what it was. Not passing judgment, I was able to overlook some of the more annoying things about the movie AFTER I was able to sit down and think about it. I would say read the books before you see it, and if you've read the books take it for what it is. An okay adaptation of the book. It's not horrible, it's not amazing¬Ö. It's just."
"mcmechann","5","3","7","30 November 2008"," Not good compared to the book.
","The Twilight movie was more than disappointing! The characters did not look how you would have imagined them when reading the story. The storyline was condensed and made some of more serious scenes seem funny. Also it contains some of the worst acting I have seen in a long time. It does not do justice to the book. This could easily be one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie I have ever seen. If you don't compare it to the book I guess it could have been entertaining. I am disappointed that I paid money for this movie. However some of my friends who did not read the book liked the movie so I guess just take your chances."

I like the Harry Potter books and find that most of the movies aren't what I would call amazing, so I can't agree with you there. You said that the dialog was cheesy. Yes,there is definitely some cheesy dialog out there, but sometimes the words that come into your head when you love somebody are simply that--cheesy. You can't always help it. And if cheesy means from the heart and sincere, then I think it's okay to be cheesy. We aren't all Shakespearean poets. I think that makes it all the more sweet. You also mentioned Bella's lack of emotion. I don't agree with you there. Not everybody displays their emotion on their sleeves. Some people are really withdrawn and closed. But that doesn't mean they aren't feeling emotion. I think you should read the book and then look back at what the characters are trying to portray. Perfect? Of course not. Low budget? Sure.

"Irisheyes0717","5","3","7","28 November 2008"," Good supplement to the novel; doesn't stand on its own as a film.
","I'd like to preface this review by saying that, being an avid fan of the series, I really enjoyed this movie. That being said, I have to admit that this is a very bad film. Sound contradictory? Let me explain.<br/><br/>Much of this movie will be inaccessible to people who have not read the series. Many of the facial expressions, much of the dialogue, and some of the plot makes sense only when supplemented by Stephenie Meyer's text. The director leaves out (perhaps necessarily due to time constraints) much of Bella's inner monologue, and many important confrontations between Bella and Edward. Those who have read the novels understand that the two main characters are fated to be together, but those members of the audience who lack the context of the books will perhaps find the amorous relationship between Bella and Edward underdeveloped and unsatisfying. When Edward tells Bella ""you are my life now,"" fans of the book will sigh with contentment while newcomers to the Swan/Cullen dynamic will feel uncomfortable with the rapid progression of their story.<br/><br/>Of course, as my audience at the midnight screening on opening night proved, fans of the series will not be disappointed by this film. Sure, there are a few times when unforgivable CGI work (Edward in the sun) or poor dialogue (""remember who you are,"" which sounded more like Mufasa than Carlisle) threaten to undermine the fantasy love-story that is ""Twilight."" But admirable acting from the cast (particularly Pattinson, Stewart, Burke, and Facinelli), fantastic cinematography, and a competent score save this film from becoming a teen story more comparable to ""High School Musical"" than ""Romeo and Juliet."" This is, after all, a love story, scripted though it is in a world inhabited by vampires, and fans of the series will be thrilled, as I was, to see that story come to life on the screen.<br/><br/>Yet, herein lies the problem with the film, and also the explanation of my inability to rate it above a 5: films are not novels. Films should be able to stand on their own, and reading the source text should not be necessary, even in an adaptation. This movie, as much as I liked it, is little more than a supplement to the novels, and does not work on its own as a film. In my opinion, this is why it is getting such consistently poor reviews, which are, while unfortunate, most likely accurate.<br/><br/>The good news (and yes, there is good news!) is that the fan base for this series is so devoted and so forgiving, that the actors (at least, at the time of this review, the director had not yet been announced) have been given a second shot to make a truly good film, since ""New Moon"" has been scheduled for production. ""New Moon"" is far and away my favorite book of the series, not because I love Jacob or enjoy seeing Bella get her heart ripped out, but because true love can only exist in a world that also holds the possibility of pain, and nowhere do I see this paradox articulated more clearly than in ""New Moon."" I do hope that those involved with the production of the next film will learn from their mistakes and produce a richer, more beautiful film than we were given in ""Twilight."" I hope for this, not because I'm disappointed with the effort put forth here (remember, I honestly liked this film!), but because by creating a film that stands on its own, people who are not big readers, or who don't have access to the series, will be able to see, on screen, what amounts to a very touching story of innocence, sacrifice, and love."

","I am undecided as to whether or not I enjoyed this movie. First of all, I read all of the books within about 3 days, and I didn't read them faster because school interfered with reading time. Stephenie Meyer is a genius. I went to the movie on opening night, prepared to be let down, which I was. They not only cut some of the books necessary scenes, but they added their own. Even the book's humorous scenes became extremely melodramatic. But aside from that, the acting, camera-work, writing, and costumes were all laughably bad. Kristen Stewart (Bella) seemed like she wanted to eat Edward's head half of the time, and she always looked extremely angry. Her lines were either delivered without emotion or were over-acted. Her aside, the more minor characters (Edward included) did much better jobs. The camera was constantly shaking. Did the crew suffer spasms? The lines were ridiculous. ""Hold on spider monkey""? What is that?? Lastly, all of the characters, save the vampires, were wearing horrendous clothing. For example, Bella's prom dress (which was gorgeous) was worn with a knit sweater covered in plastic flowers. My least favorite part was when Bella is bitten by James. She starts writhing on the floor (disturbing noises being made) which can only be described as sounding like giving birth to an especially huge baby. The only reason I give this a five is because of how hard I laughed, even though I wasn't supposed to."

Epic Robert Pattinson.<br/><br/>2. The Debussey/Edwards Room Scene - the little dance and flirty lines illustrated Bella and Edwards fun chemistry which was pretty rare in the movie. I wanted more dialogue and interaction with them other than just a score blasting through the speakers and looking at them talk about something I cannot hear or enjoy.<br/><br/>3. Bella's Lullaby. If you read the back story of the lullaby by Carter Burwell, it not only illustrates true love but makes the song much more special.<br/><br/>The BAD <br/><br/>1. Awful Awful Awful dialogue. The lines were forced and sounded unnatural....Why would he call her a spider monkey? Why was he climbing on trees? Why did he explode at her and acted weird when she confronted him about being vampire? Why does Bella sound so dumb and cheesy? Why were the Cullens so awkward? Too many questions for a teen focused flick...<br/><br/>2. What happened to the meadow scene? It is the most important scene in the book yet was ended in a staring contest in a patch of grass. Why did he just explode at her randomly in the forest (and why were they in the forest in the first place)? Overall, there needed to be better transitions.<br/><br/>The UGLY <br/><br/>1. The Dazzling moment was not dazzling at all. ""I am gonna show you what I look like in the sunlight"" line was random, forced, and not hot.<br/><br/>2.

"tillsband","5","3","7","27 November 2008"," If you're cynical, your expectations with be spot on
","My girlfriend desperately wanted to see this, and although both the book and the film aren't really my taste I went in with an open mind.<br/><br/>I like most kinds of vampire movies (I enjoy Fright Night as much as Shadow of the Vampire). This was barely one. Meyer could have called the Cullens anything she wanted, really, and it wouldn't have mattered.<br/><br/>The smaller, more intimate scenes (with the exception of the ""Let's stay up and talk all night!"" scene) were what kept me interested. The bits with Bella's goofy friends, her father, the paraplegic werewolf were all well acted and well written. The characters themselves were adorable. The problem with the film (and I wouldn't know if it's the case with the book) is that the stripped down vampire thing is too damn dry.<br/><br/>It's always nice to take an old concept and turn it on its head...as long as it's interesting. The Cullens's immediate acceptance of Bella was harder to get over than Edward's reluctant courtship. The blood thirst fades that easily? After years of abstinence? Pretty easy to deflect considering it's their ""own brand of heroin"". The action scenes were horrible with bad choreography and silly special effects but the plot wasn't resting on a climactic battle, so they get a pass. The villains were lame as well, with their bare chests and low-rise jeans. Still, save for the very forced ""final showdown,"" the plot did not hinge on their involvement--it's negligible.<br/><br/>Again, I can't speak for the book. But in trying to rise against vampire clich√©s, if the film is any indication, Stephanie Meyer drove the story into a terrible realm of even worse clich√©s. Clich√©s of monsters in designer clothing and the romantic dreams of every teenage girl. Perhaps it was Catherine Hardwicke's doing in translating the words to screen. The characters (even the peripheral ones) are all very likable, but the story feels lacking. It's not enough to carry the film but the romance works, and I quite enjoyed the chemistry between Edward and Bella.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of the book (tween, middle-aged, pre-pubescent, it doesn't matter if you're a fan) don't expect this film to break new ground. If you've liked the Underworld series or any of the recent sexified horror films you might enjoy this."

I know people say ""You shouldn't compare the book with the movie"" but you can't really avoid it, you put so much effort in reading the books, the characters means something to you. When a director makes the movie out of the book, they are putting what they saw, and their opinion into the movie. I honestly didn't really like the directors way of interpreting Twilight. I will be completely honest and separate the book from the movie and say, if i watched this movie without reading the book, i would think it was an so-so movie, I wouldn't be as crazy to see it if I didn't read the books. I really really hope they put more effort into the second movie New Moon."

","I recently became a fan of the Twilight series and a fan of Stephanie Meyers books. What I loved about the books was how the characters were beautifully developed and how they were intricate to the stories. For those who have never read the books or are familiar with the story, Twilight tells the story of Isabella ""Bella"" Swann, a seventeen year old girl who moves from the sunny state of Arizona to the drearily depressing small town in Washington to live with her police sheriff father. Bella is the new girl in the small high school and attracts attention. She is awkward, shy, and lonely but she manages to make ""friends"" and gets along with her classmates and attracts some of the boys. Enter the Cullen family. They are pale, they keep to themselves, they are wealthy, and beautiful beyond words.<br/><br/>Bella becomes drawn to the Cullens. Specifically, she is drawn towards the ""youngest"" son Edward. He is handsome, brilliant, strange, but socially withdrawn. In addition, like his ""family"" he is also pale and never appears under direct sunlight.<br/><br/>Bella later discovers the family secret and his hidden talent: Edward and his family are vampires who have lived for centuries by feeding off the blood of animals and controlling their thirst for human blood. In addition, Edward has the gift of telepathy however he can't read Bella's thoughts.<br/><br/>Bella and Edward start off bitterly and distant, but become attracted to each other and fall in love.<br/><br/>Everything is alright until a group of nomadic killer vampires enter town threatening the humans and soon Bella's own life.<br/><br/>The books are amazing. I would also like to point out that I am twenty seven years old and have read my share of teen novels in the past. But Twilight is one level above the typical teenage novels filled with melodrama and angst. Twilight allows readers to connect with the characters and their lives. The Cullens I found to be a very fascinating family of characters because of their loyalty to each other and that they are not this cult. The characters are more developed. In addition, Bella Swan is the girl that many young women such as myself identify with.<br/><br/>The casting of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in the leads was well done. Both actors brought these two characters from the series to life despite of the material that was provided to them. The rest of the cast was also decent and nicely done, but the adaptation of the novel to screen by Melissa Rosenberg was a complete and total shame. For one of the writers and producers of a masterfully successful show ""Dexter"" it is a disappointment but when it comes to romance she went back to ""Step It Up"" a film of many clich√©s. Melissa Rosenberg and Catherine Hardwicke had many opportunities from the novel to avoid the clich√©s of cheesy teen romance films, but they missed and caved into the studio pressures of making this film as far away from the books style.<br/><br/>The film was rushed, boringly clich√©, and heartbreakingly disappointing.<br/><br/>The cast led by Pattinson and Stewart did their jobs by bringing these characters to life, but the director Catherine Hardwicke and writer Melissa Rosenberg failed to theirs by giving Twilight series and its characters there full purpose.<br/><br/>I cringe at the idea of them teaming up again to make any more."

","To be honest, no i haven't read the books, and yes, this film probably doesn't live up to the book, but movies & books are completely different. People imagine characters in whatever way they like when reading books, and that's the beauty of it. Movies are different, your given what you see - like it or loathe it.<br/><br/>Personally, i really enjoyed this movie. It did feel as though the director was trying a little too hard to put an artistic swing on it, but i thought the movie worked out well. I loved the way the vampires were not all 'fangs & hissing'. Pale faces and strangely enticing eyes is more then enough to make a realistic vampire, It's the acting that needs to be spot on. Robert Pattinson is brilliant, never did i doubt his love for Bella or the fact that any second he could snap. Kristen Stewart also gave an exceptional performance, and i think the actors worked really well together.<br/><br/>The love story was beautiful, and some of the shots were gorgeous. People forget that it is just a fantasy, and not real, but what i thought the director did well was make it seem quite life like. The evil vampires were good, but the long haired male was the only one that stood out for me. I don't think the others seemed that scary.<br/><br/>Overall, i think it is a beautiful watch. IF anything, this movie will make you envy Bella & Edwards love and certainly makes the 'pale' look cool again. I probably will read the book, but i think its unfair to cast this movie as 'crap' just because it takes a different spin on things compared to the novel."

","First of all let me say that I am not going to include any spoilers here... but, I want to thank Catherine Haedwicke, Melissa Rosenberg, and Stephanie Meyer for sticking as close to the book as they could on the low budget that they had to work with. (Maybe more movies would fare better this way... hmmm) <br/><br/>This movie garners a 5 feathers up from this bird on a scale from 1 - 5. If you've read the books then I am sure that you know what to expect. This is a teen-angst filled love story between human and vampire. The story is all about what those teens are thinking, what they are feeling and how they deal with it. It is NOT an action packed, blood and gore type story... so if that is what you are expecting when you go to the movie, then you will be deeply disappointed.<br/><br/>I have read some of the reviews over and I can see that some just didn't get the plot line and most forgot that this story was aimed at tweens and teens, not the older adult mind.<br/><br/>The teen mind is all about angst (well, mostly anyway) and their raging hormones. Some are capable of deep thought, but most are not analytical or practicality minded. It is romance, dreams and white picket fences over the realistic versions of life. They haven't quite lost the ability to believe in things that an older adult knows, or should know, that they don't always happen.<br/><br/>Fantasy stories are for the mind that can believe in possibilities and Twilight is full of fantasy and possibilities. Maybe this is where some reviewers just didn't get it. Possibilities. Fantasy. Both are and can be mind blowers. The endless possibilities of the inner depths of the writer's mind. Fantasies, where anything can happen and it usually does. I live and breathe this world because I, for one, have not lost that hope; that romantic ideal and they both live happily in co-existence with my inner adult practicality.<br/><br/>Open your mind before you go see the movie. Bring back your hopes and ideals when you sit down to watch and you will be happy you did. This movie is not about conversations but with the silent look that used to make you melt. It is about the touch that made your knees weak and the kiss that took your breath away and made butterflies take wing in the pit of your stomach. I can still remember those days... and I truly wish that they still existed. Maybe in the next life, eh?"

The second time I saw it I was able to relax and see! Robert's Edward was perfect, he was tortured, uncomfortable, stiff, and as he falls for Bella He loosens up, You can actually watch his Body soften to her.(Great actor, it takes a great one to portray corny love into angst, tortured got to have it love) In the books Edward is always so melodramatic and Rob hit the nail on the head. Some elements of the movie were cheesy, but if we are being Honest the books are pretty corny at times too. It was low-budget so I had no expectations on effects, but some how, they weren't bad, they could have been way worse.<br/><br/>The adaptation was on point, I loved the additions and I loved how the feel of the movie Turns after the Port Angeles Seen. <br/><br/>Every cast member was on point as well. If anything Bella's Human friends may have stole the stage a bit!<br/><br/>Bella was every bit as the Bella we Love, Obsessed, torture funny and anxious as well. The hospital scene in the end was powerful.<br/><br/>Over all it is what it is, no it will never be perfect but it's pretty darn close. My FAVORITE part of this movie is the cinematography, it's so intimate and beautiful. No one could have done it better."
"Zackster02","9","4","11","21 November 2008"," Just about what I expected...
","Well, as we all know, a movie is never as good as the book it's based on (At least, I personally, nor have those I know, found anything to defy this rule). So, we all must have expected that the movie would have done something to make the series seem worse than it was; this was especially true to people who haven't read the books.<br/><br/>As far as the movie itself goes, you can't complain too much. It may not have stuck to the form of the books, it may not have had great special effects, and maybe not all of the characters were true-to-form. However, one thing that no one can deny was that the movie wasn't a complete disappointment, and unless you're one of those fanatics who can't realize that it couldn't be everything that books was, you have to admit that it was at least slightly fulfilling.<br/><br/>The cast of the movie was suburb, for the most part. The music flowed with the movie. The basic plot of the stories had been covered, and the passion that some of the actors (Robert, especially) was there. Some other characters, such as Carlisle, were everything and more than we could have expected them to be, there was the elements of humor and romance, and no one could have walked away completely unsatisfied."
"sherryfundin-14147","10","2","4","15 January 2020"," The total package....
","This review is for the entire saga.<br/><br/>From first glance, I fell in love with Twilight.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart's eyes are so expressive, it was like she was mesmerized, in a trance, and lost to Edward...forever. I am amazed at the quality of her acting though, at times, I thought the dialogue was laughable. In the beginning she does come across as a whiny, selfish brat, but because I know the ending, the whole triangle thing was explained in a mind blowing way. Her lip sucking and soft snorting could be annoying, but, like anything I fall in love with, I am easily able to get past it. For her age, she comes across as brave, intuitive, and able to handle whatever comes her way, never wavering.<br/><br/>The music is amazing and emotional.I laughed and I cried. I would get lost in it and it invoked so many emotions I would be overcome with...a warmth that is all encompassing, a sit up and pay attention moment when the danger rises to a fever pitch, or a clash between Edward and Jake is on the horizon. Like Calgon, I just wanted to close my eyes and let it take me away...deeper into the fantasy.<br/><br/>They did an amazing job with the special effects. The more I watch it, the more I marvel at them. We do have the cheesy moments and I do cringe, but they are few and brief.<br/><br/>Twilight has made everything vampire so much better for me. It allows me to visualize the action, such as fighting, death, turning...<br/><br/>Three outstanding peripheral characters stand out and I feel deserve a special mention. Blondie, for being there, Bella's savior til the end. Seth, what a sweet boy, that believes in doing the right thing, loyal and trustworthy. AND a very special shout out to Leah. When she makes that move in front of the Cullin's house...doesn't get much better than that.<br/><br/>To vamp or not to vamp, that is the question. I first got into vamps with Angel reruns, then Charmed and Supernatural reruns. I caught a few Buffy episodes, but missed out on most of it.<br/><br/>I do love my vamps mean and ugly, but, now, I also love them soft and vegetarian. Cheesy and hot. It's so bad I can't look away. I watch whatever pops up on cable over and over. binging on Hulu. Poor constipated Edward and lip sucking, soft snorting Bella. a whiny selfish brat...and a hottie, Jacob. Sometimes Edward's facial expressions are so very creepy. To pick my favorite character is really hard, because as I learn more about each one, they all have their special touch added to the whole.<br/><br/>Two other cringe worthy moments are when Riley is standing over Charlie...I can feel his breath on my face, and when Bella's knees hit the floor. I cringe every single time!<br/><br/>My favorite quote:<br/><br/>""So the lion fell in love with the lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a stupid lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a sick masochistic lion.""<br/><br/>Everything about Twilight has made my enjoyment of the supernatural world of werewolves and vampires so much more enjoyable. I am able to visualize the action and know more of the history of the fabulous fictional characters.<br/><br/>BLEW MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I rarely buy books or DVDs, but this was a must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..and I bought the set of books too."
"GiraffeDoor","6","2","4","23 August 2019"," Still a better love story than La La Land
","Watchable piece of Gothic Urban Fantasy Romance with a great atmosphere in its foggy little one-horse town and a very likeable heroin. I'd marry Bella Swan...<br/><br/>Everything is realized with skill and panache making it quite enchanting if you're willing to turn your brain off for a bit.<br/><br/>My big issue with this movie is the same one I had for My Neighbour Totoru: there isn't really enough conflict or stakes to constitute an actual plot until just before the final leg.<br/><br/>Let me explain what I mean: I assumed that in this movie Bella would have a bad time for a bit and then find happiness in the attention from the handsome older supernatural man taking an interest in her even though the romance would be forbidden. Although Bella is understandably a little melancholic about her distance from her Mom and her new surroundings, she actually isn't bullied at all, she makes friends easily and there are two boys after her. And these boys are two DIFFERENT boys competing for her than the two who are in the sequel.<br/><br/>Her Dad actually buys her a car. It's not an amazing car but it's something. Also, everyone on both families is just way too nice about the romance. Not one of the vampires even gives an impression of not trusting Bella. There are so many ways that conflict could be drummed up but aren't.<br/><br/>The last act is also rather tacked on. It feels like they realized that they had sort of run out of ideas (by which I mean, miss Meyers did) and conjured up some villains ex nihilo. A similar problem is also found in Totoru.<br/><br/>But to it's credit, Twilight's version of a tacked-on climax is used as an opportunity to explore its themes of temptation and immortality and it's only the first quarter of its story anyway. I know how weird this must sound but the Twilight Saga is a bit like The Ring of the Nibelungen in its structure: four parts, with the first really just to establish some themes, characters and relationships. So when people tell you the Twilight is one quarter of a movie, they're right. That's what it was meant to be.<br/><br/>Twilight is an inevitably fascinating picture for the phenomenon it has been culturally. I sincerely believe this shift in how we want to see vampires tells us something about our culture and Meyer's own Mormon faith only adds to that. Edward is a vampire but he is one divorced from the religious subtext of Stoker or Polidori. He is not a demon, he is just a man (note how I didn't say ""person"") dealing with original sin and temptations he knows he might not be able to control so virtuously tries to resist until he cannot anymore. He is blessed and also burdened with an immortality of sorts and the power to bequeath it but is unwilling to do so too easily, much like the Mormon God. (seriously check out Mormon theology; it is not Christianity as you think you know it).<br/><br/>The element with the Native Americans too is interesting given the racial element of Mormon scripture, this tribe sort of serving as a stand in for black people.<br/><br/>Having read the book, I think it captures the tone of the book and gives it a professional polish as well as anyone could hope it would. Go in with an open mind and really suspend that disbelief and I think you'll find something quite passable."

Kristen Stewart doesn't drive me mad like most people, but Robert Pattinson...I don't like him. Bella's new high school friends are so annoying. Songs by Linkin Park and Paramore on the soundtrack are actually my favorite moments. And that's not good."

In 2008 there weren't any popular vampire or werewolf movies out so this was all we had. I fell in love with the series. Saw all of them in theaters. Some i saw more than once. Its worth the watch and should be rated higher in my personal opinion. Are you team Edward or Jacob? I feel like I still cant decide lol."
"icecaralee","9","2","4","3 September 2018"," Great adaptation of the book
","People need to remember that this is an adaptation of a young adult novel. It is meant to be overdramatized and cheesey. They did a great job bringing the book to life. I believe this was made possible by including Bella's thoughts from the book as part of the narrative. We always know what she's thinking and why certain moments are important. People who rate this poorly are trying to make the movie into something it's not."
"sbanner-58949","10","2","4","15 August 2018"," This is awkward...
","I never had any desire to watch Twilight at all. It's 2018, and I still hadn't seen any of the Twilight movies. I accidentally ended up watching the first Twilight because Netflix just randomly rolled into that, after I watched Chicago Fire. Not sure how Netflix got from point A to point B, but whatever. 
The awareness comes from the fact that I actually LOVE Twilight, and the other movies in the saga... but I also agree completely with the people pointing out the embarrassing dialog and awkward moments throughout the movie. I think this one is still my favorite of the Twilight movie, but it's worth pointing out that this is the only one with all the weird awkward moments. The other Twilight movies don't have that issue. The dialog improves 100%, you can tell the actors are more comfortable and for Gods Sake... the way that the Vampires do their pouncing, irrational long-flying-type-jumps... are so much better after this movie. Just the way Edward looked when he jumped a far distance, was almost enough for me to turn it off. 
Hopefully other people who hated this one because of the dialogue, were still brave enough to watch the other movies in the saga because they truly are much better."

"wisteriaberlitz","2","2","4","27 October 2017"," Meh
","Typically when a movie gets a low rating or bad reviews, people will assume it's bad and hop on the bandwagon to hate it. I decided that I'll go ahead and watch it, perhaps it'll have a redeeming factor or two. Man, was I so wrong. It had cardboard cutouts for characters and a boring story to boot. I wasn't entertained the whole way through. <br/><br/>On to the main couple. Bella's acting's not the worst like people claim but her dialogue was just plain horrible. Edward is pretty much a pale stoned ""vampire"" that has close to 0 personality nor likability. The way he shows his affection is too creepy when he was ""stalking"" her. Their scenes together are kinda meh, completely devoid of chemistry.<br/><br/>The baseball scene made was quite baffling to me, I understand it's for family bonding but it did nothing but to fill the time.<br/><br/>The final scene could not get anymore anti-climatic either, the fight was choreographed poorly and badly executed. <br/><br/>But all in all, I wasn't the main demographic for this movie that's aimed to make teenage girls riled up with the good looking men, which I have nothing against."
"joshuadrake-39480","6","2","4","17 April 2015"," A good beginning to a five-film franchise
","The plot of the first film is really simple focuses on the development of a personal relationship between a girl named Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a separate group of hostile vampires.<br/><br/>This film was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures' MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written, but Summit Entertainment bought the film rights in 2007, and all of the other TWILIGHT books were sold to Summit Entertainment.<br/><br/>Originally scheduled for release in December 2008, the film was moved to a worldwide release of November 21, 2008, after the sixth film in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moved from a November 2008 release to being released in July of 2009.<br/><br/>Catherine Hardwicke directed this film, Carter Burwell did a really good job with the musical score, and the movie's soundtrack is phenomenal with amazing songs like, ""Let Me Sign"" and ""Bella's Lullaby"", both performed by Robert Pattinson, ""Decode"" , performed by Paramore and ""Leave Out All The Rest"", performed by Linkin Park. Melissa Rosenberg, wrote the heck out of a script based on the first book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is great as the lead character, Bella Swan. She is attractive and really cool, but also really great as well. Robert Pattinson is great as Edward Cullen, but this was not the first film he was in, I actually saw him as Cedric Diggory in both the fourth and fifth films in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and he really gave a great performance in this film.<br/><br/>The two main actors were so great that they won an MTV Movie Award in 2009 for Best Kiss Scene in this film and they also shared a kiss at the award. This also won an MTV Movie Award in 2009, for Best Fight for Robert Pattinson vs. Cam Gigandet as James, Best Female Performance for Kristen Stewart, Best Male Performance for Robert Pattinson and Best Movie.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner, who was in both Cheaper by the Dozen films, and played the character Sharkboy in The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, which came out in 2005, played Jacob Black, really freaking amazing. Billy Burke is also really good as Charlie Swan.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick is hot and sweet as Jessica Stanley in this film and something told me that she was gonna be in more movies and in 2012, I saw her as Beca in the film Pitch Perfect and she will be playing the role again in the upcoming May 15th, 2015 sequel to the first film, Pitch Perfect 2. Kendrick can also sing because I heard her sing in the film and she is really good.<br/><br/>Cam Gigandet, Rachel Levefre and Edi Gathegi plays the evil vampire clan. The rest of the cast is very awesome, but also really good. So, overall, i love the first TWILIGHT film. It's smart, fun and a good way to spend 2 hours.<br/><br/>Out of all of the TWILIGHT films, this one, the third film, ECLIPSE, the final two films, BREAKING DAWN - PART ONE and BREAKING DAWN - PART TWO are the best ones so far, but the worst one is NEW MOON, which I will get to. Acting is not bad, music and story, and visual effects is not bad at all. I give it a 6 out of 10."
"the-awesome-von-grimm","6","2","4","10 December 2014"," It's not that bad but it's just awkward.
","Talking about Twilight is like playing with fire. If you have real constructive criticism about this, you will probably burn of the whole world. If you say something positive about these movies, all the haters will hunt you down and kill you. If you say something negative, all the crazy girls will follow you home and choke you in your pillow. And if you say both positive and negative things I think they will first fight over you: who can kill you? Twilight is a teen movie that is way to depressing for a teen, but too over dramatic for an adult. Also, all the characters are just very awkward. I feel uncomfortable watching Edward and Bella talk."
"RorschachKovacs","Null","2","4","24 June 2014"," This would sure be better if everyone were trying a bit harder...
","Hating on Twilight in book or movie form has lately become a way for pretentious self-appointed critics and lecherous ""players"" who hate Stephanie Meyer's views on sexuality to establish their ""street cred"" with their fellow losers on the internet. To be sure, I can see why guys would tend to keep their distance from this series; in book and movie form alike it's got ""chick flick"" written all over it. The focus is firmly fixed on Bella to the point of rudely shunting several potentially interesting subplots aside.<br/><br/>On the other hand, unlike a great many of my fellow males, I can also understand its appeal to the girls who are its target audience. To any of the aforementioned blowhards who profess not to understand its commercial success, I can only say: the continuing presence and profitability of the Lifetime Channel and its movies-of-the-week must also be quite the baffling mystery to you. Hey, Twilight is all about a shy girl who can do no wrong and doesn't realize how ravishingly attractive she really is being at the center of attention for every single guy in range, including sexually idealized vampires and werewolves. What part of that, pray tell, would not appeal to young girls in their more awkward years of adolescence?<br/><br/>My main complaint about this film is what a waste everyone involved seems to have made of their potential. It's overlong for an adaptation of what was a relatively short and easy read of a book, and a lot of what would have been worth keeping from the book (a brief recounting of the Cullen clan's history, a scene in which Edward demonstrates that yes, he can still eat human food though it no longer appeals to him, etc.) is cut in favor of lots and lots of awkward silences, awkward stares, and awkward conversations that come off looking and sounding like nothing more than padding. Yes, such awkwardness is actually pretty common to real life. No, we in the audience do not care to be bored with these long pauses. Come on, cast and crew, do we really have to spell this out for you? The story's supposed to be a massive overdose on romantic feminine fantasy with lots of sexy vampires and werewolves thrown in. What part of that description calls for mundane realism?<br/><br/>Speaking of awkward stares, the relationship between Bella and Edward in this movie seems to consist of almost nothing else. I can understand the ""show, don't tell"" principle behind some of this (though Bella's many voice-overs are, I might point out, a massive violation of that principle), but what's being shown isn't really what we're supposed to be seeing according to the book. What we should be seeing is Edward as a predator who's falling in love with his prey. Heck, that's simultaneously the Twilight series' greatest appeal to its target audience and most disturbing aspect to its critics: that a lot of girls are strangely turned on at the thought of being the subject of a troubled handsome guy's obsessive and nearly-uncontrollable desires, even if those desires come dangerously close to making him a creepy stalker.<br/><br/>So fine, Stephanie Meyer wants this story to be all dark and edgy by exploring a predator's appeal to his prey? Then let it be dark and edgy. Let us see Edward licking his chops with that creepy gaze that fairly shouts ""Why, Bella, you look good enough to eat!"" While we're at it, fans and critics alike have noted that the whole Twilight series is a big metaphor about sexual temptations and promoting chastity. Fine: that metaphor actually mixes pretty nicely with the whole ""A shy girl loves a stalker..."" theory to make it the somewhat more palatable ""...if he's polite about it and keeps his grubby paws to himself until she willingly gives herself over to him.""<br/><br/>As long as we're being darker and edgier here, there's no need to apologize for those creepier implications: let the metaphor be writ large! Let Edward alternately stalk and try to restrain himself from stalking his prey, and let Bella mistake his hungry looks for the belligerent sexual tension it seems to be (and to which it does eventually convert). That's certainly better than what we actually saw up on the screen, which is Edward looking passive-aggressive and bipolar and not the least bit interested in Bella for either culinary or sexual purposes while she understandably keeps asking him what his problem is. Where's the chemistry?<br/><br/>While we're at it, since the movie departed considerably from the book by cutting away from Bella to other characters once in a while, why not roll with this by showing a few more scenes from Edward's point of view? In the book, he tells Bella something along the lines of ""You don't think you're especially attractive? Yeah, well, that's because you don't have to hear all the other guys' thoughts the way I do."" Letting us hear a sampling of those thoughts from his point of view would have gone a long way toward making this a better movie.<br/><br/>Hey, for all the narrowness of its appeal and the flack it gets, Twilight isn't really a bad flick. I've seen worse; in fact, I've seen a *lot* worse. What I'd really like to see, though, would be everyone trying a little harder. Were the cast and crew mostly just making this movie for the paycheck? Hey, that's all right: a lot of Hollywood's best movies were made by hardened mercenaries who'd rather have been doing something else. That's still no excuse for writers, editors, actors, and producers giving us a mediocre performance, though. It might not be quite Oscar-level material, but this story had the potential to be a very entertaining movie; how very disappointing to see so much potential frittered away."
"verjoyce","4","2","4","27 June 2011"," Don't waste your time.
","So I watched this horrible movie and regret it. I don't even know where to start, the acting was poor, the plot was stupid there were dumb vampire fights and it keeps going! Kristen Stewart isn't a bad actress, (Just watch her in Speak) but she did not shine in this, unlike her vampire sparkly boyfriend. I know girls who love this movie and the books, but both were terrible in my opinion. Kristen Stewart flinches and twitches this whole film and I have no idea why. Also the s-s-stuttering. And Edward always looks like he has an awful stomach ache. But they did stay true to the book, Edward is just as controlling and creepy as he was in the books and Bella is just as annoying and whiny even though everything goes her way mostly. Avoid this and Stephanie Meyers piece of crap books. The reason I gave this movie a four is because It's amazing with rifftrax or just making fun of it yourself."
"Hollywood_Yoda","3","2","4","20 January 2011"," Fans Never Saw It Coming!!
","Catherine Hardwicke directed this film and I am sure the fans are thankful she did not direct any of the sequels. The blue tone, used like sepia of the past was too much and added little to the dramatic-ness of the film. It was a big gamble to do so, and it looks like Miss Hardwicke lost the bet.<br/><br/>However, seeing Kristen Stewart starring as the beautiful Bella Swan was an added plus, she is a delightful actress and should be seen in more dramatic films. The other star of the film, playing Edward Cullen is the little known Robert Pattinson, somewhat of a Harry Potter wannabe. The chemistry of the actors was average, nothing special. The film seems to drag on as the middle approaches, and it can be boring. The ending was the best part, because well, it was over! The only dreadful thing to do next was to wait for the sequel. Was ""Twilight"" worthy of a sequel? The answer, yes, somehow!"
"serghei_romanu","3","2","4","7 January 2010"," This has nothing to do with film-making.
","What is Twilight?<br/><br/>It's a pathetic attempt to literally suck the money out of peoples pockets. Everything is 100% commercial, I haven't seen one good scene, it was all cheap romance, and that can't be described other way than just plain stupidity.<br/><br/>He, Edward Cullen, poorly interpreted by Robert Pattinson, is a vampire, but not a regular one, it's a strong, healthy, beautiful vegetarian vampire; a peaceful one, that's why he even goes to college. She, Bella, just as poorly interpreted by Kristen Stewart, has nothing else to do than fall in love, with the vampire boy.What's the catch?<br/><br/>Seems to me it's the same story I've watched over and over again, with a little modern mythology. There are things in this world which should remain as they are, dark, dangerous, merciless. You can't make a vampire friendly, when vampires are everything, but friendly. That makes me sick. Next thing where gonna see cannibals, eating Cheeto's while playing strip poker.<br/><br/>I repeat myself, this title is embarrassing, at least. If you want romance, than watch: ""The Notebook"", ""The English Patient"", ""Love Story"" etc. If you want vampire tales, watch: ""Interview with a vampire"", ""Dracula"", ""Salem's Lot"", or start reading some books.<br/><br/>Vampires are dark, mythological human-looking creatures famous for their appetite for human blood, and they nocturne livelihood. They may drink from time to time, animal blood, but that is surviving, not living as Lestat(Tom Cruise)once said in ""Interview with a vampire"".They don't fall in love, they don't walk in plain sight, and they surely don't go to college. You can't make a vampire what it is not.A ""Bampire"" maybe, but a vampire, hell no!<br/><br/>I won't give, the lowest grade for this title, because it wasn't the worst film in history, it was just another letdown, nothing more, nothing less. Take my advice, skip this one, for your own sake. I personally rate it a ** out of *****."
"william-fu","3","2","4","7 December 2009"," I Don't Care about them at all...
","I had great enthusiasm at first as I sat down with my girlfriend to watch this film at first. It was alright at beginning...but it became something like, ""I really don't give a damn about the characters."" I don't find the relationship between Edward and Bella to be so intriguing, nor do I find it romantic at all. It just feels annoying...because instinctively, their relationship are not convincing at all. I do not understand what really draws Edward to be in love with Bella, and how could Edward, as a vampire (different race from humans) be so easily attracted and wanting to be with Bella. It feels too easy! He's a vampire! there has to be something greater, in order for these two characters to fall in love and make it convincing. All this just starts with sitting in a classroom....Then it looks easy as Bella could just be part of Edward's family. No warning, no dangers...blah blah. I've seen better classical vampire movies, and sure others may have. I'm disappointed with the way how the director approached this kind of vision. Honestly, this is a good story, with a lot of good concepts, but never did a good job to show it. The fight at the end was cheap...no real challenge at all, I don't feel the pain and suffering of Edward, I don't feel that killing James, the other kind of vampire, is such a great battle. I do not bother to watch the second one, even if my girlfriend would want me to watch. Because I know I'll start criticizing again badly until someone's going to leave the theater."
"KoeInDeWei","3","2","4","24 July 2009"," Has 'missed opportunity' written all over it
","First of all, the way I feel about this movie may have much to do with the fact that the intended audience for this movie is quite a bit younger than that I am, since what bothers me might be less important for the audience intended (I'd say female, somewhere around 16 years old?).<br/><br/>I read the book beforehand, and it simply has too much details and things happening to have made this movie true to the book. In order to squeeze this into 1,5 hours of movie, many things were changed a bit and chronologically shifted, but its not affecting the story as it is meant to be.<br/><br/>The squeezing however also made this movie a torment to watch. There is NO tension buildup whatsoever and it is more of a row of things that happen than a story. You can really just watch the movie a bit, pause it and go for beer or the toilet, have a telephone conversation, and go on exactly where you were in the movie without having the feeling that you just killed your 'movie focus/feeling'. This is a crime for any movie, to my eyes.<br/><br/>The best illustration of the inadequacy of the director of this movie is the the scene in which James comes into the movie. The entrance is convincing, but everything that follows is just absolutely laughable in every way (literally: I actually laughed). Playing kittens are more frightening, really. Please go watch some horror or thriller movies, please, miss director, before trying to capture hostility and especially tension. This is a disgrace.<br/><br/>Then on to the behaviour of the characters. My biggest problem not concerning the acting (which I will comment on next) is the way the personalities were portrayed. Edward should have been completely on top of his game: he has lived for dozens of years and is a self-confident person; the nice thing about this is the extreme contrast to the clumsiness of Bella. There are moments in the movie where this is shown, for instance where Bella drops an apple and Edward catches it, but for the rest his movements (besides the cool way of walking, I liked that!) are ordinary and sometimes downright clumsy (take for instance when he leans over Bella against a tree: watch the indecisive left hand grabbling on the tree). As for Bella, she should be clumsy and insecure about herself. In the movie the first was portrayed by just letting Bella trip randomly now or then, the second wasn't portrayed AT ALL. But this might have something to do with the acting, which was horrible at some points, making the torment of the storytelling even more torturing.<br/><br/>In contrast to the excellent acting performance by Edward Cullen stands the horrifying performance by Bella Swan. The whole movie through she seems to be unable to close her mouth nor move the corners of her mouth in any other position than downward. In fact, the expression on her face (what expression?) did not change AT ALL during the whole movie, including the sound (tone, pitch) of her voice. In short: this performance was WAY inadequate and an insult to the acting of Edward Cullen. I do not understand anyone stating that the chemistry between the two was electrifying. The simply just wasn't any, although Edward tried his very best.<br/><br/>Then we have the fact that Jessica just cannot act. Period. Luckily she has a small role, but it cannot be hidden to the eyes and ears that she just doesn't have it. All of us can say a studied line and pretend we are acting. Not a big deal.<br/><br/>The casting of Jacob Black is probably another artifact of the audience this movie is intended for. It is just laughable. This is nowhere near the way Jacob Black is portrayed in the book: this is some boy-band baby-face semi-Indian straight out of some cosmetics commercial, not a self-respecting Indian from a reserve who is supposed to be a little 'blushing' from time to time. He is supposed to have a bit of a mysterious vibe to him. There just isn't any magic to the role in the movie.<br/><br/>To close my comment on the acting and casting on a more positive note: the performances of the whole Cullen family is above average and actually very good (with maybe the exception of Emmett (you might remember the boy-band Five, well, he could very well have been a member), but it is not annoying in anyway to the movie, so I won't comment on that). They are the sole reason for the three stars I still give this movie. Or well, maybe also the CGI, which is convincing to my eyes, although others here have found it to be inadequate (and this comes from someone who thinks 'Chronicles of Narnia' had very bad CGI).<br/><br/>So in short, to make this movie what it could have been: (1) recast Bella Swan, Jacob Black and Jessica, (2) replace the director with someone who knows how to do storytelling and display characters emotions and above all tension buildup.<br/><br/>If after reading this comment you still want to go see this movie, make sure you have read the book, because it will do two things for you: (1) make sure you understand everything that happens and (2) make you able to construct the story aspect yourself from your experiences reading the book.<br/><br/>By the way, for an acting comparison to Bella Swan (supposed to be the same age), see for instance the German movie 'Die Wolke'. GREAT acting and GREAT storytelling. This is how this movie should have been."

"jadecryingwolf","3","2","4","22 April 2009"," Holy Crap, This Movie Sucks!
","I am amazed that this movie is as big a piece of crap as I expected. I really didn't think it was possible, and figured I was extremely underestimating it. I really had no plans to see it, since the vampire movie (in my opinion) was done as well as it could ever be by Francis Ford Coppola (although Keanu Reeves was terribly miscast) in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". However, I walked into my Mom's office yesterday and saw the book on her hotlist and decided I had to see what the hype was about.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson is this movie's only saving grace. I don't think he's a ""great"" actor, or that the script was anything to work with, but he's the reason I didn't turn it off after 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is absolutely horrible. I know it's not the source material, because she sucked in ""Into the Wild"" as well - looking like a tweaker-freak who is too spun to get the words out of her mouth, completely emotionless and acting only as if she'd rather be anywhere else.<br/><br/>This script sucks, and hard. The direction is a joke and the visual effects are only one step up from the SciFi channel movies.<br/><br/>Seeing it now, I think the only thing that may have saved this franchise is the replacement of the director, Catherine Hardwicke. And, it's kind of sad, because I think a visionary director might have been able to save this movie ... but then again, maybe not."
"clouse_08","3","2","4","22 April 2009"," Yep this sucked
","It's simply the fact that such a good book was taken and made into a short and terrible film that really pisses me off. Bad scripting combined with bad acting led to Robert Pattinson's performance of Edward to resemble a stalker or sexual predator more so than a romantic and emotionally torn character. The major departures from the book really just hurt this film all around I mean really they need to remake it. The only reason I can see why this film did so well is first of all the hype and second of all teenage girls going for reasons other than to take the film seriously. Hopefully with a new screenwriter and such New Moon can make up for it's predecessors absolute terrible presentation."
"qorfox","3","2","4","20 March 2009"," Absolutely Terrible...
","Just about one of the worst movies I've seen. Certainly the worst I've seen in a very long time, and I saw the Friday the 13th remake. <br/><br/>The acting was absolutely atrocious, virtually nothing felt believable or natural. The director obviously has no idea how to handle actors otherwise every scene wouldn't have felt as awkward as a junior high play. Also, some of the extremely bizarre choices of shots make me question both the directors sanity and competence. The insanely blue tones were pretty much as extreme as an annoying visual metaphor can be. The special effects... well... I don't know how to really describe it other than to say ""are you afraid of the dark"" had better fx.<br/><br/>The story perpetuates so many stupid stereotypes and thoughts about women being submissive creatures who are basically useless and unable to function without their man. Also, Ladies, love takes a little more than 3 random and occasionally creepy hangouts to blossom... It's strange that a film directed by a woman based on a novel written by a woman would have such deep seeded feelings of female inferiority. Seriously I've seen 1970's blaxploitation films and pornos that portrayed women in a more intelligent light!<br/><br/>The worst thing is seeing/hearing tons of girls/women talk about how ""awesome"" this film is. No offense, but thinking the lead character is ""hot"" shouldn't make you blind to how awful this film really is! A hot lead does not a good movie make. If nothing else, this film proves the point that if you can get 1 girl screaming for something every other girl will scream for it too, if for no other reason than to not feel like an outcast.<br/><br/>This film could have had some potential had it not taken itself so serious. Lets face it, It's a stupid story, with stupid characters why not embrace that a little and have a few laughs about it instead of taking every single painful to watch moment as serious as cancer with a side order of aids? Just about the only thing I was mildly impressed with was Rob Pattisons accent, good for you.<br/><br/>I'm sure tons of ladies and some guys would disagree with me 100%, but I challenge those people to tell me why it's a good film and have it make sense. It's okay to like bad movies, I like tons of bad movies, but you'll never hear me say ""Mallrats is an awesome film!"" because liking a film does not make it a good film. That's an important piece of knowledge that most movie goers need to learn."

","I understand coming in that I'm not the target audience for this stuff. This franchise is marketed towards the squealing teenage girls that made it popular, and my opinion will no doubt be discarded by all of the fans. First and foremost, the novel is dreadful. The plot is dull, the characterization is poor and the whole thing reads like a bad fanfic. I would not hesitate to award the film a 1, or a zero if applicable.<br/><br/>I have charitably given this a two, primarily for the cinematography, soundtrack, and the fact that one of the actors last role was as ""Skinny Dude"" which amuses me immensely for no good reason. Most of the enjoyability came from it's narmtacular moments which were clearly intended as dramatic but had quite the opposite effect, with the entire theatre in stitches. In conclusion, this film is right up there with Battlefield Earth, Robocop 3, and of course, Who's Your Caddy? In conclusion, your time and money would be put to better use purchasing a lava lamp and staring at it for a few hours. I know I would have enjoyed it more."

","I must say this movie was what I expected it would be. I mean what kind of movie can you get with such a horrible book? Lets tell some back story... I was a fan of Twilight when it first came out: September 2005. I was 13 years old. This is the age group that should be viewing this movie (this applies to the book as well) because lets face it: adults ruin Twilight for us! They can't just let us be with one thing! They took Harry Potter away and now Twilight! I was seeing Twilight for the 2nd time with my friends and this horrible 50 year old woman next to us kept on shush shushing us and I was THIS CLOSE to telling her to leave because obviously she didn't belong there if she couldn't handle a few giggles FROM THE PEOPLE THE MOVIE WAS TARGETING. Honestly, the nerve of some people! Anyways, I digress,but back to the point: if you've read the book, you should go and see Twilight. If not, then save some money and go and rent The Dark Knight (God Bless Christian Bale), because you won't get what's so funny anyway when people like me are laughing hysterically during the movie. But even though this was such a bad movie, I probably lost many, many calories laughing my head off at the hilarity on screen! I mean it was just TOO much ahahahahhahah! :D"

","Is it any good? Yes, it has its moments. But it's nowhere near it could have been. <br/><br/>I wish the movie had a bigger budget. I keep deluding myself that more money'd have done miracles. The real trouble is that the movie is lacking an imaginative and talented crew. Kind of sad, really.<br/><br/>The screenplay is generally bad. You have to be very creative when it comes to expressing feelings without the first-person narrative. Sticking to the book is not nearly enough. The result was weak. <br/><br/>Instead of intensifying the emotion the music is spoiling a lot of the scenes. The art direction isn't satisfactory either. The visual effects are shameful for 21st century cinema. The story is chaotic. The director had no sense of how to develop the romance. The few truly intimate moments between Bella and Edward are not as expressive as they should have been. I felt deprived from my initial feeling. <br/><br/>The only good thing is the acting! Despite the bad direction and screenplay Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart manage to portray the magic between Edward and Bella. <br/><br/>Of course, it's not enough, because the rest of the factors are missing. Instead of enjoying their acting, I was caught by the production's failures. <br/><br/>My admirations go for the two young actors and the efforts they've put into saving the story. And I wish Hollywood would stop ruining our fantasies. 6/10"

","Not the worst movie I've seen at all, but I think it could've been better in some aspects. Some of the dialoque seemed wooden, the special effects seemed a little cheesy, but I do believe the director created a storyline which was somewhat good but just missing a couple pieces. I believe the sequel will be better. THe look of the characters seemed right for the roles. THe character of Bella was rather well played, and the character who played Edward wasn't bad, but still could've been better. I enjoyed the character that played Bella's father as well.<br/><br/>Like I said, not that bad of a movie, but the story will likely be better in the sequel now that we got what I guess you would say was the origin story out of the way.

","Now, I didn't go into this movie expecting much. I expected teen romance, vampires, all that good edgy stuff. And that is what I got- but I had my expectations low, so I think seeing what the movie actually did made like it quite a bit. Now, in reality I would give this movie a 7.5, not an 8, but I decided not to give it the short end of the stick and rate it just a 7, and I'll explain this. I will address the elephant in the room first, yes, it is cringy. Some of the scenes are pretty stupid- and make you laugh out loud when you aren't supposed to. No, it is not a masterpiece. There are some noticeable mistakes, but if you start watching this movie expecting it to be perfect, you're not going to have as much fun as you're supposed to, and you shouldn't even watch it at all. Now that I've addressed that, I'll talk about what I liked in this movie. Now, Bella is a very stereotypical teen movie protagonist. The way she acts, the way she speaks, her attitude, it's all very stereotypical. But, surprisingly, I didn't hate her. I thought she was written with enough care that you wouldn't hate her, even though all signs point to the fact that you should. Now onto Edward. He's a vampire. He's attractive. He does creepy things, but Bella likes him too much to care. Yes, this is all very much foreseen even before watching it, but once again, I don't dislike him. He's not perfect by a long shot- he's flawed for sure, and in the real world, he would probably be in jail. But this is a TEEN VAMPIRE MOVIE. You can't expect characters you can relate to or adore, it isn't fathomable to expect that. Robert Pattinson is a brilliant actor, and I'm completely aware that this isn't his best performance, but it isn't bad. It's good. Robert does well with the materiel he is given, and I applaud him for that. I thought the rest of the Cullen family was fun as well- I'm hoping they'll explore them more in the rest of the series. The side characters were good too, although I can't exactly name any of them, so I suppose they weren't that memorable to me at least? They could've done a bit more with them, but I get why they didn't. They aren't the mains, and they're humans. Yes, Bella is a human, but she is the main, so I know why they explored her. Another good thing about this movie is how it looks. Most of the shots were very clean and I thought the movie looked great in general- even with the very heavy filter on it. In fact, I think the filter compliments what type of movie this is supposed to be. It's supposed to be edgy, and the filter helps give it that look. In conclusion, this movie gets too much flack. Is it amazing? No, definitely not. Is it the horrid piece of film that people will lead you to believe it is? Absolutely not as well. If you go in with lower expectations, you'll enjoy it more. Please, watch and decide your own opinion on this movie. Don't let others sway you."

","Bella does not amuse me what so ever. I get her reasoning behind her actions. However, she does not seem edgy or original to me from what I have seen in older films about vampires' or humans' personalities. There is some borderline Mormon attitude about her. She abstains from sex by waiting until she is married, which is cute to me for some reason. The thing I liked about Edward and Bella's relationship is that they were careful about what they were doing instead of carelessly engaging in things with shallowness. Otherwise, the rest of the characters' coupling was bizarre for me. Also, Jacob Black was annoying to me in The Twilight Saga in the book and film sense. Edward's love won in the end. Also, that imprinting business is creepy to me. So, I am not shipping Renesmee and Jacob together. By the way, I thought the New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn films and books were creepier than Twilight, and that is why I prefer the Twilight book."

It goes so fast. The period Edward fights to stay away from Bella is almost gone, which makes comments like ""can't stay away from you"" and ""your mood swings give me whiplash"" strange.<br/><br/>In the book, it is a lot of thoughts and talks, not much of visuals to build on. To transform a book of this kind to something worthy of moving image is hard but not impossible. This movie is a feeble attempt. The images do not tell the story as they should.

","There was much hype I had leading up to this movie premiere, mainly because I read the book and was very anxious to see if the movie met these outstanding expectations I had made. I was in middle school at the time, and most girls at this age drooled over Robert Pattinson, known as Edward Cullen in the movie. I had only read the first book prior to watching this movie because I did not want the ending of the book series to ruin the rest of the movies for me. I stayed up until midnight the night of the premiere so I could be the first to see it. Twilight has a great storyline behind the two main characters, Edward and Bella, but I was not at all pleased by the way the directors went about producing the movie. <br/><br/>The story itself is a very catchy one. Looking back I can see where all of the excitement made by the teenage girls came from. I mean it's about the life of an attractive vampires love story, what teenage girl wouldn't adore that? I believe even more girls fell in love after seeing this movie because I thought it was one of the best on screen romances. You can really tell the love they have for one another. Edward is the type of guy who would do anything for Bella, and they did a really good job demonstrating this during the film. The chemistry between these two characters is amazing, and this is one of the only key points in the movie that actually kept me awake in my seat. <br/><br/>The majority of the movies acting, editing, and visual effects were not all I had hoped them to be. Yes, Edward and Bella had a great connection during the movie, but the bulk of the film upset me because of the poor quality in production. For example, there were parts in the movie when the words the actors were saying did not always line up with their lips. It was kind of hard for me to take some of the scenes seriously, and I found myself silently laughing because of some of the dreadful dialog and visual effects. Another example was when Edward or Bella are running up the trees in the forest. They did a terrible job capturing the visual effects of this and it looked like a disaster. There was also a lot of awkward pausing while acting, which distracted me. All of these little off sets over the duration of the movie can really make or break it. Altogether, I believe they could have produced this movie in a more friendly and compelling manner. <br/><br/>Overall, twilight definitely had its ups and downs. I did have high intentions leading up to this movie, and was partially left in doubt. I could not help but stay interested in the majority of the movie because of the captivation that the two leading roles had during the course of the film. However, I was not at all happy with the way the production went about with the film. They could have done a much better job at keeping the audience on the tip of their toes."

","It has been awhile since I watched Twilight, but I've always been iffy about that movie. Some parts of it I like, and other parts I don't. I like some of the characters, however, I don't like the whole ""werewolf vs. vampire"" thing. <br/><br/>A lot of people have said that the book was way better than the movie; I'm just hoping they are right. I never read the book, I'm just believing in everyone else's opinion. It probably isn't best to go that route, but I am.<br/><br/>Okay, so back to the movie. My opinion of it? I don't know how to feel about it. I think they could have found a better Bella, that's for sure. I am not a fan of werewolves or vampires or anything like that. However, the movie was actually okay. I feel as though there wasn't a ton of talking going on so there was long pauses between talking. It has a sense of direction and it is not just ""flowing around"" like other movies. Acting is pretty decent, although I thought Kristen Stewart was an awful actress. I do like the way they filmed Forks - keeping it dark and grim the whole time, which goes along with the movie. The special effects could have been a little better, especially with the vampires speeding through the woods and what not. Overall, there were some downfalls. <br/><br/>In all reality, this movie cannot bore you. Whether someone likes the movie or does not, it is not a boring movie. There are some thrilling parts that keep the audience interested. Some of the actors were pretty good at playing their character. They did keep it dark and grim like I said in the previous paragraph, which definitely helped with the overall story of the movie. It wasn't a terrible movie, but there are some minor details that could have been fixed."
"sandover","Null","0","0","19 November 2009"," What happened to 1001 comments?
","This is going to be deadly serious. Like, in 1001 nights Scheherazade cuts her narrative before dawn, responding to the restrictive threat of the khalif, you know, about cutting her head, and that saves her. Here, we have a film threatened to be cut by a kiss, for some nights at least. A kiss that automatically is much more, it spills out of its frame and threatens and treats us on the verge of becoming a bloodbath, Edward eating up his girlfriend and the rest, but none of this, thankfully, happens. Thankfully? Some reviewers, and I am on the verge of agreeing with them, say that this heats up, rewinds us back to classic Hollywood where a kiss was not just a kiss, and the consummation was invested, well, in our investment. That is totally different from identification with questioning what shall one do and the appended titillation, coming back and forth the on screen proceedings and the viewer you know, like totally.<br/><br/>This is going to be deadly serious I wrote. I wish it was undeadly serious. Like (I love this American like, it's not at all, like, Brit) seriously Robert Pattinson is the most gorgeous thing of all times, and if not all times surely since 1918! That is all times can give best, and it certainly happens on screen. Off screen, well, there is where problems begin, because, you know, one is a viewer of this film, he is not embedded, if I may say so, into the action. And this is the merit of a film, I deem (excuse me if I sound from another era regarding my diction, I am actually from another country, but well, nowadays that is the same anachronism). Its merit is the fact that our gaze has to participate, and if not be undercut by it, then palpitate in that sort of film. What sort one may ask. Let's pin it down. Is it unrequited love? Frustrated love? High-school, aids-era, neo-puritan, plain girly, gay overtones one, etc? None of the above. It's not an etc. love either.<br/><br/>The question is: is this all about love? No. Just, plainly, bluntly, no. Why? For love to emerge, there must be three. As I said, I am going to be deadly serious.<br/><br/>Edward and Bella fall in - what? He is a vampire, she a mortal. There seems to be an incomensurability. An incomensurability boils. Not just down to ""I am afraid I will eat you"", not just screaming after just recovering ""don't go, don't leave me etc"". It is not about plausibility. It is not about her (her, the woman being the object of desire) being paler than death, in every respect, so that one can overwhelm his identification with death, or anemia, or loving one who suffers, as she wisely introduces herself in the beginning, that makes one more plausible, as if love was a question of plausibility. I think one can insist enough on this. The thing is that there must be a third party to make it implausible, and thus redeem it like love. Movies purportedly insist, in matters of love, on someone frustrating the couple, and likewise foregrounding it to become one. Love and death is not enough, when it is, as it was an internal question. Otherwise, as many viewers pointed, and I insist on the word viewer, the film is spent in gazes, in the film. And not outside it, namely the viewer.<br/><br/>One likes Hitchcock, one likes film noir, another likes blockbusters where there is some suspense because someone intervenes. No one intervenes here, albeit with side glances. But one cannot build up a film or love with glances and glances, hither and thither: video-clip ones, borrowed and burrowed here and there, stylistically speaking. I mean, I know there is a verve to something in this commentary, no? I was a high-school girl once? No. But everybody is one. Everyone ends up a female impersonator. And this film, with so many women in the production, is a sad example of this.<br/><br/>To resume. The narrative is thrift-spent in many stylistic devices as if it would titillate the viewers. It is not amusing, it is not disorienting, it is not in-between. That makes three? No. It makes a semblance of three. And it does not make sense. Or truth.<br/><br/>Put a teacher while the high-school student reads, put a fighter of the vampires outside their circle, not enclose the circle with vampires of a different clan. We all are of a different clan. Put a one-line that has to do with one line, put an adolescent - but you already did that in the film, early on, where the infatuation begins, before we begin to bother. We don't identify? You don't identify with us. That's the democratic vampire speaking. No, the suspense-loving vampire one, the loving-loving vampire speaking suspense. Please don't identify with us. Are you male?

","i am like many of you a regular movie goer and i put the film to not be my cup of tea based on my age and cultural up bringing. but when my girlfriend who is of the targeted age and background couldn't withstand the film then i realised there was something wrong.<br/><br/>thats what made me compelled to write into these comment section.<br/><br/>there are many points that are needed to be addressed in this film. its apparent from the outset that this film and series was written by a woman. which is an instant turn off for most people as i feel gender should be irrelevant when watching films. the story is completely misguided and somewhat immature.i feel that the fantasy element wasn't in connection with the fact that there are vampires present. but simply with the way that Americans in high school act socially. it not only reinforced the typically old clich√© of a hierarchy system but seemed to borrow ideas simply from every high school teen drama I've ever seen before. surely there is room for uniqueness........ or maybe not.<br/><br/>I'm quite happy i did attend a showing of this film. as it was a good experience for me to enjoy a few firsts. it was the first time i actually laughed out loud at the actual acting being presented to me. the actors were certainly too young and inexperienced to truly take on any of the roles given to them. it did not feel fresh and unique more regurgitated and unprepared.<br/><br/>this was also the first time I've ever actually walked out of a cinema. and the first time I've ever felt as if the director has stolen my time.<br/><br/>my advice to anyone planning to go watch it. save your money, time, breath...... this is certainly an experience you can do without."
"jedichick070588","9","6","20","21 November 2008"," Amazing movie...but it does lack
","I went to the midnight premiere and was blown away with the movie. I love the books and was excited to see the movie. I knew it wouldn't be the same as the book but it did hold it's own.<br/><br/>The opening scene is exactly like the book, Bella's monologue about death. Every scene has weight to it, and the camera angles and lighting...well the cinematography in general was amazing. The colors used really brought the movie life while still remaining in the 'fairy-tale' realm.<br/><br/>Kristen's acting was superb, you can tell Bella doesn't want to be in Forks but she's so self-sacrificing that she doesn't complain. Edward really seemed anguished until he made his decision to stay with Bella. He is still uncertain as to his decision but the pull she has on him is truly visible on screen. Kristen and Rob have such a chemistry on-screen that it looks natural when they are having their intimate moments.<br/><br/>Because Edward and Bella are the story's main focus, I expected the other characters to not be as prominent but that didn't mean they had to cut out the other Cullens. The school kids, Eric, Jessica, Mike, Tyler, Angela, etc, are shown as what you really picture them as; they are truly oblivious to the world around them.<br/><br/>The few things that aggravated me were that the Cullen's were downplayed. You do see them throughout the movie but it seemed like all together they only had like 30 or 40 lines. Jasper is the one that I was most disappointed in; Jackson does an excellent job but his power is never mentioned and looks like he was just thrown in to compliment Alice. Everyone else was amazing, the actors and the characters.<br/><br/>It's true that it doesn't follow the book to the letter but it was still an excellent movie. There are many missing scenes but it doesn't feel lacking. Things are kind of out of place or have been cut altogether, like when Bella tells Edward that she doesn't care that he's a vampire and to scare her off he shows what he looks like in the sunlight and his other abilities¬Öunlike the book where she knows and then on a sunny day he shows her what he looks like or how the biology scene where they type their blood is cut along with the scene in the airport where Bella runs away. Lunch scenes are short and it's never shown that Bella and Edward have lunch together or when she starts sitting with the Cullens.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't seem lacking but true-die hard fans might be disappointed when they don't see a scene because it was cut. All in all, Twilight is a movie that I know I will see again and again in theaters and buy on DVD. It's an amazing movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who asks."
"Ninaaa","2","32","160","26 November 2008"," Seriously bad even without comparison to the books.
","Let me begin this by saying that when the Twilight book first came out, some of my friends loved it, and I decided to buy and read it for myself. I finished Twilight feeling annoyed, pretty much dragged myself through New Moon, and didn't even try to read Eclipse or Breaking Dawn or whatever night-time-titled monster Meyer is planning to create.<br/><br/>Now, one of my friends had an extra ticket to a premiere of Twilight the movie, so I guessed, why not. I might actually like it now that we don't have to hear/read Bella's narration admire Edward's face/eyes/hair/breath/toenails time and time again (little did I know the film would include cheesy voice overs by a monotone Kristen Stewart straight from the novel).<br/><br/>To protect myself from the inevitable angry rages of hopelessly devoted Twilight fans, I will begin with the positive comments on this movie.<br/><br/>1. Pretty good visuals, nice colors. <br/><br/>2. Great soundtrack/music, especially when Edward plays the piano. <br/><br/>3. The actors playing the Cullens are all enjoyable, and because of their performances I grew pretty fond of the screen versions of Carlisle and Jasper. <br/><br/>4. They did a good job with the baseball game - when I read it in the book I just found it ridiculous.<br/><br/>Off to why I really wrote this review- to express my absolute hatred/disgust for the ""acting skills"" of Kristen Stewart. I don't understand all this raving over her performances, in this movie she was so unemotional and dead I thought she'd already been bitten by a vampire. And its not just the type of mediocre acting you can just brush away - her plain, expressionless face and deadpan voice was almost painful to watch in all of her scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. The only part it seems she put effort in to actually manipulate the muscles in her face or raise her voice was the last hospital scene, and even that didn't impress me that much. Yes, she did her job and screamed and writhed after James' bite, but couldn't I at least see those angry eyebrows tilt a little? Actually move? No Oscar for this one, folks.<br/><br/>The movie does its job to faithful novel fans by including real lines from the book itself and passionate, bubbling chemistry between the main characters Bella and Edward, so that probably made them not pay any attention to its flaws and declare this ""PERFECT!!"" or ""D BEST MOVIE EVR!!!!!1!11!1""<br/><br/>Now I'm not telling everyone to hate this movie, I mean, if you enjoy it and like watching it, go ahead, I'm not complaining. But do not proclaim Twilight - The Movie as the best-created or best-acted or anything like that, because it's not true. Lastly, do not respond to this review in some irate, screaming, capitalized comment about how I'm stupid or I'm a loser for not liking Twilight, because I'm not even arguing with any fans."
"robertallenandersonjr","10","20","95","21 November 2008"," This movie was really a gift
","Twilight was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The romance in this movie was like no other romantic movies out. It was so original and well directed. The visuals went along with the movie great. I thought the title for the movie was great. I think the visuals made sense with a lot of the scenes. It did have a few sad moments and then very intense moments. The movie was very long but did not drag on at all. It was very entertaining and will definitely keep you awake and your eyes glued. The acting was very good but cheesy at very few scenes. I think the acting was meant to be cheesy at some of the scenes. The story was amazing and very original. The vampire falling in love with a human was a great plot to begin with. Their was more to the story then just that though. The movie wasn't only serious it also had quite a bit of humor in it as well. I would say definitely go see this movie and bring a date. One more last thing to add to this amazing movie is that their was really good music."
"xjuteveux","Null","4","12","27 November 2008"," Unless you've read the book, don't go see the movie.
","Please tell me the director of this film is not directing the next one. All of her previous movies were terrible, she must be mormon because I don't know why stephanie would let her ruin this movie. <br/><br/>The movie is everything that everyone has been saying about it: Corny, unintentionally hilarious, awful dialogue, terrible acting (sorry girls, patterson is no exception, he was just as awful).<br/><br/>I think the main problem with this movie was that the directory tried to make it ""audience friendly"" meaning, make it easy for people who haven't read the books. Which is totally stupid because the main fan base is going to be the people who read the books, so why skimp on the material? The movie should have been longer, I felt that by the end of the movie there was BARELY a relationship developed between Bella and Edward. One fan pointed out that they never said 'i love you' once in the entire film. Whoever directs this next movie: you NEED to dedicate some serious time in the beginning of the movie to establishing a strong relationship between bella and edward, seeing as how edward is suppose to be ripped from bella in the next movie. The next director isn't going to get the point across effectively as to how devastating this is for bella unless they spend some time reworking the relationship. <br/><br/>So the movie made 70 million? put that toward some freakin' acting classes. Everyone in that movie was TERRIBLE! even kristen stewart did a less than par job. in the movie she's sitting there being like ""i'm not afraid of you"" and she's shaking and looking terrified. <br/><br/>Ultimately, there's nothing that can save twilight at this point, whats done is done. I just hope that the next director take some serious advice from the fans and works on making this movie better because it was severely disappointing."
"kaslesinthesky","9","4","12","21 November 2008"," My Reaction to Twilight
","I am a huge fan of the books. That being said, I went into this movie with very low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. I actually loved it. There were definitely major flaws, and it may not have captured the complete essence of the book, but it was simply fun to see so many of my favorite scenes brought to life. Could the acting have been a little better? Maybe. The directing? Probably. The special effects? Definitely. But overall this movie remains extremely faithful to the book. My opinion is that this movie, is definitely not FANTASTIC, but entertaining, and I don't see why so many twilighters are being so cruel in their judgment of it. Non-twilighters, i can understand. But I have been reading reviews from true twi-hards, some loved it, some loathed it. But for those who despised it, all i have to say is you dug your own graves. For months now I've been watching the videos of the fans reactions to this movie. They all guaranteed that the movie would be outstanding... perfect! But it hadn't even been released yet. Even I, a truly devoted fan, could tell from the trailers and clips, that this movie was not going to be outstanding. But then I would go and read people's comments to the trailers and they would be like ""OMG! This is PERFECT! This is going to be so amazing!"" The fact is, fans got their expectations set way too high, which is a terrible mistake when looking forward to a book adaptation. So the movie wasn't perfect! go read the books! watch the movie for the movie, and read the books when you want the perfect version, because it will only ever be perfect in your own heads. All i have to say is that these twilight fans seriously need to stop talking crap about this movie, or there will be no hope for making sequels. and despite the hatred by some fans toward the first movie, i know the majority of them would still like to see the sequels made into movies. For fans, go see this movie with an open mind, don't expect too much, and take it at face value for what it is, one person's interpretation of the book. For non fans, I don't really have any advice. Yes. This was a low budget movie, and it shows a little bit, but is still entertaining in MY opinion. I've known non-fans who hated the movie, as was the case with most the critics. But i've also known non-fans who really liked it. My brother has tried for months to finish the first book, never has, but actually really liked the movie. So it really just depends. Oh, and for people who hated the movie because bella was wearing the wrong color shirt in a particular scene, or someone was too pale, or not pale enough, all I have to say is, ""You're being ridiculous. Get over yourself."" One last thing, particularly for twilight fans, particularly for those who hated the film. Go see it again. I've seen it twice already, and it truly was better the second time. I forgot about all the little things, and the fact that the first time i saw it, it felt a bit like a rushed summary of the book. The second time it played more like a movie, with it's own unique feel, however different that may be from the book, and I enjoyed it even more than the first time. I bet you will too. Try it!"

There were some great funny scenes too which made everyone in the theater laugh. The way they filmed the flying/running scenes were very well done.

Was hoping for more Still left with a smile and thought it was cute but it should have dazzled me to the point of no compare... Im scared that New Moon Might not do as good because it wont draw out the non-readers, ratings might be a slump because there probably not twilighters!

"nox_everto","1","35","188","5 December 2008"," Could it have gone worse? I think not.
","This is one of those cases where the movie is better than the book, and though that sounds good,its not saying much. Even so, the movie is absolutely horrible. Moments that looked rather like the director didn't even take the movie seriously himself- when Bella first sits next to Edward is one- and bad acting cannot make up for a bland, and as others have said, predictable story. If one were to have just seen the movie,I'm sure there were many plot holes as well, like WHY the black vampire was traveling with two such dangerous vampires in the first place, and if he did know why did he not join them. This movie isn't worth the money I spent, much less going to the midnight showing- though I must admit when the movie started going backwards and upside down, it was pretty good. What? That wasn't part of the movie? Just a technical error? Dang, then this movie has no entertainment value. Also, to the girl two rows down from me in the theater, this movie, nor its book counterweight, are not even close to being compared to The Lord of The Rings."

I thought Twilight was an excellent, funny, intense and romantic love story. It's a big movie but feels like a smaller movie. It's Beauty and the Beast meets Romeo and Juliet. I thought Edward and Bella were a great couple. Bella's Father Charlie is one of my favorite characters. I did not like at first when Edward was being jerky to Bella but he was trying to protect her. I love the fight scene at the end in the ballet studio. I think the movie has great songs. James was a great villain but he could have had more scenes. I thought it was creepy when he noticed Bella was a human. Edward is my favorite Cullen and I like Alice and Jasper a lot.

","I saw other Twilight saga first so I'm biased in this review. If this was the first Twilight I've seen, it would have been much difficult to understand the story.<br/><br/>Bella moved from Phoenix Arizona to Forks Washington. There she enters high school, and meets Edward. Edward is bit unusual, and Bella suspects that there's more to him than what he's willing to tell, but she can't exactly pin point to what it is. In the mean time, there's strange killing going on in the forest. Edward finally confesses that he's a vampire, but of a ""vegetarian"" kind, and don't kill humans. They both fall in love with each other. One day, the ""other"" vampires who's been killing people in the forest shows up, and wants to ""eat"" Bella. Edward tries to defend her, but they got her mom, and by her own volition, she goes to meet the vampires.<br/><br/>I usually don't go for vampire movies, especially the old school kind, but this is story done elegantly, with romance, intrigue, and action. This is the first vampire movie that I really liked. Story develops rather slowly, and it's good that series continued, because not enough is said in this first installment. Picture is beautiful, and casts are best of the young actors. <br/><br/>Great movie, that should be seen as a series. Otherwise you'll miss the good parts."

","I saw the trailer for this movie while I was watching another one and I scoffed at it. I purposely ignored the Harry Potter craze and saw Twilight as the same sort of situation. However, the trailer left me intrigued. I decided to just take a look at this movie just to see what all of the fuss was about.<br/><br/>It's official, I have been bitten by the Twilight bug. I fell head over heels, madly, passionately and irrevocably in love with Edward and Bella. Their love story is so different than the usual teen drama, and not just because it contains hunky vampires (that's just a bonus). It's mature, lacking the usual mundane teenager drama. You almost forget that they are supposed to be in high school and see them as two adults beginning an incredible but dangerous journey.<br/><br/>There isn't a lot of action but I didn't miss it. This movie isn't like The Lost Boys, filled with death and terror. It's a love story great for all ages.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson is wonderful as the breathtaking Edward, the vampire torn between his love for Bella and his fear of killing her because of her blood's enticing scent. Kristen Stewart plays the mature and klutzy Bella. She plays her character perfectly, showing her as completely spellbound to Edward and quite willing to accept this mythical world she as stumbled upon, even hoping to become a part of one day. I look forward to seeing her in New Moon when Bella's emotional journey takes a serious hit.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I collected all of the books and I am happy to say that it's not that different. Sure there are additions and several subtractions to the story, but all in all the characters and plots were untouched. I recommend this movie to all of whom are undecided about reading the books. Once the credits roll you'll be heading to the book store, I guarantee it."

He made a short list of things Vampires should NOT do when they come in contact with sunlight:<br/><br/>When In Contact With Sunlight Vampires Do Not:<br/><br/>1. Glitter 2. Do 'The Robot' 3. Fart wishes and dreams<br/><br/>What they should do:<br/><br/>1. Burst into flames 2. Turn to ash 3. Catch on fire/burst into flames 4. Die 5. Any variation of the above.<br/><br/>If you really are set to go see this, don't take it too seriously and just enjoy the special effects. They had some nice special effects, I'll give them that much. For suggestions on a few GOOD vampire movies:<br/><br/>""Near Dark"", ""The Lost Boys"", ""Innocent Blood"" and ""Interview with a Vampire"" to name just a few. Note that none of the vampires in any of these films ever sparkled or glittered in the sunlight. ~rolls eyes~.<br/><br/>Movie Grade: C- (At least it had some cool effects!)<br/><br/>I think I'll skip the books, too.<br/><br/>~Ami"
"escalade94","1","5","17","21 November 2008"," Excellent
","I myself have read the books and am a big fan of Twilight. I was praying that Hardwick wouldn't crew this up and my prayers were answered. The movie was ten times better than what I had expected. The last ten minutes sent butterflies pounding through my stomach. Many people have looked down on this movie saying it doesn't match what they expected. The only negative would be the rush I saw. Some of the concepts in the book were ""rushed"" in the movie. For example, Edward mentioned Alice being psychic so quickly, you could have easily missed it. Over all the movie was amazing. I really love Kristen and Rob together. They made a great couple. The movie never really ads or takes away anything major. I think the entire crew did a great job making this. Bravo Catherine Hardwick!"
"cristina_mccarty","1","29","156","10 December 2008"," Absolutely painfully bad!
","OK, so I read the 4 books in 5 days while my husband was out of town. They are certainly not going to be classics, but I will admit that I (mostly) enjoyed them.<br/><br/>I dragged the hubby to see the movie tonight, and let's just say it was payback for the time he made me see Silent Hill<br/><br/>First off it was totally miscast. Bella could not complete a sentence to save her life, and was absolutely unappealing. Edward was supposed to be the most beautiful and charming man on earth, instead he was a clumsy and bizarro stalker There was zero chemistry between them...and their chemistry is kind of the basis of the book. Jasper looked and acted like a constipated Edward Scissorhands. Esme was sweet and at least looked about like I would have expected. The other Cullens were not in the movie enough to decide if I liked them or not.<br/><br/>The special effects and makeup were just weird! The flying, jumping, climbing, & running stuff I swear they just looked to be dangling from cords. The big ballet studio fight was passable...only the bad guy James was just not that bad...and the end where Edward sucks the venom out??? Good Lord it was bad.<br/><br/>If I were Catherine Hardwicke I would be very very ashamed. The screenplay must have been God awful...<br/><br/>In short, I alternated between embarrassed for everyone involved, verging on hysterical laughter from beginning to end, and thinking that I should have just gotten my $10 worth and hopped into the next theater where Changeling was playing.<br/><br/>If you liked the book stay far far away from this movie"
"bsteves06","1","8","33","30 December 2008"," Horrible-Almost left halfway through
","Wow, really bad!! I had high hopes going in to see this, as I've read and enjoyed all the books. The characters were nothing like the books. Am I wrong, but were there any Asian or Blacks in the book? I don't think so. Stop trying to make everything politically correct. I couldn't even tell which characters were which because of this. There are no hipster, emo kids in Forks either. Rosalie was all wrong, not nearly pretty enough. Bella had no facial expressions whatsoever, and every word that came out of her mouth was preceded by stuttering and hemming and hawing. Horrble! Alice, Emmett, and Edward were good.<br/><br/>Not sure what else to say. I really didn't like it and was very disappointed. I will probably see the other movies, but just wait until they are on video to rent."
"ClfGlltt","1","32","181","15 December 2008"," Waste of time! Utter CHEESE!!!!!
","Boring, Slow & Cheesy...... This movie had woman written all over it. It was slow moving, not scary, not mysterious and most definitely not sexy. Surely vampires should be all of those things. This book is disrespectful toward all literary traditions created by classical Gothic and horror writers. <br/><br/>Vampires burn in the sunlight, don't they? Or are all of the movies and books I've read wrong?. Obviously Miss Meyer disagrees with those books and thinks that vampires 'sparkle' in the sunlight. I mean wtf. <br/><br/>The book and movie were clearly written for young girls (fan girls), that like things such as Camp Rock and the Jonas Brothers. The over romanticising of every little detail is sickening. What has happened to real horror stories and classic movies such as Terence Fisher's Dracula (starring Christopher Lee)?<br/><br/>Twilight could have been an amazing and successful production, if it had a good director and a good cast. The book had an OK storyline -apart from the sparkling in the sun. The vampires have no weakness, every good hero has a weakness- but this was clearly only made for the fan girls.<br/><br/>It doesn't deserve the one star that i gave it, but there is no option to give it 0 unfortunately.<br/><br/>This movie is a disgrace, an utter waste of time and an insult to all the vampires out there ;)"
"Epiic","10","4","13","21 November 2008"," Twilight: A Beautiful Love Story
","I just came from watching Twilight. I'm a huge fan of the books but I wasn't expecting the movie to impress me. Everybody knows that the books are always better than the movie because there is no way to capture all the magic in a 500 pages book in 2 hours. At first I didn't even liked the cast and the trailers didn't help either. I was expecting to be disappointed. I thought I was going to watch how the unique but amazing love story of Bella and Edward was destroyed and turned into a cheap movie that focuses on attracting vampire and action lovers by Hollywood. I thought they didn't care about the fans of the books who were impressed not by the action scenes but by the while romance and love in the book. I was wrong. To my surprise the movie did catch the magic in the book, that essence that makes us love them. I actually enjoyed it a lot! I also thought this entire buzz and over-exposure was going to set high expectations and then disappoint everybody because that's what always happens when a movie is surrounded with all that hype. I was wrong again. The movie met all my expectations and more. I really got caught up in the chemistry between Bella and Edward. I just can say it was a beautiful movie to watch. It was far from perfect and it was not the same experience as to read the book but it was definitely a great film. I watched Twilight with my cousin and he had no idea what the books were about. He only knew what the trailers showed. To my surprise he loved it too! He was more satisfied and excited about the movie than I was! In conclusion I think Twilight met its purpose and will overwhelm all the fans of the books and the ones who haven't read them. For me Twilight was a hit and it was able to bring to the big screen in 2 hours the love story of a vampire and a human successfully. The movie will definitely leave you hungry for the sequels. I have to tell you that I was always on the edge of my sit. I never felt bored or uninterested. Even though I knew the story very well I was filled with excitement and anticipation during the whole film. I was impressed how fast the action moves without missing vital details form the book. It was awesome that the movie followed the book so closely. I was so happy they didn't change anything huge. At the end of the day I was ecstatic because I never expected it to be that good. It was romantic, mysterious and funny all at the same time. Even though the cast has been highly criticized I think they did a pretty decent job. It was not perfect, it could've been better, but it was good enough. Right now I'm telling you to go see it if you haven't 'cause it's a beautiful film that won't let you down. For all of you that have seen it and disagree with me, it's fine. This is just my opinion (and my cousin's: P) and all of us are entitled to have one. I know a lot of people did not like the movie and at first I was skeptical too. But it was just so amazing I couldn't help but love it. And this is just the beginning. After this, I just can't wait for the sequels because I think they will get better and better as the go along."
"lilbiddyprincess","9","5","18","21 November 2008"," Just let go, and enjoy.
","I went into this not expecting the book, every one of my favorite books that have been made into movies never compare. Northanger abbey, per say. Saying that though does not make the movies better or worse then the book. It's just another way to tell a story. Twilight did that. Told this love story in a different way. You know that giraffe in the room illustration...every one describes it different...this is just another view of the giraffe. No it was not as descriptive as the books, some scenes, some quotes, were not the same but the point of it all came across well though. These two creatures are being pulled to each other, and they can not stop it. The way the scenes were shot made me feel like this was real, like I could walk into a school and yep there could be vampire. If it had been some great big budget film with grand effects, it would have felt corny, fake. Don't get me wrong, this movie was still a little cheesy, little sugary, but that was the same with the book...it's a great story. I think if you go into the movie not expecting everything just like the book, you'll enjoy. The ideas are the same. Don't nit pick, because you'll just miss Edwards smile Rob did very well. I was surprised the jittery, yet adorable, Rob Patterson was able to play graceful quiet Edward, but the first moment he smiled he was Edward. Kristen was amazing as Bella, there really is a connection between her and Rob, and it makes the scenes that much more enjoyable and real. Ashley as Alice, was perfect, and the chemistry between her and Jason/Jasper was also amazing, the small things they did such as her touching his arm, really showed them as a couple. I can't wait to see more of their story in the future. I think if you watch some of the small details throughout the movie, you will see more then you think is there just look. The rest of the cast was amazing, and though at first i wasn't sure how anyone could play Rosalie, Nikki did a great job. All I'm saying is, it's worth seeing, as long as you know how to let go of the book, and see this through someone's eyes other then your own. Just let go, don't think, and enjoy a great movie. I hope to see the other made in the same fashion."
"dark30sangel69","10","13","64","21 November 2008"," Very enjoyable love story!
","OK, so I never read the books but have heard a lot about it. I myself am a huge fan of vampire based stories. When I was little Interview with a Vampire was my favorite movies! (yes I saw it when I was like in 4th grade and really that was more of an adult movie but I grew up with movies part of why I'm studying film) That's what started my obsession with vampires at a young age, then when I was in 5th grade in 1997 Buffy the Vampire Slayer came out (the show not the movie never saw that till after I'd been watching the show for a few years and yea not that good) I was so addicted and became my first real fandom and first time having an obsession with a show.<br/><br/>After Buffy I've loved most other vampire movies for the most part and then when Moonlight came on I LOVED that show so much! So mad they canceled it and now there is True Blood which well I'm not really a fan of I've been watching it and it's not that I don't like it I just don't know if I like it yet, it hasn't hooked me.<br/><br/>So hearing all this stuff about Twilight from people who had been reading the books I was excited and finally when a trailer came out I couldn't wait to see it, so I looked it up on youtube and umm yea it did nothing for me. The trailer made me not even want to see the movie it just looked like some stupid little teeny booper movie that deals with some vampire stuff in it. Though I was still left intrigued by all I heard so tonight my boyfriend, his sister and me went to see the midnight showing and WOW was I surprised!!!! None of us have read the book but we all loved it!! My boyfriend for being a guy loved it even though it was very romantic and I was gonna say sappy but really I didn't find it sappy or corny. My boyfriend's sister got out of a four year relationship awhile ago and has been one of those ""I hate love and romantic things"" person, but she loved the movie! When we got out of the movie tonight she said how she doesn't like stuff about love anymore but the romance in this movie was just too beautiful not to love it and it was her favorite movie! And really I thought that this movie was one of the most romantic movies I've seen of all times! Just the chemistry between Kristen and Robert is just so beautiful! I don't think I've ever seen chemistry that great which isn't saying that I haven't thought other two actors had great chemistry before but there was just something magical about them that brought it up to a whole new level.<br/><br/>Sure, the film may not be perfect and I can't really judge it based on the books but for what it's worth it is one of the best love stories!"
"Tigerbai1","10","3","9","12 March 2012"," Don't Hesitate - WATCH THIS despite what others may say
","Twilight was extremely popular with romantics and teenage college crowd including housewives. Loving SciFi and Romance I gave it a shot being a movie lover since forever. My daughter had read the books and loved it and I trusted her taste being a Christian. I was hooked. Kristen Stewart makes the series, but the casting crew did an outstanding job. From Alice's perky personality to Jasper always looking like he's in pain I was really impressed. Having seen thousands of movies from all era's Its hard to move me or surprise me this series of movies did just that. I had to watch it several times to catch some things. My wife is much more observant than I am but she still has not seen them. I think she's afraid she might like them. I was an Edward fan, but Jacob is hard to dislike. Each character is perfectly played and the dialog intriguing. You will experience a full range of emotion from laughing out loud to feelings of loss and empathy for each character. It will tick you off and make you smile. Don't go in with any expectations and let the movie take you on a great ride into fantasy and friendship and family and you name it. Be a man watch it. Even if by remote chance you don't think its great at least you can finally talk about it intelligently when you hear someone reference the movie or its referenced in another movie or trivia game. I just watch Kristen's movie Equals and was impressed again. I may be a sucker for SciFi and Romance, but though many said it was predictable don't believe it for a moment."

"chieb","10","3","9","6 February 2009"," Loved the movie, look forward to a better movie in New Moon
","The movie was beautifully cast with very talented actors who worked with what they had. The screenplay left much to be desired. Rob Pattinson and Kristen Stewart - in fact every cast member was incredible - was the strongest part of the movie. The chemistry between Rob & Kristen is unbelievable - and as one reviewer said - he'd be surprised if they didn't get together some day (me too!!). There is no-one else who could play these characters. That being said, Catherine directed this as a teen movie - she had an excellent feel for the high school atmosphere, and Rob and Kristen played some scenes to the hilt - some scenes were so staccato - it definitely left you wanting for more. When Edward jumps on her pick-up, when he brings her to school, when she sees his room for the first time (some of the best scenes in the movie)it's as if Catherine Hardwicke couldn't move on fast enough to the next scene. You want to savor their relationship - enjoy the build-up - her dreaming and talking about him, him being affected by that and you never can. In the book,Bella talks in her sleep all the time and that is a turning point for Edward falling in love with her - for his hope of loving her and they totally dropped it, you rarely see him in her room, in the book it's the backbone of their relationship. They wasted too much time on James (out of town attacks) and having people run up the hill. The baseball scene was well done, as well as Bella and Edward in the treetops. <br/><br/>I know with a bigger budget and some intelligent translation between Stephenies brilliant books and the screenplay - as to what is really important here Edward and Bella and their undeniable connection, you'll satisfy the mature fan base (which I am convinced is the major fan base). These are not just for teens, these books are as mature as any love story out there. Edward and Bella would die for each other and though all of the devotee's out there understand this, the connection was not built up well in the movie at all. Rob & Kristen conveyed that with sheer talent and chemistry - this movie could have been at least 20-30 minutes longer and they could have given this romance it's proper build-up. A Love anyone would give their life for - and that is why people are so crazy for it. I don't know why Catherine Hardwicke was so ashamed of that angle - it's like guys are too, but I've seen plenty of men in the theater - so SOME MEN admit that they might actually be interested in Love.<br/><br/>Robert and Kristin - Edward and Bella personified, both extremely talented, gifted people - and I can only wait, with extreme anticipation for the three sequels coming up - each better than the last! They are so lucky, these films will be the best films they ever do, roles of a lifetime, their Titanic, their Braveheart, their Romeo and Juliet - it's unfortunate that the great roles happen so early, but what an opportunity and Kristen and Rob have it - in the palm of their hands. These books have sold millions and there is a reason why - Hope -we all want what Edward and Bella have, perfect, indivisible, Love."
"thailova","10","3","9","22 January 2009"," Loved it
","I saw this movie before reading the book and thought it was wonderful. The books however, are even more incredibly good than this movie, although I think it got most of the story in. What you have to think about when seeing a movie based on a novel, you must accept that a book can go on and on, while a movie needs a timeframe. shrinking all those pages down to a movie isn't easy, I think it's caught some of the essence though I will agree that it doesn't capture it all. All in all, I think it was a very beautiful movie. The romance is way more deep in the books, to that I agree, but I was a smitten kitten throughout the movie =) Just enjoy it for what it is, I say."

","I thought it was fantastic! Robert and Kristin have great chemistry and i love how it left you wondering what they were thinking. Also The score was brilliant for the movie i bought both albums and i love them! However i did think the glittery skin part was a bit much that isn't how Stephanie Meyer's made it sound in the book but for the budget they had i give them an A+..I mean a budget of 38 million to make a movie with vampires.... they did good job. I loved it and have yet to meet a person i introduced it to not to feel the same way. Matter of fact most of them started reading the books b\c of it. Bottom line is it's a cult classic movie it isn't going away so deal with the beauty that is Twilight!!!"

"Legendre0226","10","3","9","31 December 2008"," Not your typical teenage love story....
","I didn't know what Twilight was about when I first saw the previews for it. I honestly thought it was just another romantic movie. There was just so much talk about it, I saw it EVERYWHERE: posters, the books, trailers, ads, and merchandise. <br/><br/>I finally gave in and decided to go see it with my sister. By the time the movie was over, I came out a fan. Now, I'm completely obsessed with it. I was truly surprised.<br/><br/>Many people say the graphics or make up or whatever else could have been better, but under the circumstances of only having about $30 million to go off of is not bad. It could have never been made at all. This movie is mainly about love, its not an action movie so who cares if the main fight scene wasn't as good as some people wanted. <br/><br/>While watching the movie the actors displayed emotions that many of us have experienced. Many of us can relate. The actors came through in that, it's as though they truly felt that way.<br/><br/>It seems as though in this generation, any teen movie or even any movie anymore has some sort of unnecessary ""love"" scenes of any type. Like they have to have a kiss that is 'out of control', or the girls wear skimpy out-fits and 'rub' on a guy, or scenes that imply them going to or having sex. There is always a love interest even though it's the smallest bit of detail in the story. <br/><br/>What I like about the movie Twilight is it's so deep, yet it's clean. The girls dress like typical girls in high school, having crushes, and going on dates. There isn't extra scenes with other couples making out in the background or the Cullens wearing skimpy outfits to imply visually that they are extremely beautiful. <br/><br/>I know that later on in Breaking Dawn, there is (sex), but it's not like it was just put in because it would draw an audience. It just went with the story and how Stephanie Meyer wrote it. <br/><br/>I absolutely love the movie, it's definitely top on my list."
"laurenmorgan85","10","3","9","26 November 2008"," My Twilight review
","Critics have been giving lukewarm reviews of Twilight for a lack of action, blood and gore. My question to them is ""Have you read the books?"" The book is a love story about a girl who falls in love with a boy who happens to be a vampire and the obstacles they need to overcome. Granted the movie wasn't perfect but with a budget of only 37 million, I think they did a darn good job representing the book, also the movie has Stephenie's blessing. Does it follow the book precisely, no, but what book to movie adaption ever does? The movie stays true to the essence of the characters and the story. If they fit the whole book into the movie, that would be a four hour movie, now, being an avid Twilight fan, I wouldn't have minded that one bit.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes in the movie where I felt the actors could have enunciated their lines a bit more clearly, also some of the ""glowering"" scenes were a bit over the top being laughed at by the audience. But was that the fault of Rob overacting or Catherine's fault for lack of direction? (maybe I should try to glower with orange contacts in my eyes) I felt the movie flowed well with the bit of tweaking done from book to script. I would have liked to see the part at the caf√©' in Port Angeles where Bella tells Edward to stop dazzling people and him asking her if he dazzles her to which her answer is ""Frequently"" If you read Midnight Sun on Stephenie Meyer's website that is a pivotal turn for Edward. I felt that was important.<br/><br/>When Edward enters the sunlight, it has more of a glittery look. Perhaps a better look would have been that of an opal with the rainbows reflecting off him? (I saw on another post site that several people agreed with my opal look for the vampires) I could have done without the ""sparkle"" sound affect in the movie. Tell me, does a Swarovski crystal make a sound when it catches the sunlight and sparkles? I just thought it was a cheesy addition.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see Edward dedicate Bella's lullaby to her and hear it in its pure form, just the piano, Edward and Bella.<br/><br/>The kiss scene in Bella's room was so electric you could feel the tension building in your own body and when their lips finally consummated their love... WOW! There is definitely a powerful chemistry between these two actors bringing more to this movie than if they didn't.<br/><br/>I liked the scenes of James' coven hunting bringing more depth to the ""bad"" vampires. Collecting mementos from their prey was brilliant.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it for what it is. A book to movie adaption and a getaway from the real world for two hours that I liked VERY much."
"moezoe1989","10","3","9","23 November 2008"," Not that bad, but could have been better
","Overall it was a good film. From what I heard, people who did not read the book(s) thought that it was a great film. I on the other hand thought that it was not as good as the non-readers say because I read the books.<br/><br/>The only complaint that I have is that there was a lack of detail to the story and they did not elaborate as much on the characters and their backgrounds as much as they could have. Other than that I thought that it was a good film. An extra half hour or so could have made it complete and a bit less choppy. I hope that they do that for the next film and focus on the character relationships. The director could have also done a better job of helping with the chemistry between the Bella and Edward, and could have made Edward less stiff and much more apprehensive to the relationship. They also could have included the other characters within the lives of Bella and Edward and how they play into the story and the lives of the two main characters. Maybe a new director for the next film?"
"athena_dab","7","3","9","22 November 2008"," Oh. Umm... Really?
","I'm sorry to say that this was a wasted opportunity for Stephanie Meyer and the Twilight franchise. The books have so much potential to be great movies and unfortunately, Ms. Hardwicke has seemed to miss out on some essential tones from the books. For example, if someone had never read the books, they would wonder why Bella and Edward are so quickly drawn to one another and - even having read the books - their relationship on screen is just...awkward.<br/><br/>When I read the books, the relationship between Bella and Edward drew me in so completely, I felt like I was emotionally involved with their story. (Granted, the writing could have been cleaner, but I'm not going to comment on the books here).<br/><br/>I understand Catherine Hardwicke had to compress about 600 pages into a 2 hour movie, but the movie's audience only gets to see a fraction of the pure *lust* between Edward and Bella - even *I* had trouble sleeping after reading the books. And that leads to my biggest disappointment of the movie - Bella's Lullaby. The melody plays throughout the movie, but the audience has NO idea of the significance! Bella's lullaby comes up on a number of occasions throughout the novels (and no doubt through the movies that will be produced), but Hardwicke chose to skim over the scene at the Cullen's house - truly one of the more memorable chapters in the books. It's a shame that more attention was not given to Bella and Edward's poignant fascination with each other.<br/><br/>I think the real problem with the movie is that you only get the very basics of the story line. You will not see nearly as much character development from the movie as you will from the books. After a start like this, it's very hard to imagine how the other three movies will manage to hold any type of significance.<br/><br/>Having said that, people *will* see the other three movies.<br/><br/>When I saw Twilight in theatre, there was a group of teenage girls behind me who actually *squeeled* and giggled with Edward's first appearance on screen. You can't escape the success of this franchise, built from the novels. As I mentioned, the other movies will be made; let's just hope the writers and directors learn a lesson from a somewhat dismal beginning."
"jamalk-1","10","3","9","22 November 2008"," Best Movie!!!
","I honestly walked into this movie thinking it was going to be mediocre. This movie far exceeded my expectations, I loved it. It was unexpectedly funny and actually followed the book somewhat. The actors were also unexpectedly really good and played out there parts quite well. The best part for me was the biology scene it was so funny because Edward looked truly repulsed, and disgusted at the site of Bella. I would highly recommend anyone to watch this movie! The scenic view was absolutely beautiful, stunning if I may add. Wow! how beautiful Forks, Washington is I would like to go there sometime just because of how this movie made it look.

All day, people were nagging me about how it got awful reviews and was ""the worst movie ever made"". I went into the theatre not knowing what to expect, and what I got was a wonderful movie experience, filled with fright, squeals, sighs, and a surprising amount of laughter. All the fan girls loved it, and I even caught the skeptical teen guys who were dragged there by friends or girlfriends (guiltily) enjoying themselves. It never leaves you bored, and strayed away from the book at the perfect amount- to follow and be riveted by the plot, but not ruining the book with too much Hollywood. I hope this movie does very well, and I can't wait for the sequels! It is a cinematic experience not to be missed!"

I laughed at some of the parts a couple of times...such as the facial expressions on Edwards face, some of the cheesy lines, and the interesting choice of visual effects. But overall, it was great.<br/><br/>That was only the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>I then read the book and began comparing the movie to the book. It was amazing how absolutely wrong I was about the movie. The book sort of completed everything and pulled all the pieces and emotions together. I then went to go see the movie once more with a die hard fan of the series and almost felt embarrassed at the fact that I had told her only a week before how amazing the movie was! I really did feel ashamed for what I had said and sure enough, she was completely disappointed and I felt like I didn't do my job at warning her before we saw it.<br/><br/>We both agree: the visual effects and the poor writing were the biggest downfalls of the movie. I almost want to cry because I feel so bad for the author of the books and also for the die hard fans. I think my 7 year old cousin could write a better script and make better visual effects.<br/><br/>I really hope they decide to take their time on the sequels and do it right. I heard that they fired the director? I hope so! That would be the only way you could get me to see the following movies...considering I will be reading the rest of the books within that time!"

","This movie is laughable. Bad dialogue, bad acting, cheesy (though entertaining) special effects. Teenage girls will love it, though, because Stephenie Meyer wrote a trashy romance novel and made it into a teenage fantasy film just for them. It's just a shame ""grown"" women are obsessed with it as well."

","Being the first part, as expected it was informative enough. But as the movie progresses; it digs deep into the theme:how the two get together. And very soon the audience will have no doubt in them being a couple.The remarks about the film are almost positive. The audience will be satisfied about how the fantasy that surrounded the film's theme was portrayed. My honest opinion is I am fine with the film because the entirety of it was not shown in the first part itself. I started loving it after watching 3 parts. But the soul of the film and how the characters carried it step by step was the one thing that got me attracted to it. Despite average performances, the film was good enough for me. It will be so much enjoyable for anyone who can appreciate pure love and the characteristics it has. I seriously recommend the film even though it isn't satisfying enough because as you go through the further parts; you will savor every moment and this films helps you in that experience."

","I'm very analytical and moreover I also need mental stimulation and this move kept me interested. It can't be too much speaking or I can possibly lose interest. But, on the other hand, sometimes, I can watch a movie with a lot of speaking it, depending on my mood and the time of day I'm watching the movie. Normally those are the movies that I will set aside to watch on a late night or early morning because I know that it is gonna need my undivided focus in order to keep up.
However, I believe that Twilight has just the right balance in their dialogue pitch, allowing it to be watched any time of the day, because even if you do miss something, you wont feel lost. You can just jump right in! and feel like you're part of the movie.
This one has been added to my many movie collections that I can watch over, and over again.
But, I would like to know one thing...What is it that Edward smell on Bella when she entered the classroom and walked past the fan? This made me wonder if it was just her special scent or if she was possibly on her menstruation???"

","Twilight is garbage. I'm not sure if there's been a film that I have cared less about. Like, I'm not even sure how to do a review; I guess I will list some of the blatant negatives, and maybe near the end I can scavenge for some redeemable quality.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I was so bored. I couldn't make it in one sitting; I had to take 2 breaks so that I didn't fall asleep. Now that I am typing that, I am regretting I didn't just sleep through it. I mean, I understand movies galore have an expositional setup for the first 15 minutes before getting into the meat of the film. Considering these vampires that drink the blood of animals are vegetarians, there's no meat on the bones of the film. To get a little more specific, as soon as Bella enters school halfway through the semester, everybody flocks to her and seems to know her already. Why?? I don't know! And to think that Edward would be compelled to Bella over Anna Kendrick may be the most glaring fault of all. Plus, the dialogue that goes on - and the directing with it-- is the least realistic thing I have ever seen. Nobody acts like they do. And I'm definitely looking at you Kristen Stewart, you sighing, breathing, half-laughing introvert you. For a girl that enjoys being alone, you spend the entire film with other people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I was able to release a couple of chuckles at the movement of the vampires. Oh man, it was so cheesy...<br/><br/><br/><br/>And they shine bright like a diamond.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seriously, what was this movie even about? I was about to dedicate this paragraph to the plot, but I have nothing to tell. If I wasn't zoning out at points in the film, I wish I was.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There's no motivation for the film, and it uses about 1 hour and 30 minutes to build a bond between the leads, establish friendships and villains, and put hints at conflicts to come; but really, it was just pointless because I didn't believe any of it. But Bella did. Oh, Edward, you've been watching me in my sleep for the past couple of months? That's cool. Before Bella figures out what Edward and his family really are, she pointlessly asks so many questions. It turns out she's right to have been questioning of everything, but she would've been an obsessed crazy person in any other normal situation - correction, in any other situation. Also, the first 45 minutes of gazing into Edward's eyes at school? I'm not sure if it was supposed to be mysterious or intimate, but it was just weird and uncomfortable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'd like to end on some sort of a high note. You somewhat find it in Bella's dad. I honestly believe he was the only rational character in the whole film. So kudos to you, Pops.

It is clearly aimed at the girl market but what's so wrong about that. I see that it has a poor IMDb rating but this is based purely on blokes voting it a 1 without seeing it, a clear case of voting snobbery.

"ttapola","3","2","5","6 March 2011"," Birth of the Wicked
","Yet another movie the bad reputation of which arrived before its theatrical premiere and also a movie that after reading enough unfavorable reviews I decided to wait for to see until I'd be able to catch it on TV for free. Surprisingly, it turned out not be Bottom 100 material like Meet the Spartans, the TV premiere of which I sadly caught a while ago. However, by no means is this a good movie either. And I approached it with an open mind.<br/><br/>Most negative *criticism* directed towards this movie is deserved. One of the most common is lousy acting. Now, when this was made, the main cast were all nobodies, so it was easy to blame director Hardwicke, especially as she handles the acting-free sequences so amateurishly. But, *who* do we have among the cast? <br/><br/>Sarah Clarke - we definitely know she can act. Ironically, though she practically has about as much roles done at the time of filming than the others put together, her part is a blink-an-you'll-miss-it. I guess proved talent costs.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Reaser - another veteran, charismatic and likable, whose work on Grey's Anatomy was really good and whose own TV series, The Ex List, was unjustly canceled. Not surprisingly, she too has a very small part.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick - a mere year later proving in Up in the Air that she has the talent and it cannot possibly have developed in one year, thus vindicating herself of this mess.<br/><br/>Ashley Greene - among all the woodenness, she too struggles against the bland script and manages to convey that she's not hopeless like the utterly talentless, and worse, charisma-free Stewart and Pattinson.<br/><br/>Like Stewart and Pattinson, Lautner shows no talent either, but at least he has charisma that combined with his abs should guarantee him work for at least a decade. Frak, he could develop from beefcake into a serious actor just like Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is so flat it isn't even unintentionally funny - except for the Bad Guys, who are laughable walking clich√©s. Even their entrance proper during the baseball game is laughable! Sure, the movie is based on a cheap, sanitized, dumbed-down, marketable-for-teens rip-off of the Sookie Stackhouse books by Charlaine Harris, so screenwriter Rosenberg cannot perform miracles on Meyer's weak source material. But it's really shocking how bad Burwell's music is, considering he already had in his accomplished CV the scores for, among others, No Country for Old Men, Adaptation., Three Kings, Being John Malkovich and The Big Lebeowski. Together with the ill-judged pop music songs it only serves to amplify the movie's weaknesses. Maybe Burwell wasn't inspired by the imagery and created music that would be on par with the other aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>There is one thing many of the movie's critics are wrong about: vampires and daylight. The original myth and Bram Stoker's book Dracula tell of vampires being able to walk in sunlight. The ""sunlight kills"" was Hammer Horror films' so pervasive an addition to the ""rules"" that most people cannot be but baffled if they see a vampire in sunlight. So, at least Twilight gets something right.<br/><br/>In the end, however, what we have here is a sluggish, less-than-average 3/10 movie that is just a waste of time. It's not painful like Meet the Spartans, but it isn't even close to being a Harry Potter, either, let alone The Lord of the Rings."

"RResende","Null","2","5","6 November 2010"," romanticism
","This was actually a very good surprise. I was prepared to hate this film. The books appeared as half-baked teen stuff, empty and just made to capitalize on the doors to otherworldliness as Harry Potter defined it to the XXI century: strange beings, odd variations on our real world, and a link to this same world, that makes the story and characters appear as if they could really exist, thus engaging more the audiences to whom this is intended. This Twilight series had an extra dullness that put me away: it revolved on the ""fantasy"" clich√©s, and to that, added the vampire film world. So it was playing safe twice.<br/><br/>The one thing that truly fails is the male character casting. Robert Pattinson is a stain here, he has no presence whatsoever. He throws his lines as if he was sitting in a toilet, his facial expression is bloodless, but not in a vampiresque fashion, his pose is artificial, although that works for his character (lucky there). I think they wanted to capitalize the actor who had had a short yet emotional character in the Potter series, and thus attract even more of the audiences of Potter. On the other hand, Kristen Stewart was a nice surprise. I don't know if she'll get out well of the teen movie world, but i'll be wanting to watch new things from her. She was tense in an unstressed way that usually we don't have in such young actresses.<br/><br/>But what i did like was the general mood chosen to this film. There is a very sweet and tense sense of romanticism that goes through the film, and that's what really caught my attention. It's a genuinely not corny melancholy, where the growing adolescent feelings between vampire and human take a sweet place at the center of the narrative. Regular readers of my comments know and appreciate such films which can convincingly build and sustain a mood, like an invisible glow which surrounds every element of the film. Wong Kar-Wai is the all-time master of this. So i care about trying to understand what produces such effect. Here i think the first anchor of this mood is Stewart and her controlled, intense performance (i wonder if she learned it from Foster). The second anchor is the cinematography and the very well succeeded choice of colors and sets. But the most important thing is the camera work. The hand held camera in the closeups while the lovers have dialogs are really something of superior class. Editing helps, but how the shots were conceived really works well. Some dialog moments are worthy of some bits of some Lumet's films. That is saying a lot.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","The fact that this has become a full blown pop culture phenomenon baffles me to no end, it's not that good. The story is very simple, a moody and pale teenager named Bella Swan from Phoenix, Arizona decides to live with her father for a while in Forks, Washington. Bella seems to draw the other teenagers like flies as they try to be friendly and several of the guys seem to like her. Honestly, this surprises me because Bella is pretty bland. She takes notice in some strange high school students. One of them is Edward Cullen and he and Bella don't seem to getting along. When a car speeds through the parking lot and almost crushes her, Edward just happens to get over there like a bolt of lightning and stop the car with his bare hands. Bella gets curious and tries to get some answers from him about his unique abilities. After another rescue and uncomfortable conversations, she does some research and finds out that he's a vampire, a vampire who sparkles like diamonds in the sunlight rather than burn to a crisp like the vampires of legend, and even though he thirsts for her blood because he and his clan only drink less satisfying animal blood, they fall in love and start going out. The relationship between the two main characters seems to be based on trust, he is protective of her but is always struggling with his desire to drink her blood. Kind of like a drug addict dating crack if you catch my drift.<br/><br/>At times, the movie can actually be kind of romantic or even suspenseful, but the biggest problem with the movie is that it's often pretty boring. Kirsten Stewart's performance as Bella is just bland and often I can't tell what emotion she's trying to convey because she looks nauseous most of the time. Rob Pattinson's performance on the other hand is okay, he's a vampire, over a hundred years old and stuck in a super strong and fast seventeen year old body. You can actually sympathize with him as he struggles to control his blood-lust for the girl he loves. There are other characters that deserve mentioning, the other high school students are painfully overplayed but the less said about them, the better. Taylor Lautner is likable as Jacob Black, an old friend of Bella and member of a Native American tribe, he and his family are actually pretty likable. The bad vampires are pretty cool, especially the sadistic James who wants to feast on Bella. The good vampires are okay but we don't get a whole lot from them. The parents Dr. Carlisle and Esme Cullen are nice, Emmet Cullen is just there, his mate Rosalie Hale is mean, Jasper Hale is the most recent addition to the clan and clearly has to refrain from having Bella for lunch, we may end up being good pals. My favorite character in the entire movie is the spunky Alice Cullen, played by Ashley Greene. she's lively, likable, and totally gorgeous, the kind of girl you'd want to go shopping with, it's a shame she doesn't have a lot to do because she was the best part.<br/><br/>To be honest, I hated this movie the first time I watched it, the second time I watched it months later it actually wasn't quite as painful an experience. Before I wrap this up I should talk about the good things in this movie, and there is some good here. As I said before, the love story can be interesting and after a while I was actually paying attention, the cinematography looks really good and almost dreamlike, the soundtrack is just great, and I'll admit that I kind of liked that cheesy thunderstorm baseball scene. Edward and the other vampires let Bella join them in a game of baseball, who knew watching vampires with superhuman strength and speed playing baseball could be fun. Sadly, this is a movie that isn't that bad but it isn't very good. It has a certain appeal, mostly with annoying adolescent girls who judge their favorite actors by how hot they are and not how talented they are. Overall, it's an almost tolerable movie that has its moments and occasionally tugs a heart string or two, but otherwise is dull, pretentious and suffers from having a thin story that anyone could've come up with. It has it's redeeming qualities from time to time, but not many. I almost have to admit that the whole thing about what vampires can and can't do in this film and the novel isn't that bad, considering it makes their chances of blending in better and other movies mess with what vampires can and can't do. I've yet to read any of the books as I write this and I'm tired of all the girls raving about it. If you try to enjoy it for the cheesy vampire chick flick that it is, you may enjoy it a little, or you may go head over heels for it, whatever floats your boat."

"Rucarlos","3","2","5","11 December 2009"," A film so bad that it seems like something out of the Twilight Zone
","NOTE: This review is based on the movie alone. I have never read any of the books, so DON'T consider this as an evaluation to the story, but of what you get from the film alone.<br/><br/>From the first moment I knew I wouldn't love this movie, but after seeing dozens of people talking about how great it was, I thought that maybe this was something good after all. Well, after a very boring Saturday afternoon, I can only say that once again I got a lesson to trust my instinct over the hype of a audience that yet doesn't know how to tell a good film from a sad attempt to make a quality drama.<br/><br/>Starting with the acting, sorry I meant line reading, because even for unexperienced actors this was the most atrocious attempt of personification ever. After so many people said how Kristen and Robert where a perfect match on screen I managed to confirm this, as they where the absolute worst acting couple I have seen in my life! Good thing that sometimes if you join two things that aren't very good you'll get something great in the end. Bella managed to spend the whole film looking like a depressed, suicidal,antisocial and annoying teen incapable of showing any emotion at all! It's like she had severe facial paralysis for the whole duration of the movie! And how about dear old Robert? Well I admit that he was pretty good comparing to what Kristen was doing but yet he left me thinking what the hell was really going on inside Edward's head and what did he really wanted, specially facing Bella. Was he really attracted to her or to her blood, why didn't he want her to become a vamp even after she begged him to? Why did he almost tried to shoved her away just to keep stalking her day and night? Fortunately, and surprisingly, some of the secondary actors managed to deliver a more consistent work and save the movie of being as dull as Kristen's expression.<br/><br/>Now the screenplay was as rich and evolved as a teletubbies episode, and the pace of the story was so difficult to understand, that it seamed as something out of the Twilight Zone. Full of stuff that leaves you just thinking ""why is that?"". Why does he like her and she likes him? Why isn't Bella capable of showing any affection towards anyone(except Edward) during the whole movie? Why did that rogue vampire made his life purpose to suck out Bella's blood? Why doesn't Edward just turn her into a vampire if she just hates having a normal human life? why? why? why? Why is this awful movie so popular after all?<br/><br/>Resuming, this may have been the greatest cinematic mistake of 2008, from all parts involved- director, writers, actors and specially the audience, to encourage this disgrace. But something I have to admit is that Kristen and Robert really share a good connection when they are together, a sort of perfect for each other, imperfect for everyone else. And that is where my 3 stars come from. The Best: The chemistry between the main couple. The Worst: The acting, the screenplay and comprehensibility of the story for someone who hasn't read any of the books"
"Bobby747","3","2","5","30 October 2009"," Hype saved this movie
","This movie to me was laughably bad. As if we needed another vampire movie let alone another vampire novel!<br/><br/>The only thing that kept me watching this movie was that I was laughing the entire time. The acting was generally substandard and the scriptwriting was a poor adaptation of an already mediocre novel. The only good acting job I had found was Peter Facinelli as Dr. Carlisle Cullen. His part (the classic role of the patriarch vampire teaching those he had turned) was played very well in the whole pursuit of, ""making the fantasy believable,"" that has always been a primary concern for fantasy writers.<br/><br/>Another element that I did not mind and that was Cam Gigandet's portrayal of James, which was a throwback to the Lost Boys. This is also likely credited to the director Catherine Hardwicke. <br/><br/>I thought visually, Pattinson was a good choice for the role of Edward, but I found Edward to be not only pass√©, but a very weak character (the compassionate vampire who thinks and acts like a depressed teen, and not the 80-90 something year old vampire he is supposed to be)in the movie. It appeared as though what was supposed to make us believe he was that old were simple visual strategies of books and graduation caps in his home, while the acting seemed very one dimensional. Whether it is the writing or the acting that failed to deliver is still unclear to me, but I am leaning towards the writing. My reasoning is it seems Stephenie Meyer ripped the character ""Louis,"" from Anne Rice's novel ""Interview With The Vampire,"" turned him into a boy and created ""Edward.""<br/><br/>Bella was played by Kristen Stewart, who seemed to be playing her part. The anxiety riddled teenage girl who deals with her nerves by retracting socially and showing little emotion. The only problem is that when you do connect with someone like that, they open up and often beam with personality, and when she was connected with, she still didn't open up. There is an extreme duality in a person like that, and Bella appears to be more of a psychopath than an anxious and confused teen. This is apparent to myself in the scenes where she is interacting with Edward and emotions are addressed directly but not expressed in other than words and transparently forced gestures.<br/><br/>The fact that they are adapting the sequel is a testament to the notion that even bad movies and okay novels can be successful if you market them correctly. I would not be surprised if the sequel were to flop."

","It's slick. It's glossy. And sometimes it's so bright it *sparkles*. But like the ""vegetarian"" vampires (they subsist on animal blood, not human) that rest at the center of its story, ""Twilight"" is also pretty bland. Even for a story about the walking undead, the film itself is just as lacking in any sort of dramatic pulse. I have not read Stephenie Meyer's books, but by the end of ""Twilight""'s distended running time (clocking in at just over 2 hours), I felt that I had borne witness to a hatchet-job adaptation, where everything revolves around star-crossed lovers Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson). She's a shy girl moving in with her sheriff father in the rainy Northwestern town of Forks, WA; he's an elite member of a pale-faced clan of ageless vampires, whose hormones run in conjunction with his innate predatory lust toward Bella. While ""Twilight"" isn't a boring film, its lack of pathos and underdeveloped supporting characters leaves a lot to be desired: vampires have been portrayed as sexy, repulsive, aristocratic, and natural born charmers, but the overbearing ""sex is bad, abstinence is good"" philosophy at work here all but fizzles any potential excitement, which is a shame, because Stewart and Pattinson (despite a pretty equal share of awkward beats and line readings) make for an interesting couple. Director Catherine Hardwicke does a fine job establishing the gloomy setting, but fails to integrate special effects convincingly, or create a palpably exciting climactic showdown; and Melissa Rosenberg's (who has written many great episodes of Showtime's character-driven ""Dexter"") script treats anything outside the Bella/Edward union as a distraction, leading to undercooked backstories, motivations, and a central ""villain"" whose screen time is so fleeting his presence barely registers at all. It's a shame, really: vampires have been at the center of much great art through the years; the notion of sunlight causing these pale bloodless suckers to *sparkle* instead of burn to a crisp is probably making Bram Stoker roll in his grave."

","Reading a small part of a plot I thought: A vampire film? Not my kind. About teenagers? Worse. With a romance? Grrrhhh...<br/><br/>It turned out my prejudices were wrong. Despite some flaws ""Twilight"" is a very good film. I realized there is a series of books but don't consider reading them. As I said vampire stories are not my kind. I liked the film because it doesn't focus on the thrill. There is balanced dose of romance and even a pinch of humor. It is not difficult to foresee the story and the actions of the characters but it is not boring. <br/><br/>As a result ""Twilight"" deserves watching it and I am happy I didn't ignore it."
"ceche","8","2","5","10 October 2009"," Lavish adaptation
","Sorry boys, but this is not just another ""chick flick""! Director Catherine Hardwicke floors the accelerator to get to what is probably the most interesting aspect of Stephanie Meyer's novel and also the main focus of Melissa Rosenberg's script: the riveting and unbearable sexual tension between the star-crossed lovers, both desperately yearning for each other but, at the same time, forced not to embrace with the kind of intensity which is customary for lovers all around the world. A lot of reviews have underlined the theme of chastity, while taking into consideration the fact that the literary source is not immune from the author's Mormon beliefs: personally, I found the dynamic between the two main characters very refreshing, even more so because the script cuts right to the chase, managing to avoid a rather substantial portion of the mushy banter devised by Meyer. The awkwardness surrounding Edward and Bella makes their relationship thrilling and fascinating, while allowing a drop of sweet, uncompromising romance to slip through. Fear is a strong motivational force for both lovers, who struggle in order to achieve different ends, but the pursuit of eternal love is an equal contender which shatters their feeble resolve. Once we've established that, are we to regard Edward and Bella as heroic figures? Personally, I don't think there's anything ""typical"" about their love story, a fact which brings me to my next crucial point: even though there is an epic resonance to the story, the main tone of the film is profoundly introspective, in line with the director's idea of what makes a good story. Therefore, I wouldn't qualify the two main characters as heroes, but rather as people who are compelled to make heroic choices to catch a glimpse of a wonderful and apparently unreachable dream. Rosenberg's subtle and pondering analysis manages to hit the right cord and feel honest, also thanks to Hardwicke's non-intrusive focus on the characters' feelings, without sacrificing too much of the other characters by giving each one of them a well-defined first introduction. I must say I'm not too keen on the choice of Nikki Reed as Rosalie, but it's an impression that comes from having read the book before seeing the film, so I won't bring any arguments to the table just yet. Elliot Davis's empathic cinematography adds a lot to the feel of the story, as does Carter Burwell's low-key score, a fusion of classical and rock, even though the latter seems at times misplaced. It has been announced that the ""Twilight"" team will continue working together (production is due to start next March) on the second chapter of Meyer's saga, ""New Moon"": hopefully its trickier structure won't influence the final result. My hopes are certainly up."
"whatever_123","2","2","5","4 September 2009"," my opinion has changed
","When I wrote my previous review, I was too generous in rating this movie. I am speaking as a former Twilight fan; this movie was awful. It messed up the novel it was based on.<br/><br/>Also, this movie sends out a really bad version of Disney's reoccurring theme: that if you sit back and wait, your Prince Charming will come and sweep you off your feet. Why Edward fell in love with Bella in the first place is COMPLETELY illogical. <br/><br/>Who is Bella? A girl from Arizona, with a plain appearance, dull voice, no special talents, and no personality. She is a moving wooden puppet, or maybe just a moving wooden block. She is the flattest, and most uninteresting character ever to appear on the big screen. So, along comes this gorgeous, strong, fast, romantic, smart, vampire guy and he just falls for her? Just like that? What exactly does Bella have to offer in the relationship? Nothing... well, except for skull-numbing drama involving Edward's struggle to control his lust for her blood, and Bella's fragile human nature. Really, Edward and Bella's love isn't LOGICAL. It doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Now, relating to the book, the movie did an okay job of following the plot, but later it gets messed up. Edward and Bella's first kissing scene was really awkward. First off, Edward appears in her room suddenly, and the creepily tells Bella that he frequently sneaks in her room at night to watch her sleep. Totally weird. On top of that, Bella is only wearing a T-shirt and underwear the whole time they are kissing. AWKWARD. What was preventing her from wearing pajama pants? Anyway, another scene in the movie completely screwed up the same scene in the book. Yes, I'm talking about the meadow scene. It was supposed to be magical, a teenage girl's fantasy, but all I saw was Bella and Edward randomly walking out of school to stand around in the woods and discuss Edward's true nature. He shows off his SPARKLY skin (ugh), which looked more like they used a computer to put a bunch of blurry diamond shapes on his face. Later, they lie on the ground sort-of next to each other and just.... stare at each other. What kind of love scene is that?? Bella, this whole time, shows maybe the tiniest hint of emotion, while Edward's face is completely over-exaggerated.<br/><br/>Really, I don't understand what went wrong here. Maybe it was the director. Maybe it was Kristen Stewart's dreadful acting. Maybe it was Edward's ""sparkly"" skin. This movie isn't worthwhile. Teenage girls need to realize that life isn't a fairytale, and it certainly isn't a vampire drama fantasy. There is another person out there for all of us, but it never EVER happens like this. (Well as far as I know, it doesn't happen.) People, get some brains. Make some good movies for us, please."
"stripeddtegris","7","2","5","15 June 2009"," Pros and Cons
","I have probably read the book a good dozen times, and went to see the movie on opening night. I have also reviewed the movie for a film class, as well as multiple times afterward. And with saying all that, I feel confident in my critic of the movie.<br/><br/>Pros; The screenplay lived up to expectation, I realized that not every single detail of Edward's perfection would not and could not be portrayed in the movie, but the script did a nice job dealing with the task of telling the story from a third-person perspective.<br/><br/>Lighting and costuming were nice and fitting. Each of the characters were thought out and planned to the most minor of details.<br/><br/>I liked the extra splash of humor thrown into the mix, such as Edward's reaction to Bella's scent. I also found it a bit humorous for myself that they added in the line ""You are a strong, independent woman,"" when Bella was talking to Angela about asking Eric to prom. The reason this makes me laugh is because I have read so many anti-Twilight blogs complaining about Bella's ""submissiveness"" and total lack of ""female strength and self-reliance."" Cons; Not. Long. Enough. If they had made it even half an hour longer, they probably could have stopped focusing so much on Bella and Edward's awkward excuse for relationship progression, and tapped into the other characters. In the book, Carlisle's story, as well as Alice's and Esme's are touched on as well as Jasper's power (which was completely skipped over). But unfortunately, besides Edward, the other Cullens remained one-dimensional throughout the film.<br/><br/>My biggest qualm; Rosalie. Am I the only one that thinks Catherine Hardwicke was more than just a little bit biased when choosing the actress to play Rosalie? And I don't think there was a shortage of attractive, talented blonde bombshells that auditioned for the role."
"kellyfacebook1","3","2","5","8 June 2009"," Can't remember seeing one set of fangs!
","I have just watched Twilight for the first time and I must say I'm peed off. This is due to the fact I decided to treat myself to a Blu-Ray player on the weekend and had to find a film to watch on it. There wasn't anything that I didn't already have on normal DVD other than this. God how I wish I'd never bothered! Forevermore my first tentative steps into the world of high-def will be forever tainted by this film.<br/><br/>I have to be honest and say I've never read the books (and never will have any desire to) and other than the hype surrounding this film that I was somewhat aware of I had no idea what to expect from the world of Twilight. So how would I sum this film up? Boring! Painfully boring! I spent close to two hours essentially watching a bloke stare and his navel and furrow his brow (I think he thinks that conveys intensity) and a girl mumble her lines. I think the screenwriters wanted to create a tortured, Byron-esquire type figure with Edward Cullen but he actually comes across as a common, everyday, sullen teenager, I truly think that you could have taken out the whole vampire element of the movie as it seems just latched on. Then you have Kristen Stewarts character of Bella Swan; plain, disinterested, inarticulate (crack a smile once in a while love). Why anyone would so desperately want her, be it vampire or otherwise, is beyond my comprehension. And that's a major problem for me as I would class myself as being a rather cynical person, a realist. I just can't believe that crazy, intense love thing the actors were trying to convey exists in real life. It would take a brilliant performance for me to buy in to it. Unfortunately I didn't.<br/><br/>What is the deal with these ""vampires"" anyway? They happily stroll around in sunlight as in the world of Twilight (i.e. completely ignore vampire lore) this doesn't kill them but rather shows off the lame body glitter effect their skin is meant to have. What that brings to the story I have no idea. Also where are there fangs, an essential bit of vampire kit? But don't worry cos their eyes can change colour for no reason whatsoever. And why is a hundred-plus year old vampire chasing a seventeen year old? I know he looks that age too but...well he's not. And that was a key flaw in this film. None of these centuries old creatures had any wisdom behind their eyes that comes from being around for a while (see Interview with the Vampire). Edward may as well have just been seventeen.<br/><br/>Twilight has a few good moments. The fight scene at the end was enjoyable although having to sit through the rest of the film to get to it it wasn't much of a payoff.<br/><br/>Basically the whole premise of Twilight isn't aimed at people like me, a 29 year old man from the UK. However, if you're a 13-15 year old girl from America with an Anne Rice fixation you'll love this soppy nonsense. Me? I'm gonna keep watching my vampires get their heads chopped off by Wesley Snipes."
"galensaysyes","4","2","5","17 May 2009"," Where were the grups?
","The first impression this movie left was that it was a cheap, third-rate movie, with a director and actors of the calibre one would expect at that level. Then I learned that the same director had done ""The Nativity Story,"" which I thought a beautiful film, and that the actor playing the lead vampire had played a good part in the Harry Potter movies, where he showed at least as much of elegance and charm as that series required. And from a chance shot in a featurette on the DVD, I got a breathtaking view of the Washington forests which reminded me of how gorgeous they are. Their power never comes across in the movie; the lead vampire seems ugly and tacky; the direction, bumbling and limp. Clearly, something went wrong.<br/><br/>Whatever it was, it's evident from the very start. The first thing we hear is a girl's monologue about the coolness of dying, or something to that effect, and the first thing we see is...a fawn's behind. Why? Is the fawn's butt talking to us? Is the fawn a symbol of death? I guess not, because it scampers away. It doesn't like to hear stuff about death? This kind of unwitting comedy recurs throughout the movie. Everyone involved with it seems to have lost her capacity for detecting the absurd. For instance, take a look at the lead vampire's expressions when he's seized with a sudden attack of bloodlust. It looks like he has to puke. Or look at the scene where he sucks on his girlfriend to save her life and his ""dad"" tries to get him to stop but he can't because he likes sucking too much. This is a set-up for a ""Seinfeld"" scene; imagine George at the girl's throat.<br/><br/>As the story develops, it started to seem awfully familiar--and I realized I was watching a WB show from the 90s (for an audience who's probably too young to remember what the WB was). More specifically, I'm watching ""Roswell,"" with vampires--and worse actors. The kids who are ""different,"" the boy saving the girl's life and revealing his powers in doing so, the others blaming him for putting them all at risk, etc. And with the resemblance, you see how poorly developed this situation is by comparison. For instance, in ""Roswell"" an evil alien was committing murders that incriminated the good ones; and so in this one with a trio of evil vampires. But in ""Roswell"" the sheriff believed in aliens and had his suspicions of the kids already, so was ready to attribute the crimes to them. In this movie, that possibility is very remote. First the sheriff would have to believe that there are vampires, then that the kids are vampires, then that they did the crimes.... The suspense is nil.<br/><br/>Of course the movie also swipes from ""Buffy,"" ""Angel,"" and all the other good-bad vampire sagas. But in this movie the good vampires are only good, which eliminates one of the three main reasons we'd be interested in them, and also keeps them from being scary--eliminating the second reason. And finally--the third reason--they're not sexy. Partly this is because they're given unattractively pasty make-ups--and not very attractive make-ups generally--but partly it's because the actors aren't sexy to begin with. And neither is the human heroine, so that the teen lovers (which is to say, movie-teen/non-teen teens) are the most sterile, sexless pair since Frankie and Annette.<br/><br/>And they're hardly vampire-like. Got no fangs, don't avoid sunlight--don't believe crucifixes were ever deployed, this is an agnostic movie. And the powers the vampires do exhibit (super-speed, super-tree-climbing) seem more appropriate to super-werewolves, or super-were-monkeys.<br/><br/>All in all, the director appears to have lost focus on the material. But how? <br/><br/>Another featurette on the DVD shows the director, the writer of the ""novels,"" and several cast members as guests at a comics convention. As each steps on stage, the audience emits a mass squeal. They do the same thing every time one of the guests opens his mouth to answer a question. An audience of little girls, by the sound of it--but in fact interviews show that several were teens or grown women, behaving like little girls.<br/><br/>I think the same thing happened to the film's makers. In the featurette, the director tells how she loved the books and is really excited to be bringing the characters to life on screen. The screenwriter says much the same. The author tells how she's really excited to see the characters come to life. None of them says, ""Omigod!"" or, ""Robert is, like, so cute!"" but their commentary isn't far above that level. It appears their enthusiasm for the books, and thence the movie--that is, their own work--reduced them to fans of themselves and deprived them of the capacity for mature judgment.<br/><br/>So ""Twilight"" is like a movie made by a little girl. The daddy is a big stiff stern man who loves her but doesn't show it. The mommy is a wide-eyed sap who loves her and shows it, but is silly. Also, she's not around, the little girl has to talk to her on cell phone because Mommy left (this is a movie for little girls of divorced parents). The love scenes are sexless because that's how a little girl would imagine them. The vampires aren't creepy because that would be gross. The heroine doesn't have habits like smoking or drinking because those are yucky. And she's the center of everyone's universe, everyone bends over backwards to make her happy, she doesn't have to do anything for herself--and she deserves it. The perfect little-girl fantasy.<br/><br/>The movie needed a grown-up in charge."
"maryannbrown99","3","2","5","9 May 2009"," This movie is horrible! It does not hold a candle to the book!
","This movie should have never been made like this. The director and everyone involved in making/directing this movie should be burned at the stake! The books are WAY better. The characters' ""running"" was so cheesy that I couldn't help but laugh at how absurd it all looked. How the director ever got away with this is mind blowing. I hope the director for New Moon knows how to make a better movie than this past lady. These books are amazing and blow Harry Potter out of the water. Why the first movie wasn't handled similar to the Harry Potter franchise is a travesty. Twilight the movie let me down and made me embarrassed that this movie was the book's representation."
"Homogeek","2","2","5","4 May 2009"," Bella is no Potter
","This was an after-school special disguised as a theatrical release. I understand that the books were better but I still have to believe, juvenile. The movie revolves around Bella a 17 year old that just moved to her father's residence in Fork, Washington (a.k.a. the wettest and cloudiest place in the U.S.) and the Cullen family. The Cullens are good vampires ‚Äì they are 'Vegetarians' as they only eat animals. The bad vampires kill and eat humans. Bella falls in love with a good vampire (well thank God for that) but a baddie has taken a shine to killing her. There has been many spins on vampire legend but this is one of the silliest. Stephenie Meyer tried to do for vampires what J.K. Rowling did for witches, I think she fails. Rowling started with Harry at age 11. Potter fans mature with the books and Potter himself. Meyer has Belle at 17 and ready for an endless life with Edward (Cullen). Edward refuses to turn Bella and wants her to have a long life with him. Apparently Edward has not thought about what Bella is going to do in 10 years and is still dating a 17 year old. In 20 years? In 40 years? Yeah, didn't quite think this one through. I think the second movie will be less successful, since adults will not be looking for the next Harry Potter from this franchise."

"MadameGeorge","4","2","5","18 April 2009"," The 'I do not care' Attitude Shows
","I will be the first to admit that when Summit said they were going to bring Twilight to the big screen I was excited. When they announced that Katherine was going to be the director my excitement increased, having seen Thirteen I knew that there was potential there for a movie with bite. I was very disappointed in the movie. <br/><br/>If looking at Twilight as a movie (not taking into consideration the book what so ever) it is awful. There is little character development, suspense or plot. (Granted there is not much plot in the book written by Meyer) I like many others, found myself laughing at parts that WERE NOT suppose to be funny and wishing that Kristen Stewart (who plays Bella) would give me something. I felt like I was watching an episode of a televisions series (insert any name here) that I was wishing would end in the death of all those involved. I mean yeah, Robert Pattinson is not bad to look at, but he must be more than a pretty face. He seemed closed (as he should be) but he never really opens up as a believable boy who has fallen in love for the first time. I spent most of the time wondering why he cares about this girl (Bella) who is average in every way and annoys you with her signs and inability to make you care about her. Let the vampire eat her and that would have been more exciting. <br/><br/>Perhaps I am being to harsh on the producers of this movie (but, there are honestly people out there who thought that this was good? I know it made a lot of money but that does not mean good), but if I were to look at this as a movie, with no previous knowledge of the book, it would maybe get 2 stars, it is awful. I am giving it 4 for the scenery and the music, which was the highlight of the film. <br/><br/>They say sometimes it takes some time to grow into a character, I hope Kristen and Rob can. If not, I fear more disappointment. (Enough of the ""I do not care"" attitude from these two- start caring, your career depends on it- get BETTER)<br/><br/>cheers"

Also there was some serious man-scaping needing to be done in my opinion (my roomie calls it the bushy eyebrow movie!). I liked the girl who plays Bella and the boy who played Jacob, but was pretty disappointed with the rest, which surprised me because I've liked most of the actors in other roles. The lighting was overly bright, I mean ever heard of contrast and balance, jeez. I also found it offensive how dreary they made the northwest appear. I'm NW born and bred and while yeah it does rain a lot, it's still breathtaking. We do have sunshine more than just a couple days out of the year.

"Quesazilla","5","2","5","31 March 2009"," Not a very good film for adults. Teenage girls might like it.
","Oh, to be a teenager again. I have to assume that this is the market for this film. The problem is, I ain't a teenager. This is the love story between a vampire boy and a human girl, and I imagine that if I were a 16 year old girl, I would love this. As it stands, I'm not, and I didn't. This is a ridiculous film that takes itself dead seriously. That's a shame. It could really have done with a sense of fun. I found it dull and boring, and way over-long. The lead actress takes hammy to a new level, but the other performances are adequate, I guess.<br/><br/>It had a few flashes of the better film it could have been, such as when vampire boy's family are on screen. They were all great, and I perked up every time they appeared. Then I settled back down for another thirty minute stretch of endless dialogue that goes nowhere. Also, the score was horrific, and the whole production felt amateurish.<br/><br/>The teenage angst is laid on, super thick. These characters are in PAIN! Oh, the agony. Compare this to the VASTLY superior recent vampire film ""Let the Right One In"", and this film is laughably bad. In that film, the characters are lonely and in emotional pain, and this is expressed with subtlety. This film hits you over the head. It's overwritten and bland. And I hate to say this, but the show Buffy the Vampire Slayer did everything this film does, and they did it way better, and ten years ago. Some scenes were actually directly lifted from very prominent episodes of that show.<br/><br/>And I'm no hater of this franchise. I've never read any of the books, and I actually really wanted to enjoy this film. It was even my idea! My significant other didn't want to see it, but I talked her into it. I should have listened. I honestly can't work out how any adult could be entertained by this. Bland, boring, and it's been done. I wanted a fun, maybe slightly cheesy, epic love story kind of thing, and I got a sullen, depressing, boring slog. They didn't skimp on the cheese, though. A real shame, and disappointment.

","If you haven't read the books, then you may think this movie is great - however the books are a million times better! So much of the movie was changed and flipped around to the extent I felt it jaded the book and all watchers of the movie. Jessica was introduced in the book as dark curly haired, not during a volleyball game as a bubbly straight haired brownish/blonde. Given Bella's demeanor she never would have volunteered to help the girls pick out dresses nor ask to go to Port Angeles to do so! My girlfriends and I went to the midnight opening and purchased the DVD and came home, I was so excited - but feel asleep it was so far off. The best thing the movie has going for it is ""Edward"" - he is some great eye candy to look at (reason I even gave this film a ""3""). The actress portraying Bella obviously hasn't done anything major before, and those in charge of replicating the book details must have skimmed the book. As Bella, Alice, and Jasper are on their way to Phoenix in the Merecedes in bright sunshine, it's amazing! Per the book, they have black tint on all the cars for they can't be in the sun...and speaking of vehicles Rosalee didn't drive a Merecedes, she drove a BMW M3 - huge difference, but so many things like this throughout.

","I'm sorry but I've decided to be quite merciless regarding this movie. I have, once more, committed the mistake of reading the book first... and I do believe it couldn't have been a worse experience watching the movie. I mean where do I start??? The ONLY well cast actors were Bella and her father, perhaps her mother... the rest of them all sucked tremendously. The Cullen family (maybe with the exception of an OK Alice) all were bad actors and the most exposed of the lot, Eddie ""Diggory"" Cullen, was the worst! They were supposed to be a ridiculously beautiful bunch, which they weren't, not even Rosalie (well maybe Alice was cute), and, homossexualities aside, especially not Edward. OK, this could have been a hard movie to cast actors for (although I've seen harder ones), but I expect the actors to at least deliver... which they did not.<br/><br/>The story of course was stupid. The book's plot was already obvious, but they had to smack movie-goers in the face with the story didn't they? ""OH pay attention to the following scene cause it will explain the whole movie while they are jumping from tree to tree WHICH THEY DIDN'T DO IN THE BOOK!"". I'm all pro-adaptations when writing scripts that are based on books: books have a narrator, movies have er.... images! So of course some steps should be taken to adapt them... but changing the entire story?? Stuffing scenes like you would a turkey and changing sceneries just... because?? The school was not as described, the prom was not in the school, the Cullen house could have won a nouveau art award instead of being the classical house it was described as, there was no chase, there was no suspense, there was no sexual crescendo between them, there was nothing!<br/><br/>On a final note: this was an ""MTV"" movie. What do I mean about that? It was an easy-to-watch, quick-to-digest, detail-spurting flick that just corrupted the quite nice book that is Twilight just for the fun of satisfying the legions of teenage girls that love Evanescence and Paramore. I'm surprised the author didn't sue the lot! I was really excited about this one... what a disappointment..."
"rattlesnake_khi","5","2","5","15 March 2009"," Totally Disappointing....
","I am not big fan of the book itself but always thought the movie could be much better. However, the movie disappointed me to the limit. Lets count the bad things about this movie. First of all cast was poor. All of them acted horribly.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart as Bella was completely expressionless. I think shes good at not showing emotions and she has proved it through this movie. It was extremely annoying to see her totally blank face when the scene demanded some powerful display of emotions. Robert Pattinson was equally bad in the beginning. The scene in which Bella for the first time sits in a biology class with Edward was funny due to the hilarious facial expressions of Pattinson. Then the best part was when class ends and he rushes out. In the novel, it was mentioned that there was a grace in his walk but unfortunately in the movie it was completely opposite. However, Pattinson improved a bit in the later stage of the movie.<br/><br/>Second bad thing about the movie was its bad beginning scenes. In the beginning it looked like a B-grade movie. The scenes could not be adopted the way they are in the book like Bella visiting Edward's home. The movie improved a bit in the end when tracker was involved.<br/><br/>The sound tracks were a bit better but the overall direction was very weak. There was no drama and thrill in the movie till the end. The movie came out totally opposite to what was initially expected. I would recommend it to the die-hard fans of Twilight book because only they can have the stamina to watch such a poor movie. Its a completely forgettable movie indeed, a big disappointment."

","I've given this flick a 5, purely because I am just hoping that the bad acting elements and total lack of chemistry between Pattinson & Stewart was just down to bad directing and an even worse script.<br/><br/>I love the twilight series... and I'm old enough to be grown outta all that stuff now. Still, it sucked me in (so to speak) and I was someone who was all of a sudden so anxious to see the film that I was almost hopping from my chair when I saw the trailer. <br/><br/>I was of course, like so many others, utterly disappointed...<br/><br/>Where was the build up and character development? Where was the story line??? Where was the romance... and most importantly... where the heck was the chemistry!!!<br/><br/>I know that this movie is somewhat about restraint, but seriously, the emotional divide here was as wide as the grand canyon. Pattinson, as other reviews mention, delivers a great & believable performance as Edward, feeding the emotional build up through his eyes and quirky responses to what is meant to be happening between his character Edward, and Bella... the beginnings of a great and strong relationship that cannot be stopped. Stewart on the other hand sadly looked like she needed to pass wind half the time to me. Did she even crack a playful smile once, save for a moment where she was a 'spider monkey!'?? She just seemed to blink a lot and let her mouth hang open. I simply wasn't convinced of her 'feelings'<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it was the awkwardness of what they had to work with, under a director who frankly should NEVER have been given this movie, or just the fact that they simply aren't suited to get that MUST have emotion between them which could have made all the difference to this flick!<br/><br/>I just hope that there is time to work on it and get that chemistry flowing hard, else round 2 is just going to make me lose all hope I had for this series and I'd rather keep my imagination than spend ¬£12 ruining what I already have in my head from devoting a couple of weeks to the saga.<br/><br/>I think its totally salvageable. Harry Potters first outing sucked, now its pretty decent viewing, so hopefully it will turnabout for the better, especially now that certain people have been replaced!<br/><br/>As a fan though I will put in my two cents in a hope that the sequel will stick to the book. That when it comes around we won't find random scenes stuck in that don't work (yes I am talking about the vampire attack on the engineer!)... and, not saying its got to be easy or that I could do any better, but PLEASE get into proper character!!<br/><br/>I look forward to New Moon, but I think if I want to enjoy Twilight again I'll just go back to the book.<br/><br/>Sorry for harsh critique for anyone who really liked it."

","Something crappy this way comes. What a snooze fest! Get a pillow for falling asleep (and a bucket for potential vomiting) This abomination of a teenage TV-pilot drama-like, is a great snooze fest. The actors are so bad they made my teeth hurt. The story is so incredibly juvenile and preposterously tedious, it makes me want to find those responsible pull down their pants and give them a good spanking. There are long pointless scenes of nothing happening. The story and dialogues are so badly written one has to drop their IQ to squid level to be able to follow. I dozed off here and there, and when I was awake I was either angry or annoyed. The writing insults the viewers intelligence and the terrible acting makes you wonder ¬Ö There were though some good aspects. I have to be honest. The fact that the vampires do not turn into hideous monsters under the sun (and die a screaming death) was quite refreshing; I really liked the glittering scene - Perhaps the only beautiful scene throughout the whole film - And the idea of all the extra individual abilities was also a nice touch. I give one point to that. Then the fact that they didn't show a single fang was a real good thing!!! I mean the movie was ridiculous already, if they would add the typical growling vampire-grimace showing off Halloween-fangs, it would be a comedy. The fang showing factor is one thing that always bothers me in vampire movies. (It is the only thing that turns me off with True Blood for example.) So I have to acknowledge that and give them one more point. And I will give it one more point for good photography. So other than these three pluses, the rest of the film is totally pathetic. It is a teenage drama for pre-teens. The love story is so ridiculous I don't know where to begin. It is so exaggerated, it dances on a very small thread between bad drama and comedy. I have to say I laughed many times during painfully long - to kiss or not to kiss - scenes. A wannabe powerful love story turn to sentimental diarrhea. And what is it with the Dawson's Creek alike, vampire family? They all looked and acted like a deeply religious Goody Two-Shoes family. The cooking scene was so unintentionally funny, yet disturbing, I didn't know if I should laugh or ask for my money back. I give it 3 out of 10"

","Plenty of elements came together and worked well. Still my overall impression was that something at the center went missing.<br/><br/>First, deprived of Bella's inner dialogue and her lightness & humor, the first half of the movie felt tentative. We sense what's going on with Bella but as viewers we are on the outside. We need direction. What drives the book is Bella's quirky humor and her ever escalating fixation with Edward. According to the story on the second day of school she is stricken with disappointment; Edward is absent. Even to her this is mysterious. With little encouragement from Edward, Bella becomes enthralled - nay, devoted to being by his side. Obsession culminates with her risky venture into the isolated meadow, alone with a superhuman killer. In the film this story arc is abbreviated and oddly spliced-up. The story feels a little thin. (Plus the voice of Edward, as played by Robert Pattinson, was a little startling, and not in a good way, and took some getting used to).<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie introduces a catalog of elements and characters from the book plus some added violence but less romance. (Same thing happened with the adaptation of Brokeback Mountain ¬ña far, far superior story and film, I know.) The primary story, the intense, scintillating and overwhelming perhaps fatal attraction of the two leads, is diluted. The movie is less sensual than the book. Wasn't there time for any over-the-top, big screen caliber romance? Instead some favorite scenes and dialogue went missing. (""You're intoxicated by my very presence"") The overall effect is an enjoyable glimpse of many supporting story elements and an odd romance that feels too underdeveloped to be the force driving all the action. I suspect the scriptwriter tried a little too hard to dial down the passion appropriately for her intended adolescent audience. Where's the fun in that? Plus it made for an uneven movie.<br/><br/>Mysteriously, all the talent at work on this film couldn't dispel a TV movie-of-the-week sensibility. This distracted me for the first half of the movie. Why did the story come across so small? Maybe the movie didn't know what kind of tone it wanted to take. Lots of possibilities were on option in this chock-full story.<br/><br/>For the rest, I enjoyed myself. Plenty of talent in evidence. The actors did remarkably well. The tension, humor and yes, the tenderness of some of their scenes made for quality low-key stuff. I loved the setting, the adolescent angst, the actor who plays Charlie, the few extreme close-ups, the dream (or were they?) sequences. The parts just didn't quite add-up to a satisfying adaptation or night out at the movies. I can attest the movie improves upon second viewing :)"
"precious8387","7","2","5","18 February 2009"," Could have been better
","After reading the book and watching the movie, I was extremely disappointed. There was a connection between Bella and Edward in the book that I did not see on screen. The relationship between Bella and Edward was rushed, one minute they are introducing themselves to each other and the next they cannot live without each other. You did not see the relationship between them develop at all.<br/><br/>I imagined a very different version of Bella then what was portrayed in the movie. I am sure Kristen Stewart is a wonderful actress (I personally have not seen many of her films if any), but I don't think she was the right choice for Bella.<br/><br/>Stephanie Meyer described the vampires as being impossibly fast and strong, but I didn't really see that in the film. Everything felt extremely rushed, and scenes from the book were not included that should have been included.<br/><br/>And I have to say what is with the hospital scene I still have to laugh every time I watch it. Kristen Stewart is forcing it way too much. Isn't she supposed to be stopping the one she cannot live without from leaving her? We certainly don't see that, it looks more like struggling to remember her lines.<br/><br/>The cast they choose for the Cullen Family is great, and they couldn't have done better. Some of the other characters however, they could have searched a little longer for."

","Twilight was a very entertaining movie, yes, I am very critical with movies, and don't get to see as many movies as id like, yet I have seen twilight 3 times. The problems with Twilight were Film School project mistakes, Its almost as if they just got lazy, between the editing, or the special effects, down to the casting of Edward.<br/><br/>For starters the acting in Twilight was very commendable. Some of the most natural, realistic acting from an ensemble cast we have seen in a long time, except for Edward. I realize every one is in current Rob love but, he took the flirting romantic lines and made them creepy and awkward, to the point where you wonder why Bella is with him, Yes he has his moments but on the whole he was no Casanova. <br/><br/>And then the ever depressing sunlight seen, where he Bella describes it as ""beautiful, like a million diamonds embedded in his skin"" and then in the movie he looks like someone dipped him in sugar. Then there is the rain scene where there drenched then they are bone dry. The fight scene where her major wounds magically heal themselves. I could note errors in the movie for hours, and don't get me wrong this movie was good the cinematography was stunning the entire film was eye candy but the mistakes were enough to draw my attention from the story and notice them. <br/><br/>This Series has the potential to be great They have Great Writers, A director with a good vision and a all around stellar break out cast, If they clean up there filming crew find a competent editor and a special effects crew that knows what the hell there doing New Moon will be a stellar movie!"

I thought Kristen Stewart was just really awkward in this film, but then again, she's always awkward. Robert Pattinsson was definitely not how i pictured Edward Cullen to be.

"egg8593","9","2","5","26 January 2009"," Compared to the Book
","I have read all of the Twilight books and I am a huge fan, I was really excited when the movie came out. The problem is that I am kind of a perfectionist, so sitting in the theater I could not help thinking ""Edward kissed Bella in the meadow not in her room"" or ""We don't even know about the bad vampires until the baseball scene"". Throughout the entire movie I was picking out every little detail that was different from the book. I have seen the movie multiple times and I have gotten over most of these differences. But there are some things that I cannot get over no matter how many times I see the movie:<br/><br/>1. Bella is not even a little scared when she runs with Edward?! What is that?! I mean I could see how they want to make her look stronger but really who could jump on someone's back run at top speed through a forest and not be afraid? <br/><br/>2. Alice!! What happened to Alice? Where was she in all of her scenes? She wasn't in the car to make the plan to get away from James and she didn't get Bella ready for prom, she didn't even go to prom (I am also upset that Bella willing went to prom.....she would never do that!!!!) <br/><br/>3. The line ""You're like my own personal brand of heroin"" come on that line is awful it is so cheesy and why would Edward say that? <br/><br/>I know I sound really negative but I actually did like the movie. It is probably one of my favorite movies. The way that it makes you feel matches the book and that is completely amazing. I absolutely love this movie and I can't wait for the rest of the series to me made into movies!!!"
"kmm1078","7","2","5","26 January 2009"," Some good, some bad
","I really go back and forth with my opinion on the film adaptation of one of my new favorite books. Going into the movie, I knew that it would not live up to my expectations, so I tried keeping my expectations to a bare minimum. I knew that the film would deviate dramatically from the book...it's to be expected. The book was long and there was a lot of internal dialogue etc that would be nearly impossible to translate to the screen. So I will set aside (most of) my comparisons between the book and the movie and just focus on my opinion of the movie in and of itself.<br/><br/>I think Kristen Swan was horribly cast as Bella. She goes through the entire movie in what I can only assume is a coma. She shows no emotion and recites her lines with a bored/depressive monotone. She totally lacked a personality and she wasn't likable in the least. She stuttered and bit her lip and awkwardly delivered her lines. I was very aware that I was watching a struggling actor. Never once did I actually lose myself in her character. She doesn't capture the character at all.<br/><br/>Edward, Edward, Edward...where do I start with him? Rob Pattinson is adorable and I think he was a good choice for Edward except for one tiny point of contention. The kid cannot act!!! I laughed aloud several times at his super intense expression that he so favored throughout the film. The scene where Bella walks into the Biology class for the first time and Edward recoils and covers his nose, is unintentionally hysterical. It is so overacted. It seemed like he just didn't understand who his character was. At times, Edward seemed completely bipolar. He seemed like the kind of creepy guy that we women are warned about. He didn't seem sweet and romantic, just stalkerish and possessive. But even that wasn't very believable. It seemed toward the end of the movie, that he got a bit more comfortable in his role and I almost started believing him. He definitely needs work on his American accent.<br/><br/>The only other actor I had much of a problem with was Jackson Rathbone. That guy just didn't know what to do. He didn't look like a vampire as much as he did a zombie.<br/><br/>Now on the subject of makeup/appearance, I think they need to go a bit easier on the pancake makeup. And perhaps for the next movie, they could consider dyeing Nikki Reed, Peter Facinelli and Jackson Rathbone more realistic shades of blonde. Was anyone buying them as natural blondes? I doubt it. My next complaint was that the movie was very rushed. There was little in the way of character or plot development. Also, I thought the special effects were terrible and clearly low budget. And I don't know if it was just me, but the choppy, awkward dialogue ruined what could have been a pretty good movie. But I don't know if it's the fault of the screenwriter or the actors.<br/><br/>Now for what I liked/loved. I loved the cinematography. I liked that it gave the movie an artsy/indie feel. I thought the rest of the actors were very well cast and played their parts very well. I especially liked Alice, Charlie and Esme. I thought the storyline with the exception of the two parts where James and crew kill the mill worker and then Waylon, was enjoyable and entertaining in spite of being rushed as I mentioned before. I loved the scene at the end of the movie following the fight scene where Edward is flashing back on memories of Bella while he is removing James' venom from Bella's body. I loved how they portrayed his struggle to stop after her blood was clean. I loved the song (by Rob Pattinson) that played during that flashback sequence. It was a pretty emotional moment. I'll admit I swooned! I loved the soundtrack, but was confused by the addition of a Collective Soul song from the late nineties. It seemed really out of place with the more current music.<br/><br/>I really hope that New Moon under new direction will deliver where Twilight struggled. But with less than a year to film, I'm not holding out a ton of hope."

Not as much as i thought, but i had VERY low expectations to start with.<br/><br/>I wont get into the Annoying fan girls of twilight who haven't even read the books, because I shouldn't let that effect the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie misses out some information that you did get in the books, and the acting was awful. Bella seemed to have no emotions what so ever, yet seemed to jump from hating Edward at once scene to being overly madly in love with him in the next.<br/><br/>All in all, I say this. If you've read the books, then prepare to be disappointed. If you haven't read the books, go read them, and then get ready for the disappointment."

","Let me start by saying I am not someone in their target audience (which I assume are teen females). I have never read any of the books, so my assessment is based solely on the movie.<br/><br/>The story itself is like every other movie of its type. Nothing about the plot will surprise you, and there will be no ""Oh I was not expecting this"" moments. In fact, one could probably guess the plot simply by watching the first 10 minutes of this film.<br/><br/>What really pulled me into this movie was the connection between both Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. They compliment each other very well in the film, with Edward being calm and level headed and Bella being somewhat panicky. As individuals, Robert Pattinson's portrayal of Edward Cullen was spectacular. He played the role of the quiet heartthrob to a T. On the other hand, Kristen Stewart's individual acting was a little hard to swallow. Needless to say, she benefited greatly from scenes where they both appear.<br/><br/>Other members such as Carlise and Charlie were magnificent as well. Overall, the cast all performed very well.<br/><br/>Though it may not win many awards, this is still a great movie to watch, and you will not leave disappointed!"

","Well, as a beginning, I must say that I'm a Twilight lover(I have read the first 2 books-the only ones available in my country until now- in less than 3 days) and nobody or nothing will change it. Even though the movie doesn't rely exactly on the book, it is worth seeing. The movie is that gripping that when you start watching it, you won't be able to do anything else until it ends. The love story is one of the best from Titanic until now and the ""vampire thing"" adds a bit of suspense on it.

","This is more of a comment on the previous comment -- I had not read the books when I saw the movie, but I enjoyed the movie enough that I am now on book #4... I disagree with a few things previously stated. First of all, the vampires in the books do not have fangs. There is one instance where Jacob asks Bella if Edward's fangs bother her, and she gets defensive and says ""You know he doesn't have fangs!"" It's pretty hard to turn a 300+ page book into a less than 2-hour PG-13 movie without leaving out some of the detail, especially when the detail is usually about how beautiful the characters are. The only way to really show that is through makeup and the way other people look at those characters... In my opinion, the movie was done just fine, and considering a lot of twilight fans have paid to see it multiple times, I don't think it was ""by far... the worst."" Have you seen ""The Spirit"" yet? :) I rest my case."
"monkeyminx007","7","2","5","13 January 2009"," Doesn't compare to the book ... but still good
","OK, so the movie was a good movie, BUT it didn't compare to the book at all. It was a good movie in itself, but it lost some of the twilight feeling.<br/><br/>The film was far too focused on the action rather than the romance, but actually the action doesn't even take up a quarter of the book. I think anyone watching the film who had not read the book (and isn't already in love with Edward simply because he is played by Robert) will be thinking why the hell does he love her, why does she love him, especially when he could kill her? i don't think we saw the real falling in love between Edward and Bella, as we know its not love at first sight. when Edward first sees Bella (see midnight sun partial draft on Stephenie Meyer's website)he doesn't see what the fuss is about. Bella see's Edward as beautiful, but is not immediately in love with him either.<br/><br/>I think while Kristen Stewart is a good actress, she was not a good Bella, and did not portray her as i imagined Bella to be, which is bad, because she is the main character. However, i adored Ashley Greene's performance of Alice, i think she was graceful and very enthusiastic. i also liked the way she sung her words, as does Alice, and seemed to be dancing when she walked. I also though Jackson Rathbone made a fantastic jasper ... he did actually always look in pain! My other favourite performance was from Taylor Lautner, as Jacob. though he is hardly seen, i thought he had the perfect 'Jacob smile'. He seemed friendly, kind and funny, and we saw that he liked Bella. We also see that finds the superstitions silly, and we do see some of Jacob's true (and good) colours . There were other great performances, but these were my stand out 3.<br/><br/>Over all the film was a good film, but it was no where near as good as the book, and they made a few too many mistakes and left out important details/scene's at times, e.g Edward not mentioning the Volturi."

I had read the first book before I watched the movie and there were hardly any points which I didn't like about it. The directing was amazing, the actors matched the criteria of the characters and the way the film was produced, has grabbed an obsession on it. Although the film was incredible, the only thing I didn't like was that they brought one death into the film instead of the upcoming one, new moon, so I'm looking forward to see what they can do to replace it. <br/><br/>This film is truly the best I have ever seen, so if you do like magic and mythology, then I would definitely recommend this film to everyone.

But Edward being played by Robert Patterson is a work of genius.The fight scene actually really scared me and James was brilliant in his part. Also, I really hated Rosilie.

"mtoton","8","2","5","11 January 2009"," Twilight Misses Mark
","As a forty-something and definitely not a YA reader, I read the series in a few weeks. So that right there says I was hooked. Naturally, I was anxious to see the film version and I truly did enjoy it. However, I was somewhat disappointed that much of the emotion so heartfelt and ever-present in the book was severely lacking in the movie. Granted, it was certainly a lot of material to cram into 2 hours but the movie failed to reach the emotional depths that Stephanie Meyers' characters possessed, especially the part of Bella Swan. I just couldn't feel Bella from Kristen Stewart. I wanted to but it just wasn't there. What really annoyed me was her constant blinking and shaking her head. Was that supposed to be her defiance, stubbornest??? I'm supposing maybe it was her portraying Bella's nervousness? I couldn't feel Bella's emotion? Where was her shyness? How about Bella's blushing? Bella's clumsiness? Robert Pattinson was more believable than I anticipated as the part of Edward Cullen. However, what you really miss in the film is his need and love for her. Having lived as long as Edward has, he knows he's found his soul-mate but doesn't know if it's safe - for Bella. The movie didn't focus enough on that I think. It just doesn't capture the intense love they both feel for each other. It totally missed that he was a 108 year-old vampire that was much more adult than your typical mortal 17-year old male. In the book, it's painful and very difficult for Edward to touch and kiss Bella without killing her and the movie missed that completely. The uncontrollable desire he feels for Bella and yet the pain of not being able to have her. The meadow scene in the book was more enlightening and romantic than the film's version. Another missed mark was that I was expecting Bella to be absolutely terrified as she was in the book as they raced through the woods. That was non-existent. I think the effects could have been better. I could barely hear a hiss and the flying scenes were so fake. I know they didn't have a big budget but, gees, the audience pays for viewing so at least make it believable.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to New Moon but concerned that the production schedule is so short. I can't imagine cramming all that material in in a matter of a few months. I've read where Robert Pattinson had trouble with the contacts that made it so difficult for him to properly portray his role and I certainly hope the issue is addressed this time around. He's a good actor and will make a spectacular Edward with a little help. Kristen Stewart needs to tone-down a little. Bella's nervous but not that much. (I must say she really pulled it off in her performance in the hospital scene.) And, they both need to act like lovebirds to convince the paying audience. New Moon is much more emotional than Twilight. I sure hope they can pull it off."

","So this movie was on the list when my girlfriend and I rocked up at the Box Office and said, 'ew, not another romantic vampire movie'. We clearly hadn't read, or even heard of the books.<br/><br/>But to the hell with it (sorry for the pun), we decided to give it a try since the only other movie playing at the time was High School Musical.. (just... no). Oh, and we felt like popcorn.<br/><br/>About 2 hours later we emerged from the theater dusted in salt and tiny pieces of popcorn in a state of be-wilderness, still captivated by Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson's amazing chemistry on screen.<br/><br/>This movie has it all, the mystery, the action (with in my opinion excellent special effects with the budget they had), the comedy (I'm British and love that dry humor), the romance... being the centre of the movie, and also that flow- the story keeps you on the edge of your seat, while not moving too fast -brilliant direction.<br/><br/>The only problem I found with the film was the open trails left behind by the storyline, which of course is unavoidable- still, we can expect a far-fetched over-the-top sequel which will fill those gaps.<br/><br/>To anyone who gave this movie a bad review, I strongly suggest you take a second to think about what Catherine Hardwicke set out to achieve and ask yourself one simple question, did she succeed, or fail?"

In Vampire films, they're meant to be afraid on the sun as they'll burn to death. Twilight, vampires in light get a bit of glitter on their skin. Stupid or what!!

"KiteVega","3","2","5","11 January 2009"," Did the Director Hate the Book?
","As you know, this review is supposed to be about the film, so I will keep comments about the book brief as possible. I enjoyed the first book a lot, though became steadily more rattled as I read the rest of the series. There, that's it. The point of my comment re the books is this: while I doubt very much that they are stunning literary masterpieces, I cannot deny that they are loved by millions of people, and that Twilight, therefore, deserved a much better representation on the big screen. The acting, for the most part, was OK. Not great, not terrible, but OK. The exceptions to this rule were Billy Burke, who was great as Charlie, and Peter Facinelli as Carlisle. Burke did a good job of portraying Charlie's awkward, sardonic side, and Facinelli put Carlisle's gentle, caring nature right out there. I actually thought the kid who played Jacob Black was very good too, though I suppose we'll see more of him in the next installment, if they make one. The leads however were average. Kristen Stuart looks how I imagined Bella, and I thought Robert Pattinson made a fairly convincing Edward, despite everyone's initial horror. In my opinion, though, they channeled all the most negative aspects of their characters. Bella in the film is on uber monotone, miserable and whiny mode - character flaws which came out far more strongly in the next book. Gone is her creative and witty side. Edward too had his angsty, tortured side on full show, rather than being confident and verbose. Whether you've read the books or not, having the character's more dismal parts brought out is not going to make for the most interesting viewing. Some of the direction in the film was terrifically feeble. Edward's first reaction to Bella brought howls of derision from the audience - rather than looking desperately enchanted, he looked like he'd necked one too many vodkas at a party the night before and was trying to suppress a very unpleasant hangover. The shots in this scene were also distracting - fading in and out like an early 90's after-school special, and at one point Edward had a stuffed barn-owl behind his head, so the wings stuck out behind his hair like mal-formed, gigantic, white, feathery ears. More hilarity ensued. The three evil vampires were an absolute hoot - when they accosted the poor boatman I half expected them to break into a high-kicking, jazzy number a la Chicago. The direction here seemed really out of place, particularly when coupled with James' cringe-worthy line: ""What have I told you about playing with our food?"" Argh, gasp, head-in-hands. There can't have been that many under 11s in their demographic, surely? The special effects were sub-par: Edward charging up the hill looked as though he was on a very fast escalator, and Edward and Emmetts' mid-air crash during the baseball game looked like something out of Charmed. The film picked up towards the end - the baseball game was pretty cool over all, and the confrontation with James was a definite high-point. Despite picking up though, the film could not resist ending in a morass of soap-opera-style cheese: when Victoria, after spying on Edward and Bella at the prom, un-pinned her hair (bit of a lame disguise considering she was still wearing her mud-stained fur and no shoes) and strutted vengefully down the stairs, backed by the tacky jingling of Hip Hop lite, the audience roared again. Twilight, for good or ill, has certainly not had its credibility restored by this alarmingly trite effort. Better luck next time."

","Now, when this movie was first heard of, everyone could hear the screams of teenage girls clawing to get a peek. The movie remained in the dark and kept fans hungering for more. Calling my younger cousin a few days before the release, I asked her if she could tell me if I should go see it or not. I had high hopes for the movie and was pretty excited along with the rest of America. However, I was going to be mortified.<br/><br/>I saw the movie about two weeks after the release date because I wasn't sure if I should spend my money. I decided just to take the chance and go. I walked into the movie theater with high hopes. As the movie started, I could tell that it wasn't going to live up to my expectations. It was going to get worse.<br/><br/>As the movie went on, I started to shift in my seat whenever I heard line after line of awful scripting. Lines like: ""I should eat"" and ""Hold on tight you spider monkey"" had me laughing. It was AWFUL. The lines were not the only thing keeping me entertained. Edward's expressions when encountering Bella in the classroom had him looking like he had food poisoning. When that was over, he had extremely awkward conversations with Bella until their awkward relationship started to form. The movie kept with these traits to the very end. And as I walked away, I would replay some of the funniest moments such as: ""SAY IT SAY IT"" ""vampire...."".<br/><br/>In the end, I would have to rate this movie as a ""dont waste your money"" movie. Its a movie that people should look back on and laugh at its poor scripting. The story behind the movie had so much potential and it saddens me that it had to end up this way. Sorry Twilight fans, this is getting rated a:<br/><br/>3/10"
"lovelydonohue","3","2","5","6 January 2009"," Frustrating
","I'd like to start out by saying I am a huge fan of this series of books. So naturally I was very excited when the movie came out. For me the movie was awful. For people who haven't read the book, the movie was far too choppy and there wasn't enough character development. I HATED that they added scenes that don't even exist in the book at attempt to make it more cohesive. I am a hopeless romantic and I read the first and second books in one week. Even by trying to just enjoy the movie without any prejudice I was simply disappointed. If they would have spent a little more time and money instead of wasting the talents of the very promising cast this could have been a fantastic movie."
"dont-you-fake-it","5","2","5","5 January 2009"," Was OK (not good or great)
","I thought the movie was okay, provided that the book is too long (they can't just fit all the scenes in 2 hours). Still, the director could've done better, like which are the best scenes that should be included in the movie, and role-picking. Kristen Stewart is not that bad. She's just not the Bella I had in my mind. And I've heard and read a lot of comments that said that same thing. In My Opinion, I think Alexis Bledel of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants fit Bella's character better :) Somehow I can imagine her as Bella. Robert Pattinson is good enough, 'cause he has that vampire-look and acted the role quite well, and he is apparently very appealing to girls. Overall, the movie was Okay but not that good or great either. I'm kinda hoping for a remake- a Great one please! ;)"
"ifyouseek-alicia","5","2","5","3 January 2009"," The Truth
","Kristen Stewart cannot act her way out of a paper bag in this movie. What is frustrating to me, especially, is that I've seen this girl sprout more emotions in other films in one scene than she conveys as Bella in this entire movie. It is laughable, and most of all, a disappointment - I know she can do better. If this is honestly how she believes Bella is portrayed, then I will boycott New Moon and any other illegitimate films from the Twilight series made by her.<br/><br/>The lighting does nothing to flatter her at all. Kristen Stewart, whom under good light is fairly attractive, in an odd and uncommon way, looks like a greasy tom boy. We all know (that is, the Twilight readers and die-hards) that Bella is attractive, but not in an overly so way that it makes it obvious to how she gains the admiration of a handsome, god-like creature such as Edward. The clothing they chose for her was ridiculous and did not accentuate anything about her features and structure.<br/><br/>I would like to point out that it is obvious, painfully so, that Stewart was not cast for her abilities, but merely the chemistry between she and Pattinson. While the heat was fan inducing at times, there are only perhaps about a hand full of these moments, which as we all know cannot possibly compensate the joke she has made out of a dearly beloved character. At all. I do also wish to mention that I felt the urge to snap shut Kristen's almost constant open jaw. Not only did her monotone acting make her appear brain-dead, the near drooling did nothing but make the cherry on top of her life-lessness.<br/><br/>I would like to give a light slap on the butt to the idiotic writer who gave these actors some of the most horrific lines that made me turn my head away in shame - and embarrassment - at seeing Twilight slaughtered on screen. It is, with horror, that I read that the same writer is assigned to massacre New Moon. I dearly hope and pray that this pathetic screenplay writer, and Kristen, read some of the heart-breaking reviews on their performance and choose to shape up the next time around, because if there is even a modicum of idiocy with the next segment, I (and many, many others that I know) will not be on the train for Eclipse and the already bastardized Breaking Dawn.<br/><br/>If anything, it is obvious that Rob Pattinson saved and made this film. There were moments where I could have sworn I saw him struggle with the lines they forced him to say, but he made through it, and I am grateful that the two hours and $8 wasn't a complete waste of my precious life because of him. To all that questioned his ability to play Edward in the beginning, I know many if not all left feeling satisfied - at least more so in him than Stewart.<br/><br/>The actor of James was so bad that it was like rubbing salt on an already open wound with their laughable and exaggerated ""hunting"" scenes that really weren't even necessary. I had issue with Carlisle's actor because he seemed very stiff and one dimensional, not as the noble, strong character we know him to be through the books.<br/><br/>Good things I would like to point out are the actors of Rosalie and Emmett. Excellent portrayal of the characters. Though obviously not Oscar worthy, they at least were not laughable, like Alice's high-pitched, kill me before I stab you with a fork voice or the corny vision of this generation's youth with Eric and Mike Newton. Charlie was great as Bella's father and made me very happy.<br/><br/>I am not saying I hate this film, as angry as this review may sound. I am completely aware that any book-to-movie deal will always have it's faults and disappointed fans, but the film was about 20% closer to the ridiculous side than it is anything else. I don't speak for everyone; I know some were pleased, strangely enough, by Kristen's portrayal. I have seen the movie multiple times, and it wasn't as bad as I originally thought the second time around. The soundtrack is amazing and I adore every song, of each that bring to mind of the excellently captured landscapes of Forks. I honestly hope that the increased budget offers more support for better clothing, an acting coach for Kristen, and non-laughable special effects. There were mistakes that were easily spotted, such as editing problems, a very novice accident that I wouldn't have expected for such a highly anticipated film. I suggest the next movie focus on fleshing out Bella - the REAL, heart-sick and vulnerable Bella - and spend less money harassing people with ads and promotion and more on the things that matter. We're here for you; the fan base isn't going to turn away just because you didn't do it halfway decently the first time around. Second time, maybe. We're intelligent enough as a whole to recognize failure when we see it - merely look up the reviews for Breaking Dawn to understand where you're headed."
"Troy33","4","2","5","31 December 2008"," Worse than expected
","At first i wasn't at all interested in watching this film. But my twin sister that was half way across the world begged me to see it. Because she loved it so much. When i entered the Cinema i wasn't expecting much. Because i haven't read the books, and all that i knew was an average girl and vampire falls deeply in love with each other. And that Edward wants to kill her and eat her every moment they are together. So yeah, the plot seemed alright, so i gave it a shot. And my god.. I was so disappointed. The script was terrible, the editing was the worst i've seen in years. I think the one that's to blame for this movie is the director. This movie seemed to have huge potential, but all ruined by four things.. The Script, editing, directing and visual effects. Although i thought that Robert Pattingson did a pretty good job. His American accent was a pass. And i thought that the performance by the girls Dad was the best in the movie. I left the Cinema feeling Confused. It was far below my expectations."
"Kara_007_40","9","2","5","31 December 2008"," No offense but. . . .
","I disagree. I hadn't read the books yet when I saw the movie, so I went and bought them (my friends said I might as well, 'cuz they were so good). And I've read the first two so far. But, in my opinion, what I envisioned in the book as I read it, matched up fairly perfectly to the movie. Especially for Edwards character. Let's keep in mind that in the novel he is stunned by her smell and is disgusted with himself for the thoughts & feelings that cross his mind when it comes to her. Hence the look of constipation; to me, that was not what the look was anyways, but rather it was a look of shock & awe. Then in the office, he's trying to switch classes to get away from her, because he knows he should stay away from her as best he can, his facial expressions nailed it. Now, as for Bella being mono-toned, hey she's a teenager. Guess what, they act like that. Bella is going through that awkward stage, where she shuts out people as much as she can, plus going to a new school doesn't make that easier. Most teenagers can be broken up into ""groups"" (forgive me if I offend any teens, but I was there once too!), Bella belongs to the quiet & dark (perhaps bordering on goth or emo) vs. Jessica whose your average cheerleader type, peppy, talkative, etc. So, as mono-toned as she may seem, that's exactly how she's supposed to be, so well played! Not to say that I wouldn't have like to see her show her emotions to Edward more, since she was SOOO crazy about him in the novel. And, I think the supporting cast also played their roles quite well; Alice's character was spot-on to the novel, as was Rosealie's. You could totally feel the animosity there! I'm just glad that they stayed true to the book as much as possible & for a novel-to-movie adaptation, I think they did a brilliant job. I hope another is coming soon!"
"freckledfrogbaby","4","2","5","30 December 2008"," Awful Direction
","First things first, a little history before I begin my rant.. I've read all the Twilight novels including the partially finished Midnight Sun, and for the most part, enjoyed reading them, especially the first book on which the movie is based.<br/><br/>Although I'm not one of those die-hard fans of the series, I did, however, enjoy the book for what it was. A touching vampire love story which was written primarily for the teen community. And even though I am nearing 30 myself, I liked the book.<br/><br/>As for the movie, even though I feel that for movies that are based on books, the book version is almost always better, I went to watch the movie with an open mind. I understand that as a screen adaptation, there had to be some deviations from the book itself, and that was fine with me. But seriously, the script was bad.<br/><br/>The main draw of the book was the attraction and love between the two main characters, but in the movie, their love towards each other was never expressed properly. One moment you see Edward covering his nose as Bella walks in, and the next moment, apparently he's in love? Some of the dialogue too, seemed a little abrupt and pointless at times. You'd think they might have thought to cut out those useless dialogue and take the time to develop the love between Edward and Bella instead.<br/><br/>Special effects were hilarious and make-up was a joke as well. I mean, would it have hurt to increase the budget a bit more so that the jumping scenes (or flying as looked like to me) didn't look so amateurish?<br/><br/>And then there was the whole thing with Edward in the sunlight. In the book, he's supposed to sparkle ""like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface"" and be ""glittering like crystal"", but unfortunately in the movie, it just looked like they threw on some glitter that they got from the craft store.<br/><br/>He could have walked out into the busiest street on the most cloudless and sunniest day of year and nobody would have noticed him ""sparkling"". Then again, maybe they blew the whole budget buying up pots of pasty makeup for the vampires. Even then, they seemed to have scrimped on that as well since they failed to apply it to the back of the vampires' necks.<br/><br/>As a whole, I feel that the casting was pretty good. Kristen Stewart was believable as Bella and Robert Pattinson did his best with the terrible script. However, certain scenes were almost too painful to watch with the very awkward acting. This, I really believe was not the fault of the actors, who did the best they could, but rather the horrible direction they were given.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my main gripe about the movie, and the main reason why I took the time to write my very first comment on IMDb. Catherine Hardwicke.<br/><br/>Catherine Hardwicke is a joke as a director and one wonders what was in the minds of those involved to actually cast her as the director. Her direction was appalling and non-existent at times.<br/><br/>It was a movie that had the potential to be a great love story, but she took it and sadly massacred it. The bad screenplay helped as well, but ultimately it was Catherine Hardwicke and her awful direction that was the movie's downfall, in the end leaving us wondering just what could have been.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie adaptation of the book Twilight had the potential of being a good movie but ultimately was sabotaged by a bad script and a lousy director."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","5","26 December 2008"," The vampire strikes back
","It's not difficult to appreciate, if you have seen the movie, why Twilight has become such a favourite to teenage girls (and their grandmothers, as one critic quips). It is difficult enough to come by a beau that is dashingly handsome. But one that is gentle enough to play the piano beautifully and strong enough to save you from an on-crashing van, with his bare hand! And, in a feat that is very different but just as enchanting as what Clark Kent did to Lois Lane (for those who remember the scene with Margot Kidder and ""Can you read my mind""), takes you on a trapeze-like adventure at the top of an impossibly tall pine forest, surveying the immense splendour of the sweeping landscape. Romance at its best vintage.<br/><br/>Although not quite offering the dark, psychological depth of Nosferatu (1922), this vampire story has some special appeal. The vampire family that our young heroine Bella Swan (an excellent Kristen Stewart) stumbles across are ""vegetarians"", a dubious description for a lifestyle (or should that be ""deathstyle""?) of abstinence from human blood, with as substitute animal blood ¬ñ like surviving on tofu, you get all the nutrition you need but it's never truly satisfying, as the sweetheart Edward Cullen (a good Robert Pattinson) carefully explains. You get the picture.<br/><br/>The love story is sensibly handled. Rather than smothering it with layers of syrup, the effective script simply has her declare in an almost matter-of-course manner, at a most critical moment when he threatens to leave her for her own good, that they are not to live without each other. Simple as that, and directly appealing. Another clever scene is when Bella goes to meet the parents (and relatives). It looks more like an inter-racial relationship than a supernatural romance. The vampire family appears to be more like one from a different ethnic and cultural background than from another world.<br/><br/>But not all vampires are nice guys. There has to be a ""non-vegetarian"" vampire community, from which the main thriller drama is generated for this first edition of what hopefully will be a long series. Also introduced, but not fully explored, is a third power base, an Indian family, purportedly descended from wolves (think Kate Beckinsale's ""Underworld""), arch-enemies of vampires. Can't wait for the sequel ""New Moon""."
"meghandougher22","4","2","5","24 December 2008"," Disappointed
","So I originally went to see the movie before I read the books. The movie is actually what made me want to read the books. I had to fill in the holes. I like the movie just fine, but after reading Twilight I have nothing but disappointment. I realize that things have to be changed when adapting book to screenplay, but I absolutely hate it when they unnecessarily change things or leave important things out. The writers didn't do a very good job of portraying the love story between Bella and Edward. It progressed in a very odd way. The fact that they did a hatchet job to the meadow scene was more than disappointing. That was the heart of the book and the turning point in their relationship, for it to be glazed over in such a ridiculous way was sad. They could have had a natural progression in Edward and Bella's relationship if they didn't include those ridiculous murder scenes. In the book Stephanie Meyer didn't feel the need to introduce James, Laurent and Victoria until the baseball scene, I don't understand why the movie makers felt it necessary. The casting I was impressed with though...Rob is perfect as Edward, I normally don't find him attractive or sexy, but in this film...SO HOT!! I thought Kristen was good...Her stuttering lines annoyed me at point, I don't know if it was written that way or if she just couldn't find the words, but that bothered me. Peter as Carilse...PERFECT!! Except for the makeup, that was little over done, but that was the case for most of the vampires. It looked like someone took a giant powderpuff and went to town on their faces!! Esme, Alice, Rosalie all wonderful choices. Jasper was PERFECT...he creeped me out the whole film!! As for Kellan Lutz I don't think they could have found a perfect Emmett if they tried. I hope that the future directors stay a little closer to the book and portray these characters the way they deserve to be portrayed. As bad as Twilight disappointed me, I can't wait to see New Moon put to film!"
"ourreeds@hotmail.com","3","2","5","24 December 2008"," Just Awful... Oh the disappointment
","Firstly, I admit to two facts: 1. I have read the Twilight saga (why did I bother? I am not sure - probably to see what all the fuss was about. Nothing it would seem) 2. I am not the target audience for this film but it is worth noting that the actors and director have made much of the fact that Twilight is not exclusively a 'teen' film. I would disagree with that. I cannot comprehend how anyone other than an impressionable teenage girl would enjoy this farcical romp. <br/><br/>Twilight is simply dire and for so many reasons. It could have been decent - there were glimpses of what could have been a good film but they were few and far between. Mostly this film is a mess, cringe-worthy and funny for all the wrong reasons. Some key observations: <br/><br/>1. Style: The film looks and feels disjointed - like it is a mash up of clips shot by different people. Some scenes are shot in awkward hand-held camera mode, as though it is a student 'mockumentary'. Other scenes (the majority I would say) have a substandard teen soap quality about them. The two former styles mean that the baseball and ballet studio scenes (both of which I quite enjoyed - particularly the baseball scene, which was odd in the book but done very well here) seem out of place. I appreciate that the budget was low on this film but even still! The lack of continuity in film style is perplexing and irritating. <br/><br/>2. Storyline: The film tried to stick to as much of the book as possible but as much of the book focus on Bella's inner thoughts/inner monologues, it meant that the script jumped from scene to scene awkwardly without any explanation. Maybe a loose adaptation would have been better. <br/><br/>3. Soundtrack: I found the use of music in this film to be utterly bizarre. In many scenes the music just seemed inappropriate or completely random/out of sync. Some of the more 'intense' scenes between Bella and Edward were ruined by odd background music/random guitar chords. The scene where Edward plays the piano befits a music video rather than a film. Odd. <br/><br/>4. Acting Or lack of: Sorry, but most of the people in this film are painfully wooden and dull. I feel bad for Robert Pattinson - he does an alright job but because everyone else is so poor (I know Bella is a bit dull in the books, but Kristen Stewart is just annoying and monotonous in tone and acting) he looks out of sorts and almost like he is over acting when he is actually the only one acting! <br/><br/>Twilight could have been something decent (not that the story line is particularly original, but even so) but in the end I don't think it even qualifies as a 'film'. I have given it 3 stars and not 1 because I liked the use of Radiohead at the end, the baseball scene was surprisingly well done and Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart at least looked the part. Other than that, I have to shake my head in shame. What a lost opportunity. Seeing as the books go downhill from here on, I can't imagine what the other films will be like. Be prepared to cringe and be disappointed I reckon."
"raquel-dealba","6","2","5","22 December 2008"," Lots of holes
","First, I was very disappointed when I heard that Kristen Stewart has not read Twilight...or so we hear. As a fellow thespian, I believe that before jumping into a role you must gather all information on your character. Bella in the novel and Bella in the film to me do not match up. I strongly feel that Kristen Stewart should read all 4 books to better understand Bella's character and her relationship between all characters in the novel. Her stuttering gets annoying after awhile. I'm so glad to hear the Hardwicke is not directing the next installment. I think that the screenwriter should stick closer to the book because the film doesn't really do the novel justice. Meyer is a fantastic writer and deserves credit for her hard work. Overall, I enjoyed film but know that it can be so much better."
"angel_lina_th","5","2","5","11 December 2008"," It needs to be saved...
","Perhaps one day someone will say, this will be a good movie to remake, and invest the time and patience towards really making the story what it should have been. I wasn't expecting a great deal from it, but I was not expecting it to flop entirely. The only reason it made the money it did is because of the original fans who attended, including whoever they dragged to the theater along with them. The story is amazing but the movie¬Ö absolutely dreadful. I agree with everyone absolutely, Robert Pattison cannot act, and maybe it's a good thing New Moon only has him at the beginning and the end, so maybe within that time he can perhaps invest his time into acting lessons. I do not mean offense, but he won't be able to survive solely on looking the part, he must act the part as well. I had seen him in interviews where aside of not knowing what words to choose for his answers, he's actually quite charismatic and that's what he missed to add to his role as Edward. In my opinion they should have read the books before filming the movie. It should have been criteria in order to get the part. They would have perhaps put more emotion into the characters with knowing everything we knew about who they are. I always imagined Bella free spirited, imaginative and stunning not in the way of appearance but in the way of her individuality. I even pictured Stephenie Meyer herself as Bella from time to time, I feel like she was writing about herself especially at the end of the fourth novel and she definitely put a lot of love into creating the character. Kristen should have gotten to know Stephenie a little more, and then maybe she would have done a better job at playing the role. Everyone seemed to been guesstimating at what they should have been acting like, but as a result you get something that is unfinished and forced, and no eye candy can ever fix that. I'm not the appropriate target audience for the movie, but neither am I for Harry Potter and those have always been nicely developed. I'm glad they will be looking for a new Director; this movie needs new direction and a different screenplay writer, and especially new editors. I pray they learn from their mistakes and deliver us something promising with New Moon. The story is just far too good to be destroyed¬Ö on the positive note, one thing I did like about this movie is Dr. Cullen, Esme, Rosalie, Alice and Jasper. The guy who played Emmett didn't do too badly either. They should have had more of Alice however, she is the fourth most important character in the novel and it was disappointing to see her for only a minute here and a minute there. Stephenie should have the authority to approve the screenplays before she allows any more monstrosities to be filmed ¬ñ if we only lived an ideal world"

","I read the book and I've got to say, this is one of the few novel-to-movie adaptations that stick and stay true to the book. Yes, it did omit some parts out, but all of the major parts of the story are still there. And we also get a bonus fight scene which was not in the book.<br/><br/>I've seen Twilight in the cinemas a few times because it's worth it. To me, it's a very fun story. Nothing too serious or out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>The acting is not exactly Oscar-worthy, but it's still managed to keep the movie together. The plot (just like the book) is great and fun. The music score is very effective. I love it. It's deep and haunting. The soundtrack is great, too.<br/><br/>What I like most about the movie is the mood of it. The tone is very moody and dark that you could almost feel the coldness of the small, rainy and sullen town of Forks. And combined with the score, it'll give the viewer a very morose and haunting feeling. The mood, just like in the novel, is spot on!<br/><br/>What I am not happy with is the special effect. If Twilight was a TV show, the special effect would be consider good (like the TV shows Heroes or Smallville), but for a major motion picture, it looks cheap. I mean, all of the scenes when the vampires are moving very fast look like they fast-forwarded the film. And did they really have to make Edward glitters?<br/><br/>Other than that, the effect is still forgivable. The baseball scene was very exciting and I love the intensity of the ballroom fight scene.<br/><br/>Twilight looks like a very high quality TV show. But in the end, it is a worthy-of-your-time movie. I suggest you check it out."
"Adrian232","5","2","5","6 December 2008"," Better than expected
","After watching this movie after reading all the reviews, I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed it. Sure, it was loaded with really cheesy lines. And some things made absolutely no sense whatsoever (""Come on, spider monkey"", wtf?). But throughout the movie, I could tell how good the books must have been... despite the whole vampires shimmering in the sunlight thing. In fact, there were a lot of mechanics involved here that were very subtle in the movie... Mind reading, seeing the future, natives originating from wolves, etc.<br/><br/>But, still the one thing that makes absolutely no sense is why the hell a vampire, having lived for decades or maybe even centuries, would be going to high school? Screw having a cover, you could easily pretend you're 18 instead of 17. But honestly, who would choose to go to high school and take Biology risking exposure, and then fall in love with a young naive girl such as Bella? Actually, their entire relationship makes no sense except for their unnatural attraction for each other. All she knows is that she is scared, and yet completely 100% unconditionally in love with him? That is begging for failure. Yet so high school at the same time... Hell, at least the movie did get the whole high school atmosphere down correctly. The supporting characters were all believable. Even though I wanted to smack them.<br/><br/>But all in all, it was a decent movie. And i hope the sequels will be much better."

","They totally wrecked it. Edward is not supposed to look like that. And they made it totally cheesy, whereas it's supposed to be cute and romantic. Jacob looks like a girl, and a total disappointment to Twilight readers. I can't believe this. Some of the lines are wrong (eg. the heroin bit), UM BELLA IS THE ONE SAYING THAT. Why is Edward the one saying it in the movie? And, they totally fast-forwarded the whole thing. It's probably like 15 chapters and it's only like half an hour in the movie, but I guess they do it in every movie. Okay the Meadow scene is so ruined. It's just this cheesy bit when they look at each other, oh you're probably thinking 'Awwwww' right? NOT! It's so stupid. UM AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO SPARKLE? Wth. He's not 'sparkling' at all. Okay and when Edward & Bella are officially 'dating', um what is up with his face? And his sunnies? Okay, he has the 'I'm so cool and you're not' look. Fine, I get that he's a vampire and all, but he doesn't have to be so selfish-looking. UM, he's supposed to be like a baby or something when Carlisle changed him, and he looks exactly the same. But he looks in pain, that bit's good. He's supposed to be in pain. And when he's like 'It's like a human living on tofu', UM he says it as if he wants to eat the tofu. OKAY AND The Cullens' house is supposed to be WHITE. WHITE. WHAT IS HE DOING?! Um, he's like dancing with her. He's not even supposed to dare to touch her.<br/><br/>Btw, Emmett's probably the cutest."

","I wasn't really sure I was going to go for the ""glittering vampire love story"" that every tween in America has been screeching about, I mean really? Vampires that glitter? But I gave the books a shot and found them to be very delightful.<br/><br/>I would say the movie was... delightfully terrible and unintentionally funny. I found myself giggling at the acting and the over dramatic scenes that you are frequently presented with. It's almost kind of tragic. But that's mostly the beginning of the movie. The actors seem a little more tense, the makeup is a little over done, and there are many scenes that are supposed to be really serious dramatic moments, and you don't seem to be able to point out as much during the end of the movie. It's like the actors did this in one long take, you can tell that they're more comfortable in the last half of the movie, and the makeup isn't so annoying and obvious.<br/><br/>It's fun to see the characters they picked and the way they played out the book. There are many scenes that are tweaked from the book that honestly would've been better off keeping it the same. Sometimes while Edward is running around or whatever, you can get the feel of the big string pulling him around, but hey, that's low budget for ya. But overall, it's fun to watch it if you're a Twilight lover, which I am. I would probably see this movie again, but I still cannot entirely take it serious, and I really hope that New Moon will do a better job considering how much money they made on Twilight alone!"
"mosher920","7","2","5","4 December 2008"," Twilight
","Although definitely low budget, I felt they picked the right actors (a few choices I might have made differently). The problem was not with the actors but with the script and direction. Some might say the acting was bad but keep in mind they did what the script and director said. The script added unnecessary scenes and deleted/edited a few integral scenes. The worst part was that the script wrote out Edward's lighter side and his humor making him intensely serious. If you've read the books you'll enjoy the movie just because it is, but will be disappointed with how it was done. If you haven't read the books... well it's better to read the books or else you might end up wondering ""why?"". Overall I'd say I felt mediocre about the film excited for it's release and slightly disappointed with the result. Correct actors who did a decent job with the script and direction they had. Here's hoping ""New Moon"" sticks closer to the book and has a higher budget, a new script writer and a different director wouldn't hurt. But it won't matter anyway because Twilight fans, me included, will clamor to the theaters to see the books immortalized on film."
"trevor_nemeth","7","2","5","2 December 2008"," Twilight is a roof in need of thatching, but the cast manages to keep dry.
","Twilight was one of those rare movies I went into with no preconceived notions and only what the trailer offered for background information. Maybe that fact made it a more accessible movie for me than others. As I watch any movie I always try to bear in mind the questions (especially if it is a film adaptation of a book): Who is this movie speaking to and who is it being made for? Like many good movies with rabid devotees Twilight was targeting a certain demographic...for the most part young adult females and teenage females. After I had processed this I started to look for things that the movie brought to this target audience that they were not expecting and benefited from. For the most part, Twilight seemed to deliver on all the main issues dealt with in the book, with the obvious emphasis on the forbidden love aspect to the relationship between Edward and Bella. What I felt made the movie a convincing love story was that the main actors (Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson) managed to nuance their characters and move them away from lustful teenagers in a strange relationship into people exploring something forbidden with an obsessive desire. Kristen Stewart makes a hard to believe character believable in Bella, and Robert Pattinson adds a humanity to the character Edward that makes him relatable rather than the static one dimensional vampire he could have been. The one issue I had with the movie that I ultimately forgave was the pacing. It wasn't hard to believe that Edward and Bella were in love, it was just that the pacing of the movie was such that the audience never could fully understand how far along their relationship was. The most obvious example of this for me was towards the end in the hospital when we are to believe (for all of 8 seconds) that Bella will move to Jacksonville. I was under the impression at that point that there would be some touching interaction between Edward and Bella that would reveal what happened did not change her feelings for Edward, but what followed was an over too quickly dialog about how Edward shouldn't suggest things like that. At that point I decided that the pacing of the movie had obscured my sense of how far along I was supposed to believe their relationship was. When a movie is relatively low budget like Twilight (compared with other big screen adaptations of books) there is more pressure on the actors to deliver convincing performances, and any of this films faults were not as a result of poor acting, but rather a too brisk pacing leading the audience to sometimes fill in the blanks and suspend disbelief even more."
"kayfrog","7","2","5","30 November 2008"," Mixed-Feelings
","I went into the theater knowing it wasn't going to be a spot on adaptation of the novel, but that didn't stop me from being excited about it, nor did it stop me from leaving the theater with mixed feelings.<br/><br/>The way the scenes were shot was decent and fit the rugged/woodsy feel of Forks. Though, it did give me a headache after a while watching the camera shake up and down or side to side.<br/><br/>The adaptation wasn't bad, though I was having to explain a lot of the scenes to my mom and sister since neither read the books. I especially loved the wandering vampires (James&Co.) character build up. They left out some crucial scenes from the book and changed important ones, like the meadow scenes. <br/><br/>The cast itself... will never compare to the ones in the book, but of course humans are only humans. The Heroes: I was fairly happy with Pattinson, though I about died at his expression when Bella entered the Bio class. Bella(Stewart)... was a babbling idiot, emotionless and bored looking. Alice, I wasn't happy with. The happy, bouncy, nymph-like, I love Bella, Alice was no where to be seen. I would have loved to have heard more then one or two lines from Jasper, he was cast well. Carlisle made me cringe, too much make-up and dyed hair made him laughable, but he did play the part well. Emmet, Esme, and Rosalie were perfect. Though Rosalie's hatred for Bella was there, it wasn't explained. Charlie was wonderful, as was the high school cast. Jacob made me laugh >.> <br/><br/>The Villains: The little tidbits before they met the Cullen's on the field was fantastic. The only time were I felt like they portrayed the actual grace of the vampires that was so prevalent in the book, was when the three entered the field. James, Victoria and Laurent were awesome. I really felt the catty and wild feel of Victoria and the evil, calculating character of James. They conveyed it well. The ballet scene was wonderfully done. My only gripe was how Bella escaped her babysitters and took the cab to the studio. Then where James actually bit Bella. <br/><br/>I wasn't totally let down, and I laughed at some of the added dialog. I just wish some of the core elements of the novel had been put in the movie and the major things that were changed, remained true from the novel. I would recommend people to watch it, but to definitely read the book beforehand."
"xmudjunkies","8","2","5","28 November 2008"," This is a wonderful film for tween girls.
","I am surprised that some viewers chose to rate this film so low on the totem pole. They must first keep in mind that the books (written by Stephenie Meyer) were written with the ""tween"" girl population in mind, and I dare say that Mrs. Meyer has created a wonderfully imaginable world for her vampires and the little lamb who joined their clan. There is no grisly throat ripping, skin slashing or blood spewing to speak of, and in my opinion, the absence of those things make this movie much more acceptable for so young an age group. My daughters LOVED it, I was impressed with it myself. So, if you go see Twilight, make sure you keep in mind that this film wasn't created/directed/written by Steven Spielberg or George Lucas. If you want the full-on ""severly realistic"" vampire stuff...watch True Blood."
"alexangels","9","2","5","28 November 2008"," Not the book on screen, but still a great movie.
","I first read Twilight a few months ago because I had heard of the movie and wanted to read the book before it came to theaters. What i wasn't expecting was how addictive the books were going to be. I finished the entire series in just a few days and could not wait to see the movie. I even had a countdown that started at '70 days until Twilight'.<br/><br/>I got my friends involved with the books also. Being a movie fanatic, I basically lived on the Twilight page of IMDb for the next 70 days. I was always finding out new facts about the movie and sharing them with my classmates, who, i have to say, relied on me for those facts.<br/><br/>However, even though my friends were pretty much obsessed with the book and movie, I had to remind them that the two are separate. You cannot go see any movie that has been adapted from a book and expect it to be exactly the same. You have to realize that the basic storyline of the book is being used. Any significant story lines within the book will be put in the move, but it is impossible to include everything. This applies to the Harry Potter franchise also, not just Twilight.<br/><br/>So, when I saw Twilight in theaters, I went in with the mind set that I was just seeing a movie. Not my favorite book, word for word, on the big screen. And I have to say, I feel Summit did a great job. I think what people have to understand is that Twilight the movie is not ""Twilight the book the movie"". Many parts have to be cut from the book, or switched around, condensed, or even added to the movie. You can't go in there thinking each part of the book will go in the exact same order or be exactly the same. It would probably be a boring movie if they did that. It's still the same world Stephenie Meyer created, just not with the exact same scenes or word for word.<br/><br/>Of course I feel that both the movie and the book are primarily for girls, although some guys like them. I just don't see why guys went to see the movie thinking it was going to be a horror film when they probably didn't know anything about it.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the acting in this movie was excellent. Each actor portrayed their characters in a very believable way. For those of you who don't think so, I feel that maybe you don't know the books as well as you think you do. You have to really know each character. For example, I have seen reviews saying that Jackson Rathbone (Jasper) looked in pain the entire movie. Well, the reason for that is because his character, Jasper, was having trouble with the Cullen's way of life (drinking animal blood instead of human blood). It was also helpful to have read Midnight Sun, Twilight in Edward's perspective, before seeing the movie. It gave me a great understanding of his character that I probably wouldn't have caught on to if I hadn't read it.<br/><br/>Also, I felt the music added a great feel to the movie. I don't really know how to explain it, but I just really liked the background music. haha.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to any girl/guy that loves the series and can go see it without constantly comparing it the book. I don't recommend this to someone who has never read the books because it probably wouldn't make as much sense to them.<br/><br/>Last thing, I just wanted to say that I wasn't totally impressed the first time I saw Twilight. My friends and I actually made fun of most of it. I probably would have given it a 7/10 if I had written this right after I first saw it. But because I had promised so many people I would go see the movie with them, I was able to see the movie 4 times in theaters. Most of you Twilight-haters are probably wondering why I would ever do that..haha. But when I saw Twilight a second time, it just got better. And by the fourth time I was totally impressed by how well they had captured the feeling on screen. Could they have done a better job? Maybe. But the movie is great already. Twilight is an excellent book, and now an excellent movie. They just shouldn't be compared."
"eatingbugs@yahoo.com","7","2","5","28 November 2008"," Great - But why does it look like a film school project?
","While the movie Twilight doesn't cover *all* the heart throbbing teenage angst and romance, they did do a great job of the material the makers chose to cover. I had to swallow my original comments about Pattinson as Edward, on the whole, he did a very convincing love struck vampire, and Kristin Stewart played admirably (although her emotional gamut never seemed to stray from either awkward confusion or awkward desire).<br/><br/>The filming was, again, for the most part, a breath of fresh air. The clunky transitions and hand-held shots did make the film feel slightly more ""indie"" than Hollywood. This is where my ""school project"" beef starts however, as it did begin to feel like young punks with a camera trying to strut their stuff. Some of the camera work seemed contrived and distracting. If it was a film school project we'd have to fail the special effects fellow, as Edward's vampire jumps came complete with motion trails and the none too subtle ""whoosh"" sound effect. Somehow, blazing along the forest trails with Bella on his back he could move fast enough to incur the ""whoosh"" sound byte without causing Bella's hair to move, or to provoke even the slightest reaction out of our sedate heroine. It was also jarring to see the ""immortal"" Edward clinging for dear life to the tree tops while supposedly showing of for the more serene Bella.<br/><br/>The greatest support to my film project accusation however is in the casting. It was as if they took a classroom of actors and assigned them all roles. ""OK, you are Bella, and you would make a great Edward... lets see where we can put the rest of you..."". Particularly the Cullen family - Dr. Cullen was not the charismatic vampiric patriarch from the books, and really - that hair dye and makeup... Esme looked one step from barefoot and pregnant with three little children clinging to her knees (why not an actress like Michelle Pfeifer?). Is Hollywood so short on gorgeous blonds that they had to take a ""cute"" brunette and give her a wig to represent the siren-like 'Rosalie'? The other actors were passable (exeption Gigandet for the villain James - sorry, you couldn't pass as a high school bully). But for me the real let down was Alice. Although Ashley Greene is a good looking girl, she brought nothing to the slight nymph-like character that was supposed to be Alice.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was quite good, but also a frustration. Why, with the mountain of support of millions of readers (and their millions of dollars) could they not have taken the movie a step further and come out with an unforgettable film, instead of the B+ film school product that they ended up with?"

","i have heard twilight is better on the second viewing so i really hope the movie grows on me. i loved the series and i am glad summit got the green light for new moon. however, i wish there was a way to make up for the lack of character development and buildup for the romance that twilight was missing. the heart of twilight is the difficult love story. there just wasn't enough tension and yearning leading to the connection. it was all very rushed. also, fans do not only care about bella and edward, they love all of the characters. too much time was spent on extra scenes leading up to the arrival of the nomads who upon arrival, didn't even get enough attention.<br/><br/>i know it's nearly impossible to fit everything in, but part of why vampire lit is so appealing to moviegoers is they are either very scary or so much cooler than humans. so much more could have been done to convert nonreaders or skeptics who think this is just a silly series for teenage girls.<br/><br/>meyer's vampires are especially different and interesting. more needs to be done to highlight what makes them special. for example jasper's talent wasn't even mentioned and edward's mind reading was sort of ignored, when throughout the book, this was interesting and often humorous. i will say that i enjoyed the added scene of the cullens cooking dinner for bella. that was great, however, i hope that in new moon they stick to the book, the key points, and get to the heart of what the fans love...the love story and the characters."

","I read all four books before seeing this film, and although I would not claim to be as hardcore and devoted to the series as some, I feel I can count myself as a loyal fan. I was nervous about seeing the movie because the previews and promotional material just made it look cheesy and goofy. I was, however, pleasantly surprised by what I saw.<br/><br/>The music (Burwell's ""Bella's Lullaby,"" in particular), cinematography, and, of course, scenery were all breath-takingly gorgeous. It especially lent to the film an eerie, dreamlike quality that fits the beauty of the romance perfectly. The setting is as much a character as any of the others, and the film's use of it demonstrated that well.<br/><br/>I realize that some viewers may be upset by the tiny changes to the plot and narrative point of view the film employs. However, I think the film makers made wise decisions in translating the story to the big screen. Nothing major is changed, but a few things had to be shortened for a movie's sake. Unless someone would be especially bothered by that, I'd definitely recommend seeing ""Twilight."" It's a haunting love story the film tells well, complete with beautiful cinematography and talented actors."

","Moviegoers both book lovers and curious ones went to moviehouses to see one of the most anticipated film of the year, Twilight. But did it deliver? Did it reach the uber high expectations of Twilight lovers? For someone who haven't picked up the book and read it, the movie gave a good overview of the whole book. Everything was packed in that less than two hours film, but for people who've read and loved the book, it could be noted that the phase was too fast. It was as if they really tried to squeeze in everything, but still lacked something. Some notable parts of the book wasn't included (i.e. backstory of Alice). That's enough for the content.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the score. I must say I love the score and the music. But this is very subjective. Some might not like it, but I sure did.<br/><br/>How bout the actors and actresses? I personally liked how Robert Pattinson portrayed Edward (this sort of shy/angsty teenage vampire). Sure that wasn't how I pictured Edward, but for me it was effective enough. Kristen Stewart sort of gave Bella a different dimension. She wasn't that whiny and in the movie she kind of looked strong. Now to the bad guys, Rachelle Lefevre did an good job portraying the female villain. She looked like she could kick your ass while still looking sexy. Props to her. And Cam Gigandet (a.k.a. James), looked really dazzling. A friend of mine even told me that if a vampire looks that good, she'll let him bite her. OK enough about fan-girling. The casting department did a really good job casting Charlie, he really managed to look serious and funny at the same time. You could see the protectiveness of a dad to a young teenage girl. Team Jacob probably would have a bite on this because he didn't have enough screen time. Well given that he didn't really appear much in the book, so I guess it was justified. They better look forward for the next movie since it'll be mostly about him and his clan.<br/><br/>What's next? The special effects; I have to get this out of my system, the sparkling effect made me laugh. It wasn't how I imagined it. But given the limited budget, I'd take it. OK so now that it's out of my system time for the summary. In summary, it was an OK film, not that great but not bad as well. There are things to be improved on, but I know they'll manage to that in the next film."

Wrong. An entire English class full of middle school students arrived on a field trip to view Twilight.<br/><br/>From what I saw of the movie, it wasn't that bad. I had to put up with giggling and twittering the entire time, and I missed much of the token dialog.<br/><br/>I will say that the chemistry between the two leads is incredible, and you can palpate the tension between them throughout the movie. Hardwicke was spot on in casting Pattinson and Stewart for these roles. You don't really see enough of the characters of Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie or Emmett to make a comment on them. But Alice is most definitely Alice, and the actor chosen for Jasper hits his character on target. Can't wait to see more of them in another film. Taylor Lautner does a good job of a starstruck Jacob, and I look forward to seeing him more in New Moon.<br/><br/>The only thing I would change, if I could, besides the theater full of noisy teens who giggled every time that Edward appeared would be to flesh out the vampires a bit more. I know that they're dealing with limited screen time in the first place, but so much of this film ended up on the editing floor that it detracts from the experience.<br/><br/>Now, when I go see it again, I'll let you know whether it was as good or as bad as some people say it was. Right now, I'm riding the fence."

","After seeing the slaughter of several books turned movies, I came into Twilight with surprisingly low expectations. I am a huge fan of all four books and had been counting the days until the release of Twilight for about two years. After walking out of the midnight showing , all I could think was ""wow"". Although things from the book had been cut and changed the main story stayed true to the book. The actors were phenomenal, the story was really good, and it was very well filmed. The special effects were really the only part that didn't thrill me, as they were relatively low budget. Coming into the movie, I was worried that it would be too overly serious because most of the trailers had given that impression. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had just the right balance of comedy and drama. In fact, I found myself chuckling my way through several scenes. Although it wasn't perfect and I missed some things from the book, I found that the movie ultimately reflected the book very well and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

","I am in love with the twilight series, especially the first book. And mainly because of how much i love Edward. Hes the perfect guy. SO what if he happens to be a vampire? SOoooooooo I saw the movie and i definitely enjoyed watching it cuz its like a summary of the book that u get to see and kinda relive reading it, but it doesn't compare one bit. I mean, first off, that was the worst actor to play Edward. He was not a good actor, he sounded like he was reading from the script the whole time. And, I picture Edward to be tough and protective and just so sweet, and this guy, i don't know, just didn't portray it that way. Sure he can stop a truck and do all the Edward in the book things, but it looked so fake cuz he was such a skinny dork. And again a really bad actor. In my opinion. The Bella actress was pretty good, but i think he ruined the scenes so much that no actress could recover th magic that i picture them having between them. And since the movie is so much shorter they rush the whole relationship with Edward and Bella that u cant fully appreciate the chemistry between them like in the book. So, what i have been telling everyone is they can not see the movie before they read the book. If u do, u cant fully appreciate it and u will think that it really is nothing special and there is no point to read the book. But since i love the book so much, it was just fun to watch it and relive it and add my own imagination to it since i know what the author was trying to make us feel!"

","I never read any of the books that this movie was based on and to be honest wasn't really aware of them.But once I heard it was being made I was interested in finding out more about it. I read different things about this film and even read the original screen play was nothing like the book and fans and maybe even the author wasn't happy about that.Then read the script was re written and closer to the novel. Since i never read it or was that familiar with it I was able to watch it for what it was. And what I saw I liked! I was impressed.At first when Edward fled the school for a few days because he was put off by her for some odd reason after seeing Bella I was thinking it was a little pathetic.But again I never read the book so I accepted it and was captivated by what was gonna happen next. As the story picked up and the characters were all introduced it got interesting and kept me glued to the screen.There were a few characters at the school who annoyed me but when the Cullens came on the scene it got good,especially the handsome & sexy Edward(Robert Pattinson).I thought Kristen and Robert played the parts of Bella & Edward very well.They were convincing in their feelings for each other,especially Kristen.I really felt her subtle fear of him and strong attraction for him and how she was afraid to lose him.Even though I never read the book I get what it is basically about. It's about a girl falling in love with a hot guy who was dark, mysterious & sparkly but who turns out to be a vampire! He hides who he really is but she figures it out.And while they are figuring out how to be together the vampire was attracted to the scent of her blood, and having a real hard time restraining himself from killing her. And this is exactly what the movie portrays.I also enjoyed all the other characters and stories like the feud between the 2 groups of vampires,and the American Indian mythology. I am looking forward to seeing the sequels and am interested now in reading the books."

","Okay. I entered the theater in full knowledge of the fact that I was going to be disappointed. I was justified <br/><br/>The Content<br/><br/>This aspect was actually very good. Having read all of the books at least three times each I had a very good understanding of the plot and themes. The film left out many things, but most adaptations do. On the whole, the film managed to convey a lot of the book and made it flow very well. It included many crucial, strong direct quotes and the dialogue managed to properly tell the story. However, it was not efficiently delivered by the ""actors.""<br/><br/>The Cast<br/><br/>Could have been about ten THOUSAND times better. First of all, Kristin Stewart? Really? After her exceedingly flawed, mediocre performance in The Messangers, she was the cast member I was least looking forward to watching. Her deliverance in the hospital scene was terrible. I wanted to gag. Her voice wheezed, not in a cute, awkward way that might have been interpreted as her personality, but in a severe asthmatic, dungeons and dragons nerd way. She even snorted on a couple of lines she tried to say with ""emotion."" Also, many of the characters who were supposed to be drop-dead gorgeous looked like spring rejects from a JC Penny catalogue. They lacked strong, dominant features or even proportionate facial icons. Alice, for instance, was not a cute, pixie-like angel. Instead, she looked old enough to be the clans middle-aged mother. The cast mother, Esme, did not look loving at all, but rather like a desperate housewife who smoked too much. All of the characters were poorly represented with the exception of Jasper Cullen. He, with the least lines, delivered what was, to me, an outstanding performance. His face, while a bit comical, was alert and hyperaware whenever he was at school and managed to convey his damaged soul with an acute sensitivity. He was beautiful and regal, as the other actors/actresses should have been. Kudos.<br/><br/>The Cinematography<br/><br/>By far the worst aspect of the film. The angles, the special effects, the whole works were underdeveloped and terrible. It looked like a couple of 12-year-olds got a hold of a second-rate camcorder and some bungie cords. I think this whole catastrophe could have been avoided if the greedy producers had taken their time, instead of taking advantage of the millions of worldwide fans eagerness to see their favorite novel emulated on screen. ""Gee,"" they thought, hands in their pocketbooks, ""These lovesick teenage girls are going to come see this movie whether we take eight months or two years on it. Why not skip useless junk like proper editing and line memorization and just stick out tomorrow!?"" <br/><br/>I was surprised, to say the least, and will not be returning to the theater to see the rest of the series. If curiosity compels me, I'll rent them for four dollars more than they're worth."
"MsSharkBait","6","2","5","24 November 2008"," Liked it, but did not LOVE it...
","Well, I have so far read the first three books and am in love with the series. As others have said, I expected that the movie would not be as good as the book - which we were all correct. That said, I wasn't overly disappointed.<br/><br/>I actually liked Robert and Kristen as Edward and Bella. It was just so unfortunate that the filmmakers did not spend more time building their relationship. I agree with previous posters that for those who have not read the books, it would be hard to believe why they are so ""in love"" (though, they never say ""i love you"") with each other. Yeah - Why didn't they say ""I love you?"" But.. I did like Kristen's (Bella's) reaction in the hospital to Edward when he was saying they should be apart. I think that she will act out Bella's depressed part well if there is a second movie (New Moon).<br/><br/>I was actually bummed that there wasn't more scenes with Bella interacting with Jessica, Mike and friends. Also.. I wish I could have seen some Bella and Alice scenes. Even a scene with Alice helping Bella get ready for the prom. They are supposed to be such close friends that in New Moon (possible second movie) when Alice comes to Bella, Bella is so excited to see her (a not so disappointed that it wasn't Edward). For those of us that have read the books, when watching the movies, the character development is a not as necessary since we already know the characters... but what about people that haven't read the books. The movie dos not portray how important each character is.<br/><br/>I know it didn't necessarily fit into the film, but I wish there would have been a mention to why Rosalie didn't like Bella. Even just the simple statement that Rosalie was once intended for Edward - which was mentioned in the Twilight book.<br/><br/>I would like to see the movie more true to the book, but since it wasn't - I hope the possible second movie isn't all Bella and Jacob like New Moon was. I'd rather spend my time watching Bella and Edward scenes."
"jgrech-1","6","2","5","23 November 2008"," It was O.K., rushed/thin plot.
","I took my girlfriend to see this movie, because she is a huge fan of the novel. She told me the movie was pretty close to the actual book, but I could not help feeling that the acting coming from a few of the main actors was just lazy. The guy that played Edward did a great job in my opinion. His acting seemed to be the only bit that had any effort put into it. Oh well. girlfriend was happy in the, which means that I am happy. I would say it is bearable if any other guys out there are considering taking their girlfriends as well. Action sequences were nice, but to short. But in the end as I said before, everything felt rushed. At one point it kinda makes sense, then if feels like what should have taken 45 minutes to occur in the movie only took 35 seconds. Other than that, just expect decent acting from most of the characters, and a thin plot. Everything else is fine though. Hope this helps!"
"sferreira21","Null","2","5","23 November 2008"," Twilight
","I really have to disagree with the film not missing anything. There was a lot of information from the book not shown in the film. It is absolutely reasonable because the book is over 500 pages long.<br/><br/>I did like the film, but it just wasn't as great as the book. There were things in the film that we absolutely in correct. For example, the dance that Mike and everyone was talking about first was not Prom. First, Mike asked Bella to go to the spring dance and that's when Bella used the excuse of going away for the weekend. Also, I really didn't like how the scene of the meadow was rushed. That is an extremely important part in the book when Bella confronts Edward about what he truly is. I think that the film could have elaborated a little more on these important parts. The book is about their unconditional love and how are people supposed to see that when everything is being rushed just to get into the James scene.<br/><br/>I hope that the next film will be a little bit better after they have seen the great outcome of Twilight on opening weekend. I would love to see them elaborate on the next books."
"sheereenrox","6","2","5","23 November 2008"," Very good, but didn't quite stay true to the book...
","The movie proved in a way that they would stay true to the book, by keeping most of the characters that were in the book, but lost the deep emotional romance between Bella and Edward, due to the fast-forward speed of the movie. It merely looked like Bella & Edward had really nothing to build up between them, but I partially blame that to the very little dialogue that was used in the movie. Some of the MOST important scenes in the book were removed in the movie, such as the story of Carlisle and how he became a vampire, and the meadow scene had very little dialogue between Bella and Edward, and was ordered in a strange way... The first kiss was shared in Bella's bed instead of in the meadow, which felt like there was something completely missing... The music corresponding to the movie did not fit well at all, and I would recommend they use more Coldplay, Muse, and more of Stephenie Meyer's choices for songs than Patsava's. The lullaby was never hummed by Edward, but blended in a treetop scene and his piano scene that looked like he was playing in an attic. Not nearly enough emphasis on Alice, Jasper, Rosalie, Emmett and Esme, which was sad... But overall, it was very impressive acting by Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, although she did overact in some scenes, but warning to Twilight fans! THE MOVIE IS DEFINITELY not equivalent to the book on the big screen... I am hopeful that with the bigger budget, that they will make New Moon much better...."
"restless_spirit1313","6","2","5","21 November 2008"," Not As Bad As It Could Have Been
","Let me say first, while I enjoyed the books, I am not an over-obsessed fan-girl. They were entertaining, and of the four the first one was my favorite.<br/><br/>Going into this movie, I had some very low expectations. The trailers had disappointed me, and I was concerned about some of the actors. Thankfully, I was proved mostly wrong.<br/><br/>The good news first: they stayed true to the book. They didn't go all crazy or huge blockbuster, and in doing so loose the plot. I was pleasantly surprised by most of the actors, especially Robert Pattinson. I think he did a decent job of playing Edward. He pulled off the restrained parts, and was just emotional enough to be believable in the tenser parts. We didn't see much of Taylor Lautner as Jacob in this one, but the scenes he was in he did well in.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, where there is good there is also bad, and there is one glaring error the filmmakers made in creating this film: casting Kristen Stewart as Bella. Some of you will probably say that I'm only saying that because I wish I was Bella. I don't. Team Jacob all the way here. Anyways, she lacks the emotion required for many of the scenes, and she has the exact same look on her face for the entire film. I was very disappointed by her performance.<br/><br/>So, overall, a surprisingly good film, with the potential to be an 8 or 9 if you can cut Kristen Stewart out of the role of Bella. Because of her unbelievably awful performance, Twilight only earned a 6/10 from me."

","I've read the books and really enjoyed them! The movie was so close to the books in most ways, but the best thing about the movie was the humour! It was hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing (probably at parts that weren't supposed to be laughed at, which leads me into my next point). Most of the scenes were very awkward, but in a way that you can completely relate to. I watched it and it totally reminded me of when I was in high school and the people there and how lame conversations can be or how you just can't seem to get the words out that you want to say. Of course, there were extremely cheesy lines that should only be saved for books read for guilty pleasure, but all in all I give this movie an 8/10! Solid effort!"

","Sometimes it happens. To everyone.<br/><br/>It happens to be comfortably sitting on some velvet chairs of a fancy multiplex and start thinking:""What the heck am I doing here?!"". It happens to watch one of those ¬ñsoon 9.99 Blockbusters- hyper advertised movies and end up wondering how can people really spend money for such crap and why do people complain for the low level of TV broadcasters when they ¬ñwe?- massively populated absurdly useless screenings in cinemas.<br/><br/>What does not happen so often, luckily, is to feel a real physical pain while watching a movie. But let us not go too fast.<br/><br/>The story was quite commercial since the beginning, I know, but this did not mean that it was forcely impossible to make a good 2-hours-and-something movie out of that. Obviously you all know that it was not the case for Twilight.<br/><br/>A seventeen years old teenager just moved to live with her father in Fork ¬ña forgotten place in the middle of USA ¬ñ because her mother had to follow her new love, a baseball player. Her arrival in town means some of those usual things we are all used to watch in American movies since we were born, embarrassing moment with her dad and strange behavior of new schoolmates included. But, as the movie is not about the personal crisis of an underage living in a new place, the story rapidly steers.<br/><br/>And I say rapidly because, from the first ten minutes onwards, the director literally take the hands of the spectators and leads them into one of the most artificial, obvious and extraordinarily cheap plots I have ever happened to follow.<br/><br/>The girl ¬ñ AnnaBella ¬ñ catches the attention of the most strange guy in school who is mysterious, cute and different from the others enough to let everyone understand since the first shot that yes, he will be the co-protagonist. Coup de theatre, we almost immediately discover that he is a vampire, but a good one. That he has superpowers but do not use any for spying Laetitia Casta under the shower. That he loves human blood but he calls himself vegetarian because he drinks only animals one. Enough to push you already out of the room? It can get worse, hold on a second more.<br/><br/>The atomic duo fight against their feelings ¬ñ for some 3-4 minutes, not more ¬ñ and start getting into deep and intellectual discussions as: ¬ÑHow old are you? Seventeen. For how long have you been Seventeen? For a while.""(...)<br/><br/>Or: ¬ÑI am the most evil predator in the world. No, you are not, I can see it""..and so on..<br/><br/>Suddenly some bad vampires jump on the scene and, for some unexplained ancient rule, they start hunting the human-wanna-be-vampire for killing her and tasting her blood. End of the story, the evil ones are defeated ¬ñ but not completely so...get ready to Twilight 2!- and the two romantic freaks swear each other eternal love.<br/><br/>Now, seriously, what was the need to produce such a movie?<br/><br/>Every time the carachters started to speak I had the unstoppable desire of going to the police and sue the director ¬ñ lucky him I did not even remember his name ¬ñ: poor dialogs, meaningless soundtrack and a cast made probably by amateurs completed the masterpiece.<br/><br/>I know that advertising is the most powerful push anyone can have to do something nowadays and I see how the whole thing worked out perfectly for this waste of time named Twilight but, seriously, during the time I have been sitting ¬ñ and disturbing people sitting next to me -I had the feeling of being fooled or definitely taken as a huge dumb ass from the director.<br/><br/>I am sorry to say such things as I am sorry to spit on someone else's work but, as some wiseman said in a movie I watched when I was a little kid ¬ÑSome people was born for studying and some for working in fields"".

"xxcurlyqchickxx","9","4","15","21 November 2008"," Captured the essence of the book
","Let me start out by saying: Yes I have read the Twilight series, and because of this you could probably consider me somewhat bias. Before you totally disregard this review though, my boyfriend, and brother both went to the movie with me, (neither of them have read the books)and both of them had many of the same views as I did on the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is not exactly like the books, but this is understandable as the book is somewhere around 400 pages and the budget for this particular film was on the lower end. Having said that, I think that the result is impressive especially when the limitations are considered.<br/><br/>I think that they did a good job finding a middle ground to appease fans of the book, and also new viewers. They provided enough background information for people who have never read the story before, and yet they did not ""Spell it out"" so much that previous fans would be bored.<br/><br/>The special effects were kind of lacking, but this is to be lacking with the budget. Some of the scenes felt a little rushed, but this is also understandable as they managed to fit in the majority of important scenes into the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was a lot funnier than I was expecting, and many fans had a problem with this as the book is portrayed very dramatically. I think the humor and moments of awkwardness fit the story, as first love is often that way.<br/><br/>Having giving you my review, I will also add that both my boyfriend and brother enjoyed the movie. I was very surprised by how much they both liked it, as I was ""given heck"" over the past two weeks for dragging them to it. Upon exiting the theater though, they agreed that they would give the movie about a 4 on a scale of 1-10, and that they would be up for seeing sequels were they to be made.<br/><br/>In closing: The book is different than the movie. I think the movie captures the essence of the books, and does a good job at converting a book to the big screen. All I can say is: go into the theater with an open mind as I did, and I guarantee you will enjoy it that much more."

","I do not understand why this movie is getting all the negative criticism that it is getting. It is actually a very awesome movie. Sure it is not your traditional vampire movie. True the vampires do not burn to a crisp when sunlight hits them in this movie. And yes, there is also a love story element added to the mix. But hey, that is what makes this movie different from other vampire movies. It has some originality to it. In most vampire films, their is usually no love story element added to it, and the vampires get burned to a crisp when hit by sunlight or ultraviolet produced by some mechanical devices. And they are usually if not always very gory. But not this movie. There is a little bit of blood in this movie. But not the amount that a traditional vampire movie has. But nevertheless, it is very good. Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson were absolutely amazing. This movie is a must see."

I'm certainly glad I was completely unaware that this was based on a book as most of the negative comments here seem to be from people who complain about changes. I can say, that not knowing the original, this story flowed just fine.<br/><br/>If you have a good film taste. The movie has great acting, beautiful scenery, and one of the best scores ever written for a film. .... Absolutely delightful! I just hope the November comes faster as the sequel New Moon come out!

"mpdgb","4","3","10","24 November 2008"," Pretty bad, but fans of the book will want to see it anyway.
","Is there anything more a director can ask for than millions of people really, really wanting to love their movie? That's how I felt when I went to see Twilight but unfortunately, the movie fell hopelessly short. I don't think my expectations were too high, in fact, I was quite willing to make allowances...movies are rarely on par with their literary counterparts. What I wasn't prepared for were the horrible production values that made the movie seem like it was made by amateurs.<br/><br/>As the movie ended, I heard someone in the row behind us say ""wow, that was really bad acting"". Well, I don't know if it was the acting or the screenplay, but something was really off! There were very few instances of dialog that actually seemed natural. Surprisingly, most of them involved the supporting characters, such as Jessica in the dress store and the Cullens making dinner.<br/><br/>I don't think that the tension between Edward and Bella at the start of their relationship was nearly as apparent as in the book. This was a major downfall in the movie because it didn't give a good enough sense of the conflicts that Edward was facing and the danger that Bella was in.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson looked the part of Edward, except for the really dreadful make-up he was wearing. It was quite distracting, particularly the lipstick! Kristen Stewart was an O.K. Bella...she's very pretty, but her acting was just a little too flat for my taste. I saw no evidence of great chemistry, but maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the special effects as much as some other reviewers. I thought they were acceptable, and Edward 'sparkled' well enough.<br/><br/>Another glaring flaw, IMHO, was the music and editing at the end of the movie. What was THAT? It felt like the end of a TV episode...in the 90s! It was so hokey and undramatic that it certainly didn't leave me wanting more.<br/><br/>In the end, fans of the book have flocked to see this movie regardless of bad reviews. The creators of the movie should not see this as a major success. Yes, they did some things right, but were it not for the existing fan base, I don't think they would be seeing the same numbers at the box office. I hope that if they do make a sequel, they'll do a much better job, because next time, we'll all be a little wiser."

","Seventeen-year-old Isabella ""Bella"" Swan moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, to live with her father. There, she finds herself drawn to a mysterious classmate, Edward Cullen, who is revealed to be a 108-year-old vampire but is physically seventeen. Although Edward discourages the romance at first, they soon fall deeply in love. When the arrival of three nomadic vampires puts Bella's life in danger, Edward and his family put their lives at stake to save her.<br/><br/>You may question yourself now, ""What is with this hype?"", ""Have the world gone mad?"", or even ""Should I even see this?"" You don't know what this is all about but you're curious. This is where I come in, and other millions of reviews you can read to gain answers from these questions and even millions more. No, I have not read the books. Actually, I have chosen to try to watch movies before I read their original sources because comparing the two can cause huge problems. *cough*Harry Potter*cough* No, I'm not a fan, so I WAS in the same boat as you. To start this off, I wasn't looking forward to this film. So why did I see this? My brother read the book and wanted to see the movie. But now I can say I left the theater with a huge smile on my face.<br/><br/>So what is this hype? It's nothing different than the ""Harry Potter"" frenzy and any other frenzy you can think of (LotR, Star Wars, etc). This is basically a vampire love story for this year's generation, and I'm part of it (which might be another reason the movie appealed to me). So what's different about this than other vampire love stories? I guess it has to deal with the young cast, which gives off a hint of freshness, if you ask me. No doubt, the target demographic for this film are the fans of the books, plus millions of teenage girls. If you're not apart of it, well, I guess you can do yourself a favor and skip this movie. It's not for you. Howver, there is a small chance for teenage guys and people who haven't read the books but are curious to see this movie to like the film. Hello, I'm one of them so take that risk if you will.<br/><br/>The love story presented in the movie has a timeless feel to it. I'm a sentimental fellow so it's no surprise I was brought into it very quickly. However, that doesn't mean the movie is flawless. There are some moments in the film that is just downright cheesy and awkward. Take this scene, for example: The first time Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson meet each other is awkward, but this is probably a bad example because I think it was supposed to be that way. There are some lines in here that was also very awkward and cheesy. There's one about heroine. You don't want to know. But apart from those flaws, the film does a great job giving us a fantastic romance.<br/><br/>A high point in this film is, surprisingly, the performances by almost everyone in the movie. Judging by the movie trailer, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson might give off some bad vibes but that's because you're not watching the movie as a whole. Trust me, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson both give off some fantastic performances, not to mention a great chemistry. The supporting cast also do a very great job as well, for what they're given.<br/><br/>The music choices for this movie is very weird, but you'll get used to it. It's a mix of rock and perhaps Gothic (I couldn't tell, exactly). The direction by Catherine Hardwicke does a great job showing us some fantastic views of nature. In total, I was swept away by four fantastic sequences in the movie. I won't tell you because it'll ruin the surprise. One thing that bothered me about this film was that, and it may be just me, the film should've gotten a better distributer because the film looks low budget compared to other film adaptations and it is (a budget of about $37 million). I just wished that the film could've gotten a more well known distributer so that it could've gotten a bigger budget so the film would look less amateur and better special effects. Like I said, it may be only me.<br/><br/>Overall, the film surprised me big time, surpassing way over my expectations and probably some other people that are going to see it too. If you're a fan of the books and/or a teenage girl, there's no doubt you should see this movie. If you're not, you probably will not like the movie, although there's still a small chance that this miracle can happen. If you're one of those people who feels like it's the end of the world because of this huge fan base and this huge success for this movie, don't complain because we all know this movie isn't for you so just stop whining that there will be an apocalypse. In the end, this movie is basically a huge setup for the next three movies (hopefully, they will get made) but that's not a bad thing because you get a great romance with a fantastic showdown in the end."
"mlraymond","8","3","10","23 November 2008"," Liked it a lot more than I anticipated
","I am a 55 year old guy without any kids, so my knowledge of what teenagers are reading is pretty limited. I only heard of Twilight a few months ago, and was intrigued, since I've always been a horror movie fan, from my own teenage years.<br/><br/>I went without a lot of expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. The two young leads were very believable in their odd romance, and the whole rainy, fog drenched Pacific Coast setting was beautiful to see. I found the pacing and editing good, the effects adequate and the acting pretty good throughout. I especially liked the hyper teen friends and the strong but silent police chief father, who seemed so natural in his interactions with his growing daughter, almost a stranger to him.<br/><br/>There are some really great comic moments and funny lines, that I cannot quote without giving away plot points, so all I'll say is to pay attention to the dialog and you'll hear some really unexpectedly hilarious lines. The sequence where a nervous Bella meets Edward's family for the first time is priceless.<br/><br/>The movie is highly romantic and should please fans of supernatural love stories. It is first and foremost a love story, not a horror film, and should be seen in that light.<br/><br/>Give this movie a chance, and you might be surprised by how entertaining it is."
"flatspin-1","8","3","10","23 November 2008"," I liked it, but felt it should have gone longer to get it perfect.
","I went first thing Friday (had to work midnight Thurs) to see Twilight, which I had been anxiously waiting for. I was not disappointed by the casting choices, I thought Rob Pattinson was a great choice for Edward, and he did not disappoint in the looks or the acting - I thought he really put a lot of emotion into it. I was also happy with the rest of the Cullens and with the nomads - they all seemed to fit with what I had expected from the book. Kristen Stewart was a good choice for Bella as far as looks, and her chemistry with Rob is electric. However, I have seen several of her films, and as with the others, she just seems to be unable to bring a lot of emotion to the parts - it comes out looking like she is just going through the motions - sort of monotone. I would blame this on the script, had I not seen her other work. It's not bad, just not great. I liked how well they kept to the book, although I think they cut out too much of the development of Edward and Bella's relationship. I felt like they really rushed through all of that - I think had they gone another 20-30 minutes they could have really brought that out and made it more believable. A lot of the school/biology class , parking lot and lunchroom stuff was left out, and I felt this was all part of their relationship building. I also would have liked to have seen more of the Cullens. Overall, I really liked it though. Considering the budget they were working under, I think it was excellent. With what I believe will be a much bigger budget for New Moon, I expect a little more next time. However, I think they will need to find a way to have Edward's character in it more than the book allows in order to get the big draw for that one. I think he is the one who holds the hearts of the crowd. I do look forward to it, though and will be seeing Twilight again at least once more. I definitely recommend it, just wish it had been longer and shown more character development."
"Chris Knipp","7","3","10","22 November 2008"," Varieties of vampire experience
","Say you're feeling like a misfit in school; how about finding a vampire to be your boyfriend or girlfriend? Vampires, after all, are misfits too--big time--but their alienation is offset by special powers you lack, such as superhuman strength and the ability to live for centuries. A friend like that sets you apart from the crowd. The rich possibilities of teenage vampire romance are illustrated by two new movies, 'Twilight' and 'Let the Right One In.' Different as they are, they satisfy similar adolescent fantasies. Maybe for different adolescents.<br/><br/>'Twilight,' directed by Catherine Hardwicke, of 'Thirteen' and 'Lords of Dogtown,' is a story primarily for teenage girls. It's based on the first of Stephanie Meyer's bestsellers about the relationship that develops at a Washington State high school between a new girl in the junior class named Bella (Kristen Stewart) and, as the high girls unnecessarily spell it out to Bella, ""totally gorgeous"" undead teenager Edward Cullen. He's a student; so are several of his siblings. Of course the other students don't know the Cullens are vampires; it is left to Bella make the discovery after she and Edward fall for each other. Young female readers of the books have been suggesting their various ""perfect"" candidates to play the role of this heartthrob (see YouTube)--Hayden Christensen, Gaspard Uliiel and Josh Hartnett were favorites--but the choice for the movie has fallen on Robert Pattinson. Meyer has published three sequels, so if the movie opener does well this could be a franchise on the order of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>'Twilight' glamorizes and softens vampire-hood and makes it upper middle class. Edward's foster father's the Washington State town's main doctor. The family drives cool late-model cars and lives in a splendid airy pad up in the misty hills. None of the old lugubrious Addams Family heavy-curtained look. The Cullens are hip, PC vampires. When Edward tells Bella about himself, he explains they're ""like vegetarians,"" abstaining (though with difficulty) from human blood and living instead off deer from the woods. They like the Pacific Northwest because of all the rain--the perpetual ""twilight""--but it's not because sunshine will make them burst into flames, only that it makes them glow with a diamond-like digitalized surface on their skin that will reveal them to be ""different."" Edward shows Bella when they're up in the woods. Their relationship is chaste--perhaps to avoid the danger of Edward's inadvertently pouncing on Bella and biting her neck. They don't even kiss on the mouth till the end. Edward's concerned because he doesn't want to get involved with Bella--it could cause them both a world of harm (like premarital intercourse?).<br/><br/>The prim, nobly suffering Edward is like a superhero, a pale, romantically high-cheek-boned version of a blockbuster clich√©. He can jump across a parking lot to stop a skidding SUV from injuring Bella. In one of the movie's most whimsical sequences, he takes Bella flying up in the trees near his family's house to admire the river and the mist. Trouble comes when it turns a rival vampire family of the old-fashioned homicidal kind has invaded the region.<br/><br/>Bella has all kinds of conflicts--and Kristen Stewart is reasonably good at making them seem real. She's left her remarried mother in Arizona and gone back to live with dad, Forks, WA's lonely, rather boring town sheriff. Her regular human classmates are that he is, doesn't want Bella to get involved with him. But in a cliff-hanger at the film's end, she begs him to ""turn"" her, and he refuses--at the high school prom! This is glossy, somehow conventional and kitschy stuff, with clunky characterization and some blatant makeup. Why the Cullens need to play baseball (at superhuman speed) in a thunderstorm is never explained. And the fudging on classic rules of vampire-hood seems unjustified. Pattinson's wooden acting--no better than Christensen or Hartnett's would have been--is only compensated by many tight closeups of his immaculate and chiseled face. Nonetheless Twilight is still lively and fun, and not at all bad, really; Hardwicke has a good touch with young people. This is what the squealing girls wanted: a glamorization and gentrification of vampires into a boyfriend who's noble and ""different"" and cool and scary. The ""Twilight' stories are an interesting pop phenomenon that it's no use fighting.<br/><br/>Swedish indie director Tomas Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' is at the opposite pole. It's dark and down-and-dirty and surprisingly realistic--and at the same time more authentically strange. The supernatural effects are simple and understated. One vampire, a newly-turned who doesn't at all like who she's become, commits suicide by having her husband open the shade and let the sun in: she explodes into flames and is burnt away. Alfredson doesn't mess with or tone down the harsh rules of vampire life.<br/><br/>'Let the Right One In' is Swedish, after all--from a country that's all twilight. This is a complex, ironic tale of a small blond 12-year-old boy names Oskar (K√•re Hedebrant) living in the outskirts of Stockholm who gets cruelly picked on by classmates and fantasizes revenge, standing in his room fondling a small dagger, as we first see him. Soon he's befriended by a mysterious new neighbor, Eli (Lina Leandersson), a lanky-haired girl who hangs around outdoors in the cold without needing a coat. She likes him, and he asks her to be his girlfriend. Over time, he realizes she's a vampire, but he doesn't care. There's nothing glamorous about Eli's life. When Oskar sees her flat, he says, ""You're like poor, right?"" Her dad is a loser and knows it. His efforts to kill people and get their blood are practical and utilitarian, but also fumbled failures. She may be able to help Oskar--and she does, both physically, at a crucial moment, and psychologically, by encouraging him to fight back. But she herself is doomed. No sequels planned."

","Isabella Swan: (to Edward) ""I know what you are. You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale white, and ice cold.""<br/><br/>And a vampire. That piece of information is not a spoiler because almost every teenage girl knows the impossibly popular Twilight novel series by Stephanie Meyer is about 17-year-old Isabella Swan's love for 17-year-old Edward Cullen, a very handsome vampire. Oh, the longing. I forgot the teenage angst that feeds off a benign, unfulfilled lust for the opposite sex, whom the nuns made us fear as if girls were vampires. Twilight does as well as any film could in figuratively embodying the Romeo-and-Juliet-like difficulties of connecting temporarily, for a lifetime, or for eternity as is the case of the heroes in this enjoyable if emotionally overcooked romance.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the delightful plot possibilities of a Washington state town called Forks, near Port Angeles, is an interesting family of mild-mannered vampires with some intriguing story possibilities, even some laughs. After all, the figurative living dead have always peopled our offices and audiences, so why not the real thing? It's only when director Catherine Hardwicke lingers over the hero and heroine with their painful stares of desire that you may wish for some stock vampire stuff to relieve the tedium. In fact, I am beginning to long myself for the hammy other Bella, Lugosi that is, as Dracula (1931), or Max Schreck's visually- haunting Nosferatu (1929), to satisfy my yearning for outright scary bloodsucking. The movement to defang, so to speak, some of our most enduring genres (James Bond, Spiderman, and Batman come to mind in the superhero category) by getting deeper into brooding, realistic characterization is taking away the conventional titillations such as fangs and frilly femmes in vampire movies and gadgets and sleazy ladies in the Bond franchise.<br/><br/>In other words, sometimes I like cheesy, and Twilight is not that enough. What it does well is take a cloudy, forbidding Washington and make it romantic through the magic of aerial photography and true romance, albeit it of the adolescent type. The film advances the accepted interpretation of vampirism as unbridled lust and civilizes it to where desire can be seen as just another controllable emotion, not a life-threatening obsession. Hardwicke successfully navigates teens' brooding emotions.<br/><br/>""One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach. All the damn vampires."" Last line of The Lost Boys."

"arielkerr7","10","3","11","25 November 2008"," yeah. I disagree
","I think the only reason someone would say that is because they didn't get or understand the movie. I loved it! I have read the book and am on the fourth and for a low budget film the special affects were great and the lead actors really caught the main characters. Sure there could have been a little more romance between Edward and Bella shown, and they shouldn't have done a close up on the characters, and the camera zoomed around to fast sometimes. But those were minor things that I got past quickly as I enjoyed the movie and let it sink in. The action/fight scene could have been longer but it was still good and I think it was short due to the budget. Maybe the budget affected their amount of time or film that they had in the camera. I have already seen this movie twice and am proudly taking a group of friends in 2 weeks to see it again. I give this movie ten stars! It's gotta be better than High School Musical 3. I heard that didn't do so well. Thats just my opinion though. New moon has gotten the green light and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing it. I think the movie was very entertaining, and had a good pace. Obviously it sounds like you guys set your expectations to high for a low budget film. Or tried to compare the book to the movie. Don't do that. I loved the baseball scene, the fight scene, the characters, the prom scene, everything! This movie is geared toward people of ALL ages. How old is your daughter? Maybe she was to young. The movie is not always going to be the same as the book. Maybe your son didn't like it because it was a romance. If that's the case take him to a horror movie next time that will give him nightmares for a few weeks. Being sarcastic obviously."
"ceilidhlwc29","9","3","11","23 November 2008"," surprisingly worth it
","ALRIGHT here goes! i've never read any of the twilight series, nor do i know a ton about them. however, my best friend has them all and is reasonably obsessed.. so for her birthday we went and saw it. i have to admit, it was pretty decent actually. after she explained the basics of the story i was kinda hesitant, thinking it was gonna be a really lame love story. but it wasn't at all. it wasn't really cheesy, or clich√© (although a few cheese moments exist, i'll give it that).. it was actually a nice story. Edward was a little over the top a couple times but i thought Bella was awesome, much like the rest of the cast. however, it's apparently ""not as good as the book"". truthfully i think that's a matter of opinion. everyone who has read it, or even knows anything about it outside of the movie, obviously imagined the characters, the scenery, the interactions, all in their own way. to say that the movie ""wasn't even close"" i think is a bit of a low blow. most of the people that i know that have read the books and have seen the movie, say that although it was DIFFERENT than the book, the story line was pretty true to form and that most things still fell in the right places. people, don't go in there expecting word for word book to movie lines. keep in mind, they had to condense a 550 page long book into a 2 hour movie -- and i think they did a hell of a job. i walked away from the movie knowing the history of the characters, the storyline, the possible things to come... and in all fairness, i'm a little excited for the next one. whether you've read the books or don't have a clue, it's definitely worth seeing. and for those ""twilighters"" who are planning on finding out if their favourite line is in the movie, maybe you should change your expectations. try appreciate it for what it is -- just a really cool story."
"dmccor1","10","3","11","22 November 2008"," Well worth the wait!
","Here's what I enjoyed the most: 1)the chemistry between Rob & Kristen!!! SO HOT!! 2)THE KISS!!! (and was that an accident Rob hitting the wall? OUCH!) 3)Rosalie's attitude toward Bella was dead on! 4)slowly introducing the ""baddies"" 5)Dr. McSparkle!! 6)Bella narrating the movie, it made me feel like I was reading it 7)the first Biology scene especially (I liked them all) but with the owl behind Edward making him look like the fallen angel she thinks him as, and Rob did awesome portraying Edward's pain and suffering sitting next to her!! It was like that R.E.M. video...(Losing my religion) 8)Billy Burke did an awesome job portraying Charlie!! 9)Victoria was awesome! I loved at the end how she was at the prom and she was getting worked up watching B&E below dancing in the gazebo outside! She lets her hair down and then it fades to black and white and the credits roll!!! AWESOME!!! Then you hear Linkin Park!! And if you stayed for the credits, you saw the scenes from the movie playing again but in black and white. HOT!!! 10)I thought the makeup was good, could have been better because at times it seemed too caked on. (like on Dr. Cullen in his introductory scene) 11)The contacts were awesome!! I want some red ones! 12)I kinda liked how they went surfing instead of hiking at La Push. Would've liked to have seen the tide pools though... 13)Jessica and Mike was awesome! Angela was cool, I liked how she was chatty and girlie-girl. And I loved her reaction when Bella showed up with Edward at school when they were official! And she and Jessica's reaction in Port Angeles before they got in her car!! Priceless! 14) no Lauren!! 15) ""You better hold on tight, Spider Monkey!!"" Loved them going up into the trees for an intimate conversation! 16) Stephenie Meyer's little cameo at the diner (behind the Macbook at the bar with the red hair) after Chief Swan and hunting party are searching for the killer in the woods with the search dogs. <br/><br/>And things that left a bad taste in my mouth: 1)Edward sparkling in the sun (not as cool of an effect as I hoped, but it was still okay) It was pretty blurry. 2)the jeep was not like a monster truck size jeep like in the book 3)Bella getting away from Jasper and Alice so easily from the hotel!! 4)Bella's mom was too plain, and the extreme close-ups of her when she's at Bella's hospital bedside made me squirm. 5)I wanted to see them ""pet"" each other in the meadow like in the book. In the book, he was shirtless and she rubs his arm... 6)the accident scene still irritates me, where was the ice? Why didn't Bella's truck have chains on the tires? What was with Edward jumping over the truck after? I didn't see Bella hit her head!! Edward didn't have to move her legs or anything as it hit a second time-there was no second time. And the accident happened AFTER school in the movie??? It was in the morning in the book!! WTC???!!! 7) Jacob! Taylor Lautner and that wig-- yuck!! 8)no ""ladies choice"" dance, it was all about Prom! -speaking of which, what was with Angela and Eric doing together? Where was Ben??!!! 9)the field trip to the greenhouse, stupid!! Eric being amazed at an earthworm, incredibly stupid!! 10)the way Bella ditched school and went walking into the woods, and then Edward followed her. ??? He was always so concerned about being seen with her and then in the forest after she says ""vampire"", he whisks her up the mountain above the cloud bank?? And that's where they revealed their feelings?? (instead of the meadow scene in the book) At least the scene against the huge boulder was HOT!! 11)Emmett was too ""homeboyish"" for me. 12) Why didn't Edward smell Victoria at the Prom?? Where were the rest of the Cullens at the Prom?? 13) What was that Prom getup?? Bella looked dressed for a semi at best, but not a Prom!! Leggings and a sneaker?? yuck! What happened to Alice getting her ready and the six-inch heel she wore on her good foot in the book!<br/><br/>I thought Rob and Kristen's acting was superb! They really captured the anguish, pain, suffering, and all the oh so many emotions of their characters. I loved Rob's faces, I thought he portrayed Edward's suffering in biology perfectly! I felt Edward's excitement and his need, and even desire for Bella's blood when he was sucking her ""clean"" blood. You could see what it truly did to him, ""sing"" to him and the pain he went through as he had to realize that he had to stop before he would accidentally kill her. <br/><br/>Overall I thought the movie was awesome!! I can't wait to see it again and again this weekend!! I knew it was going to be different from the book, so I went in knowing that, so I am pretty stoked!! If it was going to be EXACTLY like the book, it would have been a MUCH LONGER movie. <br/><br/>With the big announcement this afternoon that they will be making ""New Moon"", I am looking forward to the future of this franchise!"
"skpn123","10","2","6","3 February 2019"," If only I could create something so 'terrible'
","This franchise has made almost everyone who touches it very rich. And what is rare success is that the popularity has only increased with each movie. It is estimated that in the year following when there were no new Twilight books on the market, author Stephenie Meyer earned $14 million. In 2010, at the height of the Twilight book and movie madness, the author ranked 59th on the Forbes annual Celebrity 100 with $40 million in earnings.<br/><br/>I don't know who has written these ridiculously low score reviews LOL -the ones that seem among the most ridiculous criticise the unique and scene-setting camera work. If you don't like vampire films then why eatch or review them. And the criticism that they are not close to the books is ridiculous - I do not recall watching a film that is so loyal to the source material.......<br/><br/>Well here's hoping I can be involved with a project that is 1/100 as ground breaking, successful and iconic......"
"willcundallreview","5","2","6","6 March 2015"," Vampire love never felt so awkward
","Rating-5/10 <br/><br/>Twilight is a fantasy romance film based on the novels of the same name and boasting vampires and love. It's safe to say this move is not the best although I will add it never completely fails and as a piece I think it can be thoroughly enjoyed, but only by some. With a cast that isn't all bad you'd expect great characters but in the end they end up pretty annoying and as if the person who first created them was not thinking straight at all.<br/><br/>The plot is gloomy and the setting, even gloomier, but what Twilight does is draw you in, whether it's the pretty good romantic plot or the thrilling last quarter, or even if your in awe at how bad it is, I guarantee interest. It has it's plot holes that we so often see in this age of franchise movies and it's not done to the best degree either, although with very few effects I commend it for sticking itself to the ground and not giving in to too much green screen and the such.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart as our main gal Bella is poor here and although her chemistry is seen with our main man Robert Pattinson, she still just can't pass this off as a good performance. On Pattinson's performance well he is isn't so bad but his awkward body language and speech make for well, awkward scenes, and when he and Belle are together it can almost feel silly and not well done. The supporting cast are again drawn in to this awkward feeling and no star turns are found anywhere with rather competent actors looking dazed and confused and befuddled at what the hell is going on here.<br/><br/>Catherina Hardwicke directs and although not destroying it, she deals a lot of the endless list of damage. She creates these scenes that are dull and almost meaningless, and although like I said you can be drawn into this film, that mainly goes down the books author Stephanie Meyer. I felt the script was poor, now I'm not sure whether that's the books talking or the screenwriters but someone has made a mistake here and made a rather cute albeit dark relationship, unbearable to listen to.<br/><br/>It's not that this movie is hell on the screen but it's just the point that no one seems good, and overall I can't really think of much to compliment, although strangely I felt by the end it was just about an average piece of movie telling. Look Stephanie Meyer has obviously created a group of books well loved by its fans and the pressure some of those fans put on critics who dislike this movie is proof they really have fallen in love, but those who haven't read them may just feel instead of falling in love, your draining love instead. I think what would have improved this was just a little more reality and less awkwardness and angst, it could have been so much more well made but instead not only the director but the actors and writers have ruined a golden chance and made it so-so.<br/><br/>Overall I gave it a 5/10 as I felt it is a middling film, this may battle with your thoughts for a while after and it really does make you think about liking it, and then hating it. Give it a go I urge you, you don't forget it quickly and there are thrills to be had, many will and do like this but many don't, be sure to make up your own mind before deciding and work out whether your team twilight or your out."
"devilsadvocatered6","3","2","6","22 February 2014"," 6 years late to the party!
","I avoided this film for a long time. I saw the odd review and got other third person accounts of the film, but none of it prepared me for it. Even the Rifftrax, hilarious as it was, couldn't keep me from facepalming my hand through my own skull in disbelief. <br/><br/>There are some huge problems with this movie, not the least of which stems from the fact that I saw it just the other night and can't for the life of me remember a single scene or quote. I wasn't even drunk at the time! C'thulu knows I wish I had been, but there is no good reason for a movie with a 2 hour run time to leave so little an impact. Most people will notice right away that the soundtrack to this movie is morose and boring. This just doesn't fit at all when the movie is trying to convey tension and drama like when vampires are sprinting at poorly animated mach speeds.<br/><br/>That's not to say after effects are everything, though. I believe whole- heartedly that a good story can make up for a lot. I will still play Silent Hill to this day for this reason even though the original PlayStation graphics have long since been obsolete. The only problem here is that the story in this movie is much like a spastic colon unexpectedly releasing a gallon of peanuts: you might find an interesting tidbit here or there, but you're still shocked at the sheer amount of fecal matter around you. As I understand it, this is a recurring theme in the works of Stephanie Meyer. There are occasional bits of actual human emotion and drama, but they are immediately cast aside so that the 'romance' can take center stage. For instance, Charlie's (Bella's father) old friend is killed by vampires. We know they're old friends because we are told this, not because of how they act together as friends. For a minute there I thought Charlie was going to swear revenge and show some character development.<br/><br/>Silly me, that's not what happens at all. The movie immediately cuts to Bella and Edward staring at each other. Get used to that, by the way. There's no sacrifice on the part of either lead to make this 'romance' work, they just stare at each other scene after tedious scene. That leads me to my next point: none of the characters act like people. They're more like dolls with eerily blank expressions on their faces even when confronted with, say, vampires that want to kill them.<br/><br/>Well, that's about it. The film looks drab and washed out, the soundtrack follows suit, the leads are as boring as the world they inhabit and the antagonist doesn't actually antagonize anyone until well into the second act. And then everyone goes to prom. Stay tuned, insanely bored person who might be reading a review to a movie that's roughly 6 years old now. I plan to subject myself to the rest of this series just to see if my psyche can take it.<br/><br/>Next up: Eclipse! Or is it New Moon? Breaking Dawn Part 8? When did it stop being cool to put numbers in the title of a sequel? Iron Man did it!"
"silentwhisperer93","3","2","6","31 January 2014"," Didn't like it.
","These films are great for your usual teenagers who find it a chore to find love and fantasise about the characters instead. For me though, it was atrocious. Even Robert Pattinson said in a review that he hated twilight. Look it up. In my opinion, Kirsten Stewart can't act. She reminds me of Rowan Atkinson in the very first season of Blackadder which nearly got stopped there. For those of you who have never seen the first Blackadder season, Rowan Atkinson's character was a mixed person basically. It was as if he had multiple personalities and it was way over the top. To me, Kirsten doesn't know how she wanted to act in the film. She always seemed confused. Oh, btw Twilight is a perfect example of what not to do. When a guy like Edward treaats you like crap as he did, go for the one who was always there and put up with your emotional ass. In my opinion, she f***ed around with Jacob's feelings.<br/><br/>This movie had a terrible director in my opinion. The movies were bogus. My advice is to read the books. They were a hell of a lot better than the movies, I know. I've read them all.<br/><br/>Hated them."

I don't understand why so many people hate it, if you are thinking of watching 'Twilight' you should go for it because its a amazing movie and give the book a try. The characters are very well played epically Kristen Stewart which plays the part of Bella Swan, she has done a amazing job. I can't wait to watch 'New Moon, the next part. The clef hanger at the end is very good and you don't see it coming.

","I never read the books, nor did I read any book or watch any movie about vampires in the slightest. Who could possibly be into all that fake fantasy stuff, right? <br/><br/>This film was randomly being aired on free-to-air one night and oddly enough, though I'd convinced myself prior that I'd absolutely loathe it, the movie turned out to be pretty intriguing. I didn't intend to watch until the very end but I had to - I had to know what happens. <br/><br/>This review is coming from someone who detests any fantasy/sci- fi/unrealistic crap - well, actually, I'd never seen/heard about anything of the sort - and that's probably why I thought so highly of the film itself. It was different. It wasn't my usual 'Devil Wears Prada'. It was kind of cool."
"eline-hoskens","6","2","6","11 August 2013"," It was okay!
","By the time I write this review, I have watched all the Twilight movies. I think the first one - all in all - is okay. Although I really do prefer Dracula I don't mind the sparkly take on vampires. At least it's a personal and original kind of vampire. Like Beauty and the Beast, it raises the question: ""Who actually is the monster?"" If there is a monster in Twilight, it's Bella. It really looks like she suffers from constant PMS. Plus she has a throat disease as she swallows a lot and the doctor told her to... Speak. Very. Slowly... And. Pause. A lot.<br/><br/>What was a bit of a disappointment is that the moment the Cullen family steps into the mess hall you really instantly know they're vampires. But then it takes billions of missed classes and mysterious gazes before Bella actually realises. I'm pretty sure this is no spoiler for anyone.<br/><br/>But I thought the Cullens were well done. They cast a number of good actors and actresses there. If the leading actress hadn't been such a disappointment, this probably would have made a good movie. I did enjoy it after all."

There is nothing positive to mention for the first half of the movie AT ALL, the writing, acting and directing is pitiful. The way in which the characters are introduced to us leaves the viewer wondering if they have stumbled upon some poorly written porn the likes of ""Oh I am so lucky you two plumbers happened to be passing by........"", the acting fits right in here with that type of film as well. The second half of the film is only just good enough to keep me entertained and interested enough to want to watch the remaining films. I can say now that the remaining films are far better in every aspect and those I will give a much more in depth and positive review. As for this movie I end the review here as there is truly nothing more I could write that will not see me struck down by God on the spot and sent straight to hell."

","Romeo, Romeo, how art thou Romeo?<br/><br/>The classic Shakespearean tale has been carried down the generations from centuries ago. As two lovers fall for each other via the 'ye-olde' English language, they realise their romance was forbidden by their families and must meet in secret. This is how it would be accomplished with vampires and more amateurish acting - still a watchable yarn.<br/><br/>As Bella (Kristen Stewart) the ordinary school girl moves back to her previous home to live with her father, she quickly develops a crush on the mysteriously pale Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). However, Edward's family aren't as 'normal' as we assume and they believe that romance certainly shouldn't be on the cards - but it is!<br/><br/>Co-starring Taylor Launter as Pattinson's apparent love rival Jacob Black 'Twilight' is an interesting and heartfelt take on the novel entailing this vampire-human love franchise. <br/><br/>It's drawbacks are that the novel was seemingly groundbreaking among bookworms yet the movie feels rather low key and one-dimensional. The story has little complexity and for a duration of approximately two hours, very little ground is covered and the movie often feels too stretched and bloated.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch from a neutral perspective although lovers of the novel may be disappointed.

"Foreverisacastironmess123","5","2","6","25 October 2012"," Very lacking and weak, but not all that bad I suppose...
","I'd heard a lot about this film, and its sequels, and the whole phenomenon of it for years-I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to have, it has been rubbed in everyone's faces for so long. But I found the look and feel of the movies, from what I'd gleaned from mags and trailers and such, to be revolting to me, and not something that I could ever truly get into in the least. I'd never even heard of any of the books. I only watched this first one because I was bored and needed to kill some time. I'd also heard of the intense hatred people have for these movies because they're so shallow and fake or whatever. I didn't really feel that too much. Sure I did a bit, some of the stuff with the two leads smacked of ""ooo, look at us"" and the vampire brothers and sisters strutting around all cooler than cool was so over the top. But no, the shallowness did not arouse my ire. I think that element of the movie just may be a little bit exaggerated. I've seen worse. For instance, there's this absolutely wretched little vampire movie/TV series called Valemont, that is an absolute ripoff of this movie, and completely pulls no punches regarding that. Whoa-a lot of the hardcore fans of this movie sound p****d-off!!! I wouldn't be all psycho about it if someone didn't like a movie that was took off a book that I loved. Of course, ya gotta remember, when you're in those early teen years the emotions are running really high about EVERY single little thing... I thought the cullen family were gonna turn out to be the bad guys and he'd have to protect her from them, and they'd run away together. But no, they were ""good"" veggie vamps! That was a surprise, that they weren't the real enemy. Surprises are generally good. The little pixie Cullen girl bugged me with her perky-perky hair! I liked Peter Facinelli as the ""father"" of the Cullens. I do remember him from Six Feet Under. ""Cullen"". What a delightfully wicked, sharp-sounding kind of name. It made me picture lambs being eaten by wolves. Moving along, I thought this film was so boring, and corny, and weak! I could not get into it. It was definitely aimed at little girls. It was all about the look of it, and to me it didn't feel like it had any real strong substance or matter to it. I like a little more MEAT to my vampire movies. Perhaps things improve with the sequels, I don't know. Frankly I don't really care either. I'll let these things come to me. I did like her in Zathura(!) but I thought Kristen Stewert was just horrible here. She acted like a robot dike or something. I could not bring myself to care for this frowny monotone-speaking bore of a girl or her perils at all. I never felt an ounce of chemistry between her and what's-his-face, seriously. The character of her dad was so stupid. Not that the character was literally stupid, but he was such a pointless ""stock"" father character. He just stood around and was the dad. What did we know about him? He didn't like to hover, he had a moustache and he was concerned for his daughter, and he was some kinda sheriff. To my surprise, one of the few things I did like was Robert Pattinson. I'd imagine lot of the hate for this movie is focused on him, but I liked him. He had character, he could be funny, and break out of the porcelain brooding poser BS and yell and wave his arms around a little. He played a vampire in an interesting and different way to what I've seen before. I didn't think he was all that attractive. He was definitely a good-looking guy, but he wasn't my type. I liked his personality. I though that running and jumping thing he did though looked so stupid! It just screamed wiiiirework! Now all that stuff I found just laughable. The body crystal thing didn't bother me, I thought it was different and mildly interesting, if not a little gay. The part of the movie I most enjoyed was the baseball game. Baseball is so much more fun and interesting when played by vampires! I liked the trio of bad vampires. I thought the Victorian-looking woman was so cool! She looked so beautiful and deadly and predatory, and the suave black guy was pretty awesome as well. He looked like a vampire pimp! And, in another twist within the twist, only one of these nastier more dangerous vampires was truly a threat. I thought the guy did a good job as a last-minute villain with his small part. So, there you have it, my humble thoughts and observations on Twilight, the modern day vampire phenomenon that never seems to go away,(just wait till this latest effort is out of the way) and which I never care to voluntarily delve into again any time soon. But who knows, Maybe I'll get ""lucky"". Dreadfully bloodless, cheesy and boring, and not my idea of what a great vampire movie should be, but I still didn't find it as bad as they say. Bye now."
"TheAdaptationAddict","3","2","6","13 October 2012"," This movie is ""meh"" (let me explain)...
","Honestly, I neither love nor hate this movie. Oh it's bad. But I think the two worst things about it is (1) the complete and utter defecation of previous vampire lore, and (2) nothing happens. In the first 30 minutes it revolves around a girl with no personality or facial expressions besides ""blank"", and it felt like I watching an episode of an ABC Family teen series. Some moments were so ridiculous that you either laughed in disbelief or just groaned. <br/><br/>If I am going to be perfectly honest with myself, the story is not as horrendous as the ones that follow as I do not despise the main character. If I ever met someone like Bella in my life as she was in this first installment of what will later be one of the most overrated film series I have ever seen, I would just scratch my head, shrug my shoulders, and get on with my life. <br/><br/>And I will address what everyone else has: the vampires (or Meyerpires). Personally I have never understood the romantic appeal of night creatures who would constantly have the urge to rip over my veins to suck the blood out of my body, but this certainly has me scratching my head in disbelief. In her quest to try and make a dangerous mythological creature that is meant to be feared and despised into something that teenagers can go on dates with, Stephenie Meyer has turned these once (for lack of a better word) bad-ass creatures into what appears to be the lovechild of Enrique Inglesias' sweet romanticism and the sex appeal of a Chippendale's dancer (apologies to both). If you're going to use on the most legendary mythological creatures of all time as some teenager's boy toy, at least be aware that on some level he/she will be scary, and then make them scary! And while you're at it, give them a personality that in your self-indulgent fan-fiction I will actually root for them. <br/><br/>All in all, to me this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it's just boring - boring characters, boring story, boring execution, just overall ""meh""! However, I only give the movie that much credit because it's next of kin is much, much worse."

","******Seven Out of Ten****** <br/><br/>Upset movie goers need lay off this film, as it's clearly billed as a teenage ""chic-flick"". So what do people expect when they go into to see the film? Gratuitous sex? Buckets of blood? Over the top profanity? Give me a break. ""Twilight"" lives up to exactly what it's billed as: A teenage vampire love story. I went expecting these things and received exactly that. The other major complaint registered by film goers relates to the way in which the vampires are portrayed: A much tamer, furrier version than most of us are accustomed to. I was fine with the vampire characteristics in ""Twilight""; it was a refreshing change of pace. Why in the hell do vampires need to be exactly the same in every horror film ever made? It's actually not a bad idea to tweek monster norms, in a day and age in American film inundated by terrible remakes and other recycled ideas. So just back off ""Twilight"" people and direct your criticism more appropriately at main stream studios refusing to financ√É¬© any new budding horror creators or any fresh horror ideas that don't guarantee a fast buck."
"knightcg","Null","2","6","30 October 2011"," ""The lion fell in love with the lamb""
","Twilight, the first in a series of three narrations, is a two hour long movie that is no doubt a chick flick of young love, sure to appeal to teenage girls with many of their mothers included. A mysterious, but dreamy Edward (Robert Pattinson) and an equally attractive Bella (Kristen Stewart) have very few words for one another, but share an attraction that even they don't understand. The ""hard to get"" game played keeps a strange, sexual tension in the air and that is exactly where it stays. Edward has the restraint of a saint. No sex scenes, sorry about that moms, best to know now rather than wait the entire two hours and be disappointed if you were looking for a steamy love story, but it does make it safe for the tweens to watch. The love story is there, but it develops slowly and out of the norm, no high school girl should fall this hard and this quick for guy of such strange allure. The big hype surrounding the book and movie was clearly just that, all hype. The first hour of the movie drags on as the setting takes place in a modern day, small town called Forks, were most scenes display the evidence of rain coupled with the lack of sunlight. A plus for the town is the panning and high-angle shots of the camera randomly treating the viewer to breathtaking scenes of Washington's snow covered mountains, ocean surf, and the glistening, foggy forests, creating some romanticism and a calming on the surface in between focusing on the complexity of the characters attraction.<br/><br/>This movie is similar to a chess game, in that one person does not make a move until the other person does. Moves are made slowly and deliberately. There are some interesting scenes of family meetings, secrets revealed, and enemies attacking, that push the young couple even closer and the will to survive strengthens their bond. For the complete romantic, it is termed, ""The lion falls in love with lamb"", and one can only imagine being the girl who is loved by a dangerous vampire. If one is looking for a good movie, take a pass, it is simply a movie of incomplete sentences and conversations. Each character responds to one another a bit awkwardly and hesitantly but it obviously works and continues into a love story that is just the beginning of a three part book series. That is the problem with watching a movie in a series, the viewer is left hanging in the end, wondering what will happen next and hoping not to forget important details until the sequel is released. The movie gets a thumbs up for a summer romance that can be picked apart for deeper meanings. It is refreshing to see a relationship build without sex clouding everything up, coupled with just enough strange violence to feed the need for danger. But a thumbs down for acting and dialogue. Looking beyond this, the movie was successful in capturing the box office number one spot with young love, intrigue, and danger all the while tactfully avoiding messy sex scenes, and limited blood and gore. A decent chick flick, but the men might just want to stay home and find something on TV."
"bill432","4","2","6","30 October 2011"," I thought a vampire was supposed to be the beast - NOT the beauty...
","I get it, vampires are popular and dangerous and I can understand somebody just feels an attraction to them but - Come on! These are not vampires! I think Meyer mixed them up with superheroes or mutants or something like that. A vampire is supposed to be a beast, to be a creature of the darkness - not a walking lightning bug.<br/><br/>I like vampire stories and I am not against these ""love stories"" between a vampire and a human, I'm loyal when it comes to that. I just can't deny that these stories are popular nowadays and i won't waste my energy doing it. But for me vampires stay ugly and evil creatures - like Dracula and Nosferatu. Well, I suppose I could go on with good-looking vampires - why not? And these supernatural gifts are not that bad to get on with. But shining in the sunlight?! Oh, come on, they are supposed to burn down to dust - I think I just can't forgive the writer who created the story that one. She turned vampires into light bulbs.<br/><br/>Well, I think it is not that bad movie even though I'm certainly not a fan and I don't think I will ever watch it again but I guess it could be quite a lovably and entertaining movie if you're 14 or so. For me, it was kind of boring - not mentioning Pattinson's horrible acting performance and really stupid jokes. After all, you know exactly what is going to happen at the end of the movie all the way from the first minute of it."
"FilmFreak94","3","2","6","28 July 2011"," Not a pleasant experience
","Twilight is clearly a movie made to cater to the fans. And only to the fans. The overall experience I had with this movie just wasn't all that fun. The actors performances for the main characters were all pretty wooden, the cinematography was often really annoying, and the dialogue was often laughable. The love story between Edward and Bella just isn't believable either. How am I supposed to believe that watching someone while they sleep is considered romantic? That's not romantic, that's creepy. It seems like the extras themselves tried to bring some personality to their characters but were overshadowed by the sheer blandness of the main cast. It's also hard to take the whole vampires sparkle in the sun thing, when other(better) vampire films had them die in the sun. Just look at nearly all the Dracula films. Dracula didn't sparkle in the sunlight, he died. They mess up other mythos for vampires but really it's the sun thing that takes the cake.<br/><br/>This film is not for those who are familiar with vampire lore or are fans of actual romance. I really can't in good conscience recommend this film to anyone, but I rate it a 3/10 because there are a few things I liked. The actor who played Jacob was pretty good, and the baseball scene was pretty well done. As well as the scenes where the three opposing vampires are hunting humans. Those scenes were well filmed and are pretty interesting to watch. The rest of the film however was not very good. Seriously, if you wish to see a good vampire flick, go watch Bela Lugosi's Dracula, Nosferatu, or any of the Hammer Horror films depicting the infamous vampire."
"anne_brouwer1983","9","2","6","13 June 2011"," Breathtaking
","When I saw this movie I had no idea Twilight even existed. A friend was reading the books and brought the DVD to watch together. I was very pleasantly surprised! The story captured me immediately and the chemistry between Kirsten/Bella and Robbert/Edward truly was amazing. <br/><br/>I do realize though that it's probably a woman's movie and most men won't understand any of it (sorry guys). It's a story of old fashioned romance, gentleman-like behaviour, intense emotional connection and even family value against a tragic vampire/supernatural background. It's brought in a unique way with great lines and with the right amount of humour. Go see it and let yourself be drawn into this wonderful world.<br/><br/>*9/10*"
"Blueeyedcutie121-1","4","2","6","24 November 2010"," It was lacking...
","Okay, you cannot blame anyone for comparing the book to the movie. If you've read the books, that's what you're going to do. Personally, I think they left out a lot, and the moving was definitely lacking scenes from the book. For example, the blood type scene. I was honestly disappointed by the fact that they DID NOT include that in the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting was okay. Personally, I don't care for Kristen Stewarts role as Bella in the movie, because to me, she lacks emotion. I do think, however, that Taylor Lautner was a good choice to play Jacob Black mainly because he still has the younger look about him in this movie. Edwards acting was decent, that's all I have to say about him. I mean, after all, he's undead, he can't be over enthusiastic.<br/><br/>Finally, I thought the setting was good. I thought that even though Kristens acting was poor and they left out a lot, I do think they picked the perfect setting. It was bland and bleak which is how the setting is basically described in the book. Although, did anyone, aside from me, notice almost a BLUE HUE, to the screen while watching the movie? Overall, I don't think it's an academy award winning movie, but everything about the movie combined, I give it 4/10 stars."

I hate to do this to all you twihards out there( I don't usually write negative reviews) but if you get past the sparkling bodies and the visuals, you'd see the many weaknesses this Flick has.<br/><br/>Edward is like a stalker, I mean come on, watching Bella sleep, that's not romantic, that's creepy. About Bella, I don't understand what Edward sees in her. She has No hobbies, looks depressed all the time, and talks like she's constipated. The only thing Edward and Bella have in common is that they have no Personality. I guess fans won't be disappointed, but I certainly was. Even my sister thought the movie was terrible and she's almost Twelve.<br/><br/>If all you want is eye candy( Edward) and don't care about the rest then this movie is a must see.

"sampit","6","2","6","9 November 2009"," Robert Pattinson has arrived......
","Before starting my comment I would like to say I have not read the book so am no twilight fan, hence, very little expectations. The casting was kinda OK. Robert is here to stay, perfectly cast as Edward and I know that Kirsten Stewart's character is confused, but her face emotes one expression throughout. Someone else would have done better justice to Bella's character. All other supporting characters lacked depth, but still the Cullen's did a good job. The visuals were awesome and the movie had an above average background score, especially liked the scene when Edward plays the piano. The baseball scene was fun. This is a vampire film but the action sequences, were far below average. Director, if you cant think of any new sequences, should have watched some good old vampire films to get an idea. The bad guy James look like a retard, he wont even scare my 6 yr old niece. The makeup was patchy and editing a bit too crisp for my liking. The director didn't give a chance for a scene to develop. The dialogues were as corny as it could get, especially Bella's, as if they are lifted right of the book, but what hooked me for 2 hours was the chemistry between the two actors. They looked like an item on screen. I still have not understood a few elements in this film, and that I think is because I haven't read the book. So in all not a perfect film but good popcorn entertainment. I give it a 6/10."

","We all know the deal here quiet, retiring Bella Swan moves in with her father Charlie to dreary, old, boring Forks. There she meets the adorable, sexy and mysterious Edwards Cullen problem is he's a vampire...bad times... and so a great Romeo and Juliet style love struggle comes into play.<br/><br/>Now to the important stuff :) I adore Stephanie Meyer's books and the thing I loved about this movie is that it really stayed ridiculously true to the book. All the characters looked exactly how I imagined them, the locations were perfect, even the cars! Everything was done down to a T and that's a credit to Catherine Hardwicke.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson is perfect as the sullen, lonely vampire although I had to try a few times not to laugh at his ""crazy eyes"", Nikki Reed will definitely come in to her own in the later movies as the stuck up pretentious Rosalie, Peter Facinelli was a pleasant surprise as Carlisle and Billy Burke brought something refreshing and different to Charlie. Even Taylor Launter, who I was extremely worried about, pulled it out of the bag...unfortunately it was all really let down by Kirsten Stewart. I'd high hopes, I'd seen her before in other things but she just didn't seem to get Bella, she looked like her, talked as I imagined but there was something missing...she did have chemistry with Pattinson but not enough to make me truly believe in her character...that was a major disappointment for me. Bella is the everyday girl, the one that anyone reading the books wants to relate to....and it was just a really wooden and boring performance from her.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that Stewart gets some acting lessons for New Moon and then maybe the avid readers can get the full movie experience they'd been hoping for as well as people who haven't read the books because as it stands this movie will only appeal to fans and that's all."

","I think twilight was by far the best movie u have ever seen in my entire life!!! I was amazed so much a saw it a second time! I have read all 4 books in the twilight saga and recommend them to everyone! Twilight is about a high school girl Isabella Swan(Bella) who moves to Forks, Washington and meets the vampire Edward Cullen! Twilight is a action filled romance. It is completely indescribable how great twilight is!!!!! I think twilight may be one of the best movies ever made. Twilight was made by Summit Entertainment and they have the rights to the rest of the books in the twilight saga. They are currently preparing to film new moon the second book in the twilight saga."
"lucashillsinlondon","10","2","6","24 December 2008"," Stop comparing it to the book!!
","My girlfriend was utterly taken by the books and disappeared out of my life for a month or so while she completed the series. So taken was she, that she forced it upon me to read Twilight and I must admit, I rather enjoyed it... a lot! I rushed to finish it by the day I went to see the movie.<br/><br/>I read the previous disappointed comment from the couple of people before me and was gobsmacked! Why is it that some people have to have every single page of a book put on the screen? The audio books went for almost 20 hours so of course they have to cut stuff out and re-order things a little! I thought the screen adaption of this book was utterly Brilliant!! My god Rob Pattinson can act!! His eyes and facial expressions throughout the movie were unlike anything I've ever seen before. I've honestly never seen a performance like it. I had already seen that Kristen Stewart was playing Bella before I read the book and so it was hard not to think of her while I was reading but whoever cast her for the role absolutely hit the nail on the head. She was perfect! A little quirky, with a little rebellious attitude, obviously a goofy foot ;) but also, incredibly pretty. I've seen her in previous roles but she really shined in this movie and the chemistry between them is unreal. The whole idea behind the forbidden love absolutely drove you insane. You could see how much they wanted each other from the first scene... well.. almost the first scene. That scene in biology was hilarious!<br/><br/>Anyways, overall I've seen a LOT of movies lately and have been fairly disappointed with Hollywood in general pumping out the same reprocessed stories over and over again. This was the first movie I've seen in a LONNNGGG time that actually had a fair bit of originality to it. It was lovely and fresh, great acting, great directing and a fantastic story. My hat off to everyone that was involved with its creation! I can't wait for the next one!"
"vip_ebriega","6","2","6","9 December 2008"," OK. Just OK.
","My Take: Not as great as the hype made it look, but still the movie fans would be delighted with. <br/><br/>After a few popularity rates later, the hype got to me. Okay, not really. But while I didn't get the chance to read the immensely popular and addictive bestseller by Stephanie Meyer, I did get the chance to see the long-awaited adaptation. Advance news announced that the movie would have a limited budget since it isn't produced by a big, major studio, but the fans don't seem to take a hint. Besides, how much can a vampire movie cost? Well indeed, the low-budget quality of this TWILIGHT adaptation is obvious, the film still came out fine. As a breezy, cozy chick flick, TWILIGHT delivers. It'll make several teenage girls say ""aww.."" every time while giving their dates a chance to make their move. I should have seen this with a date (of which I planned to)! I guess that pretty much what the movie was meant to be. It's sweet, cozy date movie (where the 'date' part is the guaranteed success).<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is a finely credible Bella, an attractive teenage girl who moves to the gloomy town of Forks with her father (Billy Burke) while her a mother remarries. Warmly accepted by her new classmates at at her new school, she is also fascinated by the mysteriously attractive Edawrd Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who, with no surprise to any fan or reader, is actually a vampire. Against all odds, the two unlikely couple fall in love and all the mellow moments flow. Also at hand are the consequences of their unlikely affair as a blood-hungry vampires pursue Bella, seeing her a nothing but a snack.<br/><br/>TWILIGHT loses its inspiration in a few scenes, namely the ""effects-laden"" moments as in the baseball scenes and scenes where the vampires jump on top of each other, but it doesn't so in its endearing old-fashioned romance. As an intimate love story, TWILIGHT does just about it. Try not to hug your date even when the movies over! <br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."

"monetscloset-1","9","2","6","1 December 2008"," Screenplay just as good as the book
","The comments made by cligutan say it best: ""Don't spend your time comparing it to the book."" When you have to turn a 500 plus page book into a 121 minute movie scenes will be cut and the pace of things has to be accelerated.<br/><br/>Melissa Rosenberg, the screenplay writer, had a really tough job. Die-hard fans aren't going to appreciate any changes made between the book and movie and considering the audience target is Tweens they may not understand. I have read many books that were turned into movies and it is a rare occasion when the movie is better than the book as in this case.<br/><br/>The introduction of Edward was far from ""awkward"" and the scene where Bella walks into class and Edward catches her scent is PRICELESS. The romance between Edward and Bella is rushed but then again you only have 121 minutes for them to fall unconditionally and irrevocably in love.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie had to deviate from expanding on the Edward/Bella relationship to include the James storyline is pertinent to movie number 2 (New Moon). New Moon is about Victoria and her hunting Bella down. The threat of having Victoria out there is another reason why Bella and Jacob become so close. Movie 2 can pick up where Twilight left off as the ending scene with Victoria hints that it is far from over.<br/><br/>I don't envy Melissa if Summit Entertainment keeps Melissa on as the screenwriter. New Moon is going to be very hard to adapt into a screenplay because it is extremely important to show how much Bella deteriorates when Edward leaves her. It is very important as it explains how and why she ends up having an unconditional love for Jacob, a love that may never had happened if Edward had not abandoned her.<br/><br/>Half of New Moon doesn't have Edward in it so the movie has to keep the audience interested until Italy. So much to cover in so little time.<br/><br/>Summit Entertainment will have to change the feel of the movie as the fan base is not just Tweens anymore. Adults young and old have recently become fans, and this increased target audience is paying for the product merchandise and will expect more from New Moon. The ""cheesiness"" that did sprinkle Twilight will not be forgiven the second time around.<br/><br/>In closing, the casting of Twilight was impeccable! The chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson was undeniable. It's a good thing Stephanie Meyer didn't get her way and cast Henry Cavill as Edward. A great ensemble makes a movie as in the case of Twilight."

","I'll admit that when I first heard about the movie, I was sceptical. How could they make something that was so wonderful on so many levels into a two hour long movie?<br/><br/>But then I saw the trailers, and (in the words of Mr Darcy, whom Stephenie Meyer cites as one of her influences for Edward) they 'caused me to hope as I'd scarce dared hope before.' For me, within the first few seconds Kristen Stewart had stopped being Kristen Stewart. She had unconditionally and irrevocably become Isabella Swan - dreamer, loner.<br/><br/>The incredibly talented cast brought the book to life in ways I'd never expected. Additions to the script simply added to the overall vibe of brilliance that Twilight simply has.<br/><br/>And for all those who are freaking out because the movie doesn't follow the book to the letter - do you really want to sit there and watch three hours of Bella lying in bed being emo over Edward?

"musica1","6","2","6","21 November 2008"," They did a good job bringing the story to the screen
","**This review may contain spoilers**<br/><br/>I usually hate movie version of books I love. The ONLY two exceptions I can think of are ""The Shining"" and ""Jurassic Park."" Otherwise, it seems to be impossible to bring a book to the screen credibly. Twilight will be number three on my list. <br/><br/>The screenwriter and director have done a really good job bringing difficult material to life on the big screen. All the characters and basic elements of the story have been translated beautifully. Edward's love/hate of Bella at first, before he decides to actually love her, was portrayed perfectly by Robert Pattinson. If looks could kill, his would have done so. All the other characters were spot on as well. Alice, Emmett, Jasper and Rosalie couldn't have been better portrayed if some magic had brought the actual words from the book to life! Jacob seemed a little bit polished. He never quite looked like the scruffy kid from the rez who just walked out of his garage. But he did have the warm welcoming that Jacob is supposed to have. And the three bad vampires were EXACTLY right! The movie really came to life when they were on the screen.<br/><br/>The only two problems I had with the movie were these: Kristen Stewart's acting sometimes lacks any emotional range. Her line delivery is really choppy, and she physically seems twitchy in many scenes. But the bigger problem was the score. Music is SO important in a movie. The choice of music can completely change the tone. And the music in Twilight for the most part wasn't that good. The songs that Pattinson sang were probably the best in the film. The music behind the beloved meadow scene sounded like it had been pulled right from a B-movie based on a sappy Harlequin romance novel. The scene itself, if you could keep the music out of your mind, seemed well done. But the music sets such a B-movie tone that it makes you feel like you're watching a worse movie than you actually are. Director Catherine Hardwicke will have a bigger budget for the next movie, so I hope she hires Alan Shore, John Williams, or someone of their substantial abilities to score the next movie. She can still throw in the ""hip"" songs here and there. <br/><br/>These problems didn't make me dislike the movie, though. I would still say go see it and have a good time"
"3xHCCH","6","2","6","27 November 2008"," Not bad, but compromised by very high expectations
","I have read the book. And today I watched the movie. So what do I think? They got the atmosphere of rainy and gloomy Forks, Washington right. They got the actors right, most of the time. My personal favorite actor was the guy who played Bella's dad Charlie, because he was so natural in his strained interactions with Bella. But I will complain about the ghastly overly white make-up for the vampires being too obviously make-up (especially for Dr. Carlisle Cullen).<br/><br/>As the leads, Kirsten Stewart (as Bella) and Robert Pattinson (as Edward) have a lot of big expectations to live up too. They have got the right look, but I think the exquisite descriptions in the book made their job very difficult to pull off for the big screen. The readers have made their imaginations run wild with the vivid narrations of Ms. Meyer in her novel, so it would be difficult to satisfy everyone's own interpretation. Their interpretations may never be enough for true Twilight fans.<br/><br/>Poor Robert Pattinson certainly has more pressure since Edward is a veritable demigod in the novel The fans have their own individual ideas on how Edward should look, talk, run, fight, glisten in the sunlight, etc. I personally felt he was too stiff in his interpretation of Edward. This maybe more of a problem with the director's vision though, rather than the actor's call. There were very awkwardly filmed scenes, like their first class together, and their first kiss.<br/><br/>My wife watched this without reading the book yet and she generally likes it as a romance movie. It was enough to make her overlook the vampire aspect which she does not really relish. I personally felt more time could have been spent to establish the depth of their love for each other. The director chose to spend more time to establish the presence of James' group, where Laurent was unexpectedly played by a black actor. In fact, this film really takes an effort to create a multiracial casting, for which it can be commended.<br/><br/>It is not a bad movie. It is just compromised by too much high expectations from readers of the novel who have eagerly anticipated this film treatment."

Except Kristen Stewart, i personally thought she played a horrible Bella. She did the character no justice at all. The special effects failed to meet a pleasing appeal. And the movie went by too fast, leaving out all the special little moments. In a general sense, though, it was OK. The love line of the story was magical.

","I am a huge fan of twilight, you can call me a twilighter. my expectations of seeing this film was not high. I do NOT like Kristen Stewart for Bella at all. Her acting was horrible. She looked scared whenever she talked, as if she was afraid of what she was saying. I found so many mistakes. 1) Bella did not have a cell phone, she communicated with her mother through emails. 2) ON A SLOW COMPUTER! She did not have a laptop. 3) She did not have an ipod, she had a cd player. The film was also out of sequence in some parts with the book. Bella found out what Edward was on the ride home from Port Angeles... they did not skip school so she could tell Edward what she knew he was. Also, on their first date is when edward showed her he sparkled... not when they skipped school. And it's not like the film wouldn't have enough time to simply fix the order of these events. The kissing scene too... They did not kiss the first time in her bedroom... and they could not have kissed with that much passion because Edward would surely bite her head off. Their first kiss took place in their first date that I was talking about earlier. The fight scene too, more mistakes James completely messed Bella up, she had broken ribs and she was passed out when James bit her. She did NOT see Alice, Emmett, Edward, Jasper, and Carlisle come to rescue her because... she was passed out. I also really wished that they included in the film the part where Edward made her heart monitor jump whenever he kissed her. The prom scene... Bella did not know what was going on in the book... but in the film she was fully aware she was going. In the book Alice got her all dressed up, Bella dreaded dances, thats why she was not going to go. I personally think they screwed up the film extremely. It's a good movie if you have NOT read the book, but it just doesn't do anything for me personally. The baseball scene was possibly the best scene in the film and Charlie's little comedic remarks were hilarious. I was also upset that they gave Alice very little part in the film, she was a big role in the book. I really wanted to hear more lines from Jasper and Emmett, especially Emmett because he was on the funniest characters in the series.<br/><br/>The good things about this movie was that it bought my imagination to life. Forks is exactly how I pictured it. Robert Pattinson did a great job playing Edward, he was mysterious and sexy. Alice and Jasper were absolutely adorable together, especially their entrance scene in the cafeteria where Jasper twirled Alice. Rosalie was a complete bitch but she was really good. I think the casting was great. When I found out that Taylor Lautner was playing Jacob I did not like him for the role, but as I watched it he grew on me, as long as they can fix the height issue for the New Moon. He gives Edward those dirty stares that you read about in the next books.<br/><br/>So the main things that ruin this film are Kristen Stewart's horrible acting and the fact that the scenes are not in the same order as the book."

","I've been a fan of the Twilight saga for about two years now and ""obsessed"" probably doesn't even begin to cover it. So, of course, I had to run out and see the movie. Some conversations in the book were had in different places in the movie and, surprisingly, it didn't really bother me so much. But, we all expected that. I thought music was sometimes used at weird times. I believed all the characters and they were exactly the characters I'd always pictured in my head while I read the books. I liked the extra background on the nomads but I wish there had been more on the Cullen family. Jasper is one of my favorite characters and his ability wasn't talked about or used like in the book. You could see how the characters were related (married and what not) but not much about their past which bothered me. Some of my favorite scenes in the book weren't exactly played out much in the movie but overall I thought it was pretty good and I'm excited to see how 'New Moon' turns out. Hopefully, since they'll be funded more, they can do some better CGI. But go out and see it!"
"reneshepard","9","2","6","24 November 2008"," I've seen the movie and read the books.
","I am a very hard critic when it comes to making books into movies. I hated all but the third HP movie, as far as I'm concerned they are mostly disasters.<br/><br/>Twilight on the other hand did a fair job of retelling the story on film. There was one notion I felt needed to be there, the irony of the argument between Bella and Edward about her not ever having to give her life for him thereby proving her love vs. her actually choosing to go to James to save Edward. That conversation was rather nebulous in the book as well so I can see why it was left out or over looked.<br/><br/>I wish that directors would read the books as well as the screenplays so they could make adjustments rather that relying on studio execs to approve the screenplay and work from it exclusively, I think this is the point of problem in turning books into movies.<br/><br/>Edward and Bella are beautifully portrayed and the movie does move along and the cinematography just makes you want to cry. And the boy playing Jacob Black..HOT HOT HOT.<br/><br/>Over all its a decent evening with hubby and btw, my husband is harder than I am to please when it comes to this kind of movie making and he enjoyed himself too."
"heyysyd","6","2","6","23 November 2008"," Okay the first time
","Honestly, I wasn't expecting much since id viewed the trailers on youtube several times. I didn't want to get my hopes up too much for this movie and I think it was a bit more then i expected.<br/><br/>Everyone complains about how bad it was but honestly, people need to not compare it EXACTLY to the book. For those who are Twilight readers, you shouldn't complain so much. I think the problem is that those who have read the book expect so much since they picture everything perfectly in their head, since thats what Bella and Edward's relationship is made out to be.<br/><br/>I'll admit when i went to the midnight showing Thursday into Friday, I did come out slightly comparing it to the book. People need to give the director props for trying to make such a popular book into a movie. There NEEDS to be changes in scenes or humor or dialogue and people should realize that also. Not everyone going to this movie has read the book, therefore there needs to be a slight change.<br/><br/>Others complain that Robert and Kristen's acting did even compare to that of the book (again with the comparing people!) but if Kristen were to narrate as Bella the whole more just to describe her feelings for Edward I think we'd all agree the move would get boring.<br/><br/>All in all I think the movie was most on the book and I don't care if it wasn't exactly the same. My imagination is different to anyone else's. Acting was decent and the way they shot scenes was just okay too. I plan on going back again to get my finial opinion of the movie."
"ca7mon","5","2","6","23 November 2008"," Tried to stay too true to the book
","Adapting a book to a movie is very difficult. If you deviate too much from the story you get slammed, yet this movie tried to cram a too long book into a movie and we lost the character development. It tried to include too many key book scenes while not leaving enough time to build up the relationship between Edward and Bella. It lacked the intensity and angst of Brokeback Mountain/The Notebook. I never felt any fear of loss or emotionally charged love.<br/><br/>As far as the acting it was OK to me, nothing Oscar worthy but it might have been due to the corny dialog. Again, maybe time to deviate from Stephenie Meyer's writing. She wrote a thrilling novel, not classic literature by any means, but the dialog didn't translate well to film form. Kristen Stewart was right to insist on changing her lines. She did an admirable the job. The movie trailer didn't do her justice. When I first saw it I thought ""Uggh, what an awful low voice and wooden actress"" but once I saw the film, she did quite well. Although, she was too somber throughout the movie and has no comedic skills at all.<br/><br/>Charlie, her Dad, had the most comedic lines and he played it well. Jacob Black has potential to be very funny as he was in the book. I hope any sequel made will allow Jacob to show his funny side.<br/><br/>I like Robert Pattinson because he is a wonderfully handsome young man. Not what I pictured when I read the story but he performed his role as well as he could within the limits of the script. I believe or want to believe he has great potential to be an excellent actor. As a person, I love his normal bubbly self in the promotional tour. He's got an open and endearing personality that you can't help but love. I will definitely be interested in watching his future films and hope he continues his leading man roles for which he is well suited.<br/><br/>Usually for most movies where I read the book first, I am disappointed by the movie and this is no exception. One exception is The Kite Runner. I loved the book and the movie left me transported and moved. I hope Catherine Hardwicke will check that movie out as inspiration for any Twilight Sequels.<br/><br/>I have no opinion on the directing since I'm not an expert on film directing but I thought Catherine did a great job and hope she goes on to direct any sequels, but a better script writer is definitely needed."

","I went into the midnight release knowing the movie simply could not be as rich in detail and character development as the book and that the majority of the cast were unseasoned. Having said that, I was blown away and it exceeded my expectations in every respect. Robert Pattinson, YOU ARE EDWARD CULLEN. I thought the adaptation, acting and cinematography were excellent. I must applaud soundly everyone involved with the film for staying true to as much of the original content as allowed with the time and budget restraints and give it a hearty two thumbs up. I'm concerned about the fans who will dig in on the things that were different more than the things that were preserved, but I know none of them could have done it better. Summit deserves high marks for checking in regularly with Stephenie Meyer the author and utilizing her feed back. No one knows Twilight better than she does and I can see why she was very happy with the film. It does stand alone as a film so audience members who have not read Twilight the novel will enjoy it as well. We had three in our group of sixteen last night and all enjoyed it immensely. I hope this brings them to read the novel and the remaining books in the saga. We will be seeing the movie two more times this weekend to help Twilight earn it's $150 million so Summit can continue to bring the rest of the Twilight saga to the silver screen."

","With undescriptable scenes that don't advance the plot nor develop the characters; rushed scenes that do not connect with what came before or next; and scenes that open questions that are immediately dropped and never answered, this movie is a clear example of ""ironic entertainment"".<br/><br/>But it is bad. Just a bad product. The cinematography is bad and repetetive with constant boring close ups, making the movie more dull that already was on paper. The story is minimal and better told, didn't need 2 hours. There is not evolution for the characters that mostly stay the same for entire movie. The motivations for their actions are questionable or abrupt. And last, the acting. With minimal roles for the rest, only the two leads have enough time showcase their talents. I think Pattinson showed potential in spite of the script, while Stewart showed just plain and simple lack of talent. She barely showed any emotion, so she nailed just the parts where her character was confused and failed miserably in all the rest.<br/><br/>In the end, I had fun, but it was really bad."

","The plot of the first film is really simple focuses on the development of a personal relationship between a girl named Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a separate group of hostile vampires.<br/><br/>This film was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures' MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written, but Summit Entertainment bought the film rights in 2007, and all of the other TWILIGHT books were sold to Summit Entertainment.<br/><br/>Originally scheduled for release in December 2008, the film was moved to a worldwide release of November 21, 2008, after the sixth film in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moved from a November 2008 release to being released in July of 2009.<br/><br/>Catherine Hardwicke directed this film, Carter Burwell did a really good job with the musical score, and the movie's soundtrack is phenomenal with amazing songs like, ""Let Me Sign"" and ""Bella's Lullaby"", both performed by Robert Pattinson, ""Decode"" , performed by Paramore and ""Leave Out All The Rest"", performed by Linkin Park. Melissa Rosenberg, wrote the heck out of a script based on the first book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is great as the lead character, Bella Swan. She is attractive and really cool, but also really great as well. Robert Pattinson is great as Edward Cullen, but this was not the first film he was in, I actually saw him as Cedric Diggory in both the fourth and fifth films in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and he really gave a great performance in this film.<br/><br/>The two main actors were so great that they won an MTV Movie Award in 2009 for Best Kiss Scene in this film and they also shared a kiss at the award. This also won an MTV Movie Award in 2009, for Best Fight for Robert Pattinson vs. Cam Gigandet as James, Best Female Performance for Kristen Stewart, Best Male Performance for Robert Pattinson and Best Movie.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner, who was in both Cheaper by the Dozen films, and played the character Sharkboy in The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, which came out in 2005, played Jacob Black, really freaking amazing. Billy Burke is also really good as Charlie Swan.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick is hot and sweet as Jessica Stanley in this film and something told me that she was gonna be in more movies and in 2012, I saw her as Beca in the film Pitch Perfect and she will be playing the role again in the upcoming May 15th, 2015 sequel to the first film, Pitch Perfect 2. Kendrick can also sing because I heard her sing in the film and she is really good.<br/><br/>Cam Gigandet, Rachel Levefre and Edi Gathegi plays the evil vampire clan. The rest of the cast is very awesome, but also really good. So, overall, i love the first TWILIGHT film. It's smart, fun and a good way to spend 2 hours.<br/><br/>Out of all of the TWILIGHT films, this one, the third film, ECLIPSE, the final two films, BREAKING DAWN - PART ONE and BREAKING DAWN - PART TWO are the best ones so far, but the worst one is NEW MOON, which I will get to. Acting is not bad, music and story, and visual effects is not bad at all. I give it a 6 out of 10."

Anyways she tries to you know get close to this guy,, only to find out he a freaking Vampire :P, anyways she still loves him,, and guess what!! Vampires fall in love with humans! So apparently this guy , the vampire is knows as Edward Cullen and he finds the unusual emo babe attractive,, i mean not literally her,, but he likes her blood, he is you know just addicted to her blood and at the same time he loves her,, so we have a guy who loves a girl who he wants to eat!! :P, oh and did i mention, this movie has a definition of their own for vampires,, according to them, vampires can be vegetarian (only eat animals blood) and the biggest shock of them all ,, Vampires freaking Spark in Sunlight! I mean common! the guy who created Vampires is lucky to be dead, cause if he saw how his creation is being insulted he would have had a heard attack or something, moving on, so they end up in a relationship, but their is a twist in the story,, there is this other guy,, who looks like the king of steroids , all muscle and stuff, he loves the unusual pale babe too!! woohoo! a love triangle now this girl who claims to have the purest of love for the vampire guy,, is now confused who she really loves, some love eh? anyways, enter evil vampires, one day the vampire boy calls his human emo girlfriend to play thunder baseball! but remember how i mentioned that the emo girl named Bella has a very attracting blood? i mean for vampires, anyways some really evil bad Vampires goes crazy by her smell and comes looking for her,, of course the Cullen's protect her, but later they go after her anyways, it ends up in a fight which the Cullen's with and yeah at the end the vampire boy sucks up his girlfriends blood but doesn't suck on long enough to kill her, talk about choosing love over food :P, and so the movie ends, so what i thought about the movie? well i guess if you are one of those guys who have seen classic vampire movies you should just avoid this weird movie, but since its SO famous i guess its good for single teen girls who have nothing interesting in their lives, and yeah some weird guys might like it too, if they are single and miserable that is !!!"

","Many people have been asking me what I thought of twilight so here it is, twilight is possibly the most strange and weirdest movie I have ever watched. Besides the stalker Edward who needs to be reported to the police over his obsessive following girls who are hundreds of years younger than him twilight is an interesting vampire/werewolf movie. We now know things that we didn't, such as vampires don't melt in the sun like we all thought - they sparkle like gay pixies, we know that if you live in a southern state such as Texas or Arizona we won't end up with dark sun kissed tans - we will end up with ghost white pale lifeless skin and of course all the pedophiles out there now know that watching a young girl while she sleeps (and note she isn't aware of this) isn't a bad thing in fact it will end you up with dating this strange girl and using her as your personal bag of heroin. The awkward Bella also did my head in with her hunched back and constant hair moving. I honestly think that I cannot judge this one for someone else as one either loves it or hates it, so if one has patience give it a chance and watch it or if someone is like me and that someone wants to watch a decent movie they should go down to their local blockbusters and rent the first movie they see as I can guarantee that it will be better than this."
"aebunny","2","20","140","8 December 2008"," Disappointed Despite My Very Low Expectations
","It's to be expected that when a novel is adapted onto film, you can bet that it will loosely follow the original story-line... with ""Hollywood"" twists added to it for marketability. Going into the theater I really had a very open mind and was hoping to enjoy the movie, even with my low expectations.<br/><br/>I'll admit I'm not the target audience of Stephanie Meyer's novels. I'm 26 years old and have long out-grown my days of shrieking over teen idols (I got that all out of my system when I was screaming over Leo DiCaprio back in the day). Regardless of some of the immature drama and obvious typos/English/grammar errors, I still enjoyed reading the Twilight series. Something about the forbidden love between Bella and Edward really sucked me in and I continued reading their journey all the way through.<br/><br/>Despite my mindset, I feel that Twilight falls completely flat on it's face leaving much to be desired. I've only been to 2 movies in my life where people have walked out of theater mid-way through... and Twilight is one of those movies. Twilight is also one of the worst movie's I've ever seen... sparring toe-to-toe with Jumper in terms of being the worst. How do I even start?? Some of the people who have written praising reviews of Twilight have mentioned that reading the book helps you appreciate the movie. Even though this is an adaptation of a popular novel, I feel that it shouldn't be a necessity for someone to read the book before hand in order to understand and enjoy the movie. It's imperative that the movie can draw in a broad audience and doesn't just pander to Twilight fans (which it obviously did).<br/><br/>As I watched the movie, I kept thinking... if I had not read the books, I'd have NO IDEA what was going on. The screen writing was absolutely terrible. You can't just take some literal word for word quotes from the book and expect that to clue in the audience. In one scene Bella and Edward completely despise each other and in the next they're professing their love to one another. So much for character development and the gradual momentum of their relationship. Let's go from 0 - 60 in 3 seconds! Catherine Hardwicke's vision for this film also comes short. She attempted to make Twilight into an artsy film when that's just not the right direction for it. The camera angles... if the movie was in high definition we'd probably be spending most of the time looking at how much lipstick Robert Pattinson was wearing. In other words, she used too many close shots to portray emotional depth. Special effects were particularly ghetto. The only scene with effects that I did like was the baseball scene.<br/><br/>The one aspect of the film that really did me in was the mediocre acting. Somehow I felt like this movie was dedicated to showcasing how handsome Robert Pattinson looked. I did like Kristen Stewart's performance in Into the Wild. However, her portrayal of Bella was one of angst and coldness as opposed to being fragile and shy. The whole time Bella acted like a completely beeotch, which was aggravating. Robert Pattinson focused too much on the tortured aspect of Edward's personality rather than his refinement, intelligence and charming nature. Whether I can completely fault them for portraying the lead characters this way is questionable... they could have possibly been following Catherine's direction. The bright spot was Billy Burke as Charlie. His acting really stood out and I'm glad he was casted.<br/><br/>Overall I don't see myself even renting the movie when it comes out on DVD. Hopefully with the making of New Moon, they will make a number of necessary changes so that it will become a more higher quality movie. I won't hold my breathe though... I'll just see who they chose to replace Catherine Hardwicke."
"adirechance","8","19","133","9 June 2010"," a great satire!
","I'm going to voice my confusion here, a confusion which I have been burdened with for some time. I saw this movie with great glee, along with a full theater of those twelve year olds that are said to be so crazy about it. I sat, delighted through the whole thing as the whole theater raged with laughter through scene after scene. <br/><br/>For example, the ""cat scene"" in which a man's inner thoughts are revealed to be about his cat and he sighs in comedic distress. Or, the shimmering scene, when Edward dramatically builds up the fact that he is ultimately forever covered in body glitter. <br/><br/>Having enjoyed it so much, I read all the books. I giggled to myself as cheesy line after cheesy line poured forth. I bought the movie and re-watched it many many times. I even became jealous when my best friend got a hilarious life sized Edward doll with his signature super creepy expression. There were the plastic family crests being sold at borders and the great team Edward/team Jacob shirts being sold at target.<br/><br/>This underdog of comedy, this independent film on American society, was genius. The actors, which were the best of the teen stars they could get, had clearly been told to act as awkward as possible. To do as badly as they could. In fact I believe that was even stated in an interview at some point...<br/><br/>Why is everyone pretending this is a bad drama? Why does everyone think this is proof that teenagers are stupid? <br/><br/>hello. wake up. it's just a satire...none of those 12 year old teenage girls are taking this seriously. Were the critics even listening to the audience while they watched in horror? IT'S A JOKE. ON PURPOSE.<br/><br/>and then...the second movie came out. And it was serious. And it was terrible. I was squirming in discomfort as the pedophile thoughts of someone my mother's age poured forth for a 17 year old night-walker. I waited for the humor. I pined for it. And it didn't come. what happened madam director? did the author catch on? did you fall for the news thinking these teenagers were serious? <br/><br/>I have no interest in seeing the third one, unless the satire returns. The first movie was so bad it was great. And the second movie was just enough better to be terrible."

I am a die-hard fan of the books and the movie was a mockery of a masterpiece. The audience was laughing because it was so incredibly cheesy.

","I went to this movie expecting a love story action adventure combo, but its really more of a love story than anything. The effects were pretty good and when the plot got rolling it was great entertainment. I was disappointed by the lack of Werewolves and the much reduced presence of Jacob Black,(Taylor Lautner)however. Did they cut out most of the werewolf scenes in favor of the vampire romance theme, because I remember Jacob Black having a bigger role in the book? The directors also left the audience wondering about a few key points, such as how old the vampire characters really were and why they were living there in the first place. The other twists to the vampire legends were also a little bit much, such as these vampires sparkling when sunlight hits them as opposed to igniting into flames as any decent vampire is expected to do under such circumstances. All in all, it was still a very good movie."
"munkey-c-munkey-do","9","4","18","21 November 2008"," Twilight Opinion
","The film version was very close to the novel. As a film aimed towards teenagers it was very appealing and beautifully filmed. The cinematography was breathtaking. I could not get over the emphasis on eyes and facial expressions. It was sensual in a non provocative way. The focus on eyes really introduced several of the feelings that were exchanged between characters. The actors and actresses must have worked very hard to perfect every glance, as everything seemed to fit perfectly. Although some parts were different from the novel, the film can stand alone, leaving many areas of interpretation and comparison with the novel(if you are into that sort of thing). I enjoyed both the novel and the film for their own. I went into the movie with little expectations which made the film much more appealing. The story was not stretched in the least, but characters were very 'real' and everyone added a great flare to the film. Every scene was beautifully crafted, a great novel made for a great movie!! If you haven't read the book, that's okay, the film is very clear and concise for those who have read and those who have not."

","OK- so I was a little irritated that the movie was different from the book. In my opinion, I compare it to Harry Potter a little bit and most of those movies were pretty spot on. HOWEVER, I enjoyed every second of it.<br/><br/>I'm almost 24 and went with two of my friends: one in their early twenties also and another that is in her thirties. Yes- we were probably the oldest in the theater for the 12am showing besides parents of teeny-boppers. You better believe we clapped and squealed just like the kids. Edward's character will NOT disappoint. He's not quite as chivalrous and polite as he is in the book, but he's still so ridiculous good looking that you'll get chills every time he comes into view.<br/><br/>Production value was so-so, plot didn't completely follow the story line, and it seemed as though it was a very brief summary of the book. Otherwise, it would have gotten a ten for sheer beauty factor.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong- I still thought it was great. But in comparison to movies like any of the Harry Potter (the books are just as long as Twilight) I was left wanting more detail.<br/><br/>Whatever. I'm going again today just to squeal for and giggle every time the Cullens come into view."

","I went into this movie with pretty low expectations. I mean, I was excited about it obviously, but the movie previews and the usage of Kristen Stewart as Bella had me on edge. I thought she was going to be too pretty for the part.<br/><br/>But I didn't have to fear. Within the first few minutes of the film, I was in love with Kristen Stewart's portrayal as Bella.<br/><br/>And don't even get me started with Robert as Edward... mmmmmm I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and I am a huge fan of the movies. Yet, I always leave the movie with some disappointment. I always say to myself, ""Wow, I wish they would have included this small detail that is actually significant to the story."" However, with Twilight, I felt like they did a fantastic job of paying attention to small details that I think all Twilight readers can appreciate: Edward's (and all of the Cullen's) golden eyes, the preexisting tension between the Black and Cullen families, including the lullaby, the WHOLE baseball scene, Alice's quirikiness, the dreamy ""Dr. Cullen"", etc. Too much to mention.<br/><br/>I don't know, I feel like I have seen a lot of responses regarding the inaccuracy of this movie, but I strongly suggest otherwise. You will appreciate the attention to small detail that really makes this movie what it is."
"fancyhollywood","10","4","19","21 November 2008"," Review of Twilight
","How do I say this without over exaggerating this? This movie was the best movie I've ever seen in my life. When Edward enters the movie the whole movie theater literally screamed out loud. This movie was everything I hoped for and more. It confirmed my belief that Edward Cullen is the ideal figure of a man. The movie had everything, humor, romance, and action. I literally fell in love with it. I will be seeing this movie again... and again... and again... and again. The only thing I regret is that Edward is fictional character and I can never have him. Oh well. I wouldn't mind settling for Robert Pattison. His acting was perfect and he embodied Edward to perfection. Kristen Stewart was a perfect Bella and I absolutely loved them on screen. My only complaint is that Alice, Rosalie,Emmett, and Jasper could have gotten more screen time. Maybe in the second movie they will. Everyone must go see it to make sure that the Twilight movies will keep being made."

","Being a huge fan of the Twilight series from the beginning, I am more then perturbed by the movie attempt. It was, for lack of a better word incomprehensible. So many little minute details were left out that were so much a part of the story line and that is a HUGE disappointment to watch¬Ö. I can understand that it is not always easy to incorporate every detail from a book to a movie but the little deviations stole from the story.<br/><br/>I have always pictured Bella as a shy, sweet girl with a naive air to her and this was not portrayed in the movie. I did not find the Bella in the movie to have even a remote resemblance in personality to the Bella (that I know and love) in the book. I feel the movie was based too loosely on the book and anyone who did not first read the story would not understand some of the feeble attempts that were portrayed (the lullaby for example) in the movie. If you had not read, the book you would not understand that Edward actually wrote that Lullaby for Bella it would just appear that he was playing a song on the piano for her. How about the Sadie Hawkins Dance that was cut entirely and while it would seem not a big deal that is what leads up to the revealing of Edward in the sunlight. Or when he stopped the van Edward runs away when he was supposed to stay with her and have that little conversation about how he had gotten there so fast and the stopping of the van with his hand. I was extremely excited for this movie considering that I have read this series about a dozen times but what a let down and a disappointment it turned out to be. It makes me cringe to think what New Moon is going to be like. In a story such as this, you really have to stick to the actual book as much as possible to get your viewers to see and understand the characters their flaws and the underlying hesitation, danger and love that encircles them all."
"jim_gill","1","2","7","5 June 2019"," I tried, I honestly did
","After hearing all the hype about the film, I gave it a go but only lasted 20 minutes before I turned it off.
Not wanting to judge it based solely on the film, I tried reading the book too (the books are ALWAYS better than the films).
Unfortunately I came to the disheartening conclusion that both the book and the film have one fundamental flaw - they're both crap."
"lars_hendrikx","7","2","7","10 November 2012"," Such a shame
","I really like the concept of this movie. The whole vampire theme interests me. However, it's such a shame they handed Kristen Stewart the role of Bella Swan, the actress who is often referred to as ""stoneface"" and who even received the ""Stoner Award"". Kristen Stewart shows about the same level of emotion in every scene she stars in, close to none.<br/><br/>This movie could have been great if the casting was done properly. Although Robert Pattinson isn't a very convincing 17 year old, the role vampire suits him. Jackson Rathbone and Peter Facinelli are both very convincing vampires too, in my opinion. The rest of the cast works, although the group of ""friends"" Bella has are quite bad. Storywise this movie is good, acting wise it's utterly shameful.<br/><br/>I like the concept and i'm certainly going to check out the books, but this movie just doesn't work for me."
"Haleybartholomew","9","2","7","8 November 2012"," Twilight movie 2008
","The first ""Twilight Saga"" movie was made in 2008 was probably one of the most creative and intense movie of the 2000. The writer Stephanie Meyers has made this movie about modern day vampires. No garlic, no sleeping in caskets but a attractive love story about a mortal and vampire with a jealous werewolf and they fight for the mortals love. <br/><br/>This movie leaves you wanting more. At the end you can't wait to see the next! The directors Bill Condon, Catherine Hardwicke, David Slade and Chris Weits has picked just the right people and showed the world that this movie will be a world wide phenomenon. The ""Twilight"" movie is very original. The writer Stephanie Meyer actually had a dream about the story line and she tried for many years to make this a movie but always failed. Finally someone realized that this movie would be a hit and made a movie about it.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson plays Edward Cullen; the vampire. Pattinson plays one of the lead roles in the movie. He is very similar to Edward in a lot of ways. They are both funny and serious. He has been in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" and ""Water for Elephants"" with Reese Witherspoon. He is perfect for this movie. <br/><br/>Twilight does have some glitches. The graphics could be improved and the acting could also grow to be better. All in all, Twilight is a good movie. Twilight has a lot of fans, so called ""twihards"". This is one of Twilight famous quotes. Isabella Swan: (to Edward) I'd rather die than to stay away from you. You and your ""twihard"" friends should go see this movie!"
"xianalenard","7","2","7","1 November 2012"," Depends on the person's taste
","The Twilight Saga Hype, is it Worth it?<br/><br/>Every adolescent girl's dream in 2012 seems to be to fall in love with an immortal creature, involving them in a supernatural war that could possibly destroy humankind. Add to the movie a saucy forbidden romance with a box office earning of 300 million dollars worldwide in the first week and you get the greatest movie in America. Amazing special effects, great actors, and an unpredictable plot are the components of making the best fantasy movie in America. The Twilight Saga, overall, impressed many people but did not set the standard with the first movie, Twilight. The 2008 release of the movie Twilight, based off the best-selling novels by Stephenie Meyer, in some areas disappointed fans who had previously read the books; but also emerged new ones, encouraging viewers to read the novels. <br/><br/>This new media sensation tells the story of Bella Swan who moves from sunny New Mexico to rainy Forks, Washington and has to start a new life with her father. Having to find ways to build a father daughter relationship becomes the least of her worries once she realizes she now has to deal with being the new girl in school. Entering Forks high school she become the main attraction to most students on campus who are intrigued by having a new person join their class and yet Bella finds her self paying attention to one person who shows no interest. After finally socializing with Edward Cullen she realizes that she wants more than a friendship with him, even after she discovers he really is a vampire, along with the rest of his family. Her long time friend Jacob Black, who happens to be a shape shifter by the time New Moon comes out, ends up being caught up in a battle between vampires and werewolves while deciding which supernatural character to spend the rest of her life with. This is a relatively realistic and retold story if you ignore the supernatural fictional characters. The story became your typical awkward girl comes to a new school and meets two ""hot"" guys and can't decide which one she wants. The Twilight cast and crew members understood this story line and turned it into the dramatic and corny whirlwind romance that a lot of teenage girls secretly wish they could have. Without the dramatic and inexpensive looking special effects, the director Catherine Hardwicke captured the world Stephenie Meyer imagined and created an engaging visual presentation of what every young girl was hoping to see. The sparkling skin and supernatural movements were a disappointment only because they were a little over the top and looked as if they were thrown into the movie last minute. The meadow scene particularly stands out because in the novel, what could have been important dialog to put into the movie had been cut out completely. If I had not read the book I probably would have been confused why the meadow scene was even put into sequence. The plot and time line of the movie generally followed that of the book, but of course did not include every detail, dialog, and scene or else the movie would have been longer than 122 minutes. Die-hard fans of the book series of course would probably want to sit through five plus hours of the movie just to get the whole feeling of the thousand pages they have read. Unfortunately, the budget of this movie and every movie just cannot please everyone. Therefore, a lot of cutting out and tweaking was done to compact a novel this size in such short a time. The sequel, The Twilight Saga: New Moon, directed by Chris Waits also did a good amount of removing scenes but satisfied the audience by adding cheesy and cute lines to fill in what could have been awkward blanks. Casting directors of the film, Deborah Aquila and Tricia Wood did an exceptional job of choosing which actors could best fit the characters with just one exception. Robert Pattison and Taylor Lautner, who play the supernatural characters trying to win Bella's love, make me want to choose a team but can't decide because they are both equally too nice to look at. On the acting side, both fit the roles quite well. Pattison made an impressive, charming, rough- around- the -edges bad boy vampire with that award winning smile and Lautner's baby face came in handy to pull off the look of a struggling teen in the Quileute clan who has yet to figure out his destiny in the pack. The Cullen family, which consists of big names like Sarah Clarke, Nikki Reed, Kellan Lutz, Peter Facanelli, and Ashley Greene, portraying the ""vegetarian"" vampire family, gave me some acting to look forward to throughout the movie. On the other hand, the role of Bella Swan, played by Kristen Stewart could have been a clever choice if she had not been awkward and emotionless the entire movie. I've seen her in other movies like The Runaways, Catch That Kid, and Snow White and the Huntsman and was surprised to see her not put her talents to full use. In the end I am pretty sure that is all you need in a movie is some nice eye candy to make you want to drag yourself out the house, or in my case look for it online, and watch it. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to any one interested in forbidden romance tales. The disappointment from this movie comes from the fact that movies that are based off of books are never truly as good as the books themselves. As I said before if the movie could be five plus hours and really went page by page (around a thousand), it would probably be the greatest love story to date alongside ""Titanic."" But of course, it is no Titanic and Pattison and Stewart definitely are no Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet."

","First of all... more than the story , it's the chemistry between the lead characters that make the film. The film starts on an interesting note and gradually starts to grow on you.Although Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart share the maximum screen time... the other characters do contribute in moving the story.The screenplay is surprisingly pleasant for a vampire flick, but nonetheless effective as the film enjoys a romantic backdrop.The antagonist played by Cam Gigandet was good enough, but could've been better.The main concern that hit many critics was that the film failed to embrace some gripping details of the book, but it had nothing to do with me as i hadn't read the book.Although,i did feel at times that the director failed to bring out the raw tenacity that Hollywood has always portrayed in vampires , as the superpowers of the vampires were served in a childish manner.IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO ENJOYS DRAMA FLAVORED WITH SOME INTERESTING ACTION...THEN SAFELY PLACE UR BETS ON TWILIGHT... IT WILL CERTAINLY NOT DISAPPOINT YOU (NON-BOOK READERS).... <br/><br/>Also be beware of the fact that the low ratings for this film is the result of the ratings offered by the book readers."
"baileen67","8","2","7","23 June 2012"," I think Stephenie Meyer would be happy.
","This movie wasn't as good as the book, but it probably made Stephenie Meyer happy. I think this is a really good way to introduce the modern, romantic, vampire that has evolved from the days of Dracula and Kali. And every single vampire has a different personality. Alice likes everything to be pretty and is a happy vampire. Jasper is quiet but really has a thirst for human blood, unlike his partner, Alice. Emmett is incredibly strong and manly and Rosalie loves romance and wanted to get married and have children (which wouldn't be hard for her because she is supposed to be very beautiful). And Edward is kind and likes to read minds. Overall, this was a good movie."
"sweetaya","8","2","7","20 November 2011"," Not bad at all
","So let me begin by saying that the only 2 things i didn't like are 1. The cast of Bella. I cant get over the fact that Kristen is just not soft enough not emotional enough. Heck at 1 point I seriously thought she had down syndrome in previous movies. On first sight the girl they showed when Jacob inprinted looks like a better Bella.<br/><br/>2. I didn't like the way they displayed Sam. They made him look like some vindictive and hating monster that acts more upon his anger than logic. He's not like that at all. i like the Sam in the book for his reasons and most importantly how he was taking care of his kindred.<br/><br/>What I really did like about this episode is that it was just as emotional as the book. It really delivered everything that I liked about the story's heart. From the wedding over the honeymoon to the end of Bella's life. And not just Bella's emotions but Jacob's as well.<br/><br/>I have read a lot of hating comments here tonight and I guess nowadays it is cool to be a poser and jump on the twilight hating band wagon. My question is just if people weren't so happy with the first 3 movies, why spent money on the fourth and be mad you don't like it. Or maybe they're are closet fans but again its much cooler to rant about the movie, because lets be real there is an enormous anti-twilight thing going on.<br/><br/>But for those of you, who are twilight fans: the film delivered and that's that. Enjoy your time...cyas :)"

","After reading and thoroughly enjoying all 4 novels, I was a little apprehensive to see the movie version. Most movie adaptations do little justice, but Twilight was an exception. The actors were all very believable in their roles and the scenery was exactly how I imagined it to be. There were a few cheesy moments, but not as many as I expected. Robert Pattinson and Kristin Stewart as Edward Cullen and Bella Swan had good chemistry together and were perfectly cast. I also loved Taylor Lautner as Jacob and look forward to seeing more of him in New Moon. This is a good movie to see even if you haven't read the books. It's a classic love story made even better with vampires!"

"morganshs99","10","2","7","12 August 2009"," Doesn't follow stereotypes
","First of all, let me say I haven't read the Twilight books, so I came to this film with no preconceptions. I thought it would be a mildly entertaining teen film. But from the very beginning, the character Bella is such a sweet, shy girl, not like the typical bitchy teen in so many movies nowadays. Kristen plays the part like a real girl, and reminded me of how I felt going to a new school in 10th grade and not knowing anyone. The kids are nice and welcoming, which is also breaking stereotypes. Her dad is loving but not controlling and tries to give her as much freedom as he can. She falls in love with Edward slowly and I love the fact that there is no SEX in this film, but that makes it even more romantic. Its not clear what Edward's sexuality is really all about (guess I'll have to read the books to find out), but in any case he restrains himself and they fall in love emotionally. Its so old-fashioned in a sense, but that makes it so much richer. After the scene in which they acknowledge their love, the film really takes off! As a female, I have to admit that I would LOVE to be Bella! I can't wait to read the books and see the subsequent films."
"fasterkillkittykat","10","2","7","5 June 2009"," hoping to answer some questions
","Having read the books first and then seen the film I feel I have an advantage, to be honest I always try to read books first. I have just read some of the comments and they seem to be very personal, as in personally what they think of the subject matter. May I remind them that the film is based on fictional novels and that they should try to enjoy! A little bit of myth, fiction, history and contemporary life is a perfect ingredient, especially when well written. Some viewers do not seem to realise that a novel cannot be made into a film, all 300 odd pages that is, unless they want to spend several days in the cinema. Most adverse remarks from viewers make me think they are not actually watching and/or listening but just seeing. I love films and books, and we all have our own personal taste. Not good or bad just what we like."

","When I first heard of twilight, I wasn't even going to watch it, however, I reconsidered and watched it. honestly,it wasn't bad. this movie actually made a good point, I'm referring to the scene in which the evil vampires were ready to attack Bella, the entire Cullen family put themselves in front of her, in other words, they were willing to protect her with their lives, that to me was a good moral especially considering she wasn't of their kind. Carlisle Cullen makes a good family role model simply because his entire family looked out for each other. I did not criticize the Edward/Bella relationship because it's geared toward a female audience, and I haven't read any of the books, so, I don't claim to know exactly how they were supposed to act. I didn't find anything wrong with their acting, that's just my opinion. The thing that made me laugh was whenever James would cock his head to the side, nothing against him, he actually made the movie more entertaining. during the mirror scene, every time it showed his reflection, my brother would quack once, everyone that was watching including me started laughing to the point of tears, no offense intended. In my opinion, Victoria is the most attractive vampire in the movie, I think she's gorgeous, and i'm not ashamed to say it! she is the main reason I liked this movie!"

This charming, softly speaking vampire falls for the beautiful girl. The story, that could have been pretty stupid, was very well played and very well directed. Pattinson was a revelation. While I think Kristen Stewart is a natural and can act very well, Pattinson practically carried the entire movie. He is so charming as Edward, his acting is very intense, the very essence of emotion. Kudos to this great talent. I was very impressed also with his full body / postural acting, something I've seen before only in a few actors, I think the most recent would be Brad Pitt. I truly believe he will be one of the greatest actors of his generation, if not the greatest. Keep it up, Robert! And to all the girls out there that dream about Pattinson, I have a couple of words for you: he is not Edward."

When they are not, they say ultra cheesy lines which make me laugh because they are so bad. There are many obvious plot holes which shows that the script is poorly written. For example, I find it hard to believe that the vampire residence is full of glass walls which allows maximum sunlight penetration.

"kait112","4","2","7","8 January 2009"," The Script and Screenplay Were Foul
","While the film makers didn't exactly have that much to work with (let's face it, Stephenie Meyer didn't give them much of a plot or character development,) she laid out exactly what the characters' looks were, and mentioned their apparently interesting characteristics quite often(each character has their flaws or physical appearance mentioned almost non-stop throughout the book; as if we couldn't surmise for ourselves that Bella is clumsy from the dozen times she trips, she has to tell us this herself... and I think Edwards honey/topaz/golden/whatever-color eyes are mentioned to the point of being excessive as well.)<br/><br/>But, while reading Twilight, I was able to create some nice pictures in my mind and could, at times, relate well to Bella's character. The movie however, often had me cringing at its stupidity. To each his own I guess, but the script is often my favorite part of a movie. And the script for this movie was, for the most part, laughably bad. Granted, Stephanie Meyer didn't really give them much interesting dialog to work with, but honestly, I think monkeys were mentioned at least twice in the movie as an affectionate term (did somebody who worked on this movie have some kind of monkey fetish? I never once read about a spider monkey in the book and I definitely don't remember any being mentioned in the baseball chapter)and the infamous forest scene used in the trailer had some of the most unnatural sounding dialog I've ever heard. Stephenie Meyer has mentioned that she prides herself on trying to portray realistic characters and reactions in extraordinary circumstances. Kristin Stewart's hollow list, during which she let's us know that Edward's ""skin is pale white and ice cold...(he's) impossibly strong...and fast..."" to be capped off with the hilariously over dramatic ""Say it!""....""Vampire!"" was just waiting to be mocked when the first trailers came out online. (The spoof on youtube is highly entertaining, I'd recommend it.) <br/><br/>I know everybody's bashing the acting and all, but I thought Robert Pattinson did a pretty good job. He sold me, which surprised me, because I didn't initially find him attractive, but I still believed him to be the character. And Kristin Stewart did pretty well as Bella, I thought. Really, the parts that made me laugh had more to do with the way they were told to act: Jasper's pained expression was odd to me, and Edward's first smelling of Bella in Biology was so blatantly shoved down our throats (his hand went right to his face and he got this pained expression like he was about to vomit, really, in the book he is described as looking angry and grips the desk in order to control himself. As if a well-conditioned vampire would cover his nose and mouth like in such a wimpy fashion!)<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on the useless bits added in that were not in the book and did not add to the movie at all. They certainly could have filled these useless portions with more development for the love story, greater character development, or just more views of the beautiful scenery, which I thought was done quite nicely. The leafy Washington landscape had just the murky, wet feel that I expected and made me really want to take a trip there. And while we're on the subject of artistic direction, let me say that the cool closeup of Robert Pattinson's eyes was pretty spectacular. I mean, with the many mentions Stephanie Meyer makes of them, I guess they'd better look awesome. <br/><br/>I give it 4 stars for its look and decent acting. I can forgive many of the actors not being as I pictured them, but I cannot forgive such lousy screenplay, script, and whoever it was who told the actors to exaggerate the way that they did (I'm assuming it was the director?)<br/><br/>I've come to a concession. Those who give the film 10 stars seem to be either very generous and forgiving, know nothing about what makes a decent film, blinded by Robert Pattinson's looks, just plain obsessive or crazy, or a combination of all of those. Honestly, calling it the ""Best Movie Everrr!!!"" is going a bit far, even if you really liked it. Anyone who looks at it objectively can see that it's got its problems. Even if you're willing to forgive those problems, you can't exactly call it a cinematic masterpiece, can you?"

And surprisingly, Yes, I found the movie entertaining. <br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I was not a huge fan of the books, they were very cheesy and the hype over them annoyed me. Sure, they were enjoyable but they were by no means great literature. So I went into the movies actually expecting the film to be better than the book. And in some ways it was. The acting was pretty good, cheesy obviously, but decent. The cast was perfect, exactly how I imagined it, with a few exceptions. Edward was cast beyond perfectly, every time he walked in the room my heart skipped a beat (I'm exaggerating, obviously). My favorite character was the actor who played Charlie, he was perfectly awkward and fatherly and at moments funny! Now let me say, all these people saying the movie was awful, the book was better, blah blah blah, please just shut up! Books are almost always better than movies, what did you expect? The movie was, in my opinion, very true to the book. The story line was identical, with things switched around every now and then. They left out only what they needed to. People just need to look at it as they would any other movie and ignore the knowledge they already have. They will ruin a perfectly fine movie for themselves.<br/><br/>All in all, movie was good, better than the book at some parts. The cast was very impressive and it was NOT a waste of money!"
"Lunolem","8","2","7","27 November 2008"," A better adaption than The Dark Knight...
","I believe that film as an art form is in one of its darkest periods. Movies on a whole have gotten so bad that we latch onto lackluster movies and call them masterpieces. I don't think Finding Neverland would have gotten an Oscar nomination if it had come out a decade earlier. It was an empty movie with ridiculously subtle performances. Yet people were supposedly moved to tears. The Dark Knight is in my opinion the most overrated film of all time. Not because I think it a bad movie, but because it is only a pretty good movie. Yet as an adaption of Batman: The Long Halloween or Batman comics in general, it is terrible to me. Batman is no longer like an agile ninja or samurai; he is a clunky walking tank with a ridiculous voice. And Harvey Dent's losing of his ideals makes Anakin Skywalker's turn to the darkside seem nuanced (no offense Hayden). You are probably wondering why I am writing this in my Twilight review, well here it is: Several million people have read these books, and that means that there are several million movies in peoples' heads. The film Twilight manages to capture as much of the books plot in two hours as I think possible. There are no actors that can ever be exactly what Bella or Edward were in the books, though I think these kids did a damn good job. So unless Stephenie Meyer co-directs a computer animated twenty hour mini-series with Robert Rodriguez you're not going to get anything closer, just different. Let those who love it, love it; and let those who hate it be nice to those of us that love it.<br/><br/>P.S. Please let Catherine Hardwicke direct NEW MOON. Her style is fantastic. We don't need this to change filmmakers like it's Harry Potter."
"nlyp","10","2","7","26 November 2008"," Non-pretentious teen angst. How refreshing!
","I'm disappointed so many viewers and readers simply didn't get the approach this movie took. Was it cheesy, campy, ridiculously acted, poorly scripted? Absolutely! Was is a great movie? Absolutely! Why? Because real people don't have the perfect thing to say. We're clumsy and, quite frankly, sometimes rather stupid. This movie is directed at teens, and I'd prefer the characters portray themselves as imperfect as teenagers tend to be.<br/><br/>I also disagree with those who said big Hollywood budgets would have done this film wonders! Eegads! And do what? Turn it into another ""The Covenant"" nightmare? Please spare me the drama of CGI. I buy a ticket for a movie based on a book full of whiny little characters and obnoxious teen angst and, dagnabit, that's exactly what I better see on the screen! None of this big-action, computer graphic crap that would've detracted from what little chemistry two high school students could possibly, in reality, form with one another.<br/><br/>Over-the-top acting is exactly what I expected to see. Because, let's face it...teens are drama queens. If you aren't a teen now, you once were, and you know exactly what I'm talking about. And the awful filming... not so awful once you think about it. The gritty, shaky quality of the camera added a rather effective ""diary-like"" effect to the film, and seeing that it's totally a first-person narrative, I think it works.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm anxious for the next installment, and pray they don't go big-budget between now and then. As it stands, it has the making for a teen cult classic."
"migidomeng","4","2","7","25 November 2008"," 1st half was awful but the 2nd half picked it up
","I must say, if I hadn't read the first 100 pages of Twilight before watching this movie, I would've been completely lost.<br/><br/>Most movies tend to be bad because the story drags and the audience can't seem to find reasons to watch the movie. This movie didn't drag. Instead, it dragged me. I ended up being dragged into many different scenes where it was hard to understand who was who to the story. Like I said before, if I hadn't read the first 100 pages, I wouldn't have had a single clue as to what was going on in the film.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was terrible. The adaptation of the first part of the book was really awful. Scenes kept on jumping from one place to another. The relationships of Bella with her friends were not developed at all. It was so hard to understand who her friends were because she barely said five words to most of them. Bella's relationship with Edward was also terribly developed. Luckily though, everything picked up in the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>The actors who played Bella's school friends were quite terrible at acting. They came in and talked in a very scripted way. It wasn't acting. It was trying to act. I'll have to admit though that Robert Pattinson didn't do such a bad job. He was alright for most of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was really hard to get in the first hour. The writer and director seemed to have difficulty with the tasks they were left with leaving the first half to feel like it didn't make much sense. The 2nd half though was much better. The 2nd half was a lot smoother than the 1st. It was easier to understand and if the part of the audience that hadn't read the book got the gist of the 1st half, they would've enjoyed the 2nd.<br/><br/>I sure hope they do a better job with New Moon. At least this time, their release date is more than a year away. More than enough time to write, produce and package a good movie."
"killerkitty-1","10","2","7","25 November 2008"," Very Happy with Twilight
","I have read all of the twilight books and was so excited to see the movie I knew I would love it I loved all the books. I went on Friday when it came out, to tell you the truth I was not disappointed BUT, I was comparing the movie to the book the entire time I was watching it. I had to go see it again on Sunday. I'm so glad I did I just sat their and really enjoyed it. I do understand they had to compact a 500 page book into a 89 minute movie and I think they really did a good job with it,even though they left out a lot of jokes between Bella and Edward but the chemistry they had between each other was GREAT. The baseball game was so awesome it made me want to become a vampire just to play like that, I hate sports, I am very bad at them I failed gym in high school. I'm also happy with the part when she was getting the information out of Jacob at the beach, in the book he actually said ware wolves and vampires in the movie he only said wolves and pale faces, it was nice that she had to figure it out on her own...All in all i LOVED it and i hope they make the other 3 books into movies!!!!"
"xo_kittyluv_ox","8","2","7","23 November 2008"," Definitely not disappointing!
","Before I start explaining, I will just say that I am a die-hard fan of the Twilight series. Twilight is my favorite book in the series and I was extremely excited to see the movie ever since the first announcement came out. I went last night to see it four friends, one who is also a die-hard fan. <br/><br/>On to the movie: While the beginning of the movie was slow and even sometimes painful, there was a promise of more coming later, so you didn't completely lose interest. I loved the chemistry between Bella and Jacob, and I also loved how Taylor's smile lit up the whole screen. Jacob and Billy Black were wonderfully cast. <br/><br/>The cafeteria scene with Bella's three admirers had me laughing out loud, and basically all through the movie, Bella's well-cast ""posse"" was extremely entertaining. I thought Mike was extremely adorable, and I loved the character.<br/><br/>The vampires were, of course, gorgeous. I heard some complaints about their ""pasty"" makeup and how cheesy it was, but I wasn't bothered at all. I think Kellan and Nikki did AMAZING jobs as Emmett and Rosalie. Kellan truly was the perfect Emmett. He looked strong, terrifying, and gorgeous, but was also hilarious. Some people stated early on that Nikki wasn't pretty enough to be Rosalie, and she didn't have the experience to pull the role off, but I think she succeeded in displaying both stunning beauty and extreme resentment towards Bella. Plus, her and Kellan looked amazing together and I think they have great chemistry. Jackson as Jasper was a hilarious choice, especially with Jessica's observation that he was ""always in pain"". And I'm not the first to point out my absolute love of Alice's graceful kick while she pitched during the baseball scene, which was a very well executed scene. Elizabeth was satisfactory as Esme, but Peter as Carlisle nearly made me drop dead--he was exactly as I pictured him. All the Cullens were phenomenal, can't wait to see more of them.<br/><br/>But I left out the last Cullen--Edward. Robert was truly AMAZING. A couple times he overdid it a little, but it was forgivable. He seemed so determined to live up to everyone's expectations, and I thought his performance was WAY above my expectations. <br/><br/>For Kristen, however, I was mildly disappointed. I expected her to make more facial expressions at the times when she was stiff and unmoving, and I was hoping she would stop blinking so many times or calm down when it seemed she was overreacting. Her acting at times was painful and crappy and I almost wished for another Bella. At some scenes her voice just annoyed me (hospital scene at the end), and the fact that she was so lifeless sometimes gave off the feeling that she stopped caring. Robert seemed so determined, and she seemed bored half the time, and not in the way Bella was supposed to.<br/><br/>I also thought some scenes were very rushed, like the meadow scene. It seemed forced and way less romantic than it should have been. I don't think that scene really did the movie any justice. I imagined Edward sparkling in the sun a little differently, and the line, ""This is the skin of a killer!"" was cheesy as hell. The awkwardness of them laying in the meadow together was also a little painful. They looked like they could have been a little more engaged in each other with their bodies in order to match the undeniable chemistry with their faces.<br/><br/>The kiss scene, however, was incredible, and I loved every second of it, even when Edward had to stop himself. The biggest things that bothered me, though, was that there was really only one kiss, in the big kiss scene, before James threatened to kill Bella. And they never once exchanged ""I love you""s throughout the whole movie. It wasn't quite the same for me, but overall, I was impressed by the Cullens and Bella's friends. I could have been a lot more impressed by Kristen as Bella, but I was still shocked at times by the chemistry her and Rob shared.<br/><br/>At the prom in the end, I didn't mind the one converse shoe paired with the leg cast, since I know that's Kristen's signature, but the legging paired with the high fashion dress just looked tacky. Edward was adorable sitting at the table with Charlie, and he just looked gorgeous overall. I loved the tension between Jacob and Edward, sort of as a foreshadowing. At the end, they danced and kissed and they all lived happily ever after, right? WRONG! Victoria was at the prom watching them, and she took her wild red hair down and smiled evilly, which was a definite foreshadowing for New Moon. And...THE END!<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend you see it. I definitely want to see it again. Although I had a lot of criticism for it, half the time when Rob was on the screen, I was thinking to myself, ""He's so gorgeous!"" And, even more impressive, I was so proud when one of my non-fan friends asked me to lend her the book so she could read it! I think this movie is a great way to get more people, who were generally not interested in the series, to get interested! So take your friends and go see it!"
"hpfan15","7","2","7","22 November 2008"," Pretty Good Adaptation of Novel, Save Minor Details
","Unlike ""Blood and Chocolate"" - for which I have also reviewed - which failed to make the novel it was based after tangible and true to the storyline, ""Twilight"" was a pretty good adaptation of the best-selling novel it was modeled after. In my opinion, there has been no greater book-to-film adaptation than this with the exception of the ""Harry Potter"" films and ""The Notebook."" ""Twilight"" managed to maintain the same storyline and sequence of events; even some of the dialogue was straight from the book. The film is narrated by one of the main characters, Isabella ""Bella"" Swan, which gives a slight leeway into the character's thoughts, although, that which her words manage to express, her actions seem to falter doing. Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella, succeeds at one thing throughout the entire film - expressing the vulnerability that humans are equipped with and the pain of being engrossed in a forbidden love affair. Otherwise, her acting can be considered very one-note. Having read the novel myself, I knew Bella beforehand to have been a bookworm (Kristen Stewart never even picks up a book, save to do her homework), passionate (her love for Edward could have been stressed a lot more), and quite emotional. Stewart portrayed Bella the way she may have been were she only clumsy and angsty. Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, was in a word, mysterious. The character Edward Cullen is portrayed in the novels as being ""The Perfect Man."" He walks as though he is dancing, his voice is sweeter than the music of Debussy, and he is every bit as polite as any boy of the early 20th century. In short, he is unrealistically perfect. Pattinson brings out the brooding side of Edward Cullen - the part of him that refuses to be the monster that he is doomed to be eternally. But through all of the gloom and doom, he does a better job than Kristen Stewart does at displaying love for his significant other. He looks at Bella adoringly and protectively, while Stewart - despite the fact that she claims to be unafraid of her undead boyfriend - seems hesitant and scared of him throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>Ashley Greene, who played Alice Cullen, played the character straight to a T. She walked with music in her step, she was about as light and airy as a sprite, and although she was not as beautiful as I had thought, she was certainly adorable. Her partner, Jasper Hale (Jackson Rathbone) did a good job and displaying Jasper's self-restraint when trying to avoid feasting on humans, as well as with his portrayal of hostility, but the shocked look that remained on his face during almost the entire film was a little over the top.<br/><br/>Nikki Reed was not the woman whom I expected could pull of playing Rosalie Hale. After all, the woman is a natural (dark) brunette and is nowhere near as pale as she needed to be; and the blonde wig and powdered face that they had befitted her with took away from her natural beauty. However, reed made up from her lack of similar appearance in her performance, which fit the character quite well. Her boyfriend, Emmett Cullen was just as how I hoped he would be. Although he played the protective brother, he was still the self-confident, manly-man (or manly-vampire) that he needed to be.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner did a great job playing Jacob Black. There was a comment on this website that mentioned that he was not ""manly"" enough; but in the first novel of the series, Jacob isn't manly at all. He is a conventional adolescent boy, which wasn't a difficult task for Lautner to pull off, seeing as how he is only sixteen-years-old.<br/><br/>Minor characters such as Charlie Swan, Esme Swan, Billy Black, Mike Newton, Jessica Stanley, Eric Yorkie, and Angela Weber were beautifully portrayed by the actors who played them. They were almost identical to the characters in the novel. Esme and Carlisle Cullen were also great matches in the film, even though Carlisle's hair and makeup looked ridiculous at times.<br/><br/>In general, the actors in the film did a fairly good job. The romance between Edward and Bella could have been portrayed through more than just a few intense glares and a make-out scene, but it is understandable that the director only had a specific time frame to work with. Whether or not you have read the books, the movie is at least worth seeing once."
"firefly-27","1","20","161","19 January 2009"," By far the worst movie I have seen since Mr. Wrong
","I read the book and was so excited to see this movie, but was utterly disappointed. With in the first ten minutes I wanted to get up and leave. The special effects were cheesy, the running scenes were not what I would have expected to see, and seemed more cheesy than unreal.The characters never seemed to be natural they all seemed like they were being forced to say what they were saying and just awkward to watch. Edward looked constipated through out the whole film and it was just uncomfortable to watch. It did follow the book's storyline very well with some parts left out as usual, but the worst acting ever! I would not recommend seeing this movie, read the book instead."
"Heath618","1","20","161","16 December 2008"," Embarrassing to Watch
","Thankfully I didn't bring my husband with me when I saw this movie. I went by myself and I was STILL embarrassed by its sappy/corny screen writing. The movie doesn't catch the essence of the books at all. The effects were horrible. The ""blurs"" when the vampires were moving uber-fast looked like a sad mistake from a bad 1970s film, and the wire-work when Edward and Bella are leaping from Edward's room to a tree looks like NOTHING like a leap; they clumsily swing back and forth. yuck. Rob's American accent is generally pretty unbelievable--unless Edward is supposed to have a speech impediment. Some of the acting in the movie was pretty good--Charlie, Rosalie, and a few others, for instance. Most of the acting was Horrible--and here I'm mainly talking about the two MAIN characters. Not believable at ALL. Kristen Stewart is WAY too serious, and she doesn't let you into her head at all----which is a huge part of the books, I might add. It's like she's just looking for good camera angles the whole movie through. Rob Pattinson makes vampirism seem really boring. He doesn't do well playing a perfect character. In interviews he even says that Kristen Stewart is intimidating in real life and probably looks like the real vampire in the movie, because she made him nervous and clumsy....THAT's vampire-like! Bad directing. Does Catherine Hardwicke hate the light side of human nature, or what? It seems like most of the actors in all the movies she's ever directed hardly smile at all. nice going. i won't be seeing this movie again. Let's just hope I can get this out of my head by the time I read the series over again. Don't waste your time."

","Tonight I finally saw it, the movie we all have been waiting for finally came out, and to be honest at first when it finished I felt a little bit let down. Many of you have complained about the film, but I challenge you to try something. Many of us went to the midnight premiere or even opening weekend, the first time you see a movie you have been waiting for what seems like forever the only thing that you can think is ""oh my god! I am finally seeing it!"" Once that feeling goes away, devoted fans will being making comparisons of what they think the book goes like in their heads, each and every one with a different version. My challenge to you is, once you have seen it once, take the time to see it again before you make your ""final judgment"". The jitters of a first time see ruins hyped-up movies because you just cant wait to see it. Go to a showing next weekend or even during the week when there are not as many people there, take the time to sit back and appreciate what gift has been given to you, the fans. To create a movie that will fit everyone's vision of the book is absolutely impossible and it is selfish to think that your particular version of what you think is right will be on the screen. Loved the movie, perfectly cast, set it up perfectly for New Moon, especially for those who have not read the books...fans you will understand at the end of the movie.... Lastly, my advice is to love the books (of course!) but look at the movie separately, and love the movie. Its never going to be exactly what you want, but hey that's what your imagination is for! So go out, see this amazing film and enjoy, really enjoy!"

The plot translated very well to screen, (I loved the baseball scene.) the effects were decent, and the fight scene between Edward and James kept me in suspense. (Sorry to all you fan-girls out there, but it has to be said: in a stunning upset, the movie was better than the book.) The cast choice was interesting. The look of the characters actually surprised me; that goes double for Carlisle; he looked younger than I had pictured.<br/><br/>As always, the romantic aspect was a draw to me. I think we can all relate to Bella's situation: wanting someone that could possibly be harmful to us.<br/><br/>the only disappointment I can name is that the ending didn't exactly match up.

"ookamimaru-1","10","6","35","21 November 2008"," Give it a chance
","TWILIGHT!!! OMG!!! Okay, so it isn't a direct port of the book. I know the Teen Twilighters are going to massively disappointed in that fact; however I walked in with open eyes. Previous experience with books made movies (Interview with the Vampire, Queen of the Damned, Eragon, Seeker, Lord of the Rings, et cetera) prepared me for the onslaught of added to and dropped from material. I'm not going to say anything to spoil the movie. However, I will say that those that wish to see the film and have not read the book should do so before reading the book.<br/><br/>There is enough of a difference between the big screen adaptation and the book that they will enjoy the action and romance. The movie, though the book is vastly superior, is well worth the watch. I for one as an avid fan of the book saga still intend to see it again with in the week and will be purchasing a copy of it on DVD as soon as it is released even if I have to wade though a throng of ravenous Rob Pattinson fan girls.<br/><br/>I could see Bella and Edward in Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson's performances. Yes, some of the wittier banter was lost but the body language made the relationship that these characters share show.<br/><br/>It is my most sincere hope that the reaction of the Twilight Fan Girls, which I personally observed at the 12:15 AM showing at one of our local AMCs will not keep this film from getting the numbers at the box office that it needs for them to make New Moon. It would be a terrible shame to allow the reaction of these young people to ruin what could be a great series of films.<br/><br/>Mind you as a youngster I too over reacted to the film adaption of books I loved. Today some of my favorite films are those that made me angry. Interview with the Vampire was not a good port but the spirit of the book lived on in the film. Queen of the Damned, tried to put two books into one and failed miserably. Eragon was cut in to confetti and a blind man taped it back together with random bits added. Seeker, which was based on book 2 of the Dark is Rising Sequence, was bland and almost soulless. Twilight, I could sense Stephenie Meyer's characters even though the dialog was changed and things were added. Twilight's Heart was still there. Bella, Edward, Jacob, Charlie, and the Cullens. Was there more I would have liked to see. . . Sure. Am I more then Happy with how this flick turned out? You bet you sweet buns I am.<br/><br/>I gave it a 10/10 before seeing it and I'll personally hold to that rating. The screen writer did a good job and the acting was, at least in my humble opinion, great.<br/><br/>Please don't let the ""Critics"" sway you. If you had any interest in seeing this film then see it. It is at its very heart a love story like Romeo and Juliet the only real difference is the star crossed lovers get to live and love."

","I was worried that this movie would be another Eragon fiasco; but this movie delivered, it makes sense to even those who have not read the book(s) and would be a delightful movie to take friends and family and even that special someone too. It offers some tender moments and also delivers some laughs in appropriate spots.The acting of all involved was up to par and there was no one dragging the others down. The visual effects on the movie are kept to a minimum but do not look like half witted attempts to fool the audience. The scenery in the movie was beautiful and film in a perfect location.

I didn't feel like they were madly in love with each other from just watching the movie. Kristen never seemed to really be in love with him, and there were no ""i love you""s in the movie, which surprised me... and there was only ONE kissing scene which was more of a make out scene, which if I'm not mistaken, NEVER happened in the first book. Pattinson did a better job of seeming like he was in love with Kristen, but not by much.<br/><br/>And I'm sorry, but some of the faces that Robert Pattinson made, about had me and the entire theater dying with laughter. He did a good job, don't get me wrong, but the scene where he smells Bella for the first time... Dear God..<br/><br/>But, I did LOVE LOVE LOVE all of the supporting actors. Mike, Jessica, Eric, Tyler, Charlie were all AMAZING and for me, made the whole movie. <br/><br/>I can, say that I am a little disappointed in it, but I still loved it and plan on seeing it again in theaters."

Nikki Reed looks like one of the black guys in White Chicks and Kristen Stewart was as wooden and flat as a living human being can possibly be. The special effects are not equal to 50's TV and the script was painful to hear. Perhaps that is why the actors performed on something equal to middle-school level.<br/><br/>The sooner this tasteless little flick fades away, the better.<br/><br/>I assume Summit is rushing to complete the rest of the movies before the fan base grows up and develops some sense of taste.<br/><br/>Oh well, you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear."
"bob the moo","Null","19","160","13 July 2009"," Bland and surprisingly lacking in passion, excitement or breathlessness
","There is no point in pretending it ‚Äì I'm a man in his thirties and I'm not target audience for this film. So the fact that I rented it is just a ""bonus"" few pounds in the pockets of the makers since they clearly weren't aiming this film at me. Who they were aiming it at appears to have been the army of teenage girls who have been reading the Twilight books religiously ‚Äì again. I'd never even heard of the books so this is really something off my cultural radar. Regardless I decided to give the film a try without really knowing the plot or what it was meant to be. What I found was the first part in a longer story about a human teenager who moves back to her small town and falls for a boy who turns out to be one of a group of teenage vampires who feed off the blood of animals rather than people.<br/><br/>I have no problems with the teenage aspect of the story but somehow it really failed to engage me as it was not only too superficial but didn't even really do that particularly well. The film plays like it has been written around events without a great deal of depth, complexity or characterisation in it, which is a surprise considering the fertile ground the world of teenage love and acceptance is. Sadly it comes off all too bland and obvious for my tastes and I rarely could bring myself to care about what was going on. The direction is a bit too serious at times but it also lacks passion and the breathlessness that the material suggests it must have once had if it did captivate a teenage audience. Of course I could be just missing the point because perhaps the cast are a big part of it working and this is lost on me.<br/><br/>Certainly the appeal of much of the cast is lost on me totally. Stewart has something about her but cannot translate it into something meaningful here, leaving her character feeling a bit one-dimensional. However compared to Pattinson she looks like one of the finest actresses of her generation because he is about as dull and vapid as he could have been without trying. OK maybe his immortal, unsleeping character has to have something weirdly ""dead"" about him but this should not be a detrimental part of his performance as it is here. I shan't bother to list those below them because nobody really captured my interest in terms of their characters or performances.<br/><br/>Twilight is not a bad film, it is just a very bland one that lacks passion, heart or excitement. Maybe the target audience will strongly disagree (I'd be shocked if they did not) but having watched this for myself I fail to see what not only the fuss is about ‚Äì but why anyone would really consider this to be a good film."
"Tomatbo","9","6","37","20 November 2008"," Transforming from a book to a movie
","Many people will probably not like this movie and consider it too much of a Hollywood movie, but I don't agree. I think they did a great job in making a wonderful and lovable book to a really good movie.<br/><br/>Sure they didn't get all the details, but who could expect such a thing? I think however that adapting the different aspects in a terrific way! One of the things I know wasn't the same in the book as it is in the movie is the board with the graduation hats! A cleaver and witty idea of including the information received in the book. I thought it was great that they included Jacob in such a way that it won't be strange with the next movie.<br/><br/>The acting is not the best I have seen, I can give you that, but they still manage in a good way to get the feeling of what Stephanie Meyer wanted to tell. Well, at least according to my interpretation of the books. I almost started clapping in the cinema when I saw her on the screen getting a veggie-burger sitting with a computer; amazing.<br/><br/>This is a good movie even if you haven't read the books, sure there are a lot of details and background history that you don't get, but it's still understandable and a movie worth watching. Two of the girls that watched it with me had not even heard of the books before they came with us, but they still thought it was a great movie and will read the books as soon as the library opens tomorrow.<br/><br/>This is not just a vampire movie like any other, it's also a chick flick with a twist. You don't have to like chick flicks to like this movie, but it is romantic and watchable. If you have the chance and want to see a movie that makes you feel good and get a bit out of the ordinary, go watch it!"

","Allow me to begin by saying that I am deeply sceptical of the book-movie translation. As a Harry Potter fan, I was deeply disappointed with the films adaptation of the plot and most especially - the characters.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of Twilight, I was similarly sceptical, but after seeing various trailers and TV spots I was almost convinced that I was wrong.<br/><br/>This Sunday I was lucky enough to be one of the few in the UK to attend a press screening of the film and I was just blown away.<br/><br/>The film is incredible. In every single aspect. The most important feature, is - of course - Robert Pattinson playing the iconic Edward Cullen. He was flawless, and that in itself is an understatement. The entire crew was amazing, I have never seen a film cast so well in my life. Each character was themselves, even down to amusing extras. To me, the best way to describe it was the book coming to life. It has to be said that this is THE BEST book-movie adaptation I have ever seen. Everything about it just took my breath away.<br/><br/>The music was stunning, and perfect for every scene, the sets and locations were drenched in raw beauty, adding to the dark ominous feeling that Forks dishes out. The script was fantastic, most of it was verbatim from the book, except for the occasional, excellent add-in, most of which was hilarious and had the whole audience laughing. That, in my opinion, was one thing Twilight the book really lacked - humour. The interesting little scenes with Charlie really gave it that, leading me to the conclusion - dare I even speak it's blasphemous nature? - The film is, in a lot of ways, BETTER than the book.<br/><br/>Robert WAS Edward Cullen, I felt his torment and ardour in everything he did. Every single girl in the audience screamed when he first came on the screen, and I wanted to join in. He wasn't some stuck up actor playing at a part - he really was Edward. Kristen played Bella better than I ever imagined anyone could, making me like the character more than I ever did, she gave something to her that I think was missing. The Cullens were utterly delicious, each one picture perfect and with such stellar acting and off stage camaraderie, I was more excited about seeing them that anything else. Nikki Reed and Kellan Lutz had the exact connection between them that I imagined, in fact....EVERYTHING was exactly as I imagined, from the layout of Bella's bedroom, to the school and most definitely all the characters.<br/><br/>The plot was fast paced in parts, and wonderfully lingering in others. The kiss scene actually made me blush, it felt too private for other people to be watching. The villains were amazing, beautiful and terrifying at the same time. I never thought anyone could really pull of the 'friendly killer' look, but Cam sure did that.<br/><br/>More than that, more than anything else - I felt Bella and Edward's love for one another, in an almost tangible way. This film cannot be thrown discarded as another 'Vampire' film. It's barely even that, more it is a love story and by God it's a mouth-watering one.<br/><br/>Magnificent, addictive, beautiful and loyal. I cried, I laughed, I melted. See it!"
"leckscheid","7","3","14","21 November 2008"," Not as good as I was hoping...
","ACTUALLY ITS A VERY MILD SPOILER To be honest, I really, really want to like this movie, and I do...sort of.<br/><br/>It does stay pretty true to the book, they even plucked lines straight out of the novel...although some lines could have just stayed in the book as far as I was concerned (there's just no way to use the lion and lamb line without being cheesy, this film proves that). There were some fairly minor deviations from the book, but honestly nothing to get in a snit over. My major beef is that while Stephenie didn't talk down to the readers, the movie did. It just seemed that it was made solely for the 16 year old set, and unfortunately anyone older has a harder time sitting through it. The thing is that the book is more about the love story between Bella and Edward with a villain(s) chucked in at the end; the movie tried to make it more about the threat of the Nomadic vampires against Bella, so we ended up with a really abbreviated love story.<br/><br/>On to the acting (or over-acting)...I wont lie there is no shortage of cheese in this movie. Some of the lines, and the way they are delivered, just make your eyes roll. People in the theater were laughing more about how things were being said than any real humor in the dialogue.<br/><br/>I've come to the grim realization that I HATE Kristen Stewart as Bella, she does this annoying huffing after almost every line! It was beyond annoying, I just wanted to smack her upside the head for each eye roll, shrug and huff she delivered. She made Bella look and feel like such a ditz. I don't know if Kristen had trouble remembering her lines and therefore had to have these huffs and pauses to give herself time to think or what her goal was, but it didn't work for me.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, however, I loved Taylor as Jacob, which is weird because I didn't like his character, nor did I think the actor suited the part; so I'm happily wrong there. Billy Burke and Gil Birmingham (Charlie Swan and Billy Black) were fantastic. Kellen Lutz is perfect as Emmett and even Nikki Reed makes a good bitchy Rosalie. I can't have much of an opinion about the other Cullen actors as they didn't have enough lines nor screen presence to make much of an impression on me (except Jasper, who as Jessica line points out, ""looks like he's in pain"").<br/><br/>Rachelle Lefevre (Victoria) was also fantastic, she was way better than Cam Gigandet (James) and Edi Gathegi (Laurent).<br/><br/>And let's give it up for the humans! They were much funnier and less cheesy than the vampires (although I didn't like the take on Angela, she's supposed to be shy not a carbon copy of Jessica) The special effects left much to be desired (I HATE the glitter effect). They looked just too cheap and hokey for my tastes, but it's a low budget film, I wasn't really expecting a whole lot there.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how well the soundtrack was incorporated into the movie. I am one of those people who bought the soundtrack and to be honest I really only like four of the songs, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out how the hell any of the other songs were going to fit in the movie, but they did a very good job with it. Supermassive Black Hole during the baseball scene was perfect! Oh, I do have to say that I agree with Stephenie, the end credits were awesome."
"LLR_Cal_523","9","5","30","21 November 2008"," Haters - Give it a rest!
","To the people who have written all over message boards like these bashing the movie ¬ñ ENOUGH ALREADY! Your negativity and ruthless critiques are ruining a series many of us have become invested in.<br/><br/>I understand if people are unhappy with the film, and everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I think it is necessary to have some perspective on this. Being a self-described ""Twi-hard"" I had high expectations for the movie. I must say, after some initial casting reservations, I was very happy with the way the movie turned out.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart gave performances very indicative of their literary characters. The supporting cast of vampires - and the humans as well - was remarkably similar to the book. There were romantic moments, suspenseful moments, and other moments where my fellow Twilight fans were giggling like 12 year olds.<br/><br/>Some have said the movie was cheesy or saccharine. To that I have to say - OF COURSE! Any supporter of the novels would have been INFURIATED if certain romantic lines straight from the novel had been cut. People around the world (myself included) would be hysterical if the movie hadn't had enough passionate scenes and sweet dialogue. Teenage girls around the globe fell in love with this series because of the books' overwhelming love connection between the characters. The movie delivered exactly what die-hard fans wanted - the near sappy and unparalleled romance between two conflicted characters.<br/><br/>Others noted some of the inadequate special effects. To them, I have to ask - What did you expect? This was a film made off of a $37 million dollar budget. This is not a 'Harry Potter' type movie. This was more of an indie-like film. With what was available, the director did a great job of highlighting all the super-natural elements within the book. The baseball scene in particular was fantastic.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the movie delivered exactly what its core fans were hoping for. It was delightful to watch, and the chemistry between Bella and Edward was definitely there. It was as true to the book as a movie was going to be, and hopefully, with the money it will earn - they will be able to put more toward each of the sequels... all of which I'll be running to see."
"randy-janice","10","5","30","21 November 2008"," Movie does indeed have the heart of the book!
","I just came home from a midnight showing where I have to say how pleased I am at the movie staying true to the Heart of the Book. It is not as good as the book, but what movie can be? You have 2 hours to tell several hundred pages. The phrases we know and love so well are all in the movie, there are jokes, plenty of action, and yes the love story between Edward & Bella. You see 1st hand the frustration that Edward experiences while trying to fight with himself on Bella smelling so good. You see Rosalie's expression of ""I'm not sure I like you Bella"" rings loud and clear. And Yes you see the love blossom between Edward and Bella. I think even those who have not read the book will enjoy this movie. Everyone thought this would be 13 year old girls, but at the movies tonight I saw teenage girls & boys, along with women who are in the 20'-60's. It is a show for everyone to see and enjoy. I have to say that all of the actors did a great job and I even caught Stephenie Meyer in the movie--yes it really was her. The director did a superb job and I hope she will do the same for the rest of the movies. If you can't imagine that there can be ""good"" vampires in this world, then you won't like any of the Twilight Saga. That is the great part, that they CAN overcome the monster and be good, have a reason for being on this earth forever. I hope that those who see it and haven't read the books will want to read them. It is a exceptional fantasy and a delight to escape the world we live in. Isn't that the reason we go to a movie anyway? Thank you Stephenie for sharing this story with us. I love it and give books to everyone because I love to read and this movie is an excellent display of Hollywood bringing the books alive!"
"OneTiredMom","1","18","158","31 July 2009"," Kristen Stewart
","Kristen Stewart was beyond horrible.<br/><br/>The role of Bella was totally mis-cast, and that ruined the entire movie! How can you miscast the main character? She's a lousy actress to say the least.<br/><br/>She put no emotion into her role.<br/><br/>She STUNK! Additionally, the director didn't not put enough thought into this movie.<br/><br/>It was like he just tried to ""hurry up"" and get it into the theaters as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>If he would have taken more time, made the movie a bit longer (only if he would have followed the book more closely), then, and maybe then, I would have given this movie a higher rating. But again, Kristen Stewart totally ruined Bella. Instead of bringing her to life. She KILLED HER COMPLETELY!"

"raulfaust","7","2","8","28 January 2013"," Beauty and a heat
","I don't get why people are so hateful when talking about this movie. After thousand of bad commentaries about it, I finally gave it a chance-- and I don't regret it. First thing to congratulate is that they made a commercial romance with two actors out of the stereotypical-- a muscle and tall guy and a blonde perfect girl. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are both very common people, with no artificial beauty, which makes the movie becomes closer to the audience. Also, it NEVER gets into money; the movie ends and we simply don't mind who has money or who hasn't. When the movie starts you doubt it'll ever get any good, but it does! When you almost don't believe the main couple can have some chemistry, Catherine Hardwicke makes an involving scene in which Bella discovers he's a vampire, and simply do not care. I know it is hard to run away from the simple plot of ""Romeo and Juliet"", but ""Twilight"" is good enough to move away from that. Mixing drama, fantasy and romance is visibly a good choice for a teen audience, I really can understand why teens enjoyed this film so much. I'm almost 21 years old now, but in my young mind I can still relate to the characters sometimes. In the end, I believe much people dislike this movie because of its annoying fan base, since movie itself is actually good. It may be a ""Titanic"" for a younger generation."
"janetgonzalez-523-70267","9","2","8","8 November 2012"," ""Twilight Amazing Film Yes or No?""
","Have you ever thought of the best movie you've ever seen, well in this case for me is ""Twilight"" best movie ever. One important reason why ""Twilight"" is the greatest movie of all time is because it has great young actors. Second reason why ""Twilight"" is an absolute amazing film is, it has a really awesome story. The last reason why ""Twilight"" is a great movie is because the creator had such a great imagination in creating the whole thing. <br/><br/>Additionally, the first reason why ""Twilight"" is the greatest movie of all time is because it has great young actors. For example, Kirsten Stewart is one of the main characters in the movie. When she was in the movie four years ago she was very young and she played a really big role. And that explains that she is great at what she does, and she can handle with all the things that the directors and producers want her to do. And also the stress and pressure that they might have. <br/><br/>Furthermore, ""Twilight"" is an amazing film because it has a really great story. To demonstrate, why it is a great story is because the main plot of the movie is about a girl who lives with her father. She then starts to go to school and she has to partner up with a guy in science; then from there they start to talk more. They soon fall in love and he is always trying to protect her. This is only a small summary about the story, but there is definitely more.This story is great because it reminds us of the real kind of love that people have for each other. And it also makes you want to see more of the movie once it ends. <br/><br/>Although, Twilight is a very great movie for some people, has great actors, and has a great story and its a great movie. It can be kind of cheesy as the movie goes on because probably some people think it kind of boring or they might not enjoy the story. Also, many people don't like the kind of movies that have vampires or werewolves. Like the teenagers parents. And the audience might probably think its to much to put in one movie since there are many things happening during the story. <br/><br/>Essentially, the last reason why ""Twilight"" is a great film is because the creators had such a great imagination in creating the whole thing. For these reasons, first creating human vampires. They have the nice vampires and evil vampires and they're in a conflict between each other. Because many people enjoy watching those kinds of characters in life. Some people read the books, but once it comes to life it's better. Also, there are werewolves in the movie and and they actually bring them to life in the computers that they use for the graphics and all the technology that they use to create the movies. And in the movie there also different packs of werewolves.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Have you ever thought about the greatest movie that you've ever seen?, in this case for me it's ""Twilight"". For these three reasons ""Twilight has great young actors playing the main roles, like Robert Paterson and Kristen Stewart. Also, the story of the movie is great, the writer did a really great job writing it. Lastly, the whole film ""Twilight"" is amazing thanks to the creators, producers and the staff that made it come to life. Those are the three reasons why this is an amazing film and why people should watch the film."

","I first heard of twilight a few years ago and I didn't know if I wanted to see it in theaters so I waited out. When I found it on DVD I watched it and... It wasn't that bad. Its actually pretty good.<br/><br/>Bella Swan goes to Forks to visit her dad Charlie. While there, she goes to a high school and meets new friends. One of them is Edward Cullen, she thinks he acts strange and she tries to figure out why. Edward is a nice fella who takes her out to bond with him. But he is hiding a secret from.<br/><br/>Also there is Jacob Black, one of her old friends. Something is also weird with Jacob too as he talks about wolves with his heritage. I appreciate Jacob because he is actually nice to Bella.<br/><br/>One Day Bella is nearly ran over and Edward stops the car. After this accident she decides to search up whats going on. She figures out hes a vampire. Then we see the ""Flaw"" of the film everyone keeps talking about. When Edward goes into the sunlight he glows. I don't care people if he glows OK? Its something new. She also gets to meet his Vampire family including Carlise, Jasper, Alice, Esme and others.<br/><br/>I can go on but Im running out of words unfortunitally. So this is the end of the review.<br/><br/>Verdict: 79/100-B"

","I think that this is a great movie. I love the actors, I love the story, I love the book AND the movie. The music is just perfect. And Robert's contribution with Never think and Let me sign is just amazing. The actors are talented, and I do know that they have changed some lines and scenes but in some ways that was good. I like the fight scene which doesn't exist in the book-it's actually hidden within The Angel, and it was nice to see it in the movie. One more thing...the scene in which Bella is bitten is just OMG!!!!! Kristen did a marvelous job!!! I could feel the venom running throughout her veins. Just W O W!!! I'm in love...I'm in love..."
"Primehunter","9","2","8","2 December 2008"," OH Twilight...Twilight
","I have a love and hate relationship with this Saga. I'm sure i know exactly why. It's like Death and Taxes...but in here it's Sex, Death and Taxes all summed in one. The books are horribly written, but the characters are amazing. Some of the plots are stupid, but mostly it was intense and interesting. The development of their love in the first book was awesomely executed by Stephanie Meyer (as badly and redundant she was with her writing) We (the readers) were able to believe it and love it. But that is one of the Major flaws in the movie. The character development between Edward and Bella was cut short. The scene in the Meadow (and it is a holy scene to the Twilighters) was absolutely destroyed. It should have been done a bit slower. BUT above all the chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson is AMAZINGLY good...not too many movie get well casted actors together...last years was Atonement's Keira Knightley and James Mcavoy (It was like they were on fire or something of that sort) Anywho back to Twilight.<br/><br/>The Cast. Well casted, all fit the bill, especially Pattison and Stewart. But there had been some moments of bad acting for everyone! since everyone had these moments i believe that the director..whom fabulously filmed Vanilla Sky..did a really bad job at Directing a new and upcoming cast. Yeah yeah...i know we've seen them in other movies but they still need more training to become better actors, and in this movie...I don't feel like they were challenged enough. I've seen Pattinson before in other movie and Stewart too as well as Nikki Read and they all were superb actor in their roles...why??...because they had good directors...this one..i don't know what happened..but she lost it somehow...This series needs someone even more passionate to direct the story properly.<br/><br/>The story to the movie. Greatly done! Most of the major plots are there, some scene were combined to save time, but which movie doesn't do that to book they adapted? BUT thanks to Stephanie Meyer's bad dialogue and writing some of her worst lines ended up in the movie...and oh my lord did i ever want to run. nevertheless as the movie went on, everything from the baseball match to the end was dead on.<br/><br/>That's all i have to say really, love it, but hate it at the same time. and to be honest, if Pattinson and Stewart weren't in it,i don't think i would have watched it.<br/><br/>Cheers Hala"
"mattenzo11","10","2","8","29 November 2008"," started weirdly but later on it was really good
","OK before i start i apologise for the lack of punctuation and adequate grammar/spelling because i get kinda carried away when i comment on a movie.<br/><br/>well my first impression of this film was that it looked like a 80's teen movie with random sepia shots of animals so to be honest i wasn't impressed until... i saw Robert pattinson's acting that guys for a bright future ahead of him he is instantly likable and plays the role very well. until i watched the whole movie i couldn't see how clever the crew are i thought that it was poor music editing as there were some parts where there was complete silence and then randomly there was music in a different setting but i realised that this was because the non-musicy bits were where the characters were feeling uncomfortable e.g. Bella talking with her dad at the start and then there was music when Bella was at school as the other students were always bouncy and happy. one scene i loved was when Edward first saw Bella and her hair was being blown around by a fan (in most films when love at first sight is implyed the woman's hair blows around randomly but this scene had hair blowing with a reason) this was shown through Edward's eyes and was very powerful.<br/><br/>i must try to keep this brief as i have many points to make. i really liked the book and this film was pretty true to the book and the scenes were wise as it is a film based on a book with many fans. for the first 30mins i thought it was an average film with a very good actor and a good soundtrack but after that i really got into it and enjoyed it a lot. everything about the film was good apart from 2 things: 1) the beginning wasn't the best in the world and didn't set the story very well. 2) the scene where they go into the woods and what Bella says sounds very scripted as if she had a writer on hand and doesn't sound at all like what an intellectual 17 year old would say.<br/><br/>this movie had me in its grasp after 30mins and wouldn't let go until the end i felt really sorry for Charlie when Bella left forks and the scene is done in such a way that anyone can empathise with him.<br/><br/>this movie is a must see for people of all ages and genders, it is a romance with a little bit of everything which makes it extremely entertaining."
"rinkruler94","10","2","8","25 November 2008"," The movie was good...
","I loved the movie, but comparing it to the book isn't fair to either one. One course, compressing that book into a 2 hour and 20 minute movie called for some editing. And of course, some people will say that the movie was better than the book (but I'm not sure how they can say that) One website even went as far as to write an article of 25 reasons why the movie was better than the book. This website was bashing the book, and received the much needed hate mail. I also liked the soundtrack. It went well with the movie. Like somebody had said before, just enjoy the movie. And enjoy the book. Trying to compare them will get you nowhere."

","I thought the movie was really good, I saw it on Friday evening and I am going to go see it for a second time tonight! I don't think I have ever been excited to go back to see a movie while it is still in theaters. I thought Summit did a very good adaptation of the book, it had a low budget to begin with! I think if you loved the book, you'll love the movie. Robert Pattison played a GREAT Edward!! The only thing I disliked about the movie is that I found it very short, but again that can't really be helped their is a lot of story to fit in a 2 hour movie! Overall I really enjoyed the movie! My favorite scene was when Edward saved Bella in Port Angeles, I thought is was real hot the way he came racing onto the scene in his Volvo!"
"s0sahweet","6","2","8","25 November 2008"," Oh Bella
","I don't feel this movie was as bad as others are saying. I do have to agree with the acting being HORRIBLE. It was not at all believable that Bella never wanted Edward to leave her. I mean, she didn't even cry! Anytime Edward mentioned them not being friends, or him staying away from her, all she did was stutter. REALLY? Because if I was so madly in love with someone and they were telling me they wanted to stay away from me, without giving me a reason as to why, I would cry! I thought Robert Pattinson was a great Edward though. I did not think his accent was bad at all. I wish they hadn't left out some things such as the Biology incident, Edward picking Bella up and they're almost matching outfits. And why didn't Bella meet Jacob at the beach like they had in the book? Stupid things they didn't do but really should have. All in all, I really enjoyed this movie as did my boyfriend and this is definitely NOT his type of movie. I think some people are being a little too harsh. I have definitely seen worse."
"aharmas","10","2","8","23 November 2008"," Faithful and Dazzling, Alluring and Impressive
","I read the novel by accident, recognizing immediately its themes and its audience, yet I couldn't stay away from its refreshing new angle. Taking a backseat to the love, passion, and mystery were horror and gore, and it was all from the point of view of a teenager. What made it different was the fact that such feelings do not change much when experienced by an older crowd, and though not fully recognized in the original source of every modern vampire film, they were now the centerpiece of the story. When I heard that it would become a film, I dreaded the results since now there is strong emphasis on the flash, not the substance, and where its detractors will say that this story has a weak center, I disagree because though its themes might not be recognized as ""important"", they are universal and appealing to everyone who gives it a chance.<br/><br/>It's difficult not be seduced by this dazzling adaptation of ""Twilight"". It showcases some of the most beautiful cinematography ever in a movie, adroitly complementing the cold passion at the heart of the story; it fits the color scheme of our protagonists: the main characters stand out for their pallor, their icy facades which strangely highlight the red of the lips and the gold of their irises. Their surroundings are always cloudy, giving the green of the foliage an intensity that keeps you remembering the forces at the heart of the story.<br/><br/>In addition there is an amazing soundtrack highlighting the various emotions of the characters, from haunting to passionate, from delicate to erotic, from loneliness to full satisfaction. Rarely has a film been matched to music as carefully as this. When we are treated to the notes of ""Claire De Lune"" and it envelops us, we know we are dealing with a special work of art.<br/><br/>As if the handsome and perfect production values weren't enough, we are introduced to a couple of performers that will easily find super stardom in their respective professional careers. Both Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson glow and are absolutely loved by the camera. They fit the creations of the novel perfectly, and their performances are intense and flawless. We understand the complexity of the relationship, as these two people show us how easy is to be seduced by the powers in nature, and how terrifying the consequences might be. There is a fine line between humanity and our ties to the lower animals.<br/><br/>""Twilight"" is very entertaining considering its leisured pace, and this is another one of its qualities, what makes it special. This is a film directed by an assured hand by Catherine Hardwicke, a director who is not afraid to show the intelligence and sensibility in young people. She respects their nature, their angst, their perspective about what a strong connection means to them, and maybe to us. We were able to take a very realistic look at the world of teenagers in her movie ""Thirteen"", and I wondered for a moment what Evan Rachel Wood could have done with the character of Bella, but it doesn't really matter because it there was ever a time where piece managed to fit perfectly, is in this film, an amazing achievement that will seduce its audience with its delight production, extraordinary acting, and perfect direction.<br/><br/>Let yourself be seduced."
"karenluvesfudge","8","2","8","23 November 2008"," It could have been better, but still great :]
","the movie was pretty good, but there it was no where near perfect. they changed too many things and it didn't follow the book in a lot of parts, which is understandable since the book is so long, but they still changed a lot of things that they should have left alone, they had a lot of things in the wrong places and at the wrong time, and they took out or changed parts that i found especially important . i mean, hello, Bella meets Jacob in la push, they didn't know each other from before. and i don't remember them going in to the water considering its like 55 degrees. what happened to when Jacob was telling her the story about his tribe and the cold ones? they really rushed through that part, in the book its much more detailed. and what about chapter 5 (blood type)? i was really looking forward to that and having Edward carry Bella to the nurse. and then the Port Angeles scene was wrong, and so was the drive back. on the way back is when Bella asks him how old he is, not in the woods. i also pictured the scene when Edward took her to his house way differently, and i pictured the actual house a lot different too. what happened to when Edward was telling her about Carlisle's past in his office, and when he plays the lullaby was way different in the book because all the Cullens were there and Esme is the one that tells Bella that Edward has musical talent. and what was up with him taking her into the trees and stuff? and what about the meadow? that was way different in the book. they WALKED there at Bella's pace, it wasn't until the way back that Edward runs. and their first kiss was in the meadow too, not in Bella's room with her in underwear. and what happened to her sitting with Edward the day after he saves her? what about Bella cooking for Charlie? and Bella ditches Alice and jasper at the airport, not from the hotel, and she goes to her house first, not directly to the ballet studio. and Victoria at the prom? i mean, come on. however, considering that it was based on a book, it was a great movie. the movies are never as good as the books. what i liked was that Charlie was pretty funny (like when Edward first goes to his house and he's like loading the rifle), and her mom was funny too (are you being safe?!) and mike was awesome, like when he's like dancing or something outside the window while Charlie and Bella were eating. the actors were HOT, and the girls were really pretty. the fighting scene was awesome, it was just like i pictured it, and they prom was great too (except for Victoria at the end). overall, i give it an 8 out of 10."
"beingbeckeroni","6","2","8","22 November 2008"," Excellent translation from book to film...
","Walking into the theater was one of the scariest moments for me. Seeing how the Harry Potter movies have developed and apparently deviated from the book (according to my furious father), I was so afraid that this was just going to be some fluffy teenage angst movie with the only similarities to the book that inspired it being the title slapped on it and characters with similar names to the characters in the books...<br/><br/>And luckily, that wasn't the case. Catherine Hardwicke and Melissa Rosenberg did an excellent job of translating the essence of the first book in the Twilight saga from book to film. Without deviating from the book too much (at least not noticeably enough), they captured visually what Stephenie Meyer captured through written word. <br/><br/>I thought both Kristen Stewart (Bella) and Rob Pattinson (Edward) did great jobs at portraying not only their characters, but the intensely emotional relationship between the 'star-cross'd' lovers. All the supporting cast members, the Cullens and Bella's school friends, were great; in character and spot-on every time. I was especially impressed with Jasper (Jackson Rathbone)'s performance, portraying the restraint and struggle without making it seem overdone and over the top. <br/><br/>My favorite scene was the baseball scene. It was EXACTLY how I pictured it while I read the book. Even better, was the energy of the whole scene was hyped up with Muse's ""Supermassive Black Hole"" playing in the background... <br/><br/>What I didn't expect was how hilarious the entire movie ended up being! In a (negative) review of Twilight I read in my newspaper, it said that ""the witty banter between Edward and Bella about their respective immortality and humanity is completely lost and all that's left is a slog of teenage angst."" HOW WRONG THEY WERE! Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson deliver the funny and awkward lines with perfect timing... ""Edward/Rob: I just told you that I read minds, and you think there's something wrong with *you*?!?"" I thought it was hilarious. <br/><br/>And who could forget Charlie (Billy Burke), sweet, protective, Charlie?! From the first time you see him driving Bella home from the airport, awkwardly and stealthily glancing at her, looking as if he's wondering if he should say something or just stay silent, the adorable connection between ""Charlie"" and daughter is made. One of the best scenes is when Bella comes out to Charlie about her and Edward ""dating"" and the look on his face is priceless! ""Bella/Kristen: I'm going on a date with Edward Cullen. Charlie/Billy: I thought that you weren't interested in any boys in town... Bella/Kristen: *pause* Well... Edward doesn't technically live in town. Charlie/Billy: *silent and continues to clean shot gun* Bella/Kristen: And... he's here now to formally introduce himself. Charlie/Billy: Alright... *snaps shotgun shut and cocks it* Bring him in.""<br/><br/>Priceless. Just... priceless.<br/><br/>The only reason I took 1 star off of my review is because of the special effects... they weren't ""cheesy"" like everyone complains, but the could've been a little better, maybe with more funding. This was a surprisingly low-budget movie. Hopefully when they're filming the second movie for ""New Moon"" they'll bust out the big special effects for the 'werewolves' transformations, considering Stephenie Meyer describes it as a ""pop."""
"rama-28","7","2","8","22 November 2008"," Rated T or Teens
","Let me just start by saying that I've never read the book that this movie's based on but I now can see why teen girls everywhere go ga-ga over this. The movie itself is done in a way that it makes you feel like you're watching... a theatrical CW network episode, it's hard not to remember series like Smallville or Supernatural when watching TWILIGHT. It can be clich√É¬© at times, but it's to be expected when telling a story about high school romance with complications attached. No matter what you may say about this afterward, you know in your gut that you've just watched an instant teen classic.<br/><br/>Just to give you a heads up, if you're going to watch TWILIGHT in a theater room jam-packed with teen audiences, better prepare some ear muffs because they'll be screaming hysterically every time the stars of the movie show up on screen or do something that reminds them of a plot in the book that they've read repeatedly a thousand times.<br/><br/>Just as I've implied earlier, TWILIGHT has all the right ingredients to get a teen audience hooked and seated for the whole duration of the story. From the typical dialogue and the typical humor plus the extravagant showcase of super power abilities all the way to the idea of mysterious man with mysterious past would come by and sweep you off your feet with his savior complex. Today's generation goes crazy over that kind of stuff and the movie feeds into that frenzy, if you will. It knows its target market and it does a satisfactory job.<br/><br/>I admit, there are times when this movie makes me laugh unintentionally and by that I mean, some of the scenes are so cheesy and exaggerated while other scenes could've done more to entertain but it fell short, I'm guessing it's the same reason with all book-based movies that try to pack everything into one presentation without hitting a 3 hour mark. What you get in the end, is an attempt and hope for the best.<br/><br/>Director Catherine Hardwicke has done a lot to make sure that even if the teens could notice flaws or changes in the adaptation, they could still enjoy the chemistry between the characters and the escalating intensity that it promises from the beginning to the end of the story, not to mention also some hints of 'cliffhangers' that suggest a sequel is underway.<br/><br/>But I'm betting my money that the thrilling cinematography by Elliot Davis is going to get millions to visit the locations of where this movie was filmed. If the landscape doesn't capture those teens, then the way the camera often does close up focus on Robert Pattinson's face will. That's another thing that also cracks me up, how the movie goes the distance to weld into teen's minds that Pattinson might be their next Greek god.<br/><br/>So overall, I wasn't fully disappointed but I wouldn't consider it an incredible movie-watching experience. As long as it has decent visual effects, I'm there for the next installments. TWILIGHT serves its purpose and it goes to show that an unlikely romance story between two different characters from two different worlds, to some, will never get old... in a funny way, it plays on the stereotypical assumption that some girls fall for interesting bad boys no matter how risky the relationship could get. At one point, Bella is so head over heels for Edward that she's willing to be vampire too while Edward tells her that she doesn't know what she's talking about. Love at such a young age does tend to get some people to do things without thinking clearly about it first. TWILIGHT should've been rated T for Teens."
"chenabeena","4","2","8","22 November 2008"," Robert Pattinson is Edward; weak storyline
","I have read the books.<br/><br/>I think Robert Pattinson is an excellent Edward Cullen.<br/><br/>I do agree with most people who are disappointed by the storyline. It seemed like Bella went from being confused about Edwards dislike for her to being totally in love with him - that quickly. The book draws you into more of the development about why these two were so drawn to each other and the movie definitely lacks that.<br/><br/>I loved, loved, LOVED Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen - he absolutely did it for me. Something about they way he phrased things and delivered his lines made me absolutely feel like that is what Edward would say and that is EXACTLY how Edward would say it.<br/><br/>Bella was less convincing, but I cannot blame Kristen Stewart; she was probably handed a bum and unconvincing story line that did not help create the being that is Bella Swan.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the baseball scene, Alice was truly Alice for me, Rosalie was just as convincing. Jasper seemed very constipated and did nothing for me; neither did Emmett. Esme was Esme for me. I think the casting was pretty good; I just wish the storyline had been better.<br/><br/>Jacob was okay; there was more of a tortured relationship between Bella and Jasper that I would have preferred to see on the screen.<br/><br/>I have to give it a low score though because it just didn't translate that well for me to the big screen and I can only hope they do much better with the sequels."
"Soccerbucks","6","2","8","21 November 2008"," Entertainment vs. Fantasy of Book
","I felt the movie had entertainment values, but anyone who did not read the book can not truly understand the motivation behind it. The romance between Edward and Bella lacked some of the sparkling moments that were described in the book. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect the movie to be just like the book. The movie just portrays Edward as a creeper. The main theme of the movie is not love. The main theme is awkward. Twilight had the audience laughing at things that were not supposed to be funny. Overall, It was worth seeing in theaters but didn't live up to the fantasy. New Moon, if they make it, should hopefully be good as well. But hey everyone is able to have their own opinion. This has just been mine."
"Mer_Girl_Fits_Heaven","4","2","8","21 November 2008"," Its not right, but its OK
","A separate review should be written for straight men and women. I have a feeling that nothing will matter to the latter, because Robert Pattinson elevates ""gorgeous"" to a whole new level. I have never read the books, but at the advance screening, my cousin (female) and I found ourselves bursting into fits of giggles for no reason other than Robert Pattinson's magnetic presence. Yeah, its a big deal. And that, for the most part, was ample distraction from the rest of this mediocre movie.<br/><br/>That being said, the rest of the movie ranged from underwhelming to outright garbage. Even Pattinson's acting, which was spot on in his opening scene became unintentionally funny while he tried to explain to Bella how dangerous he was. This movie had people laughing when I'm sure they weren't supposed to. There is hardly any character development, especially with the villains. James and Victoria kill people and want to eat Bella, so we know they're the bad guys, and yet the actors don't have enough charisma or screen time to give the viewer the illusion for a moment that they're a threat.<br/><br/>The love story falls unapologetically flat on its face. I'm sure they followed the book verbatim, because there would be no other excuse for it-- Edward loves Bella because she smells good (and Bella, naturally, loves Edward because he is Robert Pattinson). That's not enough to justify this supposedly romantic saga. It's basically the equivalent of saying ""Edward loves Bella because he loves her."" Why? ""Well duh, he loves her."" Even the screenwriters apparently couldn't come up with a connection between them. There is a scene, which is supposed to show them getting to love each other: He's in her room, and they're talking. It's a montage of them talking, but THEY'RE VOICES ARE MUTED AND ALL YOU CAN HEAR IS MUSIC. The writer actually couldn't find anything for them to talk about together, which makes their romance seem utterly superficial, and the moment Robert Pattinson is off the screen, even giggly female viewers have to admit this movie doesn't have much to offer.<br/><br/>If all you want is to drool over possibly the most beautiful man ever born, go see this movie. But if you want a plausible, touching love story with cool vampires, you'll be disappointed."

","Why can't Hollywood make more movies like Twilight? A fantasy love story that more than satisfies the adult mind and heart! Without a doubt, this is the best vampire film ever made! I can't praise this story highly enough! It is, also, by far, one of the best movies of the year! Wow! I didn't want it to end!! <br/><br/>What makes Twilight such a hit? First, it turns the Vampire myth on it's head. Vampires do have choices! They don't have to be evil! In fact, they can form cooperative families to protect themselves from being discovered and from fellow malevolent vampires. Vampires also can love just as deeply as a any human being! In other words, vampires can feel tenderness, appropriately adapt to their surrounding environment and follow a demanding ethical code<br/><br/>Beside the delightful love story, there's superb acting and mind-boggling cinematography. I've never been to the American Northwest before, but seeing this amazing part of the world up close and personal - it's now on the top of my places to vacation list!<br/><br/>Thank you Hollywood for a job well done! It just goes to prove you can make films that are both touching and profitable!"

","Based on the book series by Stephenie Meyer. Twlight centers around Bella Swan(Kristen Stewart), a new girl in town coming to live with her sheriff father(Billy Burke), while attending a new school, and making some new friends, she becomes fascinated by Edward Cullen(Robert Pattinson), a pale face seventeen year old, who is pretty much a loner. One day Bellas fate changes when she almost dies in a automobile accident, but is saved by Edward. But the questions begin to come like, how did Edward get to her so fast, it's like he is as fast as a cheetah. And how did he stop the truck with one hand, it's like he has the strength of ten men. When she tries to talk to Edward, he tries his best to dance around those questions. After doing a lot of investigating, like why he is so pale, and why he needs his skin need to be cool, the conclusion is he is a vampire. But she is still not afraid of him, and the two start falling in love. But will Bellas love for Edward be dangerous for her? <br/><br/>A great film, Kristen Stewart has grown into her own since playing Jodie Fosters daughter in Panic Room(2002), and she and Robert Pattinson have such beautiful chemistry, you really believe that there in love. not to mention it also had dazzling effects. I wouldn't compare it Ann Rice novels, Twlight comes in its own. It was very well directed by Catherine Hardwicke, the direction was not sloppy for a second.

","I stood in line for this movie fully expecting it to be 'not as good as the book'. I watched the hundreds of teens in line in front of me squeal excitedly as we were let in. Then, as the lights went down, and I became accustomed to the hush of the first few scenes, I was startled to hear the SCREAMS when Edward first entered. I wanted to scream too. Edward, Bella, Carlisle, Charlie, Jacob--everyone was cast perfectly. The music matched the tone. The story (though shortened) was perfection. The apple scene. The first kiss. When he wears the sunglasses. (Insert teen screaming here.) If I had to change anything about the movie, I wouldn't. This is not a teen movie. This is a timeless love story, with excellent morals (no premarital sex, no swearing, respectful children). People say it's predictable. Jane Austen is predictable, and we still love her! We know that the handsome rich guy will always get the smart and beautiful girl in the end. Twilight is the new Jane Austen."

","Wow.. this movie was a lot better than I thought it would be. I am a huge fan of the Twilight series, and was very pleased with the movie. I must admit, I was a bit worried about how it would turn out, but I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was well casted, and the actors looked MUCH better in the movie than in the pictures on the internet, so before you say they all look terrible, see the movie, please. Also, I was very pleased at the fact that nearly every line in the movie was straight from the book. Most book-movies seem to veer off the course of the original book, but this movie struck pretty closely to the story line. The only thing I would have changed in the movie was to tweak the music, just a bit. But otherwise, this movie was FANTASTIC! I know that this must have been a VERY difficult movie to film, and I think it directed with the best ability that it could have been directed under. I was very pleased with the final results. Also, the movie had just the right amount of love: just enough so you know that Bella and Edward were really in love, but not too much to be really sensual. It could be considered "" a movie your dad would approve of"" . I was very pleased with the final results of the movie and highly recommend it."

Many movie adaptions change quite a bit or leave really important things out but not Twilight. I found myself laughing and sighing and crying along with my friends.

I was worried ever since I heard they were making a movie out of my favorite Twilight Books, but now I am so happy that the movie properly reflects the beauty of the Twilight books. <br/><br/>Kristen is very convincing as Bella. She really nailed how quiet Bella is, how smart and strong she is. She was breathtaking when she was talking about how much she loved Edward. Perfect awkwardness, perfect desperation, totally flawless Bella. She is obviously, by far, the best actress we could have hoped for to portray Bella.<br/><br/>Rob was just adorable and so tragic as Edward. He came off as furious, desperate,terrified...Perfect for Edward. He was desperate to be near Bella, but at the same time, he seemed terrified of her. He seemed self conscious about himself around Bella, whether he was talking about his secret or his taste in music. He seemed desperate and overly protective and just perfect!<br/><br/>The two of them really worked well together. The entire cast was perfect for their roles, the movie was BEAUTIFULLY shot, it was exciting and so wonderful.

"allthatjazz89","8","4","24","21 November 2008"," Decent book-to-screen translation. GREAT movie!!
","As many people have said, book to screen translations are hard. But because this was done by an Indie director and produced was done by an Indie studio, this movie became unique. Could you imagine if this was just another Hollywood film done by a big Hollywood studio that got big name actors and a big name director. It would be just another cheesy Hollywood romance with the twist that one of them is a vampire. Woohoo. ""Twilight"" is much, much more than just a Young Adult romance novel. It has something that appeals to everyone, as I know most of you know. I was THANKFUL that it didn't focus strictly on the romance of Bella and Edward. That would be a lame movie.<br/><br/>On our way home from the midnight showing, I had a friend sitting in back of my other friend's car nit picking at everything that was wrong. Her first argument was that Kristen Stewart did a horrible job and that she didn't cry when she was supposed to. Our response to that is: That's not Kristen's fault. Catherine made the decision on that. And she probably included Stephenie in a lot of the filming or Stephenie was on set most of the time. It is far from the fact that ""Kristen Stewart can't act!!"" It's the fact that this is what the director of the film wanted. They probably tried it a bunch of different ways and what ended up in the film was probably the best take.<br/><br/>Her second argument was that it didn't include all the great dialogue from the book. Well...Personally...I don't want to sit there and watch the book literally on the screen. There are still somethings that are left to the imagination when you re-read the book which I am thankful for. I saw this with ""The da Vinci Code"" which had nothing creative about it. They took the book and just re-wrote it as a screenplay pretty much. I was bored out of mind. I think if they would have done that with ""Twilight"" it wouldn't be so appealing. Plus, we got some good new lines with the movie. (Edward: That guy isn't looking...he just looked.) All in all, I think this is a great movie. I am going to put on my flame retardant suit. But it's true. For what it was and for what the book is...I was stunned. I may have gone in with low standards, but I am a harsh critic as well. If you're going to see ""Twilight"" after reading the book, you do have to go in with an open mind and know that this isn't going to be word-for-word like the book. You have terrible book-to-screen translations that are horrible (Blood and Chocolate, The Princess Diaries), some that are decent (The da Vinci Code), and some that are amazing (Bridget Jones's Diary). It is my firm belief that ""Twilight"" falls under the amazing. No, it's not godsmackingly glorious. But it is its own monster. It is a great companion for the book.<br/><br/>To me, it has earned 4.5 stars out of five. Why just 4.5? Because, Cam did steal the scene when he was on the screen, they didn't include ""Breakfast time!...For the human!"" and the whole theories and questioning thing happening too early. But other than that. The film was amazing."
"excalibur212","1","18","181","7 April 2009"," Perhaps the most linear, amateurish, subtext-free film ever....
","I could tell from the trailer this movie was trash, but out of curiosity and boredom/insomnia i gave it a download (would never pay a penny to watch this). I couldn't even make it halfway through without turning it off. The storytelling was like reading a children's book: everything told in linear fashion, and then spelled out with ""flashcards"" two seconds later in case anyone was still too dense to understand (e.g. say wolf, then show a picture of a wolf on the screen...show a book she wants, then two scenes later show her in the library...gee, thanks, i wouldn't have understood without the spoon-feeding). I think this movie was meant for 12 year olds or people of very low intelligence. They should show movies like this to film students and do play by plays, ""OK, here's how NOT to shoot a scene/edit a movie...."" How do studios actually give people with no talent money to make crap movies like this??? Do yourself a favor: Go see ""Let The Right One In"" instead. That is, if you have an IQ over 80."
"shaehararashida","3","16","157","4 December 2008"," And Now I Can't Sleep
","With few redeeming qualities, I've never wanted to walk out on a show so much in my life. From horrible acting and dialog to the worst sound track since the 70's, this film left much to be desired. <br/><br/>When I first heard about production of this movie I completely expected that it would deviate from the book. Honestly movies have to, it's just a fact. I understand the need for more action when most of the book is simply Bella's thoughts regarding the events around her. But, the main theme of the books (the love story between Edward and Bella) was almost completely left out! To a viewer who has not read the book the full-of-holes love story is confusing and completely unbelievable. The lack of development of their relationship makes it appear that the two simply hung out in the woods once or twice after school. <br/><br/>This film was trying to be too mainstream tween. The use of the lingo, fashion, lack or morality, and trends took away the more timeless appeal of the books and raised a lot of eyebrows. To name a few: Edward suddenly appears in Bella's room when she's dressed in a t-shirt and underwear? Yet she isn't phased by this and they have their first kiss (after he stalker-ishly tells her that he's been in her room watching her sleep every night for 3 months). Guess Bella isn't quite as shy and self conscious as we thought (or as much as the average teen age girl). Shouldn't the way he's leering at her in her underwear and telling her that he's obsessed raised a few red flags? Get out that pepper spray, Bella! His actions made sense in the book but are just plain creepy here. Jessica is practically falling out of her prom dress, yet Bella lets her know that's a great selling point. Billy is ""just keepin' it real"". That did make me laugh, but the kids from Forks were really irritating. <br/><br/>Robert Pattison's acting was alright half the time, but the other half his speech was so dazed and slow that he sounded mentally disabled. Kristen Stewart's acting was okay but would have greatly been benefited by a good script. The dialog sounded poorly edited---like a few good sound bites had been inserted here or there for effect but they couldn't really get to the heart of what they were supposed to be saying. I felt like I was watching ""The Dueling Cavalier"" before the sound editing overhaul in ""Singing in the Rain"".<br/><br/>The music was unbelievably awful! Between the Simon and Garfunkle imitations and the guitar laden background music during the action sequences, the music just didn't fit! <br/><br/>I'm not even going to get started on the horrible special effects---I'll attribute that to the low budget this film had.<br/><br/>What's with the sudden fascination with spider-monkeys? Guess ""Jazz"" and ""Nessie"" weren't such weird nicknames after all. . .<br/><br/>That all being said, I did like a few things. I enjoyed the characterization and portrayal of Charlie and James. The baseball scene was fun! The prom (excluding the improportionate length of the scene, and the part where Victoria shows up???) was an awwww moment. Parts of the scene at the Cullens house were funny/cute. Did I mention that Charlie and James were great?...<br/><br/>Anyhow, this movie bothered me so much that now I can't sleep. Hope the filmmakers can't either. My only hope is that this movie will make enough money to have a decent enough budget for ""New Moon"" that good producers, directors, scriptwriters, etc. can be hired."

Now thats been said, in my opinion the movie is absolutely horrible.<br/><br/>I didn't see the movie in theaters, and i'm so glad i didn't. There is no clear storyline whatsoever. After watching the first 25 minutes, i felt as if someone had cut the scenes before they had ended. In fact i had asked my friend if this version was in somehow edited by a teenage boy. The movie is so awkward i just felt like laughing. Where Bella sees the police car she says 'what is going on' as if she is reading from the script. I felt like i was watching some depressing parody of the movie instead. Kristen looked depressed in this whole movie, no facial expressions whatsoever! I think she might have smiled once throughout this whole movie. When she goes to his parents house, her acting is even more unbearable. The cast of Edward's family is very well done, and at least they know how to act. Rob was good, except i could do without the pasty make-up job.<br/><br/>WATCH THIS MOVIE. You will laugh. Its just so funny. I can't wait until another sort of 'scary movie' comes out and they take their time to disregard all the other movies this year and do twilight.

"ali-joaquin","10","2","9","19 February 2013"," Twilight: Not your Average Run-of-the-Mill Love Story
","""You are my life now"" are the famous words expressed by Edward Cullen to sum up his entire relationship with Isabella Swan. The two create chemistry between their characters that no mediocre actors could even attempt to generate. Not only would the movie Twilight be nothing without its novelty screen writing and profound performances, but the elaborate works of both the director and producer all play a part in making this movie able to become prosperous and topping the charts worldwide.<br/><br/>The movie Twilight portrays the average boy meets girl, girl falls in love with boy love story; however, it is shown through a spiral effect that fits our day and age. A young vampire boy falls for an ordinary girl in high school. At first, their attraction is denied, but as it turned out, it was much too strong to neglect. Stephanie Meyers, the author of the phenomenal book series, The Twilight Saga, came up with the story line of this movie from a dream she experienced first hand. As she explained on her website, the dream was of ""two people having an intense conversation in a meadow (of) the woods. One of (those) people was just your average girl. The other was fantastically beautiful, sparkly, and a vampire."" They were discussing the difficulties they were about to face because they were falling in love with each other, and the vampire was having a hard time keeping the girl alive because of the smell of her blood. But aside from their attraction, what exactly is keeping viewers compelled to watch this movie in full?<br/><br/>The movie Twilight would be nothing without its astounding acting. Many people may say Kristen Stewart does not excel in the role of Isabella Swan, but in actuality, she is truly a remarkable actress. The role of Isabella Swan is supposed to be portrayed as being awkward and out of step. In order to fill this role, Stewart becomes her character to the extreme. She feels and believes she is in character throughout the entirety of this movie to create the image of Isabella Swan, as does Robert Pattinson. Pattinson came all the way from England to play the role we all see as Edward Cullen. Coming to be known from the world-renowned movie, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Pattinson's career takes off like a rocket just three years later at the premiere of Twilight on November 17, 2008. The character of Edward Cullen is to be strong, yet misunderstood. Pattinson portrays this with his own flavor and flare by adding a real sparkle (pun intended) to his character. The pain he enders at the smell of Isabella's scent in the biology classroom, was manicured to perfection, yet it is not just because of these two actors that keeps watchers engaged in this film.<br/><br/>The production of Twilight as a whole helps to make this movie unique. The actual shooting of this movie fits the mood and ongoing theme of wet, clammy, and dark. It creates that hesitant, dark feeling that keeps this ongoing forbidden love affair alive between Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Isabella Swan (Kristen Stewart). The way the filming is run to be so close and personal with all of the characters is a way for the director and producer together to keep the cold and dark sense flourishing throughout the movie. The filming itself maximizes the intensity of the film in its complete totality.<br/><br/>Twilight questions people, of all ages, young and old, male or female, what they truly need in a partner for the sake of their own survival. Some viewers may say this movie was horribly written and that it has absolutely no plot line, but then why exactly did Twilight gross in 35.7 million dollars on its opening day in the United States alone and 408.9 million dollars worldwide? Twihards worldwide are attracted to this compelling love story. ""And so the lion fell in love with the lamb"" - the forever words of this tragic love story that will remain in viewers hearts forever."

Kristen Stewart as Bella was perfect, then again she truly embodies every character she plays, well done Kristen, you are the one to watch. Robert Pattinson was made to play Edward. He has that evil but yet innocent look to him, not to mention he has a bad-ass haircut. The rest of the cast fit the bill perfectly too, i think Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen was the exact pick for the character, literally how she is described in the book. Overall this film was amazing for me, i think critics are way too harsh on this great series, reminds me a lot of my first girlfriend. I fully recommend this amazing film and the rest of the series, top actors in this franchise, cannot applaud enough."
"zardoz-13","10","2","9","10 December 2008"," A Terrific Tale of Forbidden Teenage Love!
","The romantic horror fantasy thriller ""Twilight"" qualifies as a terrific tale about forbidden love and passionate angst for teenage damsels. ""Nativity Story"" helmer Catherine Hardwicke and ""Birds of Prey"" scenarist Melissa Rosenberg have done a splendid job adapting bestselling author Stephenie Meyer's first-person novel about a virgin in love with a vampire. Mind you, these vampires are nothing like Bela Lugosi's ""Dracula."" Instead, these bloodsuckers can cavort in the daylight without getting burnt to a cinder. Moreover, they can gaze at themselves in mirrors, and they have no fangs to bare! While this radical departure from standard vampire lore may grieve ""Blade"" and ""Buffy"" fans from watching this chick-lite, WB-style saga, the young lovesick females who have made Meyers' four novels smash hits with 17 million copies sold in 37 countries could care less. This PG-13 rated romancer about the sexual attraction between two high school juniors confronts the temptations all teens face but it also marks the boundaries of true love. Furthermore, unlike its closest counterpart, a yarn called ""Blood and Chocolate"" about the illicit love between a graphic novelist on the lam in Europe and a shape-shifting female werewolf, ""Twilight"" is neither as gritty nor as gory. ""Twilight"" may keep its audiences awake at night, but they won't be suffering from nightmares.<br/><br/>Isabella 'Bella' Swan (Kristen Stewart of ""Jumper"") has spent most of her life with her flaky mom in Phoenix, Arizona. As ""Twilight"" opens, our dark-haired heroine flies off to live with her divorced police chief dad, Charlie Swan (Billy Burks of ""Fracture""), in rainy Forks, Washington. It seems that Bella's mom, Renee (Sarah Clarke of ""Thirteen""), and her new hubby, minor league baseball player Phil (Matt Bushell of ""Leatherheads""), are hitting the road, and Bella wants the stable environment that only her dad can provide. It doesn't help matters that Bella is both awkward and accident prone. She cannot play volleyball without spiking her own teammates, and she isn't light on her feet when she dances. When she arrives at Forks High School, she manages to get in with the right crowd, but it is the guy in the wrong crowd that arouses her. Cadaverously pale Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson who plays Cedric Diggory in the ""Harry Potter"" franchise) cannot take his eyes off Bella anymore than she can look away from him. They get off on the wrong foot when he storms out of biology class, but soon they are as thick as thieves.<br/><br/>Early in the story, Bella is hanging out in the school parking lot by her jalopy of an ancient Chevy truck when another student, Tyler Crowley (newcomer Gregory Tyree Boyce) races onto campus. Another student pulls out in front of Tyler, and Tyler swerves and skids his van sideways. Bella looks up and stands paralyzed with fear. At the last possible second, Edward appears out of nowhere and keeps Tyler's van from creaming her. Bella stares in shock at the way Edward manages to halt the careening van with his hand. Later, Edward assures her it was nothing more than an adrenaline rush, but Bella doesn't believe him. No matter how many times Edward warns Bella to have nothing to do with him, she dreams about him. Eventually, they become fast friends, and our heroine discovers that there is more to Edward than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Hardwicke and Rosenberg take liberties with Meyer's novel, but the changes are relatively minor and make the action more palatable. I've read the novel once and seen the movie three times. Sticklers for detail may object to the differences, but by and large the alterations are for the better. Meyer penned the book in first-person so that everything is filtered through Bella's perspective. No third-person movie adaptation can replicate the first-person novel experience so some moviegoers may have a legitimate beef. Nevertheless, the shift in narration from first to third person presents greater opportunities for delicious red herrings and white-knuckled suspense. While Bella and Edward gradually grow accustomed to their respective fears and foibles, vicious vampires that drink human blood are attacking people in remote places. No, ""Twilight"" is nothing like ""30 Days of Night."" Hardwicke and Rosenberg don't confine the humor strictly to Bella and Edward's quirky relationship. Police Chief Swan is so concerned about Bella's new boyfriend that he gives his daughter a can of pepper-spray.<br/><br/>Ostensibly, ""Twilight"" is lightweight blast. The chemistry between Stewart's Bella and Pattinson's Edward is spot perfect. Edward is drawn to Bella because, unlike all the other students, he cannot figure her out. She baffles him, while Bella struggles to understand Edward's bizarre behavior. Robert Pattinson bears a striking resemblance to 1950's heartthrob John Derek. While Hardwicke conjures up humor in the offbeat coupling of Bella and Edward, the relationship between Bella and her estranged father Charlie recalls the oddball relationship between Harry Dean Stanton and Molly Ringwald in the John Hughes comedy ""Pretty in Pink."" Despite the audience demographic that ""Twilight"" plays to, Hardwicke never misses a chance to make this thriller look smart and sophisticated. Watch the high school scene when the teacher talks about rewarding the best lab partners with a golden onion. The last half-hour of ""Twilight"" shifts into high gear as Bella meets Edward's immortal family and some interlopers. What little violence occurs in this lushly photographed film occurs in those final 30 minutes. Nevertheless, you don't have to be a teenager to enjoy ""Twilight"" as a chaste romance with a twinge of tension."
"PoliticChik87","9","2","9","23 November 2008"," If you liked the books you'll like the film.
","If you liked the books, then you will like the film. I didn't think going into the movie I would say but coming out of it that is the only thing to be said. The film did an excellent job of sticking to the book and showing the speedy relationship between Bella and Edward. While a few darlings were killed (great parts in the book not shown on screen) it still captured the essence with beautiful music (something dear to the character of Edward) and an amazing real life Washington state backdrop and two brooding teenagers in love. And like I said, if you liked the books this visual embodiment of book may turn out to be well worth your cash and two hours of your time to see your literary fantasy come alive.<br/><br/>If you didn't like the books your enjoyment of the film really lies in your enjoyment of the genre, romance, fantasy, action. If you don't like that combination IE ""The Convenant"", ""Van Helsing"", ""Underworld"" etc and ilk of the like, then you wont like this movie at all.<br/><br/>The film does have some dragging moments, but for someone like myself dying to see it, it was an opportunity to relax and enjoy. For someone who didn't read the books and doesn't like the genre, all this movie would do for you is drag.<br/><br/>Overall I say the film was a great and an honest adaptation of the book made for FANS ONLY."
"kunanej2","8","2","9","23 November 2008"," Great (The Second Time)
","First I have to admit that though I am a guy I have read the series-loved it-a few times over and they are apart of my regular reading rotation. When I went to see the movie first time I was wearing my critical fan hat so I spent most of the time making comparisons. Having watched a second time, after getting the fan scrutiny out of the way I was able to enjoy it so much more.<br/><br/>It was as melodramatic as the books only in fast forward. The changes they did make I thought (for the sake of a movie anyway) were better for it, especially with Charlie and Rose. The effects were cool. Having watched a lot of other vampire movies I don't think the production wanted to do what has already been done.<br/><br/>One thing I wished they would have added was showing the relationship between Alice, Jasper and Bella developed in the movie. Though all in all for a movie adaptation it was really good better than most. And any fans of the book didn't think the actors were not beautiful enough. Understand what Bella will think is beautiful may not be the same as you. ""You know how people like different flavors of ice cream?"" Edward Cullen"
"bobbysgirl10807","10","2","9","23 November 2008"," I loved it
","I love the movie, let there be a New Moon!!! I noticed on the bar graph for the ratings that mostly teen girls and young women loved Twilight, myself included. I gave it a perfect 10. I think the actor/actress choices were great, but maybe a bit held back for certain parts like the woman who played Rosalie, she looked a little too mean, but that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, I seriously would recommend seeing the movie if you have read the book, because when I was in the theater, people laughed at certain parts that weren't intended to be funny. Like when Bella walks into her first class and stands in front of a fan, it wasn't meant to make her hair look sexy blowing in the wind to make Edward drop his jaw like in a cartoon. Her scent was being carried to Edward which made him clench his fists with a sort of anger because it was her scent and hers alone that he can't control his blood sucking urges around. And the glares that Edward and Jacob exchanged weren't meant to be funny either due to the fact that Jacob's tribe (Quilieute) believed that blood sucking monsters existed and knew that Edward was one of them. I thought those were serious matters, really.<br/><br/>10 stars all the way =)"
"stormcloud496","10","2","9","22 November 2008"," Seen it twice...my thoughts.
","I became a fan of the books late in the game. I got them ALL in August (2008) and read them all within 5 days. Since that time I have read them each about 5 times. I am also reading them allowed and recording them for my husband who HATES to read (and I ain't spending $30 a pop on the CD's). So I have the books just about memorized. I heard someone mention there isn't a plot, well there is...to see if true love can SURVIVE. Now I did not have HIGH expectations because I know what I saw in my head could in no way be done perfectly in reality so I went in HOPING that it would at least be good. I was greeted with a VERY good portrayal of what I read. Of course MANY things were left out or changed...I mean how many girls loved the blood typing...not in the movie, and how many liked the jacket being left behind and she gets to wear his and SMELL him...also not in it. OK the beginning was FAST, I know this was done to get to the meat and potatoes of the story so I forgive them for that. But there were three things that I was a bit stubborn on 1.) the kisses 2.)Baseball 3.)Sparkle Edward. So I can say I was NOT disappointed. SPOILER possibly (depends on how you look at it)** The kiss is described as chaste in the books because of his fear of cutting her. A lot of hype on the internet about it being more ""frenchy""...it wasn't, it was the perfect combination of chaste and passionate!!! Baseball WOW~!!! They did such a good job that I wanted more the only flaw I found was when the Cullens converge to protect Bella...they all move like Apes and are hissing and it looks a little weak, did not have the ""power"" effect that is supposed to be there. But I like the vortex shot, what I mean is the last time Rosalie bats, when she swings, she does it SO HARD that the swoosh creates an air vortex that spins Esme's hair around and back into her face...it made the shot real. SPARKLE: OME! I dreaded this because I truly did not think they would be able to do it. But they succeeded...yes, it is a little cheesy but I think it is cheesy because there are these ""ting ting"" sound effects to his glisten...what was that about. I never imagined a sound when he shimmered...so that was a little weird. <br/><br/>Okay, the second time I went I took my cousin who has NOT read the books. When a movie is made from a book they usually are trying to tell the story so that ANYONE can watch and follow but they messed up in a few spots here. In the beginning when Edward sees Bella in the cafeteria and he is looking at her with puzzlement...we readers know it is because he cannot hear her thoughts, but my cousin was like ""What the?"" Then in Biology when she walks in and he scent is blown towards him, he grabs his nose and convulses like he might be sick. My cousin was like ""Okay, he falls for her but she makes him sick?? WHAT?"" So I had to explain to him what was happening. Other than those items I think people can follow it and ENJOY it. My husband LOVED it, he was the reason we went back a second time. My cousin enjoyed it too. So two guys liked it and so did I!!<br/><br/>**I couldn't understand why Jaspers gift was not explained, it seemed like Edward began to tell Bella but just stopped with Alice. I really liked the wolf references in the film to prep for the next one and of course the ending was very smart!!!<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone, it is the perfect mix of funny, sweet, angry, scared, sad and romantic!!"

Even though they cut and added a lot of parts, i still thoroughly enjoyed it considering i had to sit on the the stairs half the movie. The audience laughed, screamed at the right times, Robert was priceless and Kristen was unexpectedly good. I suggest to anyone, whether they have read the book or not to watch this movie.

"ashlita03","7","2","9","22 November 2008"," please read this before going to the movie- it's good and very funny
","I really hope that people lighten up about the movie and stop comparing it to the book. The book was amazing, so there's little chance that the movie can compare If people continue to shoot down movies that are trying to give an enthralling story without including EVERY minute detail from the book, then let it go. You will never end up satisfied. There's no competition, so stop thinking about it as the book's movie and accept it as a movie. I liked the movie. It was WAY funnier than I thought it would be. Very awkward and dry humor moments get me. The acting was a little iffy at times, but accept it and try to support the actors/actresses and other staff. I really hope they continue with the series."
"dropdeadred86-1","6","2","9","21 November 2008"," Hard to rate for me
","Okay, first let me start off by saying, I am a HUGE fan of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series. I will read these books time and time again. That being said...<br/><br/>Being a lover of Twilight(the book)I enjoyed the movie. It followed the book as closely as possible, for a movie. I laughed at a lot of what were probably ""inside"" jokes for the Twilight crowd. I was downright giddy during certain parts, I must admit. The acting was good, other than a few scenes that were overacted. Mainly being, Edward the first time he sees Bella in Biology, and Bella in the hospital after the fight with James. I thought all of the characters were well-cast, for the most part. I'm still not a huge fan of Kristen Stewart as Bella, but she has grown on me some.<br/><br/>The reason this movie is so hard for me to rate, is because well, Im bias. When I try to imagine what I would think of the movie had I not read the books...the outcome is a little different.<br/><br/>When I read Twilight I had strong feelings about every character in the book. From Edward and Bella to Mike and Jessica. But I think if I didn't already know and love the characters so much, I wouldn't have connected to any of them at all. Edward and Bella were basically the only two characters in the movie. I was highly disappointed that Alice and Mike didn't have a bigger impact in the movie because I thought they were a pretty big part of the book. Some of the scenes were high up on the cheese scale. Trying to keep in the mindset of non-twilighters, I would not have gotten this movie at all and probably would have hated it, if i hadn't read the book. <br/><br/>So my advice for fans of Twilight- Go see the movie. You will enjoy seeing the characters come to life, you will get some good laughs, and overall you will be entertained by the movie. Of course it will never compare to the books, but did you really expect it to?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that if you haven't read the book to skip the movie...<br/><br/>I'm saying READ THE BOOK, THEN GO SEE THE MOVIE!!"
"funfemme","5","2","9","21 November 2008"," Some beautiful cinematography & music.....some horrible scriptwriting.
","I am a fan of Stephanie Meyer and of the Twilight series. That being said, I truly feel that Twilight, the movie, is mediocre at best. There were some spectacular scenic shots, and the music choice and placement throughout the scenes was well executed. I liked that the British rock band Muse was on the soundtrack, as their music influenced Meyer while she was writing the novels. The casting was almost perfect in my opinion. There was obvious chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson (who is absolutely gorgeous), which helped save the movie from being a total waste of time. I do think that Nikki Reed was miscast in the role of Rosalie. She is a very pretty girl and a fine actress, just not anything like the character Rosalie is described as being. She also stands out because the other roles were so well cast.<br/><br/>The thing that ruined the movie for me was the absolutely terrible writing and flow problems. The dialog was often fragmented and awkward. It was rushed in some places, and annoyingly stagnant in others. Multiple times, I caught myself feeling embarrassed for the actors; Not the charming embarrassment in the novels that somehow endears you to its characters, but flat out uncomfortable, laughing embarrassment. At times, I really felt like it could have been a ""Made for TV"" movie or a show on the WB.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is worth seeing if you have read the books. It really does stay true to the novel, but the plot, themes, action, etc. are spit out at you without panache. However, if you haven't, you will probably think it is terrible and decide not to read the books, which would be a mistake."

"JoelPeterBrown","9","1","3","3 March 2020"," Character within the Characters Movie Trailer Review of 'Twilight'
","TAKE WHAT MASTERED YOU!AND MASTER IT.<br/><br/>A trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic admiration which causes a person to want to improve themselves and copy the model.<br/><br/>The 'Twilight' SAGA includes 'Twilight (2008),' 'New Moon (2009),' 'Eclipse (2010),' 'Breaking Dawn - pt. 1 (2011),' and 'Breaking Dawn - pt. 2 (2012).' Therefore, this review will place the most attention on the original film which I believe is the strongest representation of the character strength. So without further ado, the 'Twilight' SAGE can be seen as an exemplar for teaching an alternative way of living for resisting any kind of temptation.<br/><br/>For instance, self-sacrificial adjustments that is show through Edward and his family are ""good"" vampires who only feed off animals as a replacement for taking human blood.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, developing an alternative lifestyle with the character strengths exhibited of self-regulation, bravery, prudence, perseverance, and love as they have learn how to control their impulses.<br/><br/>This shows significant self-control and inner discipline in managing impulses and emotions, turning tendencies into creativity. While the themes that the 'Twilight' SAGA has presented throughout the film are: choices, love, good vs. evil, fear, isolation, language, communication, appearances, mortality, the supernatural, strength, skill, family, hate, sacrifice, man and the natural world, memory, and past.<br/><br/>The 'Twilight' SAGA trailers are edgy with this atmospheric quality in the audio and visual design that makes you feel like you're apart of the character's world.<br/><br/>The trailer show performances that are full of confidence as the actors enjoy and believe in what they're doing. Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart, and Taylor Lautner were all compelling, truthful in the moment, and emotionally connected as they fully transformed into their characters.<br/><br/>Not to mention the other actors were believable in their characters as they stood true to the original characters of Stephenie Meyer's popular novel that's of the same name.<br/><br/>In effect, the trailer pulls you brings you into the world of this Forks town. Where ""High-school student Bella Swan, always a bit of a misfit, doesn't expect life to change much when she moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Washington state. Then she meets Edward Cullen, a handsome but mysterious teen whose eyes seem to peer directly into her soul. Edward is a vampire whose family does not drink blood, and Bella, far from being frightened, enters into a dangerous romance with her immortal soulmate"" (ref. Google).<br/><br/>As the special effects really enhance the movie; both audio and visual, giving it this dark and soulful style.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the cinematography was creative, along with an amusing production quality that had a dark feeling ethereal film score.<br/><br/>Overall, the 'Twilight' trailers are an astonishing work of art
that create suspense within you to see the movie."

","Twilight is much better than the world seems to give it credit for. With its cast and crew being made up of critically acclaimed filmmakers it would have been given much fairer reviews if it weren't attached to the infamous novel. Although it is not groundbreaking in terms of its themes or narrative, it provides consistently fun entertainment. It balances humorous and sincere moments skilfully enough to keep you entertained and invested throughout. There is believable chemistry between Bella and Edward thanks to impressive acting from Stewart and Pattinson which keeps the vampire romance from becoming too far-fetched. If you are interested in a sweet teen romance, why not give Twilight another go?"

"humasizzlingfitness","10","1","3","12 November 2018"," I love this series
","About three things the Twilight producers were absolutely positive. First, Twilight was a vampire tale. Second, there was a part of it that thirsted for teenage blood. And third, adolescent girls were unconditionally and irrevocably in love with it. Indeed, American booksellers have hailed the author of the saga, which runs through four novels, as the new J. K. Rowling - Stephenie Meyer's first instalment selling more than five million copies in the US alone, and thereby helping to fill the void left by the departed Boy Who Lived. The fact that the film version arrives Stateside in what has become the pre-Christmas 'Potter slot' will only boost the comparisons.<br/><br/>In contrast to the wizardry franchise, however, the director here manages to improve on the film's papery progenitor. While a succession of helmers have struggled to condense Rowling's ever-expanding tomes into a digestible screen serving, Catherine Hardwicke hits top gear from the outset, rattling through the early exposition and never once allowing the painful teen brooding that floods Meyer's book to overflow into insipidness. Meyer is a devout Mormon, her tale a metaphor for carnal abstinence, allowing young girls to splash around in a pool of obsessive love without having to swim in the turbulent waters of scary teenage sex.<br/><br/>The author, who had final cut, thought Hardwicke's first cut a little too steamy, hence the interaction between Bella and Edward becomes even more intimate, Hardwicke employing close-ups and avoiding the exposed flesh captured by the wider lenses. The director, of course, understands the teen audience - consider Thirteen or Lords Of Dogtown - and she conjures one of the most beautiful films of the year. Former Potterer Robert Pattinson (Cedric in Goblet Of Fire and Order Of The Phoenix) is staggeringly handsome, as are the rest of his vampire brethren. The backdrop, meanwhile, the lush forests of the Pacific Northwest, is truly breathtaking, Hardwicke sending her stars hurtling up towering trees and sinking into deep moss."

","When I first watched this movie, I was absolutely excited that I was going to watch my first ever vampire movie. Of course with me, I hadn't seen the trailer, so I had no idea it was going to be like this!<br/><br/>It begins in Arizona, Bella is sad to be leaving her home and is now moving to the place where she hasn't been in ages. When she first goes to school, the movie explains that everyone is attracted to Bella. All except for the not so hot, Edward Cullen. He has no way to explain why he is covering his mouth at the sight of her, except for that she is so special that her blood smells the best. I know that there wouldn't be much way to explain this but I'm sure there was at least one other way then, your blood is the best smelling out of all these humans. Then somehow, Bella intelligently found out that he was a vampire, with a few hints from Jacob Black. Suddenly the vampire and Bella are in love and that lasts for no more that two seconds until she is endanger. A vampire is hunting her for her best smelling blood, until well he loses the battle. I won't say too much but then they end up at prom. Bella looks beautiful and Edward looks normal and they gracefully dance, if you don't count the awful looking cast on Bella's foot. She explains that she wants to be a vampire this opens up a beginning to all the other movies. All together, I think this movie is a well put together, action filled, romance movie. I would recommend it to the ages 9-40."

","I am possibly one of the few guys in the world that actually enjoys these movies, and their book counterparts. This movie is very entertaining and has a good story, buried under that cheesy poor writing. <br/><br/>The movie starts off with promise, and its visually appealing, it is shot rather well. But when the movie goes on it changes and their are some truly cringe worthy moments. The dialogue here is dreadful at times, and you could find yourself looking away, or even skipping past it. <br/><br/>The acting is not bad either, Kristen Stewart does a very good job here, while her performance dies over the course of the series, you can believe her acting here. Robert Pattinson does a mediocre performance as the vampire Edward Cullen. Their chemistry on camera is good, but the best as it could have been, but enough to understand their relationship. <br/><br/>While this movie does have its moments, like the baseball scene, the fight scene at the end and the Dance scene. It is filled with ridiculous writing, not even the book has this much terrible writing. <br/><br/>The portrayal of the vampires is what people will despite the most, they have no fangs, they don't burn in sunlight and they are almost superheroes. This movie fails to add the creepy atmosphere a vampire movie should have, and does a poor job and making you fear the main antagonist of this film.<br/><br/>This movie is not bad, and if you can look past the bad writing, and enjoy it for what it is, you could respect it more. Some people however will hate it, which is understandable. <br/><br/>6/10"

","I watch this movie since one of my best friend is a hardcore fans of Twilight Saga's novel. I also give it a try since I already read the novel ( all of them ). It is quite a good novel. I'm interested in how the author has different concept about vampire ( sparkle like a diamond, instead of burning to ashes under the sunlight. Seriously, i don't hate the concept since it brings new perspective about vampire. However, it is depicted...not like what i have imagined from reading the novel ). <br/><br/>For the main cast, honestly, i am not a big fans of Kristen Stewart. I see her like emotionless doll. For Pretty, yes she is. For Acting? err absolutely no. I don't sense the unique girl depicted in the book. The same goes for Robert.<br/><br/>However, the cullen's family, did meet my imagination. Especially, Alice. She is suitable for the role and act like what has been depicted in the novel. The only thing, i think is decent from this movie ( except for, the handsome and gorgeous Taylor. Sorry, for being biased haha )<br/><br/>Overall, i just concentrate on the movie for 30 first minute then i give up and wish i can walk away from the theater. Sadly, i can't for the sake of my best friend ( and for the sake of the money i spent for watching this crap. At least, i can watch how far this movie will ruin the novel series ).<br/><br/>I definitely won't watch another adaptation for this novel series. Not, even for the sake of my best friend (gosh, she still gives a quite good score for this movie. Only God knows why )"

They're kinda like 'introductory movies' or 'starter movies' for a child who is too young to be scared too much, but, shows an interest in monster movies; but, will build up the 'movie-courage' so that one day he or she will be ready to handle R-rated horror.<br/><br/>I believe that too many 'hard-core' horror fans (like myself) are spending too much time tearing into this and other 'soft' horror movies and series when they know that these movies cannot ever be compared to the productions directed by George A. Romero; Alfred Hitchcock; Roman Polanski; Wes Craven; John Carpenter; and/or Sam Raimi...and, they're not meant to,<br/><br/>...but, they're still good. :)"

","I'm gonna go right out and say it, I didn't hate this! I kind of enjoyed it. It was more good than bad. It was alright, but after this one it went so fast down hill that the whole carriage crashed and burned.<br/><br/>I don't have that much to say about it, really. I can say that most of the ""action""scenes are pretty bad. The scene where Bella sits on his back, and he runs around, ouch, that's just painfully bad. It looks totally stupid. It's like.. So silly looking. <br/><br/>I don't hate Kristen Stewart either. Yeah, she is kind of annoying, but more than that I think she's quite cute, and not that bad an actress. And she isn't stupid either, I think. And she used to not wear high heels, and I am a sucker for that. But enough!<br/><br/>This is the Twilight that is fully watchable, the second one is horrible, and I haven't seen any more. I just said: that's enough of that!"
"orlandin-mega","7","1","3","25 September 2014"," Twilight is not your typical love story.
","When you hear the word ""Twilight,"" what do you think of? Maybe you picture teenage girls screaming ""Team Edward!"" and ""Team Jacob!"" Maybe you think of sparkling vampires, or ripped werewolves, or a moody Kristen Stewart. These are the things that give Twilight, the movie adaption of Stephanie Meyers' first book in her best-selling series a bad rep. However, you don't need to be a ""Twihard"" fan to enjoy this film filled with action, love, and humor.<br/><br/>The storyline follows Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), who is the new girl at her high school in Forks, Washington. She appears shy and not too desperate to make friends. When she lays eyes on the brooding Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), however, she is instantly captivated by his chiseled jawline and rather fluffy hair. Bella soon realized that he is just as enamored as she is. <br/><br/>There's a catch, though, of course. Edward and his family have a taste for blood: animal blood, that is. They are not your typical vampire family: they sparkle in the sun and choose to live among humans peacefully. Things get complicated though, when a werewolf by the name of Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) also falls for Bella. She must choose between Jacob, her warm-blooded childhood friend, and Edward, who Jacob calls a ""bloodsucker."" (Can you tell I'm Team Jacob?) This movie does not only consist of the love triangle's drama, however. Things get more problematic when the Cullens' enemies find out they have told a human what they are. These enemies call themselves the Volturi. They are the merciless, black-cape wearing villains that more closely fit the ""vampire"" stereotype. The Volturi does not approve of the Cullens' acceptance of a human into their lives, and this starts a feud between the groups filling the movie with intense, eye-catching action scenes.<br/><br/>Although this book series was wildly popular and the movie was highly anticipated, the director, Catherine Hardwicke, manages to give a more ""indie"" feel to the film. The dark hues and enchanting music by Carter Burwell work perfectly together to create a haunting, intense atmosphere. The setting of Forks, Washington is captivating in of itself. The misty mountains and dark forests are the perfect backdrop to this film. The movie not completely completely dark, however, it is also sprinkled with biting humor (pun intended.) Bella's father, Charlie Swan (played by Billy Burke) provides comic relief throughout the movie. He is clueless on how to raise a teenage girl, but he is very caring and protective of her nonetheless. Sure, Twilight's plot is not complicated, but it is not your average love story or vampire story either. <br/><br/>Catherine Hardwicke did not stray from Stephanie Meyer's book. She stayed true to the original storyline, characters, and dialogue. Twilight is a film anyone can enjoy. Yes, it is a love story, but it is also much more than that. It is also full of action and humor, and even though vampires and werewolves are involved, it is relatable. The intense actors, haunting music, and beautiful scenery come together to create a unique atmosphere that captivates viewers. Don't let today's Twilight clich√©s and criticisms stop you from enjoying this film. Keep an open mind going into the theater, and you just might leave a Twihard as well."
"J_Charles","Null","1","3","30 March 2011"," this wasn't made for me
","This movie wasn't made for me. I'm not a preteen girl with a huge crush on Robert Pattinson. I'm not going thru some ""goth"" phase nor do I harbour some secret vampire fetish. My wife was interested in this so I forced myself to watch. What did I see? The story centres around Bella and Edward. A star-struck teenaged romance which in the modern day means plenty of angst, brooding, moodiness, and latent desire. Not my cup of tea. The added twist is that whole 'vampire' thing. Can a vampire really have a relationship with his prey? The story twists vampire mythology to the point its totally unrecognizable. Vampires being afraid of the sun? Nope. Their skin turns into diamonds when exposed to sunlight. Poor babies... Vampires can pretty much do whatever their hearts desire as far as the CGI budget will take them. You no longer kill a vampire with a wooden stake but by dismembering him and burning up the pieces. All this became quite ridiculous in my old jaded eyes.<br/><br/>The film tries to look sophisticated with a few arty camera angles. Lighting was pretty much the same throughout the movie - grays, muted by grayish blues, followed by dark grays. It's pretty much the Pacific Northwest in winter. I'll give them points for effort and it actually does look pretty convincing.<br/><br/>Direction, well it was OK. Nothing mind boggling.<br/><br/>Overall I'll give it 5/10 for effort. Story is definitely a minus because of a mopey, depressed love story, plus some outlandish perversion of the vampire lore."

","I want to mention first off that I'm a guy and I'm not gay. But I really was surprised because this movie is actually good. I'm not into romance movies but there was enough dark tones to keep me hooked in. There was some cheesy dialog but I guess that can be forgiven.<br/><br/>This is about a new girl named Bella who moved to Forks, Washington to be with her father. There she meets the love of her dreams, Edward. Little does she know that Edward is not human at all...<br/><br/>The acting is not spectacular but isn't terrible. Kristen Stewart is not bad as people say she is. I wish Robert Pattison could have been better. But Billy Burke was the one that shined.<br/><br/>The music is pretty good. I heard a great Linkin Park song during the end credits. The themes are gentle and appropriate.<br/><br/>Overall, this movies stays true to the book. I guess I like Twilight better than I thought. I rate this film 8/10."
"djlambeth","8","1","3","27 January 2011"," Exceptionally Great
","When I watched this movie I had more doubts than I would like to admit to. People told me that it was cheesy and poorly made and when they said that there were very little special effects I did not even go and see the movie until it was released on DVD. I mean a VAMPIRE movie and hardly any special effects, I must admit I was beyond doubtful but I rented it anyway saying to myself that I would give it a chance. Low and behold it was a movie I ended up loving. The characters had undoubtable chemistry and it was as if the feel of the movie revolved around them as it should. Although I was not crazy at how much of the film the roaming vampires took up in this movie you could say that it did blend in well with the rest of the movie. After I returned the movie the guy at the video store and I were discussing it an reviewing it and he told me that it was not just Twilight but there was an entire series devoted to this unique storyline. After he told me that I headed to Books-a-Million (after a stop at Wal Mart to buy the movie) and purchased the entire series and started to read them right away. I do agree that the book was better than the movie, but everyone involved with the film did an exceptional job when it was time to put the words to the screen. It won itself as one of my all-time favorite movies and my all-time favorite book series. Before I went diving into the world Stephenie Meyer created I hated to read and now I read everyday. I only ranked this movie an 8 out of 10 because I feel that although it flowed very well there were still a few spots that needed explaining and you probably couldn't do it without reading the book and that the James story kind of took away from the main story considering how much time it took up in the movie. Overall this is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys vampire or romance films because it has the best of both worlds."
"Flick_Montana","3","1","3","27 June 2010"," The Many Faces of Kristin Stewart
","There's the slightly slack jaw and empty eyes, indicating intense passion. There's the jaw slightly agape and eyes half closed to indicate fear. There is, of course, the remarkable drooping jaw and sleepy eyes which I believe indicate brain damage. Regardless, if you think the impossible love of a hundred year old vampire for a sullen teen girl is the only tragedy in this film, you're way off.<br/><br/>Let's be honest for a second. The books were not good. They were directed at teen girls harder than a scud missile heading for Kuwait. That doesn't usually bode well for a movie translation. When Hollywood can screw up a genuinely good book like Sphere or Andromeda Strain or anything by Stephen King, you know that a bad book doesn't have a chance.<br/><br/>What you end up with, in the case of Twilight, is a movie completely filled to the brim with absolutely nothing of substance. Stewart wanders around with a blank stare on her face (She should be cast by George Romero. As a zombie.) and the vampires, who are just feminine guys rather than the frightening denizens of darkness we all came to love, are two dimensional and completely uninteresting. The werewolves, rather than being the essence of the brazen and dangerous wolf, are just rowdy kids and punks who inspire no reaction from the audience whatsoever.<br/><br/>Basically, this film is just a lump of scenes stitched together rather poorly into a mass of people staring at one another and dialogue written by someone who fell asleep with their face on the typewriter. If you absolutely cannot avoid seeing this movie, you should at least play Riff Trax over it so your brain doesn't melt and drip out your ears."
"MLDinTN","6","1","3","24 January 2010"," OK, but the vamps should have done more cool stuff
","I have never read the books, so I can't compare the movie to them, but I'm sure the books are better for them to be so popular. The movie just wasn't worth the hype. It was OK, and it had a plot a lot better than most new films, but it just lacked that oomph.<br/><br/>First, it's hard to buy the love story between Edward and Bella when all they do is stare at each other a few times at school and suddenly they are madly in love. Surely more happened in the book. And I thought there was going to be some sort of mystery with the deaths of a couple of people: like whether it was werewolves or rogue vampires. But that was hardly a side plot in the film. And I thought the whole vampire baseball game was a hokey thing for them to do . So much more should have been done with the vamps special abilities, then hitting balls a long ways and climbing trees really fast.<br/><br/>Then the climax was Bella on the run from James. She goes back to Phoenix with the other 2 vamps, now how did they get out in the sun? Then she gets tricked by James, and James and Edward have a short fight. I did like the scene in which Edward has to save Bella by sucking out the venom.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you are not a fan of the books, then this movie probably won't be too appealing."
"glasspopcorn","3","1","3","22 January 2010"," Twilight: tween sensation not all that sensational
","Stephanie Meyer's novel Twilight follows the story of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a clumsy, na√Øve teen from Phoenix, Arizona who moves to the gloomy town of Forks, Washington with her father, Charlie. As she settles into Forks and starts going to the local high school, she notices a handsome, brooding boy named Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and his family, which includes Alice, Emmett, Rosalie and Jasper. When they're seated next to each other in biology class, they begin to get to know each other. On one cold and snowy afternoon, a car skids through the icy parking lot and nearly hits Bella, but Edward stops it with his hand, denting the car. Bella begins to notice more strange things that Edward can do that don't seem human or normal¬Öas they're together more often, Bella begins to speculate about what's special about Edward, and when she does research on the internet, she discovers that Edward and his family are all vampires. As their love for each other grows, Edward and Bella get right in the middle of a fight with a hungry, bloodthirsty vampire named James (Cam Gigondet), and they must escape from danger with help from the Cullens and find a way to live their lives in peace, while Jacob (Taylor Lautner), a boy from an American Indian tribe in Washington, tries to break up their relationship.<br/><br/>After I saw Twilight, I tried to think of good things to say about it, but that was a challenge. The story, created by Meyer, is good in theory. A story of a human in love with a vampire is something that I don't think had been approached before Twilight. Unfortunately, the concept suffers greatly when stretched out. The character of Bella rushes into the conclusion that Edward is a vampire, making the overall story look less realistic. The dialogue, written by screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg, is unbelievable. The conversations shared by the teenage characters of the film sound like what most fifty-year-olds think teen conversations sound like. The ""hip"" lingo used by the characters seems awkward and forced.<br/><br/>Something that confused me was why this movie was so popular. It won MTV Movie Awards and Teen Choice Awards, and I watched clips from the movie to try and find the appeal. I think the cinematography by Elliot Davis (which shines at times, but sinks into mediocrity at others) combined with the harsh, smooth editing by Nancy Richardson set a mood for this film that gave it a polished look that many found appealing. I cannot, however, understand why Kristen Stewart received an award for her acting in this film. This film was riddled with poor acting, specifically by Stewart, Taylor Lautner, and Cam Gigondet. The only actor in this film that I think has some strong talent is Robert Pattinson, but even his performance was bogged down by bad writing. Christina Hardwick did an average job directing this movie. The direction wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend seeing Twilight. It has no lasting charm, and the poor writing and acting make it a painfully mediocre film. It's a popcorn movie, fun to watch if you're bored with a group of friends, but not particularly admirable in its own right. If you're looking for a movie that you can think about afterwards, skip Twilight and find something a little heavier."
"virindra","3","1","3","8 July 2009"," Boring movie.
","I was surprised, after seeing this movie, to hear it has won some awards. This movie was full of bad acting, bad duologue's. The movie did not make any sense. The genre is fantasy, but even the characters were created in a different dimension, like they were not from this planet (I mean the normal people).<br/><br/>There was too little action, too little horror. It was very boring. I knew from the beginning the main characters would get a relationship. The girl was not very beautiful like Megan Fox, and still a couple of boys asked her to go to the prom with them. Like she was the only girl at school. The story took so long to get the main characters into a relationship. The way she found out the guy was a vampire, just by buying a book from a bookstore she googled from the internet, was very stupid."

","Boring! It took me three separate nights to watch the DVD of this stinker. I have not read the book - so, yes, I am missing that part of history before watching the movie.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson has no camera appeal as an actor whatsoever. It was really hard to believe that the character of ""Bella"" would swoon over Edward so quickly. Did the movie leave out a lot from the book? I guess teenagers do fall in and out of love quickly. I felt nothing for the characters and the director did not ""pull me"" into the story. I watched it from a real distance on a personal level.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was horrible. It was worse than ""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"" and I thought that was one of the worst movies of the year until seeing the mess that Twilight is."

","With this movie I made a point not to read the book. Learned long ago that the movies are never as good as the book. Will only come away disappointed.<br/><br/>Son(14) read all 4 within 2 weeks. Said they were pretty good but mushy. He liked cause had about vampires and werewolves. Daughter(12) got interested when most everyone at school was reading Twilight. Asked her brother about it and he told her would just have to read it...hehehe<br/><br/>Shortly after her begging to see the movie began. <br/><br/>Must admit I was looking forward to watching it also. Was one of the rare occasions both our children had read the same novel and agreed on seeing the movie. <br/><br/>She and I stood in line for over an hour to get tickets. All of us walked away disappointed.<br/><br/>Them because in their words it wasn't as good as expected. Movie was built up to be way more than it was. I was disappointed because of the bad make-up, choppy scenes,and production. The scene with Edward in the trees, just so bad kept expecting to see the wires. And the fight scene at the end, who ever did it needs to learn CGI cause they obviously don't know. Definitely looked low budget cheap. <br/><br/>Not having read the book to compare the movie too was the best otherwise would have been as let down as both our children."
"raz_chillin","4","1","3","25 January 2009"," From Fantastic to Dreadful in 122 Minutes
","I am a massive fan of the series and have read all 4 books at least twice, having said that I am not as such a fan of this film. Im not impressed for a start with the lack of emotional complexity that Kirsten Stewart shows in this film, she is obviously vital to the film's success or fall and I think she definitely drags this film down a few pegs. Although I think her acting or understanding of this role leaves a lot to be desired I think as far as physical appearances go this is captured quite well, with the subtle make-up and her unstyled yet attractive hair, as in the book. Although the first of our two protagonists is not quite 'up to scratch' I believe Robert Pattinson to be this film's say in grace. I think everything from his appearance, attractive, to his voice to his body language is fantastically suited to this role. My main gripe about this film however is not Kirsten Stewart/Bella Swan. It is in fact the ridiculous decision to have almost the ENTIRE film on a motion camera. I can understand the intimate scenes following this pattern to make the audience feel as if it's actually there, which was especially effective when they were kissing in his room, however throughout the entire movie was to be frank ridiculous. Another unnecessary effect throughout the film were the sepia 'flash backs'. These were, not to mince words, an insult to the audience. Somethings in the book AND film should be left to imagination and not presented in such a ridiculously obvious manner and boil down to offence to the audience members with at least 1/3 of a brain. Treating the audience like a fool, again in my view knocks marks off this potentially amazing film. My final issue with this film is the best sequences in the book being either merged or cut, this was the biggest flaw of all. My favourite scene of the book was the meadow when Edward told Bella of all his insecurities early in the book and his struggles also his diamond skin being revealed and I think one of their first kisses. This was instead replaced and cut with lesser scenes of the diamond skin and NO explanation of the early scenes when Edward was struggling not to kill Bella . This film had the potential to be breath-taking, however the only thing i found breath-taking was the sounds of the female audience oohing and ahhing after Robert Pattinson, arguably the best thing in the film. In summary an awful book to film transition, leaving a lot to be desired."
"niggo62","Null","1","3","19 January 2009"," Just enjoy the film...it's not helpful to compare it with the book
","Really, it doesn't make any sense to compare this film with the book, this only causes disappointing. And, it's not necessary to compare, there is no reason not to enjoy this film only by watching it in the cinema. There are so many good books which have been adapted for a film, and often the film doesn't reach the original book. It's the same with ""Hitchkiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", written by Douglas Adams. I was disappointed. First, than I saw the film again and I didn't compare it with the book, it became one of my most liked films. That's the way we should enjoy a film, have fun with it, don't compare everything. And by the way, the camera is not bad, they have done a good job."
"lizardkingperro-3","5","1","3","6 January 2009"," Book to movie translations aren't always hit, and Twilight is proof of this miss.
","Since Stephenie Meyer's debut of the acclaimed Twilight series, its fan base has grown worldwide, most notably the subject of pre-teen girls and middle aged women all over, and now the Twilight craze has made its way into theaters, but like most book to movie translations, this one is less than spectacular.<br/><br/>The plot follows the exploits of Bella Swan(Kristen Stewart), a pale lackadaisical teen whose move from Phoenix to Washington is all but endearing til she encounters Edward Cullen(Robert Pattinson), astonishingly handsome and shrouded in mystery. His secret begins to unfold when he supernaturally blocks a car from crushing Bella to death, and with his abnormal tendencies and behavior, Bella soon discovers that Edward is a vampire. Though she is aware that he thirsts for blood, her love for him is unconditional and even the sole fact of him being a vampire couldn't change it.<br/><br/>After having read the book, I was interested in how it would materialize on film. Seats were flooded with fans, mostly screaming pre teens and their moms. The problem I had with the overall movie came in a lot of different forms. My personal grievance started with simply the structure of the movie. Throughout reading the book, I expected it to play out on film in a very mature almost R-rated matter, but mostly in a rather serious tone. What I got was a teeny bopper experience, riddled with goofy sequences, such as the rather silly depiction of Edward's ""glimmering in the sun"" moment along with most of the other laughable special effects, but in essence some of its lightheartedness came with charm. Catherine Hardwicke's direction in the movie took a lot of queues from Thirteen(2001), another film of hers comprised of the whole teenage angst vibe, mostly on Bella and Edward's part, but that aspect fit the tone well. <br/><br/>The acting in the movie was fair, but I thought Kristen Stewart's almost monotonous portrayal of Bella was the film's downfall. Through the entire movie she seemed emotionless and boring, and her love for Edward didn't seem believable, but artificial at best. Aside from that, the pacing was also a little too rushed. Granted, it would be hard to compact a near 500-page book into a movie, but some scenes, especially major ones just seemed to happen too fast, whether it be the main characters' sudden but stale romance or more dramatic scenes that seem sped up for time restraints, such as Jacob(Taylor Lautner) sharing with Bella the history of the disputes between vampires and their clan. <br/><br/>The most crucial effect of the rushed pacing happens within character development. Because of this, the movie barely develops any of the other characters, albeit minor but still important to the story. There's little interaction between any of the Cullen family or Bella's friends that it's hard to feel any emotion for them seeing as they progress the story only when needed. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie differs from the book greatly, but is enjoyable so long as you do not compare it too much to its novel counterpart. Die hard fans of the Twilight series will be pleased with its realization on film, though it has a lot of flaws, even as a standalone movie. For everyone else unfamiliar with the Twilight franchise, just know that it is not a standard gory vampire flick."

","I've read the books, seen the film. I loved it. However, it doesn't stick to the books as much as they like, but I think they got the actors right. It's good, I really enjoyed it, me and my friend went to see it, we're die hard fans of the twilight series, we had our disappointments but really, most films that come out of a novel are altered to make sense for the non-readers, but we enjoyed it immensely all the same. Don't read an over all synopsis and think, vamp film, equals horror. cause it's just not how it goes, its fantasy. And its aimed at teenagers, so there will be cheesy romance, sexual tension, and a few touching moments. If you go in with preconceptions, you're bound to be disappointed. that's how it goes.

","Incredibly lazy work by Rosenberg who looking at her resume is not new to screen writing. Therefore there is absolutely no excuse for putting in unnecessary voice overs or extraneous dialogue in moments where the emotion or meaning was already insinuated through actors & action. Felt like a second draft. Less than impressive, I felt the two solid leads were given little to work from.<br/><br/>Also the tone of the film was bizarre at moments, uncertain direction from Hardwicke which is again disappointing considering the caliber of some of her other films.<br/><br/>It was a good way to waste an afternoon thanks to a charismatic cast but I ultimately ended up leaving frustrated because of elemental flaws that should have been picked up by at least a producer or script supervisor."

","I have to say, I didn't think paying to see this movie was an option... generally because it was my friend, who had read the books and said I would 'LOVE' Edward, who suggested it. So I downloaded it.<br/><br/>And I have to say I have watched it now, countless times. Not because it is good however, but because I can't take my eyes off of it. Seeing the inconsistency, the random scenes that make no sense, the AWFUL, truly god awful make-up, and Bella...<br/><br/>Oh my god can she NOT close her mouth? Can she even act at all? Robert (Eddie) carried the entire movie, which is saying something when he seemed to look like he wanted to puke on Bella the whole way through. And the venom scene, I'm sorry but that looked more like constipation, I was laughing myself stupid. Oh and he really did not seem that torn up about it.<br/><br/>However I have to say, the background characters were all wonderful, I wished I could have seen more of them. Which is why I plan on getting the books for their subplots, oh and maybe the background to Bella and Edwards relationship, anyone else wondering where that was? 'We shouldn't be friends' 'I'm in love with him'... Yeah kid, shut up and get some expression. But back to the background characters, I think they were adorable, and Jasper and Alice being my favourites, I feel, from reading other reviews, were caught almost perfectly. I thought James was annoyingly cheesy up until the scene in the Ballet studio.<br/><br/>I am hoping the books will leave me less, disappointed and more informed. As there is no character development in the movie.<br/><br/>Oh and then the quality of the movie, I admit my download was very very fuzzy, that didn't stop me seeing the make-up errors, where their face doesn't match their neck etc. And The scenes that didn't seem to fit in with each other, and the slow shots of faces with expressions that did not fit the music? In fact most of these faces were Bella's, honestly CLOSE YOUR MOUTH! Oh so annoyingly hilarious. Then all the effects were so 1990's, surely we have advanced beyond dummies on backs and blurry legs? The only scene I deemed good was the kiss scene in her bedroom, because the tension was brought across, but the scene still made no sense in the development of their relationship, nor technically why he stopped as he didn't go to bite her...<br/><br/>Anyway I may sound like I hated the movie, but you see, I am a soul who lives for terrible movies, they are my bread and butter. They make my day. And I have to say Twilight made my month. So bad, it is good :) So if you are like me and love to be appalled by book adaptations, watch it. Lol"

There was a lot of potential - a couple of scenes in this movie were brilliantly executed and I found myself drawn into them. But they were dragged down by other scenes which had some strange editing, unusual and out of place camera angles and music that didn't fit the mood. These don't sound so important, but they were incredibly distracting for me, the viewer. That being said, this movie was entertaining.

","When watching a movie that is clearly not intended for you, it's best to let yourself flow with it and judge it on its own merits rather than on pre-conceived notions or prejudices. So with that in mind I walked into a screening of Twilight, clearly aimed at the tween female audience, expecting to watch a vampire-love-story - and it actually turned out to be exactly that! So, in essence, it was not disappointing.<br/><br/>Twilight is the first movie in a four-part saga adapted from Stephenie Meyer's best selling books, and is mostly depicted and narrated from the viewpoint of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). Bella is the beautiful girl-next-door type that exists only in movies. She moves in with her Dad, Chief of Police at Forks, Washington and joins the local high-school where she eventually befriends Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) who turns out to be a vampire.<br/><br/>The Cullens, family of seven including a father & mother figure with adopted ""children"", are good vampires who are just trying to live a normal life in a city that keeps them away from the sun as much as possible. But there are Vampires of the bad kind too and do make the essential appearance. Yet it is mostly Forbidden Love that keeps Bella and Edward as the center of attention in this tale.<br/><br/>As vampire movies go Hardwicke has made an interesting movie that, while realizing there is not much new in the source material to add to the myth, concentrates on the relationship and dilemma of Bella. And barring a melodramatic outburst, Kirsten Stewart succeeds in delivering a performance that mostly requires her to look inquisitive and pretty. Robert Pattinson, on the other hand, has to be the most underwhelming B-actor to debut in a box office phenomenon. Apart from the confused/constipated look that he sets a new standard for, Pattinson's performance has ""wannabe"" stamped all over it; definitely something that does not add to his portrayal of a vampire. Most of the other actors are acceptable in performances that would be equally at home in a TV series. The one that does stand out is Peter Facinelli as Dr Carlisle Cullen, Edward's foster father. Facinelli, although on screen for four scenes, plays his character of a vampire trying to be good with a cool resonance and more importantly, looks the part.<br/><br/>Hardwicke's movie will please the target audience, that there is no doubt about. It's quite visible in the way she harmonizes the scenes - the colors, music & visuals are very soft and pleasing to the senses. It makes Twilight an easy time at the movies - there's no intelligence here, but no stupidity either.<br/><br/>My Rating --> 3 of 5"
"cwood0609","4","1","3","23 December 2008"," An unbiased review.
","As Edward Cullen's half naked body gleams with crystals as he stands in the sun of a seemingly mythical forest, he smiles. He says that this is why vampires throughout the ages can't be seen in the sun. At this point, I think I understood what kind of movie this was supposed to be.<br/><br/>I had seen the TV spots for Twilight, and heard of how great the books were, but never really knew what all the fuss was about. A few of my friends said that the movie was a must-see (unsuprisingly, they were without a Y chromosome). Next thing I knew, I was taken in a theater with hundreds of screaming high school girls, being force fed little known facts about every one of the characters. <br/><br/>As a movie, from someone who has never touched one of the books, it fails pretty horribly. Apart from some truly beautiful scenery, there's really nothing to savor in this film. Robert Patterson and Kristen Stewart are decent in the lead performances, showing that they really do have some potential with better direction. The supporting actors, however, were uniformly terrible. The ""bad"" vampires and young werewolves were especially horrendous.<br/><br/>I saw where this movie was trying to go, but it desperately needed a better director. The movie seems to mock the audience's intelligence, flashing back to earlier parts of the movie many times to remind us what happened. After about the halfway point, I completely lost interest in where the story was going. Unless you're an avid fan of the books, this is definitely not worth the $9 admission."
"independentthoughtleo","5","1","3","22 December 2008"," Bite into it but not too much.
","It's quite tolerable generally as movie, but for fans I guess they will get a lot out of it I mean the whole concept of the push and pull relationship between Edward and Bella appeals to a lot of fans that have read the book.<br/><br/>There is no story as such it is just mostly the main characters building there tense and dramatic relationship. However they in which it was acted did make you believe to an extent that they are absolutely mad for each other; it though made me feel like it was going to turn into an 18 certificate. When I say extent it did feel somewhat silly on both parts making it seem over acted.<br/><br/>Although this film falls into some clich√©s from the vampire genre it does have its moments that draw you in creating some excitement. For example the fight scene between Ed and James did convey what each other's intention was towards Bella. On the other hand the interaction and conversation was irritating at times, when things were being described or mentioned it strung it out for too long bringing it to the point where you can kind of fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>During the progression of the other characters I.E the Cullen family the Nomads and Jacob's family; their connection mislead there to be something interesting happening but then was more of a anti-climax. To be honest it was quite a letdown. Yet it was informative when it came to the history of them.<br/><br/>Though the concept is quite interesting and that's way I went to see this flick; it is very alluring because it gave a kind of different take on vampires and the way Bella and Edward's relationship was told made for some enjoyable viewing. Yet overall it is not that great of a movie and if you want watch it then do if not then don't form reading elsewhere the movie is pretty much different to the book. As far as that goes I cannot make a comparison on this because I have not read much of the book.<br/><br/>So comes just as an average movie but it's not as horrible as it could have been, and overall I kinda enjoyed it."
"Neldormiel","2","1","3","20 December 2008"," Some of it was REALLY good.....some of it was REALLY bad.
","Parts of this movie are perfect - like the end when they're at the prom and Edward says to Bella, ""See? You're dancing."" The way Edward looks at Bella is perfect - he looks at her with love shining in his eyes and gives her such an adoring smile, you don't doubt his infatuation for a second.<br/><br/>But other parts were AWFUL. The ballet studio scene was terrible - nothing like in the book! It infuriated me the way they changed it. When James was about to bite her, Edward was just chilling on the window sill! Edward Cullen - the book version - was unstoppable in the ballet studio! Also, he's supposed to be in complete agony when he sees Bella laying on the floor, bleeding, and almost insane with rage when he finds out James bit her. In the movie, he was very calm kneeling beside the love of his life as she bled and screamed out in pain, very un-Edward-like.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was good, the ending was good, but the middle was a mess; the cinematography was everywhere, and the dialog was awful.<br/><br/>Really, they need a new screenwriter for New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. Melissa Rosenberg butchered the dialog. The conversations and one-liners that were so sweet or funny in the book came out cheesy and lame in the movie. The lion-lamb line was delivered all wrong.<br/><br/>They left out a lot of really important scenes, too - in the book, it's the little things Edward does with Bella that makes their love story so special. Like (in the book) when he touches her cheek before she goes into gym - that shows his love WAY more than that little make-out session in the movie. They took all the little parts from the book like that and squished it into that minute of making out in her room. Which sucked.<br/><br/>It was very disappointing that they left out the biology scene, where Bella almost faints at the sight of blood and Edward carries her to the nurse's office. That was one of my favorite parts in the book. It was so funny! I loved it in the book when he was like ""What do you think you're doing? Didn't you hear me tell the nurse that I'm driving you home?"" I don't remember the exact quote, but that was adorable and funny, and they just left it out of the movie.<br/><br/>Also, the meadow scene was SO AWFUL. I WAS APPALLED DURING THAT. It was all wrong! They left out him listening to her heart beat! I was shocked when he grabbed her arm and dragged her up the freaking hill - he would never hurt her! They left out the little conversations that really made me adore the book. Like when he's asking her all those questions (""What...is your favorite color?"") - it shows how intrigued he is by her. In the movie, you only see their relationship through everyone else's eyes - not *theirs*.<br/><br/>And they never once say ""I love you."" Also, the movie doesn't show how long Edward didn't speak to Bella at first. It was over a month before he finally said, ""Hello, I'm Edward Cullen."" That was because he wanted to know why she said no to Mike about the girl's choice dance. It *was* adorable, though, in the movie when Edward smiled at Bella and said ""Hello"" for the first time.<br/><br/>Averaged out, the movie was okay. It wasn't nearly as good as the book. It's a real pity they didn't have a better director and screenwriter; the cast was perfect, but Catherine Hardwicke and Melissa Rosenberg butchered the beautiful love story. That could have been an epic romance movie if they'd had a good director and screenwriter. I'm giving it a higher rating because of the acting - the acting was so good. Robert Pattinson was fabulous."

","2008 marked, what feels like the first Christmas in ages without a Harry Potter movie, and this year we were treated to the launch of another novelised franchise -Twilight.<br/><br/>Twilight focuses on the romantic relationship between a seventeen year old girl Bella and her complicated boyfriend Edward Cullen - the complication being that Edward is in fact a vampire, albeit a ""vegetarian"" vampire.<br/><br/>A lot of the dialogue was lifted straight from Meyers novel and did not make a successful translation from page to screen and a lot of the intimate scenes between Bella and Edward were just clunky and awkward. The scene in the science lab were both characters meet each other for the first time looked clich√©d and amateurish. There was just to much melodrama for me - even the piano score was a bit to much.<br/><br/>The special effects look cheap and nasty. They would have just been better not showing Edward running through the trees or the director should have watched some wushu movies just to at least get the impression of running through the trees correct and don't get me started on Edwards twinkling skin.<br/><br/>The most entertaining part of the whole movie was the actual Cullen Family, who, as they did in the book, have a much greater presence than the two main characters, and unfortunately, as in the book, their screen time is very limited.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was OK - I liked the book much better, although, after the second book in the series I gave up because I was bored¬Ö¬Ö I would give Twilight 6/10. If you haven't read the book or heard of Edward Cullen before you go then avoid at all costs as the awkward dialogue, terrible effects and teen romance will make you cringe with embarrassment. Twilight is best watched and appreciated by those who already love it."
"sinncross","5","1","3","19 December 2008"," Blood draining...
","Moving to Forks, Washington to live with her father, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) becomes interested in the Cullen siblings. One sibling does catch her attention, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), but his quick and apparent mood swings begin to annoy her. After much pushing for information, Bella learns that Edward is a vampire.<br/><br/>Being an adaptation from a novel which has become quite popular among teenagers, mostly female, one would expect the story's translation to hold true to its source material as best as possible. It's hard to believe that it does at all because the story contained in the film is ultimately bland. There is no depth, no complexity to the plot, no intriguing characterizations: just a simple love story which doesn't hold much in terms of credibility. And this is because character motivations are never fully established. While the love Edward and Bella have for one another is easily based on outwards attraction and grows into something meaningful, the haste at which both characters are able to confide in and accept one another is unreasonable. At one point Bella is attracted to Edward, just to have him act cruel to her, then to find out he's a vampire and still place her complete trust in him that he won't harm her. While their love is touching in a Romeo and Juliet sort of way, that does not stop it passing off as completely illogical and idiotic. Still there is a certain quickness to it all that does make for an interesting watch at times for the concept itself is a fascinating one.<br/><br/>The acting doesn't fare any better. Side characters are merely caricatures and the main characters are underdeveloped so it is no wonder that the level of acting is average. Kristen Stewart comes off as far too disinterested in absolutely everything. At first it seems acceptable when she doesn't which to be bothered much by people at school or her father, but when she is somehow madly in love with Edward her monotonic representation remains static. There are times where she attempts to put some life into her character but this is rare. Pattison fares better and seems to get the nervousness of Edward fairly well, and the same applies to when he is intent on saving Bella. But his constant exchanges at love for Bella are not entirely convincing. That is not to say that there is no chemistry between both Stewart and Pattison for there is. It is just not in the form you would expect but more like both are forced to be in love.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint the direction of the film works at times but the music and special effects do not. Director Catherine Hardwicke has a very unique way in her vision of the novel. Her direction yields a simple naturalness to it, losing the classic constructed feel of most films. It does come across as appealing to watch at times but it does become a bit much by the films end. You'll either enjoy the direction to wish for a more natural feel. Regardless of preference neither would have made the film any better. The music is also another love-hate item. The music selection sounds far too forced, as if trying to capture a certain mood for the film's atmosphere which doesn't work. There's a classical element to it, as if yearning to have a connection to Bram Stoker's Dracula and is nice distraction from the angst feel of the film. Lastly there are the special effects which are noticeably unrealistic. There is a blur given to any vampire character that moves fast, but it looks more like blurred fast forwarding and thus rather unnatural looking.<br/><br/>No vampire film is really all complete without some sexual connotations and violence: both are included in low form. Language is also kept low and nudity is a no-go area considering the target audience.<br/><br/>Twilight is a vampire story which is caught in a midst of smoke. With its average story, average acting, average music but interesting direction, it has neither the cruel seductiveness of Dracula nor the morbid fascination of Interview with the Vampire. With its superficial layering Twilight presumes to be more valuable to modern day teen life then both but, simply put, is not."
"NancyNostalgia","Null","1","3","14 December 2008"," Book fan
","I LOVE the Twilight book series! I am not impressed by the movie AT ALL! First of all, the characters were bad actors in general. The actors who played Edward and Bella did not portray like they were in the books. In the book, Edward Cullen was mysterious, charming, intelligent and spoke with early 20th century eloquence. In the movie he was awkward and creepy. Bella was a ""Plain Jane"" type both in the book and movie, however her personality was definitely not portrayed accurately. The movie left out so many of the best parts of the book! It seemed rushed. One minute Edward is a freak, the next Bella is in love with him. It combined several of the scenes where the two got better acquainted with one another into one awkward, unrealistic and rushed scene. It didn't even portray the ""meadow scene"" right and that was the inspiration for the book! The scene in the trees was weird too, because that never happened in the book and it didn't make sense to me, because Edward's character was so protective of Bella. I just don't see him taking her to tree tops... Anyway...I truly hope that the next movie will be pleasantly and surprisingly more accurate...but I doubt it. I am truly shocked that Stephenie Meyer was satisfied with this adaption of her books..."
"amala-thea","6","1","3","7 December 2008"," Lost in Translation
","Twilight: Lost in Translation? (half-done)<br/><br/>I've been (and still) very passionate about Edward and Bella's love story. But after watching Twilight, I all but found myself stunned (with that ""that was it?"" expression in my face), terribly disappointed and most of all heartbroken from how the movie turned out.<br/><br/>¬∞ ALL PREPPED UP FOR DOWNFALL? Leaked ""blue script"", on-location pictures and videos, MTV spoilers, TV Spots, teaser trailers and the EPIC-like theatrical trailer - who wouldn't get excited and expect much about Twilight? After these were let out, isn't it but natural for us to think that the film will be fantastic?<br/><br/>But no, I didn't let that get into me. Honestly, I do not remember myself setting or having high or low expectations for the film. I just remember being excited about it and wondered how the filmmakers will make of it - not to mention the fact that I've seen Rob the thrill was inexcusably and unbelievably high in me.<br/><br/>I watched it in its original version last Nov. 23rd and very pleased that only half of the 170+ seats were occupied - packed movie house is one thing I avoid and annoying reactions is another I detest . I was the first person to enter the theater and the first one to leave my seat... 30 minutes before its end.<br/><br/>The whole rime I was watching, I hadn't realized I was holding my breath. I was so dumbfounded beyond speech - without being aware of it - until I decided to step out. "" Oh my God, what was that?"" was the first thing I said. My reaction towards Twilight, you will say, must have been a total exaggeration but believe me, I couldn't agree more, despite of myself. I got bummed out for like 2 weeks but I'm gradually getting over it. I feel like I have been on the sticky wicket with my walking out.<br/><br/>¬∞ DEVIATION FROM THE BOOK Book-to-film movies cater a different approach in film making. It requires intensive book reading for them to have a better grip and understanding of the author's perspective - obviously not just throwing in their ideas, twists or views as if they are writing a fan fiction. Nobody must not expect the movie to be a one dimensional translation of the book. Expect slight alterations and changes as it is how been perceived by a different person.<br/><br/>Melissa Rosenberg - if she will ever pen Breaking Dawn's script, I must double the worry that I feel right now but strangely , I still feel hopeful that she'll polish her thing. In Twilight, she captured the right plot points - I give her that - but I felt she missed out on its foundation. It struck me as an interpretation with an inadequate effort to bring out the ""magic"" of the story. Needless to say, they left out the heart and soul of it and settled to invent unimpressive, insignificant scenes which were unnecessary as there were so much of the original text that has been left out.<br/><br/>Movies will never be like the books. You don't need to be a Communication Arts student to know this. If you are a purist, do NOT watch adaptations. I don't really care if they feel like taking out numerous portions just to give much focus on a much more definitive storyline. Nevertheless, if the semblance and foundation were not there, that is a major let down for any book reader.<br/><br/>If you are a non-reader, you will love the storyline but go buy the book and see for yourself what you have been missing.<br/><br/>¬∞ MEDIOCRITY OF THE ESSENCE Character development is crucial factor in presenting the personalities of the role portrayed. Was there any development of any of Twilight's character? I guess there was but I feel like it was ZERO, completely absent.<br/><br/>Bella's character is so much more important than any roles in Twilight combined because this is how we see through everything. She's our eyes to Twilight. I think the voice-over narrative of Bella's POV is perfect to establish Bella's character but it was lost throughout the whole movie. It was carried out poorly. What went wrong was that the 'Bella in action' overlapped 'Bella in VO.' I do not know if I was overly observant but 'Bella in action' didn't go well with the VO.<br/><br/>As Twilight being in Bella's POV, shouldn't Edward's character be based from how she saw him? You know - decent, compelling, maddeningly in control of himself - but yes, that is from the Twilight book. Nevertheless, aside from the fact Rob needs ideas of being Edward, I just wonder why did they hugely used Edward's inner turmoil (Midnight Sun character) too openly in the movie.<br/><br/>Granted that Twilight is mainly the strain between Bella and Edward, I understand why some characters has not been greatly established. I take it that perhaps we just need to suck it up and wait for those characters to be developed in the sequels - anyway, there really is not much of character development yet in Twilight. However, I've never dreamed their interpretation of some characters will look hilarious and weird.<br/><br/>I'm sad because the people who went there were surely just went there because of Edward. They missed the charming story of Edward and Bella."
"acngl","4","1","3","5 December 2008"," For Twilight-Fans: Yes, but not for the rest of the world
","All in all the film was very disappointing. First, I believe that Robert Pattinson is a good actor, but unfortunately he could not really show what he's got because Hardwicke seems to have thought that plain close ups of his face to simply present him like a super model would be enough. Too bad, I believe he would have been able to convey what Edward is described as in the book - if someone had let him. Concerning Kirsten Stewart, I don't want to get into it much, I do not think she is a good actress and that was confirmed seeing her in Twilight. The dialogue was confusing, sometimes it seemed like the characters were just babbling, it was trivial (which was not like that in the book) and did not seem to be helping the audience understand what was going on. Also, the film as a whole is very confusing for people who have not read the book. A lot is left out or cut short (which is worse then leaving things out), so the scenes do not seem connected but rather loose and this held the viewer away from getting into it, or ""diving"" into the story. The cinematography was also weird and at times did not fit either. Some techniques just did not make sense. It did not help underlining special moments at all but rather seemed exaggerated as well as out of place. <br/><br/>I read the books and liked them, but I am not that much of a Twilight fan. I was disappointed by the film and trying to see it as objectively as possible I came to the conclusion, that I do not recommend it to people who do not call themselves ""Twilighters"" or ""Twi-hards"". I think the real fans love the books too much to not like what has happened at the attempt to visualize them. It was easy for me to follow & understand everything but again, only because I read the book. I was disappointed and felt bad for Robert Pattinson who is probably getting a lot of acting-concerning criticism now for what are actually the directors mistakes. <br/><br/>All in all it can be said that ""Twilight"" is a film for the die hard TWilight fans and Robert-Pattinson-Lovers and there are definitely a lot out there, which explains why this film made so much money. Concerning the rest of the world I think it might not be THE film 2008 for its lack of cinematic quality. Besides, people just don't get what is going on. I know from friends who did not read the book that they could not understand the part with the ""Tracker"" or the conflict between Edward and the Quileute - just to name a few.<br/><br/>My personal highlight of the film was the baseball scene btw. And the soundtrack does a 180 compared to the film. Its a helluva soundtrack. Thumbs up for that."

"gacklez","5","1","3","4 December 2008"," OK to really decent acting, Rushed
","I understand that books can't exactly be adapted into films without major cuts. The problem with this film is that relationship between the characters doesn't even build. If I hadn't read the book and I watched this film I believe I would have been lost as far as the relationship went. Some parts of the film were supported by excellent acting, and some were completely scarred by their performances. In my humble opinion, this film would have been much better with a different director or screenwriter. If the romance were turned up a little, and the viewers got to see what drove the characters to make the sacrifices they did, and the action were cut down a tad, this film could have been great. Hopefully the sequel and following films learn from this and do better."

","I have read the whole Twilight saga and I can honestly admit that I'm a die hard fan (with the exception of wanting to have Robert Pattinson's babies *awkward*).<br/><br/>***Everytime Robert Pattinson, as Edward opened his mouth to tell Bella about his powers or something vampire-supernatural totally ruined the scene. I love the books, even the fourth one, way too much to really have something against this movie.<br/><br/>The best part was the ending, not because it was over but because I personally felt it was where Melissa Rosenberg stayed true to the book the most*** The filming locations were beautiful even though it was not quite what I pictured I do not feel like it took away from the movie at all. Forks High School (not so beautiful) was most definitely not what I was thinking of. I thought all these kids would be wearing clothes straight out of a Walmart newspaper but Eric was wearing a shirt and tie (totally weird and just had to mention). Bella's house and everything in it again, not so much what I had in mind. Edward's house ¬ñ Edward's room was off. BUT! I don't feel these aspects of the film took away from the overall story.<br/><br/>The characters and the actors portrayed by them, from the very beginning has been a super A+ for me. I like them as they are. They did the best to their abilities taking into account their experience and the reality of the script. I can see where the difficulty may come in if you don't believe your character. The Cullen's did a nice job being who they were even though Jasper literally looked like he was taking the largest dump of his life (except the baseball scene). The whole theater cracked up when the screen flashed to him. I love Robert Pattinson as Edward. He's fairly super good looking (he's a hairy man, BTW) but WHAT WAS HE DOING? What was Catherine Hardwicke thinking? The first scene with Edward and Bella in biology was absolutely ridiculous. Again, with the constipation, the weird stunned into shock thing? I just wasn't getting it. In the book he was battling against himself, not Bella! I heard in interviews that he and Stephenie Meyer or someone else had debates over how Edward should be depicted. Well whoever orchestrated the Biology scene and, well, a majority of the scenes was totally not what I had in mind. Kristen Stewart. I think she makes a very good Bella (physically) but she put too much of herself into Bella's character. It sucks! I had no problem with the rest of the cast; it was just Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. I felt like they put too much of themselves and really took away from who Edward and Bella are. Maybe it was the script or the director but I just wasn't buying it. I love Taylor Lautner as Jacob and I hope he grows half a foot taller to surpass Robert Pattison and be Jacob in New Moon and Eclipse.<br/><br/>The script was so weird. I'm not going to lie. There was a field trip, Billy was hip and the biology teacher had a real role (did he sleep with someone to get into this movie?) Good and bad stuff always but I have to say the bad outweighed the good. I felt like there were conversations missed that were crucial to the portrayal of the love story that is Edward and Bella. A lot of the conversation weren't realistic (okay, I know, Vampires, not realistic whatsoever) in terms of what kind of person Edward is, Bella, so on and so forth, etc etc. The field trip scene was totally useless. I don't get it. Whatever Melissa felt essential (Claire De Lune /Answers-theories/ blah blah blah) was NOT. If I had never read the book I personally would feel like, 'wow, Bella is super easy' because there were so many things in between that happened that didn't happen in the movie. I may be over stepping but I could have written a better script for the cast and fitting it into a two hour time frame (or less).<br/><br/>The music sucked. It wasn't because it's not the usual genre I listen to. The music just sucked. It changed the mood to what the actual mood was in the scene. It took away from the scene actually. I would be listening to how much I hate the song than to what's going on in the movie. It also sounded like the same song being played over and over when a serious scene would occur. The music was ridiculous. My favorite was the ending because that's when the songs really started to fit (but how hard is it to pick a romantic song for Bella and Edward dancing, Edward and James fighting etc etc).<br/><br/>The contacts were all over the place, Edward's diamond chest made everyone in the audience make a 'what the F***' face. Actually, there were so many things wrong in this movie I don't know why I love it so much. I'm probably going to buy the 3 disc DVD set but still. It wasn't a good movie. I like this movie is because I love the books so much. I don't feel like they butchered the book much but at this point I can't really remember because I'm still laughing at that scene where Edward first meets Bella in biology. The music was deafening, Edward touched Bella's things (even a normal person in real life wouldn't touch someone else's things to sit farther away) and looked like he belonged in the most heavy duty toilet Forks can offer.<br/><br/>So now they have a lot of money, an audience, should have a good feel of the characters and the story so I hope they do a lot better next time."
"jdmxrain","Null","1","3","30 November 2008"," cool flick
","I haven't read the books before seeing it on Thanksgiving. Yes I'm one of those people who goes to the theatres during the holidays. Anyway, I decided to see it on a whim and liked it. I am not obsessed with it like some people are. I've never been like that. I will admit that some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy.<br/><br/>I felt some of the romance parts were rushed like when Edward said that Bella was his life now. That's a little intense, especially when Bella is in her late teens and is just introduced to the vampires. Bella doesn't act like a normal person would act to a vampire. She wants to be with Edward but doesn't really take into consideration what a life with Edward might mean.<br/><br/>I also have another question. What does Bella want, besides a life with Edward? In the movies, I like it when heroines have their own strengths, their own passions. At least in LOTR, Arwen had her own strengths as an elf princess and I don't even like LOTR. In chick flicks, the leading women have their own passions as well.<br/><br/>Bella doesn't seem to have many interests. She also ditches her friends in school for Edward all the time and I don't really like it in the movies when characters are total loners. You need at least a couple of friends in life besides your SO. I would have liked her character to have been more developed.<br/><br/>So its a cool movie with its flaws, but I don't get the obsession with it. I'm in my twenties, but even when I was a teen, I never got obsessed with things. I'm not knocking love either, love is important, but so is being able to be a happy person with or without someone."

","To say I feel cheated is an understatement. I expected more and was disappointed in the dialogue. The movie strayed from the book which was to be expected. . . I still hoped for more. I didn't even get the satisfaction of their profession of the words ""I Love You!"" I was really scared to see the movie, I had a feeling it wouldn't live up to the book. Now I will be reading the books yet again(this will not be a problem) to erase the movie from my memory. In my head it was so much more than what we were given. I can only hope for more in the movies to come. Please don't disappoint us again! Hopefully ""New Moon"" will be longer with more details, I would prefer to sit through 3-4 hours possibly more of a good display of Edward and Bella's relationship blossoming."
"startumbler92","9","3","18","21 November 2008"," Great !
","I always love going to the first showings of movie. The true fans come out to those ones. The atmosphere is awesome. When Jacob, Edward, Carlyle, and the other vampires made an entrance, the crowd was screaming and cheering.<br/><br/>I was going into the movie thinking it was going to be great. I saw a quote where Robert Pattinson thought the book was pretty true to the book. Sometimes the plot when a little fast and they made several chapters into one scene, but it was also for time.<br/><br/>The movie was shorter than I thought, but it was great nonetheless. It's made by an indie movie company and director, so it was a little different. The camera angles were cool. They would pan around from bottom, to middle, and top.<br/><br/>I think that there wasn't a lot of interaction between Bella and the kids at school and the other vampires, but I also remember that the book is really central to Bella and Edward.<br/><br/>For all of you who are disappointed by the movie, just hope that they do New Moon and redeem themselves. That means more JACOB ! :D"

","When I saw the previews for the movie I thought it looked interesting so I went and read the book (which I loved by the way!) and I went to see this at midnight on thursday. needless to say I was the oldest person in the theater. <br/><br/>Let's start with what I liked:<br/><br/><ul><li>dialogue was similar if not exactly what was said in the book - all of the Cullens acted just like they were in the book especially Alice. - I liked the feel/mood of the movie and the cinematography - Robert Pattinson is just unbelievably handsome and I had a hard time concentrating on what was going on anytime he was on screen - I really enjoyed Bella and Charlie's scenes the best because it felt really natural - the baseball scene was my favorite and pretty accurate - I did like the end where they show victoria at prom plotting her revenge leaving room open for a sequel - I loved when Bella meets the Cullens and Jasper's face the whole time - I also like Billy Black in the movie (great casting) - Jacob and Bella's scenes were very good as well, but I felt they had more of a connection than Bella and Edward :(</li></ul><br/><br/>Now what I didn't like: - too choppy and not enough character development for anyone, it was way too rushed. - wasn't very fluid it seemed like they were showing us the story not telling us one - I don't remember Bella's friends being such losers...I would have not hung out with any of these kids in high school - I could see Robert Pattinson's contact line in like every close up shot...it got annoying - the ballet hall scene was the most anti-climactic climax I've ever seen, it just seemed very forced and ended in like a 1:30. and why did he bite her on the forearm and not her hand? - they needed to include more bella and edward getting to know each other...it was like one minute they meet, the next they are in love with each other - the running/climbing was super cheesy - Bella's hospital scene was awful acting on her part, I think I laughed out loud. the same with Edward when he 1st smells her in biology...I thought he wanted to kill her not throw up all over himself. - I don't recall Rosalie being so terribly important in the book, but she is probably the Cullen with the most screen time save for Edward. Catherine Hardwick must really love Nikki Reed.<br/><br/>all in all, I liked the book and the movie. I was distracted by the things I didn't like so much that I wasn't really enjoying the movie to it's fullest capacity, I'll have to go see it again to fully appreciate it. If I hadn't read the book before I think I would have been totally lost, and I'm thankful I did if it weren't for me pointing out everything that was wrong with the movie"
"elektrikmistress","8","3","18","21 November 2008"," I was surprised... happily and sadly.
","All in all, TWILIGHT was a decent flick.<br/><br/>I am disappointed, though, in the choppy nature of the budding romance between Edward & Bella. I really think that 10 minutes of running time could have been added to the beginning of the film to clear things up a bit more than was done. If you read the book, you could easily infer what you already knew - but if you went in with no prior knowledge of the book, you may have been confused by the sudden intensity of Edward & Bella's relationship. It almost seemed to go from ""talking"" to ""in love"". It was rushed.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie flowed well. The chase and climax were done very well - better than the first part of the movie.<br/><br/>There was a lot of unexpected comic relief, which had me pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>And I know Rob Pattinson fans are going to be angry at me for this, but his American accent was stiff and unconvincing. His cadence was off a bit and certain words sounded odd. I still think the man has amazing potential as an actor; he just needs some work with a speech coach for ""New Moon"" (if it gets made). And I cannot deny his screen presence. Even *I* swooned.<br/><br/>Kristen's Bella really surprised me. I ended up really liking her. I always thought Kristen had great potential; I am convinced of it now.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was pretty amazing. Rosalie pulled off b&%$h extremely well. I loved Emmett. And I *adored* Jasper & Alice. *ADORED*. They were perfect! I liked Jacob more than I thought I would, his charisma and enthusiasm were catching.<br/><br/>All in all, if you like Twilight, you will most likely enjoy the movie. If you're a romantic at heart, looking for a good date movie or if you like vampires - you will probably like the movie. If you're a Twilight 'purist' - you are going to find flaws at every turn. Just go see it and enjoy it for what it is - if you don't have any expectations, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised!"

","OK my friend, I read your comment after seeing the movie and I was simply disgusted...disgusted that somebody like you is allowed to post comments. Blatantly said, you are the dumbest person I have ever seen in my life!! Just a few things to lighten you up: first of all you said that the movie was 'cheesy'..I don't know what soap-operas are you usually watching, but if this captivating-out of the ordinary-thrilling movie was anywhere near the concept of 'cheesy' to your opinion, that is just really sad..The second thing, you commented on her 'lack of emotions'...if this is what you really believe, than you are undoubtedly the dumbest person on this planet! Her brilliant acting skills were showed in how she could speak to us with her mimic..just by looking at her you could feel her pain, the pain inside her heart that was ripping her apart...why was Edward hating her that much, why did he save her, what IS he?! All these terrible questions were in her, the emotions they caused were transmitted to us by her mimic...she was brilliant!! You are an incredibly superficial person not to observe them. Had she been all a crying sniffling silly little girl, that would have suited you? Precisely in this case, the movie would have been cheesy, indeed...but it is far far from that. Her troubled heart was perfectly shown by her acting. And since you mentioned Harry Potter, let me quote something from there: Hermione said once to Ron when she was angry: 'Just because you are at the emotional level of a tea-spoon...', this fits you perfectly! As for it not being a good enough vampire movie?! Mate, you missed the essence of it miserably...this movie is so brilliant because it is NOT some ordinary stupid vampire movie..oh, I'm sorry, did you miss the blood-ketchup bath!? Well, grow up! You probably are a fan of those movies, everything straightforward, nothing to really think about, just watch the gore fest..well that is simply stupid. It was made perfectly so it wouldn't be just another idiot vampire movie..and it succeeded brilliantly! That is the fantastic beauty of it, all those raging emotions in them, being unable to be together, to surpass the great wall that is between them..it is a movie about these emotions.<br/><br/>This movie had the accent on the evolution of the characters, of what it takes to understand somebody so different, of the emotions involved in this process...and it came out brilliantly my friend..I feel sorry that you couldn't enjoy it at its full potential."

","I've been through this a hundred times. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Interview With a Vampire, you name it, I've read the books first, then watched the movie. So going in to Twilight, I expected to be disappointed. I assumed it would be like the Harry Potter movies, fun to watch, but nothing interesting compared to the books.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>This movie is masterful. The actors are all wonderfully talented in portraying realistic, lifelike, emotional reactions. The awkward laughs, the pained silences, the moments of confusion. So much of this movie is unspoken and communicated with looks only, and that takes an ENORMOUS amount of talent and direction. The scripting was fantastic despite what people are saying. It was very much scripted in the way people actually TALK, rather than ""movie-speak"". No, there were no real one-liners, dramatic moments, or stunning pronouncements. There aren't any in real life, either. This scripting was amazing in that it all sounded very natural. It sounded like regular conversations that regular people have in regular places. How often can you say that about a movie? Rarely! The filming of the movie has been critiqued negatively as well. I think it was brilliant. Rather than feeling like I was watching some polished, scripted, ""HOLLYWOOD"" version of a book, I felt like I was actually there. Forks felt REAL. (well, it is, but you know what I mean). It was the version of the book that lived in my head brought to life.<br/><br/>Yep, some of the story lines and plot changed. Of course they did - how else could a book of that size make a movie less than 5 hours long? But they didn't change as drastically as Harry Potter. Those movies left me feeling very angry with the adaptation. This movie made me skip through my house when I got home in glee!! The DID IT! They actually adapted these books into a movie I was pleased and proud to see!<br/><br/>I will watch this movie (and hopefully they make the rest, too!) over and over again and I will buy it as soon as it's out on DVD. Well done!"

","Most critics say that this movie will not appeal to anyone over 17 but I am 22 and I absolutely loved it! I have been a Twilight fan since the books came out and I have been following this movie all year. I was certain that since I had hyped it up for myself that I would probably not enjoy it. But I have seen it twice and loved it. Critics have been saying that it is ""forgettable and just another teen flick"" but I thought it was wonderfully artistic and beautifully acted. I will admit that it was a little rushed but for the most part I thought that all the actors did a terrific job. I would have liked more scenes with the Cullens and more alone time with Edward and Bella, but to see the movie, you have to realize that it is not going to be exactly what you expect. All the conversations are not going to be the same. There is not going to be all the scenes you want like ""the blood typing scene"" etc. But I thought it was the most faithful adaptation that I have seen. And unlike everyone else who wants to jump on the ""I Hate the Twilight Movie Bandwagon"" I am going to be brave and say that I loved it. I took my mom and she said, ""When can we see it again?"" My dad even enjoyed this film. While most people didn't like the meadow scene, I loved it. Critics hated that they just laid there and stared at each other but I thought it was beautiful. Especially when Edward sparkles. I thought for the cast being virtual unknowns, the budget only being 37 million, that this crew did an excellent job with what they were given. New Moon will have more of a budget to work with to make the effects look much better. I think that everyone should give this movie a chance and go and make your own opinion not just listen to the negative bandwagon..."

","What can I say about this movie? It's incredibly boring, like Edward, vapid and aimless with no imagination or emotion, like Bella, and an absolute chore to sit through. Frankly, I have seen five-year-olds with more acting ability and passion. This really is a vampire movie, because it sucks the life out of the audience and leaves you starving for actual talent. When I finished watching this, I immediately put in my old WWF tapes, so I could see some GOOD acting and plot. It's a sad commentary on us as a people when drivel like this becomes successful. I haven't subjected myself to the books because I don't want to be seen in public with them. The shame and anguish of having seen this movie was more than enough."
"estarinakis","1","15","174","13 January 2009"," What vampire movie?
","*This review contains spoilers * I repeat * SPOILERS INSIDE* Done my duty, now let's rock :<br/><br/>This is probably one of the worst movies. Ever. First of all let's check my movie background. I m a horror lover. A thriller/mystery lover. Which means I ve watched A LOT movies with vampires. This is not such a movie. The ""vampires"" are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off the beaten track. Which sometimes is not bad in itself. But it's another thing to leave the beaten track for a while, and totally another thing to stray so far away, you cant even see the beaten track. The vampires here shine in the sunlight (my gf said that Cullen shines more than Paris Hilton's purse) , YES, SUNLIGHT. Sun doesn't kill them, day doesn't kill them. Moreover, they are, in their own words, VEGETARIAN. Oh and they have no pointy teeth. OK, in one sentence : day walking,shiny,toothless, vegetarian vampires. If that doesn't spoil it for you.. I ll try again : I respect the genre of romantic comedies, romantic movies etc. The fact that I don't like the genre doesn't mean that fans of it are idiots or sth. We just have different tastes. OK? Respect. BUT, such cheesines is rare. The female protagonist acts as if she is suffering of chronic constipation. The male protagonist was very suitable for Harry Poter, but this overly white makeup and the cheesy vampiric love lines, don't suit him at all. The lines are awful. I mean, COME OOOON!!! I wouldn't recommend the movie to any adult. It could be a masterpiece for adolescents, under 15 though, but I don't think the adult audience will like that movie. Sorry for the intensity of this review, but truly, as far as my movie education goes, this movie is totally awful."
"Kaitl_Scissorhands","2","15","177","27 November 2008"," Poor, poor film
","Twilight. What can I say about Twilight? I'll begin on a positive note. The film used a good song, Supermassive Black Hole made famous by Muse.<br/><br/>Twilight is what can only be described as a mess. It tells the story of 17 year old Bella Swan, a teen who recently went to live with her father in the rainy city of Forks, Washington. There she meets Edward Cullen, an unbearably beautiful vampire. The two fall for each other, but that's not the only force of attraction between them. Edward thirsts for Bella's blood more than any other human's, which makes him especially dangerous to Bella. Lucky for Bella, the Cullens don't drink human blood, and Edward is strong-willed, as well as deeply in love with her. Along with this obsticale in the way of their love, a vampire named James wants her blood-and he won't give up.<br/><br/>I must say, I am a fan of the books so this review is a tad biased. This Bella, played by Kristen Stewart, was not the Bella I know. The Bella I know is shy and not sure of herself. This Bella was too confident and sometimes came off as almost rude. Also, the Edward in the film, played by Robert Pattinson, was not a perfect embodiment of the character. This Edward did things that the book character would never have done.<br/><br/>On a non-biased note, the film went much too fast. Twilight seemed rushed, and the scenes changed too quickly. There were also scenes that just had me laughing, although they were not meant to be humorous; a couple scenes were just altogether unnecessary.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a poor interpretation of the book I love so dearly and just a poor film in general."
"Bido06","1","13","149","15 April 2009"," Vampires of the World ... Avenge yourselves
","First of all I have to admit that I have never heard about the books before this movie, after seeing the movie I would not read those books even if I get paid to do so.<br/><br/>The story line seems directed at very young girls, so I was kinda of reluctant to see the movie, but I am such a fan of vampires (Louis, Lestat, Buffy, Angel, Spike, Selene), I thought that I might as well give it a shot.<br/><br/>I was greatly disappointed. The plot of a deadly dangerous ""boy"" fall for the ""damsel in distress"" and protect her with his life against all the dangers of the world, including himself ¬Ö is romantic and dreamy.<br/><br/>However, the movie turns out to be a huge disappointment and downright ridiculous.<br/><br/>The love scenes between the two main characters are too long and boring, they lack depth, warmth and credibility, he just popped every now and then by her side and told her to stay away from him, she finds out he is a vampire (a reasonably enough deduction! Vampires are known for a fact to exist among us) and fell hopelessly and irrevocably in love with him. I find that I don't relate to them at all. Kong had more passion and facial expressions for God's sake.<br/><br/>Edward has the appeal of a cardboard, he did not strike me as particularly dangerous or brooding, he looked depressed, rather psychotic and severely malnourished. And the speech of ""I am the world most dangerous predator¬Ö' Could he be more ridiculous. Oh yes and he glitters in the sun too! Bella, why did she all the time look like she's just smelled something disgusting? And what is all the stammering and umms and ohhhs and uhs? And here I am a young girl in a strange town and a vampire comes to me and tells me that I smell so good he cannot resist eating me, do I get a little scared, worried ... at all ... not even a little, NO I trust him utterly and completely and throw myself in his arms, putting not only myself but my father as well in danger.<br/><br/>ALL other characters were underdeveloped so there is absolutely no way to judge them, the only prominent feature about them is how bad their makeup was, the faces were too white, this is beyond pale, like they've used flour, and the makeup artist did not even bother to cover all the way down their necks or their ears, and God ... way too much lipsticks. Not to mention the hair, isn't it kick-you-in-the-crotch painful to look at those hair styles. And the Cullens, they tried to be oh-so-dangerous and ""vampiry"" but they ended up being laughable, strained and ridiculous. I only liked the evil vampires, although again, they were way underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Special effects sucked big time, if I wanted a fast forward bleary motion to show me how fast these guys are, I would have just pressed fast forward on my set.<br/><br/>And why was it only Edward who could suck the venom out of Bella, especially when he is in such danger not to be able to stop, why not Carlisle or Alice. I guess it was only to deliver the silliest scene ever, the expression on Edward's face was priceless.<br/><br/>I have never ever ever in my life heard such a ridiculous script ¬Ö never ¬Ö ever ... EVER ""Are you going to tell me how you stopped the van? Yeah. Um, I had an adrenaline rush. It's very common. You can Google it"" ¬Ö"" I only said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be. What does that mean? It means if you're smart, you'll stay away from me. Okay, let's say for argument's sake that I'm not smart""¬Ö I could go on. Have you ever heard of ""We'll always have Paris"" or even ""You complete me""??!!!?? Where are the aspects that we all love in a vampire movie; dangerous lurking in the night, flinching from the cross, avoiding the sunlight for reasons that does not involve sparkles and glitters, stakes, and fangs ... where are the fangs??? Even just dangerous looking teeth would have satisfied me. I think in this movie vampires will suck your blood dry by simply staring you to death.<br/><br/>So vampire and wolves, my two most favorite creatures of the night have been totally butchered, ridiculed and distorted in this awful ridiculous awful stupid awful movie.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this movie to anyone, in fact I recommend that whoever participated in this movie, even remotely, anyone who was present within two blocks from where they were filming that movie should be set to be eaten by wolves or better yet by vampires ... they really deserve a chance to avenge their tarnished reputation."

","Twilight (2008) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Teenager Bella (Kristen Stewart) goes to live with her father in the Northern Pacific and once there she falls for Edward (Robert Pattinson) who turns out to be a vampire. As a 31-year-old male it goes without saying but I'm not the target audience for this film and I'll admit upfront that I haven't heard a single page of any of the books. I'll even admit that I had never heard of this story until it became a box office hit. I really didn't expect too much but I was pleasantly surprised to see that there's actually quite a bit of good things in this movie, although at the same time there are some major problems. The greatest thing the film has going for it are the two lead performers who deliver dynamite performances and really save this movie from being something far worse. Stewart is wonderful as the strange teenager who finds herself in a strange place trying to connect with the father she hasn't seen in ages. She's also trying to fit into a school where she feels like an outsider and she then finally falls for someone who is untouchable in many ways. I thought the early part of the film did a very good job at building up her character and the actress managed to bring it a lot of weight and make her believable. Pattinson is also extremely good and I was really impressed with his laid-back approach. I thought he was very believable as the tortured soul who is caught between love and his own natural instincts. The two stars are wonderful together, have some great chemistry and they come off like a real couple. Director Catherine Hardwicke handles the material quite well but the biggest thing wrong with TWILIGHT is something that haunts a lot of films today and that's the fact that the screenplay isn't strong enough for a 126-minute running time. I'm really not sure how it happened but why on Earth do producer's feel a ""B"" movie needs to runs between two and three hours? The film starts off so well but every scene just gets to the point where it drags on and on and the ending, which you can see coming from a mile away, happens way too far into the story and by this point you're already starting to grow tired. The worst thing in the film is the extremely poor CGI effects, which are among some of the worst that you're ever going to see. With that said, if you're a fan of the books then it goes without saying that you're going to love the film. As someone not familiar with the story, I found the performances to be excellent and they're good enough for those non-fans to check out."

I have no idea where these idiots get their comments from. Most likely from their peanut sized brains.It was excellent. It gave readers a perspective of where the characters where coming from.I would tell people to see this movie. It was fantastic. Perfect chemistry between the characters. I can not wait till the second movie comes out. I think the movies will be a hit just like the books are. People should read the books and see the movie. It is worth seeing and reading."
"MelanieG6","9","2","11","23 November 2008"," I haven't been this happy about an adaptation of a book since Lord of the Rings
","Did I love it? Did it measure up to the hype? Did it honor the book? Was he Edward? Yes, yes, yes, YES!!! Yesterday afternoon, I went with four other moms to see Twilight. The mom next to me had serious doubts that Robert Pattinson could live up to the Edward Cullen of the book, especially after she saw some of the clips of Robert doing goofy interviews. She was totally won over by his performance. ""He IS Edward!"" The first thing she said after the movie ended was, ""I want to see it again!"" I totally agree, and may even be seeing it again tonight with my hubby.<br/><br/>Yes, I felt like one of those teenage girls again even though I'm 43. I swooned over Robert Pattinson's James Dean cool. He's the bad boy, and you can't help but fall in love.<br/><br/>This movie is a romance! It's Romeo and Juliet. It's Heathcliff and Cathy. It's the modern take on star-crossed love. In modern times, how else do you keep those young lovers apart? All the complaints from male reviewers about special effects that weren't top notch, not enough action, not enough blood, not enough scariness. You don't get it. This movie is not for your demographic. This is not an action film with a few minutes of romance thrown in to get the women to come. This is a romance, a full on old fashioned, say those lines with sincerity and not mocking, ROMANCE with a few minutes of action and peril thrown in. Bella is only in danger so Edward can save her like a white knight! I can't say enough about the performances of Robert Pattinson as Edward, and Kristen Stewart as Bella. They WERE Edward and Bella, and got the tone exactly right. Robert, I thought, played Edward a little more depressed than in the book, maybe foreshadowing New Moon, but it felt right to me. He just oozed anguish with every line, ""What if I'm the bad guy?"" Swoon! Melissa Rosenberg, the screenwriter, gets my ultimate respect and kudos. It is not an easy thing to adapt a novel that has such a fervid following, and she did a great job. She captured the essence. You can't have everything included, and some things need to be different to play on screen. The best example is how she combined the meadow scene where Edward reveals his diamond skin, with the first time that Bella says to Edward that he is a vampire, which I believe in the book is in the car. Combining the two together made it much more dramatic and worked extremely well. The diamond skin in sunlight special effect wasn't as radiant and glowing as I'd pictured in my mind, but given their budget looked good. With more money for New Moon, it will be interesting how the special effects improve. There will be a lot of them with all the werewolf changing! I loved how Cathy Hardwicke captured the relationship between Bella and her father, Charlie. It was pitch perfect. Cathy Hardwicke, the director who made Thirteen, made her best choices in the casting. I can't think of one single person who was ""off"". And her finds in Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson! Kristen Stewart she saw in Into The Wild, a film I have not seen. Hardwicke has said, ""I felt her yearning -- it was just palpable,"" and it is that quality that sets the tone for the entire film. That was just what was needed for Bella. It's all those looks she gives when she's not even saying anything! Even Stephenie Meyer, the author of Twilight, had doubts about Robert Pattinson as Edward, because in real life he is a goof and kind of shy. She said that once a scene would start, he was instantly transformed to Edward and he exceeded her expectations. My God, that intensity smolders right off the screen, and even his ""crooked grin"" felt just right.<br/><br/>I don't think I have been as happy about the adaptation of a book to screen since Lord of the Rings. They did it. They made something the fans of the book can love. All those thirteen year old girls will be seeing this film multiple times, and I will be, too.<br/><br/>All the stories I read about the box office predictions talked about how unique this film's demographic is and how difficult it was to predict how huge it would be. Is it really? It's not a ""family film"" like Nancy Drew or Harry Potter. It's not a video game adaptation for teen boys. It's not a Rom Com. It's not Sex and the City which is for women, but an older demographic. It really was funny to me that this seemed to be the first movie for girls, but for older women, too. Let's hope it starts a trend. We girls and women have money to spend, too, and a hunger for romance. Are you listening studio heads?"

"mama-moose101","2","13","151","26 December 2008"," Horrible script and awkward acting
","This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This film was probably the most hyped up teen film this year. I wasn't even all that interested when I saw the trailer but my friend said she liked it when she saw it so I decided to give it a chance. And after a painful half hour of it I don't think I can go on to finish the rest of the film and waste another hour of my life. <br/><br/>This is very obviously targeted towards a teen audience, especially a materialistic, impressionable, and empty minded teen audience. <br/><br/>The town is constantly overcast and somber, with some very stoic or angsty high schoolers strutting around. The new girl who comes to town and have to drive up to school in a rusting old pickup truck is suppose to evoke some sort of empathy as a misfit in a new place. But it's hard to relate when all the boys are throwing themselves at her, and becoming friends with her just so they have a chance to ask her to prom. And the hot guy from the mysterious rich ""in crowd"", who doesn't even give the time of day to any other girls also can't seem to stop disrupting her concentrated stoicism with his awkward small talk and flirting. How she made her friends is very reminiscent of late 90s teen romance movies, and fairly unlike real high school scenarios. She just has to sit there angrily minding her own business while people start running up to her happy to make friends.<br/><br/>One thing, if they're vampires, why are they not spontaneously combusting during the daytime? And since when are vampires able to eat and drink at high school cafeterias?<br/><br/>So anyway, with all the over-posed staring contests between the two intensely pretty lead characters, they manage to find some lackluster and meaningless conversation between themselves. <br/><br/>The script is very bland, witless, and pretentious. The main characters seem too busy posing and modeling rather than acting. The female lead just comes off as defensive and angry, while the male lead seems a bit ditzy and awkward. I'm hoping it's because he's having a hard time doing a convincing American accent. I've seen better scripts on D listed TV shows, and more romantic chemistry from pickup lines in Irish pubs.<br/><br/>The movie might have been more successful if the volume was off."

","basically...i am a huge fan of the books and even though the movie wasn't word for word from the book i absolutely loved it. you can't honestly expect it to be exactly like the book, no movie is ever like that so for all of you who are mad....get over it.<br/><br/>the acting is really good and i really liked how all of the characters were cast, for the most part.<br/><br/>the only thing that really bothered me was that Edward didn't take Bella into Carlisle's office to let her know about the Volturi...which was crucial for New Moon.<br/><br/>But i went into the theater expecting it to be awesome, i waited in line for like 5 hours to get into the theater and I'm so happy i did. I can't wait to see this movie again, and again. it is pure perfection and it just had me wanting the rest of the saga to be out now! if you haven't seen it yet, you're already missing out. (="

","amazing movie, loved it from start to finish. these characters were definitely brought to life by these actors. They picked great actors that i think fit each role perfectly, just the way i pictured them.<br/><br/>But like any movie that's adapted from a book, there's always going to be differences, a few missing scenes or things that happened in the book aren't in order in the movie. All the major scenes from the book were in the movie and it stayed true to the book. It's 2 hours long but yet still feels too short to tell the story. Obviously to fit a 500 page book into a 2 hour movie, the story has to develop rather quickly, so if you didn't read the book you'll wonder how did Bella and Edward fall in love so quickly. the scene in the meadow went by too fast and should've been more detailed like in the book. for me that was the turning point in the story and definitely made their love come to life. so that scene should've been better done. there were a few minor scenes or lines from the book that helped evolve Bella and ed's relationship that weren't in the movie. it definitely would've made the movie even better to focus more on their growing love. but the only big issue i had was that Rosalie/Emmett & Alice/jasper were barely on scene or had dialogue. Jasper barely spoke except for a line or two. That disappointed me, i loved Alice's character the most and how upbeat she was. and jasper as well.<br/><br/>All in all, i loved the book and loved the movie just as much. I truly hope they make the sequels because its a great series of books. so if you watch it, just enjoy it for what it is! it captures the book well!"

","I saw nothing good in this film, although I really did like the (first) book. <br/><br/>The cinematography is what really struck me as terrible. I really don't know what they were trying to convey with it (an avant-garde approach?), but it didn't work for me and I found I couldn't move past it. Perhaps, then, it tainted my opinion regarding the rest of the film, but I saw nothing good in it either; be it the soundtrack (poor), the dialogue/screenplay (lame) or the acting (overly hesitant at times). <br/><br/>Quite honestly, I saw none of the chemistry that others have commented about regarding the two main characters. Their relationship developed much too quickly and wasn't adequately explained. Most of the early book takes place in Bella's thoughts, and that wasn't translated into the film. Edward went from apparently hating Bella to loving her almost overnight.<br/><br/>We rented it through Netflix, and I am thankful for not having spent the $$ to see it in the theater.

I laughed out loud the first time I saw the vampire youngsters in the school. no one can go walking through life with that amount of powder in their face!!! you can tell a mile away they're blood suckers. and all that Stewart and Pattinson's characters do is look into each other eyes, sigh, talk nonsense. For the first time in years i used the fast forward button in the remote. seriously!!! It is a product made for girls up to 14 years old. There's no romanticism here, no fantasy, no sense of epic love. It's more an infatuation, a whim, opposites attract with no possibility of a future based in something else than the pale look of both of the main characters.

","Never before have I been tempted to rip off my face and throw it at the TV screen just so I didn't have to watch anymore. Not only was this THE worst Vampire film I have ever seen, but it was also one of the worst films ever. It is quite clearly Vampires for Disney, or rather Vampires for barely pubescent girls. I am actually getting really angry just writing this, for a start forget all the well known Vampire folklore, that goes right out the window. They can walk about in sunlight, crucifixes do nothing, they don't have fangs and they never sleep. They can however run very quickly and also fly without wings. If all that doesn't put you off they don't even kill humans, they just ponce about looking like a load of pasty-faced EMO's (another group the film is clearly aimed at) keeping themselves to themselves. and that is it. for the first hour and a half! then some proper Vampires turn up and they run away, then fight, then run some more, then fight the end. The love story is absolutely pathetic, she's new in town sits next to him in class he seethes, he walks out. she doesn't see him for three weeks, he apologises, saves her from a crash and wham bam they're in love? It's mental. I don't care how hormonal she is. The way she figures out he's a Vampire is so laughable I suggest you watch it on you tube, obviously don't watch the whole film or you may end up dead from boredom, just that scene. Please please please don't watch this awful abomination of a film. Watch The Lost Boys instead."

This movie gives up all character development, plot development, and pacing for about 2 hours of staring into the camera with a perplexed yet upset look on a face, the most fairy-rific game of baseball ever, and about 15 seconds of what was supposed to be a Climactic Battle between good and evil, humanity and monstrosity, base instinct and morality.<br/><br/>On top of all that, it also goes and takes they Vampire mythos, rapes it behind a Hot Topic, throws it some change and tells it to get itself cleaned up, then hops in its Volvo and guns it back to Sillytown. A vampire with no weaknesses is not a vampire, it's a blood-sucking-super-powered demigod. And what would a demigod that has no weaknesses and has apparently been around for centuries (if not millennia) do with their great power? Apparently, move to Washington State, start a family and make sure your kids do well in high school. Vampires need to burst into flame in the daylight, it keeps them in check, sparking gold is not a bad thing. All that would really happen is that a vampire would pretend to be a male stripper and then kill everyone.<br/><br/>And don't tell me ""oh you can rip them apart and burn them!"" because no human can catch, rip apart, and burn a vampire without about 50 other humans getting killed, at which point another vampire shows up and kills the rest.<br/><br/>The plot is illogical, dripping with teenage drama (even though you'd think that at about 100 years old Edward would get over it by now), and all classic storytelling techniques have been thrown out for what sounds like a myspace blog from a Indiana goth teenage girl with psoriasis and a nub that is technically an extra pinky toe.<br/><br/>By the way, this movie would have gotten a better rating if they just had the damn Indians turn into werewolves and kick some ass."

I will explain to you why most people who like vampire movies will hate this movie to death. It goes the complete opposite direction of what anyone would want a decent vampire movie to have. There is pretty much no violence throughout the entire film, instead of being aggressive most of the vampires are friendly, the entire story is just about romance which makes the movie suck even worse. It was like watching the movie Clueless or TV series Degrassi High only no comedy and just strictly the ditzy chick stuff. Now combine that with the TV series True Blood but take out all of the violence and killing, and suspense. What do you get? The worst vampire movie ever made in the history of film making.

There is not one single aspect I can praise, but nothing is so catastrophically bad to be worthy of bashing. An uninteresting tale that desecrates vampire mythos, told in a ludicrous and pathetic way, played by non-charismatic actors who have no chemistry between them and all the while feel as if they are bored. The effects are bad for 2008 and such a big budget, the makeup is ridiculous, to say the least, there is no drama, tension, no emotion at all, and if the film has some subtext and conveys a message, I failed to notice it. It is not boring or tiring to watch, but it is so lame, that in an endless sea of good movies, even in this genre, it is a shame to waste time on it.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Twilight is the answer to the question of how to bring pride and prejudice manners into a modern setting. The source material is Stephane Meyers book filled with Mormon rules and desperate attempts to thwart them. Edward is kinda pathetic in his one dimensional aspect, spending nearly a century learning music from the 1800's and every language on earth, never looking at a girl until the brown eyed and haired clueless and accident prone 'Bella' awkwardly arrives from Arizona like a Emo Kid lacking tattoos. Vampires are always portrayed as stuck in the past, wearing clothes from over a century ago, like your nana. But now they are boring. Rob Patterson was too stiff, and Stewart was too wooden, she seemed more dead and out of touch than the vampires.<br/><br/>Billy Burke did a great job as the dad and Gill Burmingham was awesome as the Indian dad who knows a truth that no one else will believe, I liked his impotent rage stares at the Cullens. The point of stories is the journey, there is no real change or journey here, just teen angst and the push and pull of Paterson's character as he plays with the pretty fire that is so bad for him. Cam Gigandet is decent as the villain and Rachelle Lefevre was good as well, her performance in other movies and tv shows has been very good. But, Seriously Edward couldn't go to school in the next town?<br/><br/>Watch on Netflix don't bother buying this sad excuse of teen romance meets supernatural with a PG rating it's not worth it. Girls may love the self involved overanalysing dialogue, but you can get that in spades on any other rom-com, apart from the baseball game this is a big toilet deposit."

","First off, I am a straight 50 yr old guy with 3 teenage daughters and I liked this movie. Although this dips into several genres and defies the cannon of vampire and werewolf myths, I loved the Beauty and the Beast coupled with the Romeo & Juliet feel. My suspicions as to why there are so many negative reviews is that there just aren't enough deeply emotionally driven stories out there. The crowd has grown soft with eye candy.
This story is mostly about the angst that exists in teens in general and specifically between Edward and Bella. Throwing the whole vampire thing at you and the fact that Bella just moved and is away from her Mom as well as that her Dad is the local Smoky, well, that would complicate the emotional roadmap for anyone.
The awkwardness of Bella is conveyed well and the whole high school feel of girl-guy paradigms seems spot on to me. I do wish that there was more effort to stick closer to at least some of the vampire myths (fangs or some form of grotesqueness, sensitivity to direct sunlight) (no sparkly vampires please) as I think it would have driven home both Edward's concerns for Bella's safety as well as Bella's unshakeable love for Edward not-to-mention it would have tracked better with audiences. Most people don't like their paradigms tested. This movie certainly does that more than most. But I for one was transported back to high school and re-experienced that pleasant pain that is young love."

"i-27025","10","1","4","19 April 2017"," Review: twilight(2008)
","The movie Twilight directed by Catherine Hardwicke is an excellent romance film. It focuses on the development of a personal relationship between human teenager Bella Swan (actress Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward Cullen (actor Robert Pattinson), and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a separate group of hostile vampires. The thrilling plot and the romance between Bella and Edward attracts audience' s attentions and moods. <br/><br/>From the beginning to the end, movie creates a dark atmosphere, links to the name of the movie ""twilight"", also implies there' s something different.Then as the heroine Bella makes an acquaintance with the hero Edward, the more different she finds from him, the closer to the truth the distance is, the deeper love they fall in, and the more violent the conflict is. Vampire, what the hero Edward is. Through the movie we can know Bella hates any cold ,wet things, however, vampires live in this kind of atmosphere all the time,and they are cold.The more Edward loves Bella, the more he doesn't want her be in danger. The more Bella loves Edward, the closer she wants to get to him. This love is charming but dangerous. So it attracts people to watch on. <br/><br/>The strengths of this movie are more than its weakness. In my opinion, the only weakness of this movie is that Bella's actress doesn't have good enough acting skills,it makes heroine Bella not outstanding enough.However,it still attracts people to watch it. As far as I am concerned, there are three reasons. The first reason is that the development of this story is excellent and charming, it makes people desire to know the ending of this dangerous love. Second, the characters are vivid. I love the Cullens, especially Alice, she is lively and cute. When she is playing baseball, I feel that girls should look like her, sunny, lovely and charming. Third and the last, the wonderful background music in the movie makes the movie more emotive. <br/><br/>Finally, use the words of hero and heroine to make a vivid sentence to summarize the movie. The sick and masochistic lion, Edward, falls in love with the stupid lamb, Bella, unconditionally and irrevocably."

But really all of this was copy paste bullcrap because we all now that best twilight fans are those who never watched much of the movies except pg13 and especially twilight like plots..

"toll-8","5","1","4","24 February 2012"," Greta for young girls, not so great for everyone else.
","Everyone has a different take on movies. Some people will think one film is miles better than what someone else thinks of it. Twilight however seems to fall into a different category all together, where most will despise it and anyone female and in their teenage years will absolutely love it. A teenage girl could watch a classic love story, such as Casablanca and find it utterly boring, but with Twilight they are enthralled beyond belief. Now is that the story or the actors? I know the answer to this but it is one hundred percent the wrong choice. The story is by far better than the actors. <br/><br/>This film isn't a great film by any means but the story is slightly intriguing. Bella (Stewart) has moved to her Father's house in a place called Forks, the wettest place on the continent of the U.S. On her first day at her new school she becomes curious towards the pale faced, good looking weirdo in Edward Cullen (Pattinson). From there an infatuation starts from both parties. Throughout the opening half an hour we get lots of smouldering looks in the other ones direction. <br/><br/>As the infatuation continues, Edward beings to warn Bella that he is dangerous and that she should stay well away, but she has already began to fall in love with him and refuses to leave him alone. After spending long periods with each other, Edward feels enough trust to let her into his little secret: he is in fact a vampire. The signs were already in place, he is ghostly white, has shiny eyes and is cold to touch, however sunlight doesn't seem to harm him here and instead makes him glisten like diamonds, which is slightly weird considering people believe vampires to be burnt in sun light. Obviously this is a different type of vampire.<br/><br/>Edward explains that his family are 'vegetarians' and don't eat humans but other vampires out there do, so she must be aware of what she is getting herself into. Her acceptance into his life quickly turns to regret though when a dangerous trio of vampires smell her scent and one makes it his challenge to have her, causing Edward to do all he can to save her.<br/><br/>The story is quite interesting. We usually see vampires as evil creatures and here we get a different take on it, although he does state that in fact he is the 'bad guy'. It is different to see a vampires different kind of struggle. What happens if they fall in love with the creature they intend to eat? It is kind of a mix of Romeo and Juliet with bestiality really. Coming away from something not in tone with the film, it is good to see a different side to a creature we are supposed to be frightened of and how love allows someone to take the risk of getting into a relationship with a vampire. The story is nice but now to the rest.<br/><br/>The dialogue is poor. At times it is worse than poor. It is as if it is lifted straight from a source which is known to be expositional. Film is supposed to be visual and at times the dialogue explains too much. It also can become a little dull where we spend a lot of the time listening to Bella and Edward talking. The dialogue at the beginning of their relationship is slightly laughable and makes you wonder how they even fell for each other. At times as well the film seems to be very set up, like the line of dialogue is telling us that in a minute something is going to happen. In the part of the film when complications should arrive we get Edward look in a direction and state, 'there is a complication'. This is just cringe worthy. It tells us too much. The acting as well is not great. Stewart is possibly better than Pattinson here but it is obvious they were cast on their looks and suitability together as opposed to their acting abilities. They do look good together but it isn't really enough to believe the characters.<br/><br/>To be fair the film isn't the worst. Many completely slate it, which I can understand why, but I don't think it is quite that bad. I did enjoy parts of it, mainly the story side, but some of the filmmaking and acting let it down. By all accounts this is the best one of the entire saga and if that is the case they can only get worse from here.<br/><br/>2.5 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","I read the first book and then watched this movie. Up until about a month ago, I have been bashing the Twilight series. I read the book to give it a try and actually enjoyed. The movie though, is another story. It didn't really give the book justice and Kristen Stewart isn't the greatest actress to have been chosen for the role of Bella. I'm finishing up New Moon and will watch that movie next, but my expectations aren't very high because of the first one. I definitely would recommend the books over the movies. There were a lot of things left out and the movie itself seemed a little disjointed and it seemed to run through everything very quickly. For example, when Bella confronts Edward about him being a vampire, he just accepts that she knows right away and it wasn't very believable. If he were truly hiding his secret for almost 100 years, he wouldn't have just showed her he was a vampire right then and there, he would have been at least a little more guarded."

He sounds a lot like someone we all probably have met, even if at the time of our meeting we did not recognize who he was.<br/><br/>Someone tall, dark, and handsome. Someone who had a mysteriousness about him, having something that compelled us to look on with a fascination.<br/><br/>Who is this one who has intelligence, beauty, and intrigue; and with such, draws us unto himself? In Ezekiel 28, one can see the nature that is ""full of wisdom and perfect in beauty,"" also ""there is no secret they can hide from thee."" Isaiah 14:12-15 speaks of Lucifer, son of the morning.<br/><br/>This wisdom, beauty, and ""mind reading"" sounds a lot like Edward. God created strong, spirit beings who were to be ministers unto man under God's authority. Satan wanted to be as God. He rebelled against God and one-third of the ""stars of heaven"" (angels) followed his rebellion. They were cast to the earth. Revelation 12:7-9 says, ""And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels. And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."" Satan can be seen in the garden of Eden tempting man to rebel against God. It is a subtle tactic he uses, basically saying, didn't God say you could eat of every tree. When Eve says yes, but not of one tree, Satan contradicts God's commandment by telling her ""Ye shall not surely die: (he entices her desire for more than God gave) by also saying, ""For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be a gods, knowing good and evil."" She ate, and her husband with her ate also. All one has to do is look around and see who spoke the truth - man dies. Satan lied.<br/><br/>Who is Edward? In ""Twilight"", Bella is attracted to Edward. If she now has fallen in love with him, will she continue till she is one with him? It reminds me of the battle for mans soul. Satan can manifest himself into beauty. He desires man to worship him, not God; but, at what cost? Jesus said, ""For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"" Matthew 16:26.<br/><br/>The seduction unto darkness is a seduction unto death. Satan has an end, and those who follow him receive as he. ""And the third angel followed them saying, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name."" Revelation 14:9-ll.<br/><br/>Bella may be attracted to one who will love her to death. Man can be attracted to one who promises to love him to death. The person tempted to leave light and walk in darkness may believe the power of darkness will stay with them and empower them to obtain. Yet, as soon as one departs from light and joins to darkness, one is in death. Satan may keep his promise - he loved you (or he stayed with you) until death. He seduced you to death. From the garden until now, Satan is keeping his promise to love man to death.<br/><br/>In the ""Twilight"" I see Bella being loved to death."

I will call Pattinson and Stewart's performances overkill, but Stephanie Meyer's idea is pretty inventive combining paranormal with teenage romance. The story isn't bad either and though it has to wallow through corniness and teenage girl marketing to reach its potential it still is pretty entertaining to watch.

I think you have to be either a woman or about 11 to like this because every boy I know absolutely hates it. This is better than New Moon but I would say that It's not as good as Eclipse.

","The Twilight movie is a great film that based on The Twilight Books. Because it is the first film from the saga, so I really recommended this film especially for teenagers. The Twilight Saga has five parts. Totally it is about love between vampire, human, and werewolf. It has been interested because the girl named Bella that a human want to be a vampire because she love Edward that is a vampire. But Jacob that is a werewolf doesn't want Bella be a vampire. So there will be a battle between Edward and Jacob. Even it is a romantic film, it still has an action part. Action part is shown when the vampires against the werewolf or the other vampires. It has good effect in action part. The actors and the actress are really good. They are good-looking and their act also perfect. Watch this film and follow The Saga, you'll never regret!"
"LucyFoxx","6","1","4","5 May 2011"," Nowhere near the book.
","First of all, I love these books. I honestly loved the story of Bella and Edward, although it is geared more towards preteens and teens. I fell in love with the characters and couldn't put these books down until all the way through Breaking Dawn. Needless to say I was STOKED to see the movie.<br/><br/>This movie was OK, for me. I find that the more I watch it as the years have passed the less I like it. I honestly think it was the lack of direction the actors had and maybe the author wasn't involved enough in the process. It followed the book but in such a strange fashion. The filming was bad, almost like an Indy film. I was pretty disappointed and wish wholeheartedly that it could be redone with a new director and larger budget. It was the BEST book of the series, so it had pretty large shoes to fill. For me, it fell short. <br/><br/>I found Kristen Stewart awkward as the role of Bella. In the book Bella is so shy and naive and really has that sense of a vulnerable teenage girl. You can completely relate to Bella in the books especially when you think back on your first high school boyfriend. But, Kristen Stewart portrayed her as hard and moody and this just wasn't her role. I think she is a wonderful actress, for instance I was in love with her in The Runaways. GREAT role for her......sweet little Bella, not so much.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson, on the other hand, is a fox and does a great job at portraying a creepy, mischievous vampire. The kissing scene was terrible and probably uncomfortable to act out. He wants to, she wants to, he doesn't, she does, then boom he's against the wall. It didn't capture the essence of that moment in the book!!!! <br/><br/>The tree climbing scene was a disaster, almost embarrassing to watch.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick, Billy Burke and Michael Welch were HIGHlarious! Loved them. Truly got the characters roles to a T.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie wasn't where it should have been considering the level of popularity of the book. Word to the next people taking on a popular book and making it a movie: please, interview readers and fans of these books. We love our books and get really upset if you don't live up to expectations! And budget accordingly.<br/><br/>Stephanie Meyer rocks!!!! Love her story of how she started the series."
"MaximumMadness","6","1","4","9 February 2011"," ""Twilight""¬Ö An Objective Review from a 22-year-old male¬Ö It wasn't the train wreck I was expecting¬Ö But it was still flat and uninspired
","About a year ago, I found myself unable to sleep one night, while visiting a relative. In my desperation to occupy the blank void of wasted time, I began searching his Video On-Demand channels¬Ö and there it stood, screaming at me: ""Premier: Twilight on Demand""! I'm not familiar with the books, but I know the basic story- sappy, pouting boy and girl fall in love¬Ö boy turns out to be vampire¬Ö assorted shenanigans ensue. I also know the films are met with very mixed-to-negative reception critically despite their booming popularity to the young female market. So, I had to take a dive into the pool of estrogen and sappy dialog, if for nothing more than to understand why this darned series is so popular, and why I can't swing a dead cat without hitting something ""Twilight"" related.<br/><br/>And my feelings are surprisingly contradictory¬Ö the film was simultaneously better and worse than I had imagined.<br/><br/>""Twilight"" is directed by Catharine Hardwicke, a director whom I have the mixed feelings for, as I felt her film ""Thirteen"" had good intentions, but fell into the trappings of a cheap exploitation flick, and in the end was little more than a feature-length Mtv reality show. And I felt it mainly had to do with amateurish direction on her part, and a lack of focus. So I already had that against ""Twilight""- I assumed the filmmaking would be of just-as-""meh"" a quality as she displayed before. Surprisingly, Hardwicke was, for the most part, a capable director in her handling of the material. Granted, the scenes of suspense and action were poorly done (the climax was rushed and at times it was impossible to see what was going on), and some of the dialog sequences fell flat, but on the whole, I feel she has grown as a visual artist.<br/><br/>The acting was adequate for the leads. Just adequate. On the whole, Robert Pattinson did an OK job as the heartthrob vampiric lead; though he did feel like a creep and a stalker too much- guys who behave like him likely wouldn't get the girl¬Ö It's different seeing it in a movie, but in real life, it's too weird. But then, there's your necessary suspension of disbelief. But Kristin Stewart fell flat as a pancake as the human lead Bella Swan. Boring and at times annoying, Stewart takes awkward to a whole new level in this film. I can't put my finger on it, but she either tried too hard to be an angsty teen, or she just wasn't trying at all. I can't say. Either way, she doesn't work that well.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the secondary characters were generally very well-played. In fact, I'd argue that some of the secondary characters (particularly Carlisle and Esme, Edward's adoptive vampire parents, and his accepting and sweet-hearted adoptive sister Alice) are leaps and bounds beyond Edward or Bella in terms of development. The whole notion of Carlisle and Esme heading a ""vegetarian vampire"" family (they eat animals, not humans) that generally isolates themselves from humans, but respects them as a race and are willing to treat them with kindness and honor¬Ö well, to be honest, it's a lot more compelling than the knock-off Romeo and Juliet tale the film forces down our throats.<br/><br/>Although I will say the romance is not without its charm. A few scenes are loosely entertaining (though much more juvenile than any high-school romance I'd ever seen or been in), some of the exchanges are alright, and on the whole, it works on some level. Let me put it this way- I thought I'd hate the romance, but I actually didn't mind it. In fact, if the script and dialog (I'm not gonna lie, it was soap-opera level at best) were better, it could have been great. But as it stands, it was OK.<br/><br/>This is where the movie exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>Where it failed my expectations are with two factors- 1) The action, which I thought would be redeeming. The previews lent emphasis to the battles and running and kinetic energy¬Ö but this was just a ploy to lure in boyfriends and husbands¬Ö there is maybe three minutes of action in the whole film. And those three minutes were very sloppily done.<br/><br/>And ¬Ö 2) The villain was poorly established (let me rephrase that- NOT established at all) and really didn't lend to the story. He shows up like twice in the whole movie and suddenly just decides to torment our heroes for no reason. It was a glorified sub-plot that should have been cut out during editing for adding nothing to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, it felt like a good 15 minutes could have been cut from the film, as there is certainly an abundance of filler material, which bogged and slowed down the movie- at times painfully. Some of Edward and Bella's scenes went on for far too long. The few scenes the villain gets to establish himself really don't work. There are a few subplots, moments and minor characters that just felt unneeded (Somehow, I don't think the Golden Onion award is gonna come back as an important part of the sequels), and there are just shots that feel like they run about 10 seconds too long. Yes, we get it, young lovers like to look into each other's eyes... we don't need to spend a half hour watching the actors do this, though... it gets boring.<br/><br/>But like I said, on the whole, it wasn't a bad movie. It was misguided and very juvenile, but I think it works for its target audience, and I'd never take it away from them. For me, as a serious, unbiased movie viewer, it is just decent. An average 6 out of 10."

It must be really hard to have to actually smell something you really want to eat, but can't because you love it soooo much.<br/><br/>After this movie was over, I have to admit I wanted to see the next installment (New Moon). Which of course I immediately went to BB to rent it.<br/><br/>I really would of liked to see Bella's father get a more active role in his daughter life.

Like the scene when she wanted to leave Forks. The father didn't fight hard enough for her. I didn't feel she was fair to him at all, but then again she had to be mean to him, that was the only way he was going to survive.<br/><br/>I don't know, I still have a lot of questions I would like to ask, but hey, I'm sure they will be answered in the next two movies."

"thinker1691","6","1","4","23 January 2010"," "" Dying is part of nature, but then I'm a freak of nature ""
","Throughout film history, the story of the Vampire has established a number of historical origins, film adaptations and colorful characters. From the earliest silent Nosferatu in 1922 to this newest addition called "" Twilight "" the Vampire story continues. Here several adaptations are noted to previous blood sucking, night crawling creatures. For instance, they no longer keep to the night, but can walk about during the day. They are no longer flesh tearing, ghouls who patiently wait for a ripe throat to rip open. Indeed, these new young Vampires are interestingly more patient than their predecessors as they now can 'choose' to become vegetarian and stoically drink only animal blood. Furthermore, unlike previous film victims our movie heroine Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is a pro-modern girl, childishly independent, annoyingly self-confident and stubbornly assured. The drawn, pale and undernourished Hero on the other hand, is Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) a physically powerful but emotionally disturbed, family troubled hybrid. Unloved, uncertain yet seeking a lifetime companion, he explains to Bella of his origin from the fangs of Dr. Carlisle Cullen, (Peter Facinelli) the 'family' patriarch and his need for her. This first of the three part story of Twlight as adapted to the silver screen is confusing, hap-hazard, poorly directed and juvenile with an overdose of anemic romance. The acting is pedestrian with child-like cut-outs characters and it's difficult to understand why the settings are so confined. Still, there is some quality to the story, if one believes in compassionate Vampires. Otherwise, we'll have to wait for part two. ***"
"itsmegin","8","1","4","23 November 2009"," Great Adaptation
","realize this post comes a little late, but I resisted the Twilight phenomenon for as long as I could. Partially because I tend to be a bit of a literature snob and didn't want to get involved in such a trendy book series, and partially, because I'm at least 12 years older than the target demographic of the series. But, like Edward, I could only resist temptation for so long, I really wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I ordered the books on Amazon (so I wouldn't have to face the checker at Barnes and Noble judging me for my immature purchase), and started reading.<br/><br/>I finished Twilight quickly, and while my sarcastic side was rolling it's eyes at all the angsty-teenage romance that is like crack for teenage girls, I also had to admit it was a good story, full of suspense and romance. That, along with the fact that it was at about a fifth-grade reading level, meant that I finished the 400-odd page novel very quickly.<br/><br/>Now it was time to get to the movie. It's a shame that I waited so long, because while reading, I wasn't able to envision my own versions of Bella and Edward, but instead had to picture Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, who were well cast, I guess, I just wish I could have judged that for myself. It's one of my favorite parts of watching adaptations-analyzing casting. I was curious how the screenwriters would be able to adapt such a dialogue-heavy, melodramatic book into a movie and keep it dynamic and visually interesting, when the bulk of the book involved Bella and Edward talking to each other in rather boring locations-her bedroom, a meadow, and their cars.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised with how good the adaptation was. First off, a defense of adaptations. No real fan of a novel ever thinks the movie was as good as the book. It's a given. Because no movie can ever get as far inside the character's thoughts and minds as a well-written book. Reading a book is personal, it's just you and the page, you create the story in your mind and therefore feel deeply connected to your version. The mediums are drastically different, and it's important to realize this and judge an adaptation differently, not expecting it to move you in the same ways as the book.<br/><br/>This movie, however, was adapted very well. It changed a few small details, but they only served to make the story more exciting. The book completely lacks conflict during what would be the second act. The two get together so soon and are instantly professing their love. The only conflict is the tension created by ever-present danger that Edward might kill Bella at any moment. But, like Bella, we trust he won't. With nothing else hindering their love, and Edwards super-human abilities making it much easier for them to sneak around and spend time together, they are able to lounge around and bask in the glow of their love endlessly-in the book.<br/><br/>The movie upped the stakes right away, by introducing the danger and the conflict early on. The three evil vampires that show up much too late in the book-causing the central conflict and the exciting climax of that story-are out and about very early in the film. This creates anticipation, a sense of danger, and gives Bella's father something to do besides watch baseball. Most of the endless pillow-talk scenes were shortened, combined, and moved outside, giving the film a dynamic, visually stunning look that the book didn't have, or need. Scenes, revelations, and events were combined, allowing the adaptation to progress quickly enough so that it wouldn't have to be a seven hour saga that it would have been if they had remained completely faithful to the book. These changes did not take anything away from the story but enhanced it, and made it more visually impactful, a better fit for the screen.<br/><br/>Small changes, such as giving Bella the goal of going to the bookstore to find a book on vampire legends in Port Angeles, not just aimlessly wandering, made the scene in which Edward rescues her from the gang of would-be rapists much more interesting, and puts Bella in charge as an active hero. Taking the dinner scenes out of their home and into the diner worked well to show-since the film couldn't tell as the book did-how painfully strained Bella's relationship with her father was, and it gave them a chance to interact with the townspeople so that we could see (rather than be told) how big of a deal it was to have a newcomer in Forks, and how scared everyone was over the ""animal attacks."" Overall I'm quite impressed with the adaptation. Certainly this wasn't the best film ever made, and it's success is due mainly to the popularity of the books, but I always give writers enormous credit for a successful adaptation of a book, and in this case, a very challenging book. If you think adaptation is easy, try writing one, and watch the film Adaptation, to give you a glimpse into how difficult successfully translating one medium into another can be."

","While we saw Twilight being released only this Friday in India, the audience in the Americas, Europe and South East Asia saw its sequel, ‚ÄòThe Twilight Saga: New Moon‚Äô and another sequel is already under production. The first of these, based on the four book series on teenage vampire romance by Stephenie Meyer thrilled teens precisely a year ago in the West. Had they forgotten that Hollywood has a sizeable market here? <br/><br/>Seventeen year old Isabella Swan moves to live with her father in Forks; a town near Washington State's coast after her mother is remarried. Being cute, as most thriller actresses are, many boys eye her. But, she is drawn towards Edward, the lone guy in the mysterious Cullen family teens. Initially Edward seems to detest her, but soon, both get talking. Love blossoms when he saves Bella from a crash with his bare hands.<br/><br/>Curiosity and intrigue draws Bella to Edward whom, she discovers is a vampire. But, he is a vegetarian one, in the sense that he consumes only animal blood! Soon we are introduced his vampire family led by Carlisle Cullen, whom the town knows as a doctor. The Cullen family encounters the nomadic vampires who are keen to snack on Bella, thus bringing us to the climax of the battle between the good & bad vampires.<br/><br/>Though I haven‚Äôt read the book, I felt that key drivers in a vampire romance would be intense passion, some lust blended with thrill seeking teenage innocence as Bella falls for Edward. But, when you see Kristen Stewart and Briton Robert Pattinson, at best, you stop at saying ‚Äòyeah, they are a cute couple‚Äô. With the emotional metamorphosis that leads Bella to Edward completely missing, what‚Äôs left seems liked a rushed up story! <br/><br/>Some of the characters that could have done with more depth are that of the nomadic vampire James who hunts Bella or the hunter‚Äôs consort Victoria. In the end, when you see Victoria watching over the lead couple, the viewer just doesn‚Äôt seem to care since these characters were hardly allowed to develop. Another character that deserves sympathy was Chief Swann, Bella‚Äôs father who almost had nothing to do throughout.<br/><br/>As you sleepwalk through the story, some sporadic moments make it worthwhile. The speedy tree climbing scenes and romance in the meadows are decent. Twilight also highlights another dilemma of a movie maker. Since romances and thrillers are not a natural combination, filmmakers are somehow stuck between the two and deliver the best of neither. The lack of blood and gore helps the romance but loses on thrills.<br/><br/>Although the movie has made more than half a billion dollars globally, including DVD sales, it lacks the spark. The teen romance plus a lot of low light special effects in blue-grey tint messes up on poor script, lack of character development. Maybe, just the scary thought of a lone girl in the company of a family of vampires probably kept the movie ticking. Despite all its misses, I‚Äôd say that you won‚Äôt really regret watching it at home."

But he is very handsome, though (the long-haired boy as well, 4* for that), and that is the only reason why any one should go see a movie. There are many completely unnecessary scenes and characters.<br/><br/>It is a movie missing something that makes you watch it again.

","Okay, first of, the books suck. The sad truth is that Stephenie Meyer, who wrote the books, cannot write, and broke the number one rule when you've write a book: show, don't tell. The books suck ass. Therefore I didn't care to see this movie. That's why I didn't see it in the theaters. When it came out on DVD, I decided to check it out.<br/><br/>Look, it's not as bad as I thought,...but it's still pretty bad.<br/><br/>I can give the film credit for some things. For one things, teenagers are portrayed accurately, the villain, James, is a cool character, and cinematography was interesting. But that's all I can draw from this film.<br/><br/>For one thing, the visual effects are awful. For example, there's a baseball scene in this film, and it so clich√©d and cheesy. The music was also awful. If I wanted to listen to emo music playing, I would've sat down and listened to My Chemical Romance (who suck, I might add).<br/><br/>They take the best character in the whole movie, who isn't even in the film that much, James, and they waste his character and basically give him The Phantom Menace treatment.<br/><br/>Plus every scene in this movie sounds something like this: ""Bella, you shouldn't be around me. I'm a vampire who could suck your blood."" ""But Edward, I wuv you!"" ""Okay, fine. Let's make out."" ""YAY!"" Plus, while on the topic of vampires, THESE ARE NOT VAMPIRES! A vampire has fangs and doesn't sparkle in the sunlight! They ruined vampires, and probably ruin some other horror creatures.<br/><br/>This whole movie is just bad.

Seriously. And yes, every vampire book and movie uses different rules: for example, vampires of folklore and classic literature like Dracula and Carmilla walked in sunlight before 1922 Nosferatu. However, my problem with Twilight is the total lack of entertainment value. Love story between human girl (Kristen Stewart) and vampire boy (Robert Pattinson) is a plain, drab story of teen infatuation, with ugly washed-up colours and pale make-up on boy's face. There is no style, atmosphere or fun. Thereis no romanticism. Visuals are drab every-day life with some supernatural action. Perhaps it worked little better as a novel."
"jonathanruano","7","1","4","31 October 2009"," Twilight -- A Review
","Twilight does not have much of a plot and yet it is a pretty decent film. The main reason why I say this is because the on screen chemistry between Bella Swann (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) is positively electric. Kristen Stewart does a great job as Bella Swan who loves the vampire Edward Cullen to the point of obsession. You can see her feelings for Edward beaming from her face. In fact, everyone of her reactions from beginning to end comes across as wholly sincere. Now some have criticized this film for bad acting, but really if you compared Kristen Stewart's performance to that of Drew Barrymore, Kate Hudson, Tatum O'Neal, and Mandy Moore, Stewart puts all those women in chick flicks to shame. As for Robert Pattinson, he too is brilliant as the socially awkward and troubled Edward Cullen who feels he has a terrible secret to hide. Roger Ebert observed in his review that this film is really a metaphor about a teenager who discovers how hard abstinence is. He is right, but Pattinson's character is more complex than that. Edward Cullen is also ashamed of being a vampire, because society sees vampires as monsters, and he tries repeatedly to appear normal in front of Bella Swan only to fail every time. Cullen is a repressed vampire much in the same way as some people are repressed homosexuals, and Pattinson does a really good job in showing that side of Edward.<br/><br/>Now the film is not perfect. After Bella discovers who Edward is, the film seems to run out of ideas and has to tack on an unnecessary scene with bad-ass vampires at the end. But in its presentation of a love story, this film is unique. I personally have never seen a love story involving thanatophiles before and presented with such sincerity that you can easily take it for the real thing. I was personally curious at one point about whether there was an off-screen romance between Pattison and Stewart (there wasn't). To say that this film is worth watching would be an understatement. Sadly, if the plot could only have been improved, Twilight would have stood a good chance of becoming a masterpiece in addition to a cult favourite (which undoubtedly it has become)."

","Well, I was hearing all this fuss about Twilight so I rented the DVD and watched it with my girlfriend. At first, I wasn't impressed, just another love story with supernatural beings involved. OK.<br/><br/>So I was told it was based on a novel series written by Stephenie Meyer. I decided to read them all before I could compare the movie and book.<br/><br/>I have to tell you guys. The story is intriguing. I won't say it is a masterpiece of writing like usually delivered by the likes of JK Rowling and Stephen King. It's just that everyone (especially teen girls) start dreaming about it and suddenly are drawn to this fantastic universe.<br/><br/>I do have a few cons on my mind. The Bella character was not at all well developed. She just moved to her dad's home because her mother in on the road with her new husband. She meets the Cullens and becomes fascinated with the youngest and everything is history. We never really see her dreams, her goals. Basically only ""Wow, he's so handsome. What? You're a vampire? I don't care.. in fact, I wanna become one as well!!"". That pretty much summarizes the basic plot. <br/><br/>Not to mention Stewart's performance. I had never seen any of her movies before so when I watched Twilight I thought she was pretty good. Her nervous behavior, frowning.. then I read the book and thought ""Wow, she nailed the character!"". Then I watched a few solo interviews of hers and I was amazed that she played the Bella character in real life as well.. basically her mannerisms in the movie are just the same in real life. But it did suit the movie though.<br/><br/>I read they had a tight budget to work on so that explains the unrealistic special effects.<br/><br/>Also, the Edward & Bella thing was a bit rushed to me. There should've been a few more scenes before the sudden confession in the restaurant. It seemed like in one scene they were getting to know each other. Edward desperately trying to stay away from Bella and the human curious about her savior. And then next scene, they decided they were in love.<br/><br/>Anyways, it's the beginning of an epic love story. The next movies will be even better, so don't miss this one."
"JaneYak","7","1","4","6 September 2009"," Edward Cullen and Kristen Stewart
","I watched this film just after reading the books (four books in four days, nonstop) so all the details were very fresh in my head. And I definitely liked the film but something in it disturbed me, I tried to figure out what exactly it was but couldn't. So I watched it again trying not to get engrossed in it; it was not easy but I did it. This is what I got: I've watched a lot of films - book's adaptations- and understood that it's almost impossible to make a perfect script for a 2-hour movie from a several hundred page book. ""Twilight"" film script is far from perfect but frankly speaking I didn't expect it to be perfect. So that definitely wasn't the reason of my annoyance.<br/><br/>I like the whole cast, especially the Cullens family: the protective father of the family Dr.Carlisle, the loving mother Esme, beautiful and furious Rosalie (though I pictured her a little different when reading the book), strong and funny Emmett (more funny in the book ), a little too restrained among humans Jasper, charming Alice and Edward, of course. If Edward had been cast wrong it would've ruined the film. So many thanks to Catherine Hardwicke - as I know there were a lot of actors in the queue for Edward - for her patience and right choice. And kudos to Robert Pattinson for his Edward! I forgot that that was Robert Pattinson playing Edward after a few seconds of his first appearance on screen. I didn't see Robert, I saw Edward with all his emotions - from embarrassment and hunger for Bella's blood to his passion and tenderness for her- on his face. He is really a good actor; it seems he isn't acting , he is living his character's life.<br/><br/>I like the music very much, it creates proper mood from the first notes up to the end.<br/><br/>I don't like the vampires' make-up though. It's really ""half-kabuki half-transvestite"" as Robert described it in some interview (a very pointed description!). But it was not the bright lipstick or the abrupt boundary between the snow-white face and the normal neck of Edward or Carlisle that disturbed me. So what? And suddenly I realized that it was Kristen Stewart's Bella. It WAS NOT Bella from the book. Kristen performed three emotions: boredom, irritation and total absence of any emotions with her mouth open all the time. Where is Bella's love for Edward? I didn't see a single moment when she was almost fainting with love hearing his voice or looking at his eyes. Kristen's Bella is strong (it seemed that it was not her who needed help in the sequence with four scoundrels but them - her voice was absolutely confident and she already started to punch them), she is not awkward (as in the book), always demanding something from Edward, with strange twitch of her face and sounds from her throat (which reminded me of some of her public interviews). So I saw Kristen, not Bella.<br/><br/>I can understand the disappointment of those people who went to the cinema to watch a Vampire film, because it is NOT a vampire film at all, it's a love story with vampires as a part of it. And I like it."
"priyankamutsuddi","8","1","4","5 September 2009"," where's the fun???romance??
","First I watched the movie and then I read the book. When I watched the movie I thought it was not bad. I am a huge fan of Robert Pattinson just like any other girl. So it was nice still I thought Kristen was lousy and their chemistry was not good enough. When I read the book I felt awful about the movie. Its simply a wastage of a really good book. I am not asking for cheesy dialog's from the book but where's the comedy??the romance??the reactions to each others thoughts?? I know you cannot adapt exactly like the book but the essence and the romance of teenage Romeo and Juliet was totally lost. They never looked at each other like they cannot live without each other. They sometimes looked bored. Bella's character in the book was funny, very perspective and intelligent which I never found in the movie. Her shyness and her inner goodness is almost never shown. Kristen Stewart never got to the character, not even close. Edward's character is more romantic and deadly. The rest of the vampires and Jacob's characters where really cool. Alice, Jasper, Emmet(who was suppose to be more funny), Rosalie(more beautiful), esme and Carlisle were really not bad. The romance was totally missing between Kristen and Robert. I don't know about their personal life but they should show some beauty in their love on screen. The new moon movie looks better mainly due to direction. I hope they finally get closer to the characters. But the twilight book will always be wasted which is unfortunate because reading the book I felt such a beautiful movie could have been made out of the book. The first book adaptation was very important because they should have tried to show that Bella was sent for Edward who have been in existence for a century. Both the characters should have been more matured especially Edward and the love story should have been irrational. I will always think that what an opportunity was missed. Its a very good book but the movie won't be remembered like that."
"MrGKB","5","1","4","27 August 2009"," Oh, boy! Another horrendous franchise in the making!...
","Do please color me bemused and uninterested. ""Twilight,"" adapted (from the first volume of an immensely popular series of fantasy romance novels aimed at tween- and teenaged girls) by Melissa ""Dexter"" Rosenberg, a dance major turned writer/producer, and directed by Catherine ""Thirteen"" Hardwicke, was a remarkably successful seat-filler last year ($190mil+ on a budget of $35mil+) that's about as bloodless and fangless as the ""vegetarian"" vampire our self-involved little heroine falls for. I realize I'm not a member of the film's target audience, but there it was at my local library, free as free can be, so I thought I'd give it a shot and see what all the lucrative fuss was about.<br/><br/>Not much.<br/><br/>As a romance, ""Twilight"" is tepid at best. Other than staring at each other with a variety of expressions that range from constipated to toothlessly suggestive, the leads have no apparent chemistry (and this despite their apparent off-screen relationship). Their motivations are an amorphous murk. Other than his James Dean-ish good looks and funky eyeballs, what is it she sees in this icy-cold oaf? Did she really enjoy kissing refrigerated lips? And why is this inhuman Dorian Grey so taken with a simpleton teenager? What, simply because he can't read her mind? I suppose this is all silliness that only a teenaged girl can understand; I sure don't. Give me Romeo and Juliet any day; heck, if you want vampire romance, give me ""Near Dark"" or ""Once Bitten,"" or even ""Fright Night."" Beyond that, Kristen ""Panic Room"" Stewart is still an appealing young actress, and I'll watch about anything she's in, even if she hasn't refined her ability to choose prime roles yet. I can't say the same for Robert ""Harry Potter..."" Pattinson, who left me as cold as his ostensible character; right now he's one of those actors who makes you think, ""The lights are on, but nobody's home."" The production values were fine, Eliot ""Vamp"" Davis' camera-wrangling was good, if at times a bit too music video-ish, the art direction and so on and so forth, all good for a multi-million dollar picture, but in the end...? In the end, it's all for nothing, because the story is tedious drivel, most of the characters cardboard cut-outs, the entire conceptual framework unconvincing (sparkly vampires that run around during the day?)...in an oft-repeated phrase of mine: think Sturgeon's Revelation. ""Twilight"" is junk food disguised with an artful salad, empty calories that provide no nourishment whatsoever.<br/><br/>I can only imagine what deviant impulses have led the older males on this site to rate this thing higher than their younger cohorts (unsurprisingly, the females are just the opposite). Edit: this has now changed, presumably due to video distribution; interesting.<br/><br/>You can bet I'll be avoiding the inevitable sequel(s), and unless you're an adolescent female, I'm betting you will be, too."
"rdavstar1","8","1","4","22 August 2009"," Finally saw Twilight
","I work with young teens all day long and heard about Twilight,the book and the movie. I thought I'd better rent the DVD so I can at least talk with the kids as they eagerly mention the movie now and then, and some, even having ""Twilight"" tattooed on their lower backs. I don't have time to really sit down and read thick books like Twilight, so I had an open mind when I watched it last night. It was a nice, romantic teen story; vampires, for decades, have always intrigued people both young and old. The acting was dramatic and good, and the scenery, though gloomy, very picturesque. I can see why young adults would have liked this story; very romantic for those young at heart. I work with young teen girls every day with Bella's character, very sad, dark, gloomy, distant --- such stresses is their young lives --- so that character was pretty much right on target for kids to ""relate"". People of my ""middle age-ness"" have seen so many movies like this before, so to me it was ""just another one"", but for the age group it was meant for, I clearly can see why this story and movie was such a hit."
"EireLavinia","8","1","4","20 August 2009"," Despite it's flaws strangely mesmerizing
","Strictly speaking, this is not a great movie. Being new to the Twilight series, I found the film to lack good dialogue and character development. I have read that there isn't much dialogue in the book, but if that's the case they needed a better writer to come up with some dialogue or really phenomenal actors to carry the story with bare dialogue. Robert Pattinson's ""Edward"" was really good and I think carried the film. I could see how he would be eerily attractive: beautiful, a gentleman from another time, he's developed skills and interests (such as being a pianist) over the years that most don't have the opportunity to, he has the perspective and wisdom of age yet has kept a sort of naivety to him. Kristen Thomas's ""Bella"" on the other hand, was far too expressionless. I spent half the movie trying to figure out what on earth Edward saw in her. She was always vaguely pensive and overall uninteresting. It was rather unbelievable that her classmates would have liked her so much, she really wasn't at all nice to them. I understand for the purpose of the story, she is Edward's true love, the mate he's been waiting 100 years or so for; a wonderful premise for the love story but it was not fleshed out enough in the film to be satisfying. Rather than dwelling on their relationship development, we basically get 1 montage scene to music and 1 with dialogue. It felt cheapened as if the scent of her blood was the only thing drawing him to her; the science lab scene comes to mind, which alludes to an almost feral lust he has for her rather than the drawing of a soulmate.<br/><br/>I also really would have liked to see more character development of the Cullens. I haven't read the books, but I understand that some of the Cullens are pretty big characters; however from just seeing the movie, I honestly don't remember most of their names. It's too bad because there's a lot of room for these interesting characters. They could've really cut back on Bella's gloomy moping which wasn't very believable and instead given more time to character development. In other words: shortened the first half of the film seeing as we all know going in that the Cullens are vampires and it's merely Bella who is discovering it; there really wasn't much tension built in the first half. There could've been if Bella had been a stronger character, but it just wasn't there.<br/><br/>In spite of all these issues, I found the film enjoyable. I think it really captures our innate desire for true love and immortality. I am definitely looking forward to seeing ""New Moon"", with the hopes that I'll get to know the characters better. It is a bit worrisome to think of all the teen girls taking cues from Bella's behavior (deceiving her father, going with the seeming ""bad boy""), as it really wouldn't play out as smoothly in real life as it did in the movie (I know from my own teenage experiences). One would hope that the girls would have enough sense to realize it is fantasy and not stay with a boy who seems dangerous or mysterious (such as one who does drugs), but lacks the care and maturity of Edward. However, as a married woman in my mid-20's I found the movie compelling enough to suspend my belief and enter the sparkling world of Twilight.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt after watching it like I would feel had I only read the introduction to a book. It merely whetted my taste and I get the feeling that after I read the books I will feel much more satisfied with the story."
"drlinck1985","7","1","4","17 August 2009"," Its OK movie not bad
","Hello all you movie buffs out in cyber land. I have seen crap load of movie, like movies based on books, TV shows, comic books, etc... When I heard about Twilight I never actually read any of the four books in the series, I heard they were really good books to read. So I went into the Twilight movie blinded, in my opinion it was a pretty OK movie. I has some great characters & the story sets up well, but the movie kind of starts off slow & picks up midway through the movie. So if you like a good story about Vampires & a good love story this movie is for you, but if you like your movies with more action & a faster rhythm then this isn't your kind of movie I also recommend you read the books first."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","1","4","25 July 2009"," I see what all the fuss is about, but the movie doesn't execute it well
","I come from the group that has never read the Stephenie Meyer books and knew little about them other than the general idea of love and vampires and such. I had put off watching ""Twilight"" based on reviews, what I heard and my gender, but finally -- nearly a year later -- gave in to my curiosity over what the craze is all about.<br/><br/>Now, I understand it. I don't like it, but I understand it. ""Twilight"" and the book its based on is romance -- melodramatic dialogue-filled romance about dangerous/forbidden love, something that's been a major literary force for centuries. Combine that with human infatuation with vampires and there's perfect reason for ""Twilight"" to be a success.<br/><br/>That said, the storytelling of ""Twilight"" is not all that good, speaking about the film at least (still haven't read the book). Bella (Kristen Stewart), moves from Arizona to the Pacific Northwest to live with her dad. At her new school, she develops a quick crush on the mysterious Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a pasty-faced TD&H beaux from a family that is equally strange and equally as covered in distracting pale make-up. Bella, however, is a little odd herself. For reasons we never totally understand, she's drawn to him and willing to trust him a bit quickly as she discovers he's not exactly human. Edward, however, is much the same. The on-screen chemistry of Stewart and Pattinson gets an A, but the chemistry of their characters in the story gets an F for fake.<br/><br/>Once things get rolling and we get over the fact that we don't fully understand why they're suddenly in love with each other, ""Twilight"" becomes more interesting. Until then, however, it's all sorts of awful. Never mind the low-budget visual effects and shoddy stunt work that look like something I've seen on the WB -- that's a whole other issue. <br/><br/>The problem is there's no source of antagonism in the story for the first hour and change. Edward keeps telling Bella she should stay away from him and be scared of him and Bella wants to know why. Then she figures it out and he tries to scare her off some more. The conflict is inner tension entirely. People's thoughts only make for good conflict in books -- it doesn't translate onto the screen the same way. Melissa Rosenberg, who wrote a few episodes of hit teen show ""The O.C."" and the dance flick ""Step Up,"" doesn't seem to have generated any creative ideas to make this story work more visually. I can't speak for her adaption of the source material, but I can rightfully say the movie is not inspiring or captivating until an external force (a few bad vampires) enter the picture.<br/><br/>So ""Twilight"" has to sell hard on romance, which is what it's all about anyway. This is the specialty of director Catherine Hardwicke, who directed the intriguing teen drama ""Thirteen."" The intimate scenes between Edward and Bella, which are supposed to have a tentative, awkward feeling to them given the nature of their relationship, is really felt in her work. She's definitely keen on the whole connection between vampires and sensuality. Stewart and Pattinson are both great selections for the film. Both weren't just lucky casting choices -- they have definite careers ahead of them.<br/><br/>What the movie needed to actually be entertaining to a bigger audience is a director with a better sense of action and suspense. Edward climbs a fair amount of trees with Bella on his back and it's more reminiscent of Brendan Frasier in ""George of the Jungle"" than anything released in today's visual effects era. <br/><br/>""Twilight"" ultimately takes too much time establishing itself and the rules of its world, not showing them to us quickly in creative visual ways that give us a sense of the fantasy we think we ought to be enjoying. It's like the ""Mad Max"" films with Mel Gibson: the first film ends just as it gets interesting and the second film is the one most fondly remembered. You only get a sense by the end of the film what the ""Twilight"" world is all about. I imagine ""New Moon,"" the second installment, will be somewhat better by this same concept (and also with a fantasy-grounded director in Chris Weitz). Problem is, ""Twilight"" didn't convince me any future films will be better enough.<br/><br/>~Steven C - Visit my site at http://moviemusereview.blogspot.com"
"tomdude0","4","1","4","24 July 2009"," Doesn't deserve a PG-13 rating
","First off, this film does not deserve a PG-13 rating. It is rated PG-13 for ""some violence and a scene of sensuality"". Well, in the whole film, there's really only about ten minutes of ""violence"". And the sensuality, it's not at a PG-13 level. This film could have been fit into a PG rating, but nooooo. It was rated PG-13. I think that the only reason it was rated PG-13 was because the book was a young adult book and they decided to rate it according to the targeted audience for the book. This movie is a PG level movie.<br/><br/>I read the book just for the heck of it, I can't say that I loved it, but it was much better than the movie. The movie was mostly talking, talking, talking, ooh-aah, kiss scene, talking, talking, talking, WOOT FIGHT SCENE, talking, talking, talking, happy ending, the end. If you haven't seen this movie, I pretty much just summarized it for you.<br/><br/>The dialogue needed a lot of improvement, whoever wrote the lines for the characters seriously needs some writing lessons, and the lines from Edward was like he was from a different era.<br/><br/>Overall, this film needs a lot of improvement, if the sequel is not better than I might just start to lose it."
"The_Imaginary_Friend","6","1","4","24 July 2009"," Mediocre
","It seems the entire population of Twilight viewers have either an unhealthy obsession , or have chosen to reject it and start anti-Twilight discussions. But really, Twilight is not worthy of either of those things. <br/><br/>Twilight is a decent, tolerable film, however, whatever charm the book possessed that made it so interesting has been lost during the making of this film. The biggest problem with Twilight is the character, Bella. The initial character had about as much emotional depth as a teaspoon; she was barely even a character, more so a mate created to love Edward. Nevertheless, with her narration in the books, we are forced to relate to her to a certain extent. Whatever personality she may have had was completely pulverized by Kirsten Stewart. Bella is so unenthusiastic and uninteresting, we have to wonder if she even has a brain, or why her classmates want so badly to be her friend. She expresses very little emotion, and comes across and as careless and conceited. Her lack of character provides an opportunity for the infatuated girl audiences to see themselves as Bella to satisfy their fantasies of having the 'prefect man' (Edward).<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson was a likable Edward. He took his own turn with the role, and came out with a quirky, almost awkward character. Despite some of his painfully cheesy lines, he did well. However, the couple's supposed ""love"" for each other is shallow, and not quite believable.<br/><br/>There are a few touching moments between Bella and her father, and a few laughable moments as well. And as far as the directing goes, the film was beautifully shot. All of this combined with some cheesy dialog an poor special effects creates a somewhat enjoyable, yet forgettable, mediocre film."

The characters of Charlie Swan, Mike Newton, Alice (bone structure people!), Rose, Edward and numerous others don't fit the descriptions in the books. Close as human kind might get perhaps but still disappointing. <br/><br/>Why all the dark clothes? The Cullen's were known for light clothes in a dark environment. Didn't the production team read the book?<br/><br/>Most importantly - Where is the meadow scene? Where is that beautiful, sensual scene sitting in the meadow full of flowers in the sunshine?

"aujamustafa2000","6","1","4","25 June 2009"," Not quite satisfied
","I will start off by saying that I am a HUGE Twilight book fan. I went to see this movie with an open mind and I'll say that I didn't mind the fact that they changed the plot a bit. In fact I could see why some of the changes were better suited for a movie-version. I was however quite disappointed with a few things. First, the movie didn't seem to have much flow. It was edited in a way that made the movie feel like disconnected scenes stuck side by side. Much of the dialogue was extremely awkward, they could've taken the conversations straight from the book and gotten a much better result. Also, I find Kristen Stuart didn't do a very good job as an actress. The way she talks seems too awkward and unnatural and often made me doubt how pure their love was. Bella is supposed to be insightful, smart, mature and likable not a robotic completely disconnected person. Apparently, Kristen's age (she was 17 at the time) made filming a bit of a kerfuffle as she could only work a certain amount of hours a day. A proper solution to this could've been getting a qualified actress over 18, but hey, we could also waste endless amounts of money on rebuilding parts of set in the middle of the woods to save time, as they chose to do. :O <br/><br/>After seeing the movie, I bought a book explaining the making of the movie. It seems to me that the makers of the movie spent WAY too much time, effort and money working on backstories that in the end made no difference for the viewers and far too little time on the actual screenplay and editing. It also seems like they didn't read the book well enough (if at all) because in this book they mention getting ""brilliant ideas"" that are actually in the book to begin with. (example: the unbelievable idea that Edward has no bed). I also find that they do things that are out of character. (Like Edward taking Bella high up into the trees and letting her climb on her own, although I forgave that as it was one of the more pleasing scenes of the film). I also wish Edward had spoken more old-fashioned English. It gives him a certain charm that I found was lacking in the film.<br/><br/>One part of the movie was so pathetic it made me cringe: When Bella confronts Edward about him being a vampire and he suddenly says something like ""You need to see me for what I truly am"" and whisks her up the mountain to show himself sparkling. It was ridiculous. It's just another example of how the makers misunderstood the book (or failed to interpret) <br/><br/>Other than Bella, the casting was pretty good. I was a little surprised when I saw Jacob, he seemed a bit too pretty for the part but I feel he'll grow on me. Robert Pattinson did a great job and essentially made this movie. I just hope that the next one is better written and that Kristen has had time to develop as an actress and learn another facial expression and tone (as she seems to only have one of each). Hopefully the crew has made enough backstories to last the next movie 'cos it would be nice if there was some budget left for editing.<br/><br/>One thought as I go, I noticed that they always had the vampires biting their victims necks. I had never really envisioned it like that. I found it a bit clich√© as it's never mentioned in the books. To each his own I guess."
"LinkGoku","4","1","4","19 June 2009"," romantic nothing more nothing less
","well first of all i haven't read the book but i thought that this was a very slow movie, the acting was fantastic and romance brewed but the vampiranism was lost, the movie is supposed to be about a vampire and a mortal falling in love, but the movie seemed more like a movie about two high schoolers falling in love just with a little more power, the movie was not at all what i expected and i was severely disappointed, though Kristen Stewart, and Robert Pattonsen were spectacular they just weren't given enough too work with and it was a utter failure, so after summarizing the great acting with the slow blah script i have come up with a rating of 4/10 (though i still want to read the book)"

","Twilight is based on the books by author Stephenie Meyer, about a teenage girl that risks everything when she falls in love with a vampire. This movie has received a massive amount of hype and has quickly formed a cult like following. Being a big time Buffy and Angel fan, it is hard to not see the similarities between this movie and the TV series, minus a vampire slayer of course. One of the things that always drew me to the Buffy TV series, was their ability to still take a comedic approach at the vampire scenario. Whereas this movie was so serious at times and seemed to change the 'rules' when it comes to vampires (such as allowing them to stand in daylight and instead of burning into flames, their skin becomes diamond-like which seems odd?). I am probably just being picky, but it really didn't do much for me and just seemed like another 'teenage high school romance/drama' story. Having said all of this, I can see how this would appeal to so many (plus I haven't actually read the books) so feel free to make up your own mind. It still was entertaining enough, I suppose I am just surprised by the level of hype surrounding this film. My Rating: 6/10"

","When Twilight was released last year i made a point of avoiding it. The marketing leading up to it being released seemed solely aimed at teenagers girls and that demographic could not be further away from me. So after all the hype had died down i decided to see what all the kids were getting so excited about and do you know what? <br/><br/>I loved it! <br/><br/>Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen , a boy unlike any she's ever met. <br/><br/>Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands ‚Äî and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood; Edward and his family are unique among vampires in their lifestyle choice. <br/><br/>To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for ‚Äî a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. But what will Edward and Bella do when James , Laurent and Victoria , the Cullens' mortal vampire enemies, come to town, looking for her? <br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the books written Stephenie Meyer so apart from knowing this was a vampire/love story i didn't really know what to expect from this film. Firstly let me say that visually , Twilight is stunning. The subtle colours and special affects are fantastic. Director Catherine Hardwicke understanding that ""less is more"" makes this film a delight to watch. They could so easily have got a Michale Bay style director to make this film and thank god they didn't. <br/><br/>It's the first time i have come across Robert Pattinson who plays Edward Cullen . I was very impressed with his screen presence and I'm looking forward to seeing future projects from him. Kristen Stewart is good too , although the performance from Pattinson overshadows hers by some margin.<br/><br/>I loved the way the relationship between the two develops and the fact that he's want desperately for her to stay human and live a normal,fulfilling life , makes this different from other vampire movies. <br/><br/>The only criticism i have of Twilight is over the top School Kids. Every one apart from Bella and Edward are so Happy , and nice and over excited that they look like they have walked of the set of a new sickly modern Brady Bunch.<br/><br/>I never remembered school being like that.<br/><br/>Twilight was a pleasant surprise and delight to watch yet it's still not the best Vampire film i have seen this year and that goes to "" let the right one in"",although this does have quite a few of the same qualities as that film. <br/><br/>This film cost 37 million Dollars to make and took in 351 million Dollars at the box office. Twilight is already a phenomenon.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next film "" New Moon"" and this time i wont wait so long to see it.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

It wasn't until after I actually saw the film that I found out girls like it, Whatever I think it's awesome. many films have tried to show vampires live in the normal world but usually they never get past the Bram Stoker vampire. This actually had a good reason they live such odd lives. <br/><br/>I like the idea of a vampire romance, the idea that someone willingly chooses to become the undead, that someone falls so in love with another that they would follow the person into hell just to be with them.... If that's not love I don't know what is.....<br/><br/>The plot I thought was good, the action when it came up was quick and there really wasn't much blood. The strongest point of the film is the characters.... Once introduced you instantly knew who was good and who wasn't and there was those few that you weren't quite so sure of until they showed you who they were under fire. <br/><br/>The other thing I liked about this film was it's location, Washington State. I was there when I was a kid but vaguely remember it, I remember it rained a lot, I remember it was very green with trees but not much else so it was nice seeing Washington in a film."

","Twilight begins with 17 year old Bella, moving to Forks, a small town located in north western USA. She finds herself captivated by the handsome Edward and soon discovering that he and his family are vampires. So it sounds awfully like it's aimed at teenage girls. That's because it is. However the on screen romance between the films two central characters, Bella and Edward, plays out with such tender affection and excellent pacing, that issues of age and gender soon become irrelevant. While at times Robert Pattison (Edward) is unable to give weight to thirst for Bella's blood that his character is constantly fighting against, his performance is on the whole utterly convincing. The delicate portrayal of Bella, by Kristen Stewart is equally solid and believable. Unfortunately her efforts are often undermined by the film-makers frequent use of ex positional voice over.<br/><br/>With an on screen chemistry that goes deeper than your typical sexually charged teen movie, while not too challenging, is refreshing. And director Catherine Hardwicke does well not to rely too heavily on emotional investment from the audience to drive the plot forward. Introducing a trio of some not so wholesome day walkers from the films open shot, a firmly rooted undertone of threat spans the entire film.<br/><br/>Even if you see Twilight seeking tradition horror, to be disappointed by Meyer's rather refreshing revamp of the vampire mythology; the picturesque landscapes beautifully depicted throughout are an undeniably enjoyable cinematic experience. Ultimately Twilight is a very faithful and well composed adaptation of a highly successful book."

","I rented this after being told I would like it. It had a teeny bopper theme and that was weird being that I'm 36. Once the film plot rolled in, I was into it. Finally a vampire said something no other vampire has ever said. ""You are supposed to be drawn to me and supposed to want to come closer."" Was it improv or script? Seattle was a good location for this. That tragedy-tied romance hinted by rain and gray put the film in it's place. I wasn't doing back flips and cartwheels after seeing it, but it had a romantic laid back feeling that carried me into the eve. This was also my first vampire film where there wasn't a lot of guns and running. It was almost like a soap opera. I'll be hearing about 2 and waiting in line with my 54 year old friend and 100 screaming goth chicks for the next one."
"witster18","7","1","4","29 May 2009"," not a lover and not a hater... my thoughts below
","First of all - I was stuck between 6 and 7 here but I liked the film better than its' present 6.1 rating so I'm going with 7. <br/><br/>We'll start with the good.... The Cinematography is first rate. Not only does the film succeed with it's locales and it's stunning scenery but there is a sense of style and originality in the filming. Haze. Clarity versus Blur. The dark Blue tone of everything. It's as if a Blue Moon is cast over the entire film only much of the film is shot in daylight.<br/><br/>That's another thing that I really liked about this one. Twilight is a departure from some of the usual Vampire fare in that it bends the rules of vampirism just enough to make it interesting but not enough to completely separate it from the genre as a whole. <br/><br/>I think the love story has substance and the fact that it's optimistic is yet another twist on the usual vampire fare. The leads do a spectacular job of selling the love story and treading the water between human and daywalker. I loved the fact that the movie stayed true to other vampire films in it's portrayal of the thirst for blood but still allowed the lead male to put love before hunger.<br/><br/>All in all the cast did a fine job... not spectacular... but fine.<br/><br/>the bad.... and there really isn't much here to speak of... we could have used a little more 'horror'. I think that was the product of the films' pg13 rating... but it certainly seems as if they could have piled a little more scary moments into the film. <br/><br/>the story is a bit shallow and the ending leaves the door a little too wide open... not finishing the story and basically stamping the fact that there is an inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have heard some crazy music... I loved the ""Muse"" they threw in there but would've also liked to have heard some NIN or something else with a little kick.<br/><br/>This is a good movie. Not Great. But Good. If a substantial storyline and plot is your bag then you might want to opt out. If you appreciate cinematography and enjoy the vampire genre on the whole - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Maybe not worthy of the hype but certainly a decent effort. Worth a second view and I will catch the sequel.<br/><br/>67/100 or 3.5/5<br/><br/>You'll like it if you liked: Near Dark, Ginger Snaps, The Bride, The Faculty, and Interview With a Vampire."
"www-rabid-duck","6","1","4","22 May 2009"," Love it but oops! we forgot to act!
","I just want to say that i love this film but from a critical point of view here is my opinion. I have never read the twilight saga and to be perfectly honest with you this movie was the first time i had ever, even heard of it! I enjoy watching it however i find it difficult to at the same time. It gets exciting more so towards the ending when it should have made the audience have a rush of adrenaline throughout (not including love/emotional scenes). The acting in it seemed effortless and wooden, the characters acted like they didn't have a background as if they had no personality apart from some exceptions mainly Alice who is one of my favourite characters. I personally feel however that if it weren't for Robert Pattinson being in the film i would have found it slightly unbearable to watch. I am afraid to say that just him being so sexy made it more interesting which seemed to make up for the lack of acting! Overall quite an enjoyable movie, had humorous parts, emotional parts, action parts it is just the gap between them was too big."
"jaystreet12","5","1","4","17 May 2009"," what in the world
","i find movies like this to be really stupid for a couple of reasons. reason one, it was about one girl who was lonely and needed a friend. reason two, the vampire didn't even have the traits of a real vampire. the vampires in this movie don't have wings or super strength or feeding frenzies on humans. reason three, robert pattison is a terrible actor for this part. throughout the movie he talks in a low voice close to a whisper.reason four, the storyline didn't make sense. i don't think that wolves would make deals with vampires to not expose their secret. i also think that the ending was really gay. one vampire remaining? what in the world were they thinking. the vampire that is left is a woman for Christ sake. also, the fight scene was really stupid two. there was only about 5 minutes of action throughout the whole movie. the rest was just gay romance. if they make a sequel you can be sure that i will blow my head off."
"aleexx_1920","6","1","4","14 May 2009"," twilight.......
","OK so I finally saw twilight on DVD last night and I can tell you that it was an Okay adaption of the book.But I gotta say I had more problems with the movie than good.<br/><br/>1) MY first problem was the first time Bella met Edward in the lab, where she sat next to him and he's making these funny faces and covering his nose, I mean is Bella really pose to fall in love with this guy practically insulting her, I mean in real a person doing that you would more look at him as a jerk.<br/><br/>2) My second was that Edward is basically in the movie forcing his way to talk to Bella and then he says something like ""we can't be friends"" and then he walks away from her and Bella was like OK we were never really friends we just talk normal like everybody else. So Bella doesn't really take it on and the next day he approaches her again and is like hey we should talk , is like he's stalking her or something, it was just funny the way he did it in the film.<br/><br/>3) When Bella confronted Edward on being this vampire, that whole scene drag for me, I mean its like OK we get your ah vampire how many things does he have to prove he is, he's lifting up branches and flying all over the place and the girl already said she's fine with it.<br/><br/>4) Probably my final problem was the story beside the love story, where there's a bad vampire that we don't really know where he came from and he wants Bella and Edward is gonna do is best and protect her he quoted ""you are my life babes"", alright it was ah nice touch other than the love story however they really never explain the consequences of Bella and Edward relationship, i mean he is immortal and she's not so he doesn't age but she will, how will that work out between them, she could move on to college while he stays back and lives forever and moves on to another 17 yr old girl which he falls in love with. Bella in the movie never even asked the guy well in you 100 years of living how many girls have you dating, seduce or fall in love with.<br/><br/>So those are my overall problems, I may have more but I'm enjoy watching the movie home instead in the cinema, however i kinda interested in new moon because it should be updated, the movie made millions on its average bud-jet so new moon should have better effects and stuff. I have to compare this movie though with another love story um that is ""A walk to remember"" now i don't like Mandy Moore that much but A walk to remember is ah much better love story than twilight, both movies have similarities, A walk to remember features an awkward teen girl and a douche bag guy and yet their both likable and the relationship is endearing and i just didn't feel that way about twilight as i was hoping for.<br/><br/>To the people who love twilight and hasn't seen A walk to remember i recommend you watch that movie, you might like it as much as twilight."
"GodsPrototype","4","1","4","23 April 2009"," It's just not for adults...
","Before seeing this film know that it is solely aimed at teenagers who have probably never seen a decent Vampire flick and runs more as a Romantic love story in the vain of Romeo & Juliet. Will come to be known as the Vampire Love Story¬Öfor children.<br/><br/>But it doesn't distract from the beauty of the film as the cinematography is very good and the scenes in the forest look beautiful and are well shot. There are some things for adults to enjoy but throughout the film you will be looking at certain scenes thinking to yourself that if I'd seen Twilight at the age of 15 I would have loved it.<br/><br/>Now I've never read the books but I never read the Harry Potter books and I quite enjoy the Potter franchise so not having read the book should not mean that I am not in a position to review the film because it is a movie and movies will always differ from books due to the nature of moving pictures.<br/><br/>This will probably grow into a big series but will never be as big as the Harry Potter films that are more universally aimed at a wider range of age groups. A sequel to Twilight is due to be released at the end of 2009 and will no doubt be just as big.<br/><br/>The two main actors, Stewart & Pattinson perform their parts very well and should receive much praise for their acting abilities. They carry the film in more ways than can be expected of two young actors. It is the blossoming romance and progressive love story that is the basis of the film and the Vampire aspect just adds a bit of bite to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Now it is a Vampire film so were the Vampires any good¬Öwell¬Öno not really. To a 15yo school girl they could be the best Vampires ever but for those who have seen many films incorporating Vampires they really are not that good and a bit cheesy and comical. Just to note, the main bad guy is embarrassingly bad and cringe worthy.<br/><br/>The special effects with the Vampire fight sequences are not very good and they move too fast in a kind of shimmering effect shift move that is not appealing to the eyes and looks kind of amateurish.<br/><br/>Hopefully the people that enjoy this film will use this as a basis to move onto films like the 'Lost Boys', 'Near Dark' & '30 Days of Night'. If you liked 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' then there is a chance you would like this but don't expect any of the witty, funny and bombastic scenes that you got in that series.<br/><br/>Overall a decent film that will no doubt be enjoyed more by people of the younger generations and the Love story aspect of the film is the main reason it sticks together in a kind of High-School sugary kind of way. But don't expect a good Vampire flick for that is not what it is."
"PrettyOddd","4","1","4","19 April 2009"," A let down - even with the lowest of expectations...
","I'll admit I'm an avid Twilight series reader, though I went into the theater with a fully opened mind. I tried to keep my expectations quite low and just looked at the movie adaptation as what it was - a movie. Such a poorly adapted low-budget film.<br/><br/>People can argue that the reason this movie was such a poor adaptation of the novel was because of a low-budget or because of the different perspectives of what people are hoping to see. But all in all, down to the core, a movie isn't all about the scenery, the costumes, the props or the lighting and such. It relies on acting abilities. If two actors are completely submerged in their characters, know the script, and have a bit of chemistry, they can put on at least an 8 out of 10 star performance, without anything but themselves. I've seen such within my own drama department and I believed that two talented actors could do the same.<br/><br/>When I first heard Kristen Stewart was playing Bella Swan I was mildly ecstatic. I felt that she was an amazing actress and she stood out in my mind, regardless of the fact that I'd seen her in very few movies. I also felt she looked the part. A picture perfect Bella to the eye. But seeing Kristen Stewart in motion as Bella did not quite cut it. For one, Kristen was EXTREMELY annoying and got on my last nerve with her constant blinking. Throughout the majority of the scenes she was nervously batting her eyelashes. But although her constant habit set me off a little, I tried to endure her as not only an actress, but as Bella. And I just couldn't fully believe her. Before filming, Kristen seemed as though she'd be able to play Bella and withhold all of her qualities, add in the fact that she's a serious actress. But I felt she couldn't hold it together and all of the little things that made Bella as Bella were lost completely, especially Bella's sarcasm.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson fell terribly short as Edward Cullen within the first hour or so of the movie. By far his best scenes were towards the middle of the movie, closest to the end. He was a more believable Edward than Kristen was a believable Bella - which would surprise most seeing as everyone was unsure of Robert as well as having that impending sense of fear that no one could possibly portray the perfection that Edward Cullen accentuates.<br/><br/>I felt Catherine Hardwick was one of the worst directors to take on this film adaptation that so many were anxious to see. This film from afar was a wonderful film and had the highest box-office and DVD sales - but that was all because of the title, ""Twilight"", that Stephenie Meyer had made so famous with her genuinely stunning book series. A brooding forbidden love, that I fell in love upon reading it within the first month it hit the shelves, somewhere back in 2005. I myself bought this movie because I do love/want to own most things Twilight related and I'm sure the majority of the DVD sales for this film were for that same reason. I'm not ashamed to have bought it for the purpose that it was the ""Twilight Movie"" but I am highly disappointed and expected much more. This movie was a flop.<br/><br/>But of course this is just my opinion, and you have yours as well."
"laurenemden","9","1","4","18 April 2009"," Loved It!
","I thought this film was brilliant! I have watched it about 3 times already in um.. 3 days! I thought the plot was really good, a real twist. I haven't watched a film similar to this before which makes a nice change! The acting in the film was very good, perhaps could have been a bit better by Bella, but this doesn't spoil the film at all. Before watching the film, I didn't think i would enjoy it, considering a vampire film isn't really something i would normally go out of my way to watch, but hearing what people i knew thought of it, i borrowed it off my friend and watched it, and totally loved it! My favourite scene was the baseball scene as it started to show how Edward went out of his way to protect Bella, and began to really start the film as it followed onto Bella being in trouble, which is the whole point of the film.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to everyone, but especially teenage girls like me, for just one thing Edward Cullen! He is rather hot! i hope this review helped everyone! x"

","When I first opened the book in 2006, I thought bad writing, but amazing story line, now 100+ reads I still am addicted. Then *breaking news* the movie is set to come out, I get all excited and then I see the first trailer. Disappointing...I'm worried now. I watch all the interviews and see all the ungrateful actors get gawked on by adoring fans of the characters. Then the movie enters, you see a horrid actress holding a cactus and talking in an annoying voice. Weird and smug vampires enter cafeteria and with no story behind it, they (Edward and Bella) fall in love. Jacob is now in love too, why? Who knows. Alice and Bella best friends? Not according to the movie! Horrible 'glittering' and running effects made the romance novel into a joke able and laughable on screen box office sensation."
"rusty6424","4","1","4","11 April 2009"," Could've been great...
","I was initially excited for this movie. I knew they were adapting it for screen weeks before they had even picked actors. Then, I saw it. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. Kristen gives a terrible performance. She has no emotion, is completely mono-tone, stutters, and she doesn't even look like she wants to be there. Robert Pattinson just tries too hard. And those close-ups! If you look, you can see the HUGE amount of make-up they put on his face, and look even closer and you can see his contacts. The only actor's performance I did like was Taylor Lautner, and he's only in the movie for about 10 minutes tops. And of course, you gotta give the credit for this movie going down the toilet to...the director! Catherine Hardwicke is NOT, I repeat, NOT a good director. Her style is absurd. Her shots are short and move so fast it confuses you to the point that you have to rewind about 10 minutes back and put it into slow motion just so that you can see what you're SUPPOSED to see the first time around. And don't even bother to compare it to the books. The books are passionate, and show how emotionally attached Bella and Edward are. The movie just pushes that all aside and throws in a scenes of them making out - you can even see tongue. I honestly just can't wait until they remake this in about 50 years. If I'm still alive, I'll gladly go see it in hope that they topped this one, which won't be too hard to do."
"RZDickRider_2","5","1","4","10 April 2009"," Vampires, Emotionless People, and...A Great Love Story? Oh My!
","So I recently rented this movie called ""Twilight"". Of course I knew what it was, I have a teen sister, and I knew that it was based off of a best selling book. I went into Twilight with very little expectations. When the flick first comes on we hear a depressed sounding girl, Bella, saying that she has never thought about dying. I actually liked this line, but what was with the running deer? That was strange.<br/><br/>The movie takes a turn and Bella Swan, the lead character, has to move to Forks, Washington with her father. Bella soon falls in love with this mystical guy named Edward Cullen. She soon finds out after he stops a car from hitting her, with his hand, that he is a...VAMPIRE! But The Cullen are vegetarians, which means they only live off of animals blood. They were a couple of awkward moments in the movie which played out well. Like when he said something like he has never wanted blood so much in his life, meaning her's.<br/><br/>After they fall for each other, then the movie actually picks up! Three blood sucking vampires, non vegan, James, Victoria, and I don't know the other guy's name but... whatever. These three want Bella's blood. A big chase happens, but James finally traps her in her old ballet studio. This where the big fight happens. James dies, but not before he can bite Bella. Edward has to suck the venom out! Edward said earlier to Bella that it is almost impossible for vampires to stop drinking once they have the taste of blood. So this scene was very suspenseful as both of the leads were very likable. Edward stops though out of pure love.<br/><br/>Overall, I would watch this movie again. It had a very unique, and captivating love story. This movie is perhaps this decades Titanic.<br/><br/>But, like every movie, there are some bad things.<br/><br/>The stinkers go to: James. He was a very weak main villain.<br/><br/>Jacob Blacks wig. It looked very fake.<br/><br/>Some stiff acting in some scenes. Which is to be expected with young talent.<br/><br/>Rating: **.5 out of ****"
"matthew_ball2","9","1","4","4 April 2009"," Very well done...
","I have to say that I had heard of this story for some time before i took any interest in it. The ideas behind it seemed rather dumb and didn't make too much sense. It was merely something my girlfriend was into. I had heard what others had to say about it, finding that almost all women liked it, but i had not heard of one guy that liked it in the least. I am, however, glad to say that the book...along with the movie, were very very good. While i didn't read the book until after i saw the movie, i have to say that i really liked it. While i agree that the movie was somewhat too short, it was done really well, and the character chemistry was very good. I am a big fan of Kristen Stewart and i think that she did the best job possible as Bella. Rob Pattison did a good job as Edward as well, though it seemed he had trouble expressing the emotions to match the scene. My only quarrel with this movie would be despite the fact that it is a full 2 hrs long, it could have easily been much longer. Being the only guy i know that even remotely likes the movie or books, its weird to think about but I'm glad to say that i really liked them both, and i am excited to see the sequels and read the rest of the books."
"kmsand4","8","1","4","2 April 2009"," Loved it!
","I bought this movie for my 4 teen sons and we all thought it was a great movie! I love vampire stories and was happy to finally see one that my children could watch without having to skip parts that were either to sexual or too violent. Having never heard of or read the book ""Twilight"", I felt as though they did a great job in casting Robert as Edward. The pain and anguish he portrayed as Edward gave us insight on how he felt personally about being a vampire and falling for a mortal. And I thought that Kristen did very well as Bella! This movie made me a ""Twilight"" fan. ;-) I was genuinely surprised to find out later from my youngest that Robert was British. Having grown up my whole life in Europe, even I did not detect an accent. Other than that, I never read a book and then watch a movie based on the book. It most always will disappoint. There is only so much they can do when going from book to screen. But reading the book after the movie? That is something I am definitely planning on doing and am awaiting the Twilight series in the next few days."

","My family recently watched this movie. 3 of 4 of us have read and thoroughly the book (mom, 10 yr old girl and 13yr old boy. I did not start with high hopes for the movie and found I was disappointed. Both my kids were as well. I found the movie disjointed and feel there were events from the book that were moved needlessly and too much of the ""get to know each other phase"" was left out. It is rare that a movie can capture a book well, but this attempt leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion. It was an enjoyable family evening and we discussed how the movie differed from the book while watching, however it will not be a title that is added to our home video library and I am very glad that we did not go to the theater (even the cheap one!) to watch this film."
"redheadedmama","6","1","4","30 March 2009"," Sweet, silly and schmaltzy, but enjoyable
","There has been so much brouhaha about this film that it seems like people fall into two camps - hate it or love it. I liked it. I thought it was a sweet and innocent take on the forbidden love theme. Buffy did a whole lot better, in terms of acting, script, wit and the smoldering sensuality, but I just kept reminding myself this was NOT Buffy, the Vampire Slayer (though many of the scenes and much of the dialog were direct ripoffs), but something else.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart was credible as the self-contained Bella and Robert Pattinson was very good as the devoted Edward. Both were touchingly innocent and awkward with each other, making their romance seem more human (and therefore flawed), than it might have been had the director gone for a more torrid and adult love.<br/><br/>My vote - go see it, if no other reason than to know what all the unnecessary hoopla was about. Just keep in mind it isn't Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, but more of a coming of age OMG I'm in love with a vampire film."
"dbacke1","8","1","4","30 March 2009"," Very Enthralling Love Story
","I am not a fan of the book series, and I have not read a single one of them. I think that might be a good thing, because a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from those who have read the book, and they are disappointed by the changes that they see. People need to accept the fact that this happens every time a popular novel is adapted to the screen. I thought this was a very good movie, and I was enthralled by the Romeo and Juliet-like love story of Edward and Bella. I thought that both Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart gave performances that really made us feel what they were going through. Bella was a bit put off by Edward's behavior at first, but she was drawn to him, and I think she was curious to find out what made him tick, and I think this was well presented throughout the first part of the film. The section of the film that deals with her finding out what Edward is, and the ensuing scenes of them falling in love, are very beautiful and touching, with great acting, cinematography, and Carter Burwell's excellent score. I thought that ""Bella's Lullaby"" is definitely one of the most beautiful musical pieces scored for a film in recent years. Of course, there were some cheesy parts of the film as well that might have detracted a bit, but overall it is very strong. I am saddened to hear that Catherine Hardwicke will not be directing the followup, because I think she did an admirable job on this one. The next director will definitely have a tough act to follow."
"shiningstarz0915","7","1","4","30 March 2009"," To Many Missing Pieces, Overall Still Pretty Good
","I'm not one for odd numbers, so the fact that I gave it a 7 means there's definitely a reason.<br/><br/>Now I'm a huge fan of the book Twilight. So many things happen in the book that just bring you in and make you want to keep reading and reading because its like a never ending story. I was so excited for the movie since I loved the book so much. But once I saw the movie I found it to be a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>Reasons, one the time-line didn't follow the way it was supposed to as it did in the book. I am fully aware that when making a movie from a book you have to leave a lot of things out. But a lot of the things that they left out were vital to the book when knowing the story. There are such things that they left out in the first movie that they are going to have to put in the New Moon in order for people to under the story. Most of which being Carisle and Edwards past.<br/><br/>Also I feel as though the movie was trying to focus to much on the relationship between Edward and Bella and trying to make it a ""love story/chick flick"" when really in the first book that's not what its all about at all. In the first movie its about the developing relationship of Edward/Bella and trying to get you to understand/accept it as they do.<br/><br/>Also the movie was very slow for about the first half. But finally in the second half it got interesting when the drama began to unfold and the story was actually being told the way it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the movie. I was excited to see my favorite book put up on the big screen. Although I was disappointed at some aspects I have high hopes for New Moon and hope to see the series I love brought back to the big screen again with an even better turn out."

","that's not really all that fair...<br/><br/>or maybe I could say: ""Micheeeaalll, Micheeeeealll"" And then have the frog brothers jump out of their comic shop to do some serious damage on some po-dunk Vampire Arse.<br/><br/>Which again isn't really fair but in all honesty if you did combine Lost Boys with Interview with the Vampire and sprinkle in some teen movie angst you generally have this film.<br/><br/>It wasn't so much that the story line was bad. It was original, or at least as original of a story you can get in the 21st century. However what really killed it was that it was so melodramatic and over acted, I could not take anyone seriously.<br/><br/>And it is obvious to anyone with half a brain that this movie is marketed to emo, angst ridden, dark teenage girls. But it was just so absurd, and so overplayed that it made it hard to get into the world.<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe as I get older I expect more. And maybe that is the refinement of age is that the things that amused me as a child don't even scratch the surface anymore.<br/><br/>And again, it's not the story so much as the acting. The majority of the dialogue was one worded, stuttered phrases that were just a slight bit above Neanderthal grunts.<br/><br/>There was no real character development, and it seemed as if everyone was tossed into the mix solely because they were in the book, which I did not read.<br/><br/>As always with any movie based upon the book one must keep in mind that the movie is BASED on and NOT the book itself so of course certain liberties must be taken. Dramatic license is expected. However with movies that are based on books it always seems that the film makers are either trying to cram too much book into the movie, and producing a random disjointed film that makes a bad film.<br/><br/>Or.<br/><br/>Not having enough of the book and changing too many things around, thus angering and upsetting the fans who made the series popular in the first place.<br/><br/>In the end, it was amusing to me from the first moment that Edward appeared in the cafeteria. Almost as if walking out of a Calvin Klein ad of the 90's. Wind blowing in his hair, even though he was indoors. A cold, mysterious stare, a hip and cool air about it...<br/><br/>So overplayed that I started laughing...<br/><br/>But again, I am not a young girl just hitting puberty, and I have long since been that age when hormones were raging and overly dramatic romances inspired me.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am just too old for this sort of thing, or perhaps this sort of thing is just as ridiculous as it was back in my youth.<br/><br/>The fact remains that I do like a bit of cheese now and then, and I do enjoy a cheesy teen romance.<br/><br/>This however was cheese that took itself way too seriously."

","I love the Twilight series. Stephanie Meyer has done a fantastic job with it. I know that the book is always so much better than the movie because you can pack a lot more into the book. But, I do believe Catherine Hardwicke was the total wrong choice to do this movie. There was so much that was vital to the story that was left out. I watched the deleted scenes on the DVD that should have been kept in the movie. The scene in the diner where she asks her father about the Cullens was deleted. That was a big point in the book for me. I am glad she wont be returning for the new movie. There has been some things said about Kristen Stewart being wrong to play Bella. But I think she was okay. Maybe with a new director it will be better. Even though a lot was omitted from the movie, I still love it. Its Stephanie Meyer's Edward and Bella come to life. Hurry New Moon!!!!!"
"bennett6733","7","1","4","23 March 2009"," good but not great
","My wife is a vampire movie freak and she wanted to watch this movie and while I cannot say I was interested before I saw it I thought it was a good movie. I thought the story was really good so much so I would like to read the book, but some of the actors/actresses they chose did not play the parts well. The least of these was Lautner as Jacob Black, me and my wife knew instantly it was a white kid with makeup and a crappy wig and even though his part was small he blew. Unfortunately I did not like the lead actress who played Bella. She looked the part of how I would imagine the character but fell far short in my opinion. I know interactions between human and vampire are bound to be awkward but her awkwardness was awkward. The character was very flat and I found none of the emotions she was supposed to have or claimed to be having believable, the part was not played well enough for me to make it believable that a vampire would be interested in her and the scene at the end when she is in the hospital was really bad. Cullen tells her to go to Jacksonville so he can no longer hurt her and she is suppose to have this reaction of how she can't because she needs him so badly but I couldn't buy it. It felt like it was suppose to be this real, beautiful, strange, and strong bond of love but because of her range it just felt like silly juvenile, needy, clingy love. I enjoyed the movie overall and look forward to the sequel but hopefully Bella can step up her acting chops to a whole new level to make the part more believable and enjoyable."
"BR_BlueY7","9","1","4","23 March 2009"," I was in for Surprise
","one year ago, in March 2007,was when I first heard about Twilight and that a movie was being made, based off the book of the same name. Flash forward to one year later, when I finally got to the book, as I feverishly rushed to get thru it in time for the DVD release. The book had me hooked, now it was time to watch the DVD.<br/><br/>I was anticipating the movie to let me down BIG TIME, as has Harry Potter & Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix have done. GOF and OOTP were 2 of the worst book-to-film adaptations I have seen, up there with X-Men 3 and Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>Now I know Twilight is no Harry Potter or a comic book, but this movie I would recommend over the POS that X-Men 3 and Spider-Man 3 are. I was pleasantly surprised as to how hooked I was into the movie. Of course, Edward was not who I pictured when I read the book(which to my understanding I am not alone in). Kristen Stewart was a great choice for Bella, as were Ashley Greene as Alice, Niki Reed as Rosalie, Billy Burke as Charlie Swan and Peter Facinelli as Carlisle Cullen. The story for the movie was well paced.<br/><br/>It seems like that NEARLY all the girls, or women if you will, in this movie are Extremely gorgeous. Especially Rosalie(Nikki Reed) and Esme(Elizabeth Reaser). My reaction was the same for Carlisle, I'm a straight-narrowed-guy but Carlisle just simply put took my breath away. Jackson Rathborne as Jasper, I got the same reaction from when I first met Jasper in the book(he gives me scary chills). Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, he was a bit wooden, but he worked the role the best he could. I sure hope Taylor steps it up in New Moon, when the story turns and focuses on him.<br/><br/>Now I MAY still be a fresh and new Twilight-er, but I picked up on a few foreshadowing of things to come when I am only on Book #2: New Moon. When Bella first sees her room, just above her head is a picture of a wolf which according to the Commentary foreshadows things to come. There were other foreshadowing moments, but due to my Short-Term Memory, I can't remember. <br/><br/>Now, comparing this to the book. Of course, it's not going to be exactly like the book. I did notice certain scenes that were in the book, that weren't in the movie. The only scene that I would have liked to seen was the Blood-Typing Experiment in Biology Class. <br/><br/>If I was to offer a little advice, it would be to the director, Catherine Hardwicke. She should have spent a little more time on character development for the Cullens and Bella's friends; as well as the brooding friendship between Bella and Jacob. She also could have done a little development on Edward and Bella. <br/><br/>The one character that I am anxious to learn more about is Carlisle. I got my answer in the New Moon novel, now I am just hoping that they include it in the film as well. I don't want Twilight to disappoint me like the Harry Potter movies have done. Harry Potter started off VERY strong only to become POS's with #4 and #5. Twilight right now is off to a VERY GOOD start.<br/><br/>I have also learned though, over time, not to take movies too seriously or to over-analyze it like MANY other Twilight-ers have. It is just a movie(or book), and it's not meant to be taken seriously, it's meant to be entertainment.<br/><br/>OVERALL, on a scale of 1- 10, I would give Twilight a 9. One of the best movies in recent memory that ranks up there with The Dark Knight, Prince Caspian, Phantom of the Opera and X-Men 2.<br/><br/>Think Robert Pattinson being in Harry Potter was ironic, how about this for irony: Bella's parents were both villains on the TV-Series, ""24"", can anyone recall who they played, though?"
"uselesslylongemailaddres","5","1","4","20 March 2009"," Mediocre at Best
","The books themselves being mediocre at best -- it's what I expected from this movie, and Gosh-Darnit! it delivered.<br/><br/>The plot blumbled on and on, scene after lovey-dovey scene of Bella-Edward lurrvvv. Bella seemed a bit catatonic. Edward was too let-me-be-suave-brooding. The rest of the Cullens were really empty characters within the film except for Rosalie, and that's only because she caused some moment of conflict.<br/><br/>Laurent was believable. ""My name's Bennett and I ain't in it"" was his motto and he stuck true to it. Victoria was just a sneering redhead. The screenwriter and/or director could have given her directions to have more of an edge. James just DID the creepy stuff. He wasn't convincingly creepy (but man was he hot as hell! (Laurent and Rosalie too!)) All in all I give this wonderful adaptation the same I would give the series a 5, not good, not bad, meh--I saw it."
"Maddymadeline","4","1","4","16 March 2009"," Not too great
","Not too great. If you watch it like a typical chick flick, the movie was OK not great( I have seen better chick flicks!) but if you were hoping for some action or blockbuster with strong storyline, then it fails miserably. And I haven't read the book yet.<br/><br/>I said it was an OK chick flick is because of the way the film progresses and the environment the film was made. I didn't like the places where the movie was being filmed. The school didn't look like a school, the hospital, the forest, everything just doesn't seem right to me. Some of the actors in my opinion were terrible especially Kristen stewart, she always had the same blank look for the entire movie and the way she speaks just annoys me. The chemistry between her and Robert Pattinson was just weak and awkward. Robert Pattinson was an OK actor, not outstanding. He does have the correct look for a vampire- mysterious, pale and of course gorgeous. His acting was not bad till he had scenes with Kristen and the awkwardness between them in a lot of scenes just tones down his acting. If you compare their chemistry and love story to The Notebook, the romance in this movie was just plain horrible. Both Bella and Edward had absolutely no chemistry! Cam gigadent was great as the antagonist in the movie, however, he didn't appear till half of the movie later which was pity. Peter Facinelli and Billy Burke were good father figures. The rest of the cast didn't seem very important in the movie to me and were forgettable.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe it started out with a good plot( I gave it 4 stars because of this) but the massive number of errors just makes this movie go downhill as you continue to watch. Also they are making 3 more sequels to this. I believe the makers of this movie are trying to copy harry potter and hopefully garner the same kind of success but in the case of harry potter films, they do fare much better. Ironically enough, Robert Pattinson was also cast in one of the Harry Potter films. I'm pretty sure he knows the difference between a blockbuster and a mere chick flick."
"tekbaspinar","7","1","4","16 March 2009"," A point of view of a careful watcher.
","After watching the movie several times,did not want to comment accordingly to the first thoughts, l find the acting of Miss Stewart pretty weak for this role. Obviously she was not able to get into the personality of Bella Swan sadly. Watching her shaking head, hesitant moves and spurts during the whole movie was quite annoying. l wish there was a chance to change the actress for this role for the next movies. Considering the weight of Bella Swan for this one and the next ones, l can say either it will require a crushing work for Stewart or another unpleasant experience for us,watchers. l always support the novel-based movies. Since they usually have stronger screenplay than an average movie. Though this also brings an image about the character in mind for almost all the time. As long as it is not possible to bring the actor/actress onto the screen in your mind, the cast at least have to understand the nature of the role. Sometimes there can be comments like they do not want to be a reflection of the book. They want to be unique. But there are some expectations. There are some specialities ,pointed out in the book,the watcher desires to see. When we can not, here is the Twilight movie."
"cat-peat","7","1","4","7 March 2009"," The casting was ... strange
","I read all the books before I saw the movie and I had realistic expectations of the film. I knew it wouldn't be as good as the book and I wasn't too upset about the story line, in fact I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The only problem I had was with some of the casting. Carlisle, he is supposed to look like as angel (like, ACTUALLY a stunningly beautiful angel) but he just looks like a standard vampire and not in anyway alluringly handsome, which kind of missed the point. I was also really disappointed in the casting for Rosalie. Rosalie is supposed to be beautiful in a classic way, unfortunately the actress looked more like a curvy cheerleader than a classic ice queen beauty, especially since the actress is a brunette and did not suit the blonde wig. And Bella is not supposed to be better looking than Rosalie, no one is. I think I would have chosen someone more along the lines of Laura Ramsey.<br/><br/>Apart from the casting I really enjoyed the film although would have wanted to see some more of the chemistry between Bella and Edward. But it was a great film to watch, I recommend as a guilty pleasure!"

","""When you can live forever, what do you live for?"" <br/><br/>That's what the maker of the movie missed in the film. OK, lemme start from scratch. As this was the most awaited movie for me, the day when i read its tag line, ""when you can live for......."" i was crazy about this, and than i searched the internet and looked for the releasing date, but as it wasn't going to be released in India, so i had to wait for a bit longer. But during that time i saw its trailers, its walls, n i was really impressed. But than came the IMDb's people review, which was not so good, but i still had few hopes that a movie with the rating of 6+ will be watchable, and in fact it is, and than the day came when i finally bought the CD and saw it, but there was nothing in the movie that i was thinking about, no action, no extra ordinary or super hero stunts apart frown Edward's flying efforts. Bella, well, looked really beautiful, but the issue was not with the cast. The director started off well, but lost it all the way after the half time, and the End, mind you, nothing special, i was expecting it to be one of the best climax's if not the best movie, but ...<br/><br/>I was thinking that there would be a point in the climax where the tag line would have been used, but nope, and the only other dialogue i liked, i mean quite liked was, <br/><br/>Bella : How old are u? Edward: i am 17! Bella : How long have u been 17? Edward : a while.<br/><br/>i really loved it! but the movie overall was below, in fact far below my expectations, even the end doesn't seems to suit.<br/><br/>A lot of room for improvement is required, and I've heard the rumors that a sequel is coming this November, well, i wish that the sequel wont have the deficiencies which Twilight had.<br/><br/>But I'm still waiting for it!"
"ddspliting_36","8","1","4","6 March 2009"," Good adaptation but Not That great as expected....
","I had been waiting for this movie terribly for a long time as I had read the novels. So lately I watched the movie and I will say it was fine, it was good but wasn't great as it was expected. The screenplay adaptation is good, though changed from the novel to a measurable extent but still it can't be criticized if the novel is kept aside. The downside was the acting, its really bad at some occasions and yet better at other. Robert Pattinson is disappointing at the start but he goes well afterwards. Kristen Stewart is great in it. Ashley Greene as Alice was terrible I will say. Rest were fine. Besides, special effects are fine, background music and sound are good but not greatly mixed with the scenes at some places. The filming locations are gorgeous as described in the novel which is a plus point to it. In short, if you have read the novels, then its good to watch it because its a good(not great as novel is totally awesome) depiction of it. And if you haven't then I guess its not the one which will make you leave the movie theater. I hope the sequel(s) will be far better and won't be disappointing."

","personally, i thought that the movie was OK but not fantastic. there were a LOT of differences from the book that i don't think were necessary. i also thought that the casting could have been a lot better. no offense to Kristen Stewart, but i think that they could have gotten a better Bella. also the clothes that she wore were the opposite of what i thought. in the book it says that she wore hoodies and other clothes like that. she didn't wear a lot of skin tight clothes like she did in the movie. i did think that the choice for Alice was right on target. other characters I'm not entirely sure of. i think that they should have tried to stick to the book a little closer than they did. don't get me wrong it was a good movie, its just that that the book was soooooo much better. you understand more from the book. you can tell that Edward and Bella are in love in the book. i didn't really see it until she said that she was in love with him."
"dware86-1","9","1","4","2 March 2009"," special, and it could't be better.
","Firstly, i am a straight male 23 years of age. I say this because I try and give this review from my point of view as such, mainly in response to the negative review by ""ctg0724"".<br/><br/>It is true that the main characters (ie. vampires) in this film are presented as 'not realistic' but that is the whole idea. <br/><br/>If you've read the books, the entire story is basically (without wanting to stereotype) but a version of every girl's dream!<br/><br/>No guy in history could ever live up to Edward, i wont give away spoilers, but read the books and watch the films and you'll see why, I would strongly argue that the main reason despite super abilities is actually his patience.<br/><br/>I thought the books were fantastic as a no holds barred vision of what real girls really want (if you are intelligent enough to look past the supernatural things that make it entertainment, and to the actual fantasy ideas beneath, ie. romance-a lot of which is expressed in many ways throughout, the fact that he gives her so much attention, reassurance, patience, money (haha despite her 'objections' to it) and the love of family. (Also notice that all the men are very manly men, aggressive, strong, masculine types (female writer quirk))<br/><br/>These are very real and attainable things to us all, but obviously set in a story to make it interesting media. Don't get me wrong, I am aware that in the current world its hard- almost impossible for average Joe to have money and give a girl all your time!<br/><br/>For the actual film, i'd say it does well to tell the book, and i think the cinematography was FANTASTIC and SO BEAUTIFULLY SHOT, it was one of the things that made me get into the twilight series. The sense of discord at the beginning i found very effective and uncomfortable, in a good way, and some of the scenery for the supernatural showing off was simply breathtaking.<br/><br/>With so many male directors out there who focus on male things like the action in the story, i felt that having a female director and a female writer make the focus of the film very 'different' but that couldn't be a better thing, its so refreshing for mainstream and i thought Twilight was brilliant."
"wishihadaranch","8","1","4","23 February 2009"," not a too bad novel to big screen adaptation
","The movie was not exactly what I expected, but better than a lot of novel to movie stories I have seen. It wasn't bad, worth the look if you liked the book. The beginning was a little hard to understand if you hadn't read the book since there was so much more to the early school days. I did not like Edwards exaggerated makeup, his lips were way too red in many scenes. I loved the adaptation of Jacob - hit the nail right on the head. Other than that it pretty much delivered on how I imagined the story to be on film. Its an about 9 hour audio listen down to 112 minutes on film - so it is what it is. But, I'm a 40 something viewer that had high expectations for a teeny booper film, so again it is what it is, so be it. Ultimaely, I liked it. See it if you liked the book. I'm looking forward to the next one."
"johnmichael-2","7","1","4","20 February 2009"," Trashtastic!
","This is a review of left-handed compliments. ""Twilight"" is a mix of the good and the bad, the amazing and the atrocious. And yet never does it get boring to watch.<br/><br/>I'll start with a compliment: It is faithful to the book, and satisfyingly so. Now for the left-handed aspect: The books are fun, but they are the exact opposite of good literature. They are extremely compelling, but the teenage love plot is so overblown it is ridiculous to read about. It is just as ridiculous to watch.<br/><br/>And yet... somehow, I can't resist it! I certainly know the females can't. Love it or hate it, every female between the ages of 14 and 21 (plus some older women, if I haven't been deceived!) knows about ""Twilight."" Almost every single one of them has read ""Twilight."" And something keeps them going to the next book, even if they hated the first. There is something about Bella and Edward's love that is so unconditional that we can't help but be attracted to it. To tell the absolute truth, their relationship seems obsessive. Did I say ""seems?"" I meant to say ""is."" It is actually really creepy. Maybe, subconsciously, that's why we find it so compelling. We know we can't have their kind of absolute devotion, yet we want it so much that we immerse ourselves in their story, no matter how fanatical their relationship becomes.<br/><br/>How did Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson pull off the two star-crossed leads? With hits and misses, though with more of the former than the latter. They both look gorgeous (especially Kristen Stewart!), and they both have the moodiness down pat. Occasionally they slip into patches of bad acting, but mostly when the script lets them down.<br/><br/>Here is another negative aspect of the movie. Melissa Rosenberg had 30 days to write the script before the writer's strike started. In consequence, it was weak in many places. She never cleaned up some of the awkward dialogue, and most of the atrociously corny lines remain. I was watching this on my college campus in a packed theater, and the house broke down with laughter at every such line, especially when Edward confesses to Bella, ""You're like a drug to me. Like my own personal brand of heroine."" As a sentiment of undying love, it ranks right up at the top of the Most Unromantic List along with Anakin's line from Star Wars, Episode II: ""And now that I'm with you again... I'm in AGONY."" Both lines reduce me to tears of laughter every time I hear them! And that, I admit, is part of the fun! There's something about love stories like these, told in such earnestness and yet bursting with such ridiculousness, that makes them irresistible to watch! See ""Twilight"" with a group of friends, and I promise you will never be bored, whether you are male or female!<br/><br/>To help it along, Star Wars, Episode II had its great special effects. ""Twilight"" doesn't have this. Made on a $37 million budget, the special effects look pretty damn cheap. What the movies DOES have is its art direction. I am telling you, this is the one aspect of the movie that is completely and unadulteratedly brilliant! There is no left-handedness in this compliment: the color palette in this movie is TO DIE FOR! I have never seen such lush greens, such sensuous purples and blues, such striking whites! The scene in which Bella confronts Edward about him being a vampire is a laughable one, but when they lay down in the field, her lustrous brown hair spilling around her as she stares into Edward's eyes, both of them lying supine in the rich green grass speckled with tiny blooming flowers... I just melted! I can see why the Academy avoided this movie like the plague, but if there's one award it deserved to win (yes, an actual win, not just a nomination!), it was Art Direction. It casts the mood more than anything else in the movie, and it does it flawlessly! This is likely because Catherine Hardwicke's roots come from Production Design. As a director, she is competent enough. However, she can't make the weak parts of the script any stronger, and in some parts she directs the actors rather poorly. However, she seems to have a passable grasp on teenage life. Not as insightful as her relentless teen flick ""Thirteen,"" but still good in its own way. She builds some cues really well, which balances out the parts where she drops the ball (like with the corny dialogue and one or two of the fight scenes).<br/><br/>I think I've covered most everything. Suffice it to say, Twilight as a book and now as a movie is really its own brand of silliness and awesomeness. In fact, it's so much its own brand that I've invented an entirely new word for it: Trashtastic! Yes, it is junk food for the mind: cheap, bad, and completely unrealistic, but totally satisfying when taken as a break from your normal work (for me, it's college studies: I love you, Martin Luther, Emily Dickinson, and John Milton, but after so much I need a break!). Take a group of friends and have a fun time!<br/><br/>P.S. This movie also holds up under rewatching."

","Well, all the people I talked to it was 50-50 on how they felt about this movie. I decided to go check it out before it left the theaters and well me and 4 other strangers (along with 2 children under the age of 2) watched a movie that could have been so much better. I was disappointed I really expected more after hearing all the hype. It was very slow, and there was a lot of holding back (I guess due to the rating?). The girl who played Bella was BORING. The guy who played Edward was over the top, you know, over acting. The guy who played Jasper, what was he doing, was he channeling Edward Scissorhands, come on. I guess since this was really meant for younger viewers the whole thing was really tame so in that sense it was okay. I guess I'm just so used to seeing no holds barred in any movie or TV these days I'm getting a bit callus about sweet and innocent. I read the 4 book series and liked all but the last one so I'll give the next movie a chance as well. Parents there is nothing to worry about in letting your teenagers see this movie. Things I really liked was the scenery and the copper looking contacts the vamps wore when they were newly fed other than that, I got nothing."

","I am a huge fan of the Twilight series and couldn't wait to see this movie. Just like the hundreds of other teenage girls who saw the movie on opening night I was really excited(and not because I would see Rob shirtless)but sadly the movie didn't live up to any of my standards. I wasn't looking for ""Best Movie of the Year"" but at least a enjoyable film. I nearly cried my eyes out when I realized how bad Twilight really was! I had to look away from the horrible effects and try not to listen to the cheesy dialogue scenes. The movie also had tons of plot holes for people who didn't read the book. It just seemed to me like they only had to film the thing and throw it in theaters. They just didn't plan the scenes out very well and although it was a big box office hit, it was still a failure. One bright side to Twilight was its soundtrack, thats the only reason I didn't give it 2 stars. Wait for it to come on Starz or Showtime but don't spend $25 on something you'll regret."

But , hey , that's what Bella's supposed to do too , so I guess it's fine.<br/><br/>Ashley Greene did a wonderful job as Alice.She has like no lines ,but her presence is so Alice-like , it's wonderful.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner is awful , really really awful.Awful 3 lines he had , awful look for Jacob.He's just some baby-faced kid. Some of you might have seen Steven Strait in The Covenant. That's how Jacob should look like! It's not like if you gain 26 pounds of muscle , you're gonna look as a werewolf.>.< <br/><br/>I'd comment on the others too , but they only appeared in the movie , they didn't talk too much .<br/><br/>Again , the biggest mistake goes again to you people , for expecting too much from it. The teen-movies based on books usually go wrong. And it's not like Harry Potter is great either , it's just a little bit better.<br/><br/>Twilight is everywhere and anywhere.And I've seen like a billion girls that go on and say that the movie is great because of Rob's look when they are still struggling to get past the 2nd chapter in the first book of the saga.<br/><br/>This fever will just go as it came. And sorry for my crappy review. It's my first."
"jpschapira","6","1","4","6 February 2009"," What do you want to watch? Be careful...
","Here's the deal. You have a beautiful girl, properly named Bella (the gorgeous Kristen Stewart) who moves to a small town to live with her father, a chief of police (Billy Burke). She goes to school, she's the new girl, the new toy. Suddenly, a good looking guy by the name of Edward (Robert Pattinson) comes along and saves her life in a way that doesn't seem human. Bella doesn't understand, and becomes fascinated with Edward, who keeps a secret we all know.<br/><br/>A story like this one could happen to any of you today, leaving aside everything that's not human, because Edward is a vampire, and that changes everything. ""Twilight"" is based on a famous novel Stephenie Meyer, a lot of people went to see it because of that and for the same reason they'll go to see the second part, shooting right now. Considering the fact that the novel has to be 'condensed' for the screen, screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg did a pretty ambiguous job; considering that in developing an adolescent love story she included lines like ""you are my life now, Bella"" and also had the nerve to put thing like ""you are like my personal brand of heroine"". Who would say such a thing? A vampire, you could answer, if you intend to defend the film's writing.<br/><br/>While it may all be fault of the novel itself (which I didn't read but heard was lame enough), it's true that the movie develops its plot in a hurry, and we always feel we're missing an important number of conversations between the very interesting main characters. Pattinson (now a heartthrob who got the role of his life) and Stewart (one of the finest actresses of her generation) work well together and their chemistry is palpable, either when they transmit they want to be together or the exact opposite. In this particular aspect, director Catherine Hardwicke gets the best out of the movie.<br/><br/>Hardwicke directed the fantastic ""Thirteen"", so she knows about teen angst. However, this time everything is more focused: the camera showing only the characters' eyes, emphasizing their looks. The fact that Edward is a vampire and Bella can't have him so close seems to be the center of Hardwicke's attention and, as if she wanted to show teenage sexual desire-and eventually abstinence- as an important topic of the film (she mixes it up with love sacrifice, but it becomes unnecessary and tired because the images leave it clear), she shoots the film's hottest scene with deep breaths and dim lights, ending it in nothing.<br/><br/>If you watch the action scenes-fights between vampires and other creatures-you will also understand that part of the film wasn't Hardwicke's biggest concern. The shaky camera that cinematographer Elliot Davis developed and worked so well for her in her first film, now seems out of place. The action scenes are badly shot, incomprehensible and sometimes even badly edited (or not edited with enough enthusiasm); the music by Carter Burwell sounds like out of a B-movie or a cheap TV series about murders and-maybe-vampires.<br/><br/>At least Hardwicke will not be directing the sequel (maybe she'll get back to what she does best, with all her usual actors included-they are all in this movie-) and at least ""Twilight"" is better than ""Jumper"". You can watch it for some good performances, or for some fun. That's a lot to say."
"TwilightObsessee","9","1","4","29 January 2009"," A fantastic film.. not for a fanatic.
","When I saw Twilight (the first time, that is) I didn't quite know what to expect. I had never read the book before, though I'd contemplated it. As a rule, I never read a book before I see the film, due to my disappointment that is bound to follow. You see, when you read a book, your mind automatically assigns faces to the characters, to help it make sense. When you see a film and then read the book, the faces are already there, they do not have to be created, and there is something for your mind to follow. But, if you read a book, you may not know it, but your subconscious is hoping the characters will live up to the expectations in your head. So, that is why I never read the book if I know there is going to be a film. I wait. And I'm glad I did. After I saw the film - Which, by the way, I loved (To me, the only part I didn't like was when I realized that Bella was so goddamn stubborn) - I bought the books straight away. When I started reading twilight, I could recall which bits of the text were used in the film. Some of them, I loved - Like the line about Edward's age. I also loved Meyer's use of description - so intelligent (I had people asking me what irrevocably meant), yet so... fluent. Human. The setting and dialogue was obviously changed for the movie, but I don't see that as a down side. I wasn't exactly over the moon; I was indifferent. During the scene when Edward runs with Bella, to me, it was obvious wires were used. But that isn't a complaint; It is merely and observation - there is no way that anyone would be able to film such a difficult scenario without help. During the baseball game, the cracks of the ball hitting the bat - even though they were meant to - sounded too much like thunder. Only after I read the book did I understand how that scene should have sounded; Instead of the thunder being a mere backing track, the noise should have taken priority in that scene. Without appearing rude to the casting agency or whatever, the description of Laurent in the book did not match that in the film. For one, the skin color. The hair. This, also, is not a complaint, just another observation. During Bella's 'research' about Edward, there was a change that I noticed more than others. She didn't get the book on Quileute Legends from Port Angeles, she discussed it with Jacob. I think the reason this stuck in my mind was because it was the beginning of Bella and Jacob's friendship. Again, this is a mere observation, but I can now see the discussions importance. All in all, I prefer the book. This is only because it means I can let my imagination run wild, but the film is better when I try to imagine the scenario for real. I will defiantly be watching New moon in the cinema and getting the sequel to breaking dawn (Midnight Sun). If you are yet to have seen the film, I do advise you to do so."
"liso1966","6","1","4","25 January 2009"," From books to movies
","I really wanted to like this movie. I have read all four books. The first and last being the best of the series ""in my opinion of course"" The good: Some of the actors were good fits. Robert Pattison makes an excellent Edward. The girl playing Bella could be perfect, if she actually had something to say, and stop with all the ditsy expressions.<br/><br/>The movie lost the essence of the book. I realize that it can not be exact, but it really needs to hold the flavor to be good. And it did not. I felt nothing of the building relationship between Edward and Bella. So forced and unbelievable.<br/><br/>There were parts of the book that were left to the way side for less impacting areas. The movie just felt too direction-less. I read somewhere that the overacting was due to lack of dialog. If that is the case. The screen writer and director did not even bother reading the book fully. There was a lot of dialog to be had.<br/><br/>Entertaining but lacking severely. The soundtrack was outstanding though!"
"blackismylove","6","1","4","20 January 2009"," It was OK once, but i'll never watch it again.
","This movie was actually a little harder to review than I thought it'd be. I didn't rush out to see twilight, but I had a free movie pass and it seemed like the most interesting candidate.<br/><br/>The story, though not entirely original, wasn't entirely all that bad either. It was obviously geared at a demographic for around an 8th grade level. The characters were established, but not really developed much. Visually, I was disappointed with a lot of the same old special effects. I laughed at how silly and obvious all the vampires were. Climbing up walls or trees really fast was done with a kind of Jacky Chan harness and cable method. Vampires moving really fast was just sped up and blurred footage of the actors. So unfortunately it felt a lot like I was watching a Disney channel original movie. There were a few interesting dream like sequences, but not nearly enough to save the whole movie. There were also a few nice camera shots, but even those were kinda ruined by bad lighting or a shaky cameras.<br/><br/>In order to appeal to the younger demographic, they intentionally made the adult characters look silly and ""out of the loop"" by having them use teenage slang. It worked basically, but to me it seemed just as forced and ridiculous when the younger characters did it too.<br/><br/>So heres where it became debatable for me. The story was actually kinda interesting. Not really intricate or clever or in depth, but I was interested to see what was going to happen next. So while at some points the scenes dragged more than I liked, and I wont ever say ""I could really go for some Twilight this evening,"" I can say that for a free movie pass, my attention was kept for 2 hours."
"neil-476","6","1","4","15 January 2009"," Someone should give that dreary girl a good slapping
","Every now and then a movie comes along which demands that I should spoiler it to death. Twilight is one such movie.<br/><br/>Bella Swan lives in Arizona with Mom and stepdad, at least until Mom decides to go on the road with stepdad, at which point Bella is packed off to Forks, a hick town in the middle of a cloud-shrouded pine forest, where dad Charlie is chief of police. Despite everybody at her new school being incredibly nice, friendly and welcoming towards her, Bella remains resolutely grumpy and sullen - in fact throughout the film the only person she is cheerful towards is the mother who went off and deserted her at the start.<br/><br/>I say everyone is friendly and welcoming: of course, that doesn't include Edward Sullen, sorry, Cullen - Bella is seated next to him in class, at which point he gets up and leaves the room and doesn't come back for a week. After endless we like each other, we don't like each other, you should stay away from me, I can't stay away from you, Bella finally figures out Edward's big secret, which is that he's a vampire. Edward has an even bigger secret, though, which is that Bella gives off the aroma of a particularly appetising meal for vampires, which is a particular problem if you want to be her boyfriend and not simply chow down on her.<br/><br/>Anyway, they embark on a relationship of sorts which cheers up the previously taciturn, intense and sombre Edward no end, although it has no discernible effect on Bella, who remains as po-faced as ever. This ever-awkward relationship reaches crisis point when Edward's vampire family (who hunt animal blood not human blood - they're good vampires, y'see) invite her to a vampire baseball game (held during a thunderstorm for reasons which the vampires think are obvious, though I failed to see them at all) which is crashed by the three visiting vampires who have been bumping off assorted locals, and who have been attracted by the aroma of yum yum Bella.<br/><br/>Edward's family springs into action by instantly driving Bella from Washington to Phoenix, to no avail because the sniffy hunty member of the visiting clan tracks her down no problem at all. However, that proves to be his downfall when Edward's family dismember him and burn the pieces in what would almost certainly have been the most entertaining part of the movie if only it hadn't happened off-camera.<br/><br/>Everybody adjourns back to Forks, Edward takes Bella to the prom, and the surviving female vampire from the we-want-to-scoff-Bella group occupies the last shot of the movie so that a sequel is lined up.<br/><br/>Edward is immortal - why on earth does he want to spend eternity with this miserable girl? Edward, incidentally, has the finest pair of eyebrows since Mr Spock (or possibly Noele Gordon on Crossroads), an ace aerodynamic design which are the absolute bee's knees for peering out intently from underneath.<br/><br/>This film is enough to give adolescent Gothic teenage romantic drama a bad name. It's badly written and the characters are badly drawn. Even the realistic elements are unrealistic. The effects are fairly minimal and OK. Just about the only bit where I feel justified in being positive is in Robert Pattinson's performance - not my cup of tea, but effective in its own way. Kristen Stewart quite possibly performed Bella as written and directed but, if so, that is her misfortune, because the character was appallingly misconceived from the start."

","I'm not quite sure what the target market for this movie was but being a 23 year old woman, i have read and enjoyed all of the Stephanie Meyer books following and including Twilight and was very much looking forward to the films release.<br/><br/>Although I very much enjoyed the movie, I will admit to being a bit disappointed as to the special effects used as well as the costume and make up. The Cullens are described as beautiful yet I found them their feature were more unhealthy then supernatural. And the way Edward moves, his motion doesn't seem to flow very naturally, which i found quite off putting.<br/><br/>I also struggled to identify with the characters that were cast as Emmet, Jasper and Rosalie. Emmet although described as strong in the book, was to me not one to be wearing such baggy clothes and a sideways baseball hat ; as they clothes are described as tailored, expensive but fitting in. Jasper in the movie looks like someone who should be staring in Edward Scissor hands and Rosalie, who is supposed be the most beautiful blonde the anyone has ever seen, is instead portrayed as someone who's natural hair color is clearly not blonde.<br/><br/>Perhaps having read all the books, I had my own idea of what the characters would look like and they way the movie would flow and that is why I am so disappointed by these facets of the film. But perhaps I am not alone in my thoughts.<br/><br/>I look forward to New Moon, hoping that the budget will be bigger and the film will be better than the last."

","The first scene of Twilight is as disturbing as it is touching. A boy teenage vampire and a girl teenage vampire meet each other in a graveyard. The boy teenage vampire gives the girl teenage vampire a knowing smirk. The kind of smirk that makes the audience wonder: Are these teenage vampire lovers, perhaps? The sexual tension in the theatre at this moment was palpable.<br/><br/>The hunt begins! The two turn into bats; the girl becomes a pink bat (practical, yes. Realistic, also yes, but perhaps a little too gender normative for my taste). They fly high above the city, performing majestic and graceful swoops while the opening credits roll.<br/><br/>A middle-aged business man is going home after a long day at the office, no doubt. He's talking on his cell-phone, presumably to his wife. Little does he know that he will never see her again.<br/><br/>The teenage vampire bats land on the businessman's shoulders, one on each, and begin shrieking their horrifying bat-shrieks.<br/><br/>""Transform!"" the bats shout in unison, allowing them to revert back into their human shape. Then they leap on the man, and devour him with their sharp vampire fangs. The camera is mercifully directed at the ground for this shot, so all we see are shadows and blood splattering.<br/><br/>Although the rest of the film is a somewhat predictable teenage vampire love romp, Director Catherine Hardwick has perfected the tried and true teenage vampire love romp formula.<br/><br/>4√Ç¬Ω out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>*SPOLIER* Some of my colleagues claim that a mere Wesley Snipes cameo would have been sufficient, and that it didn't make a lot of sense to have him kill off the entire cast in the third act.

","I read the books. I saw the movie. I laughed (really hard at some inappropriate times). I sighed. I love the movie - for it's horribleness. I am a ""bad movie"" addict. The books took you to a rainy, dreary small town where nothing ever happened (FOrks WA). Enter beyond-her-years Bella Swan. In the book she is a curiosity piece, in the movie she is almost a rock star instantly. And this is the way the movie continues. She is inexplicably drawn to also-kind-of-newcomer Edward Cullen who turns out to be a vampire. They fall in love, bad people come and Edawrd (and family) save the day. It is very quick and dirty, the whole movie I mean. It doesn't explain anything; leaving those who haven't read the book scratching their heads. I went to go see it with my husband (bless his patience) and I didn't tell him anything about the books. He had no idea what was going on. It was a drag for him until I explained all. It was such a let down to have him miss the subtleties that were poorly transfered from book to screenplay to film. But in this long explanation of the movie I gained a deeper appreciation for tacky, over the top movies. Catherine Hardwicke needs to hang it up. Thank goodness they replaced her for New Moon. The new director (Chris Weitz) did the screenplay for The Golden Compass released in 2007 (among being the producer for many other movies) which was adapted from the Philip Pullman's book bearing the same title. I also read those books (there were three in the series- amazing!) and found the screenplay/film to be spot on. This is hopefully indicative of his future venture with New Moon. Chris, don't let us down! New Moon is emotional and heart wrenching, I want to like this movie because it's good. Please."

","Haha. Twilight was.. interesting..I mean i thought the books were just AHMAZING. but the film was a let down. First of all, people that hadn't read the book before the film and watched Edward Cullen be in pain because of Bellas scent.. they wouldn't know that and be like what the? Robert who played Edward was very pretty and stood out like Edward in the book was meant to, but he wasn't the Edward Cullen i bet most of us had imagined. I would've preferred it if there was no film, because the book was just so good and easy to imagine except it was your own image in your head. I think the film did let it down, but i think the people that hadn't read the books enjoyed it more. Now the book is sold out nearly in every shop near where i live because of this film.<br/><br/>When paramore, a band from tennesse did one of the soundtracks, and a video for it which i saw before the film i got more excited. They made the music video with it better. I think the parts in the book which i enjoyed were cut short or cut out.<br/><br/>New moon is apparently being made, who knows? It might be better for our luck."
"lisagogel","7","1","4","1 January 2009"," Movie Review
","Twilight was a decent film. It did not quite live up to the book, but obviously they had to cut a lot out for the film. For die hard fans, it is hard to part with any piece of the story because Stephanie did such a great job of making every aspect of the story interesting and seemingly of utmost importance. In my opinion, the best character portrayals were Kellan Lutz with his character of Emmett and Ashley Greene as Alice. Kellan really brought the character of Emmett alive and made him stand out even though he is not a central character. Kellan reminded me of my own brothers. He did a great job! Ashley was incredible as well. Alice has so many odd little quirks, yet she is fun and lovable as a sister figure for Bella. Ashley got it perfectly. Alice was slightly strange but still someone anyone would love to be friends with. These two actors did an amazing job, and it is worth seeing the movie just to see their work."
"emmers-justem","9","1","4","29 December 2008"," A lovely adaptation of the book.
","Although the movie did not include every word and every scene in the book, I loved it. The movie sped things up where I felt the book was slow and added some applicable dialoge. I loved Robert Pattinson's portrayal of Edward. I laughed, I cried. Actually I'm pretty happy with every actor in this movie. The guy who played Jacob could do a muscle building workout for New Moon and hire a different hair person. The only addition I would make is more kissing scenes like in the book. Other than that, the chemistry was so strong even I was feeling it. I've seen the movie three times. I've never payed 9$ three times to see the same movie before. Can't wait till New Moon and the rest of the series!"
"davidloveshorror","7","1","4","28 December 2008"," Innocent and young "" Buffy and Angel "" Similarity
","I was generally excited for this film. With the delay in the release of the new Harry Potter film a market niche was caused. This would not be filled easily it needed to target the same audience as the ""Harry Potter "" generation and to attract even a new audience. This is where twilights success has resulted in. Strangely this film reminded me of a younger "" Buffy the vampire Slayer "" due to perhaps the leads similarities to them. The story is even quite similar girl moves to new town and falls in love with vampire ; its the new Buffy and Angel. But in a way despite the sweet innocent love that is portrayed it works. Without the correct casting it would not of worked so well but casting Catherine Hardwicke and Robert Pattinson as the leads was incredibly clever. Both being not too known and not overly attractive they would create an instant likeness to them by the audience. It is to be noted also that the sets on location and off location are both beautiful but there's a special scene in which Edward plays the piano the lighting , the angle , the mood is just perfect. All in all this has been a success in Ireland and from what i've been reading not far off in other locations. I think its time to pick up the book and continue on ...."
"svetlastoyanova","9","1","4","28 December 2008"," Romeo and Juliette in Underworld
","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It is not your regular vampire movie, yet it is not your regular teenage love story film either. It is a bit of both, spiced up with some spectacular fighting sequences for those who were nodding off.<br/><br/>The cast is really sweet, there are some familiar faces and some fresh new blood. The acting was OK, keeping it real and quite believable. Especially the two leads, both of them looked misplaced and confused, but in the movie they actually both are which make it look absolutely natural and creates a dark cold atmosphere of constant tension and anticipation. This is a love story bear in mind.<br/><br/>I have to admit there were some daft expressions and illogical actions. And generally the vampires' qualities are a bit different; like their exposure to sunlight. Every well informed vampire fan knows that kills them, but not in this movie here they just sparkle like they are covered in glitter. It is all so very romantic and so American. The baseball game scene was absolute blast, Muse's Supermassive Black Hole was on the background and the game was the baseball version of Shaolin soccer, quite entertaining. The vampires are people after all and you get few decent laughs every now and then.<br/><br/>And the love story between Bella and Edward is so pure blooded metaphorically and literally speaking that you can read in it far beyond the vampire element. It is love that is forbidden, impossible, and incompatible if you wish. Drop the fictional vampire moment and you'll see a very familiar human prejudice."

","With great displeasure I have to admit that I was utterly disappointed with the outcome of the movie Twilight. To me, the main characters had very little on screen chemistry. Seeing as the plot revolves around their undying love for each other, I was extremely dissatisfied with the choice of Kristin Stewart as Bella Swan. Her lack of emotion and inability to portray the character as I would've imagined ended with a feeling of sheer disappointment. Robert Pattinson, or Edward Cullen as the neurotic preteens and teens know him, grew on me after a while. I enjoyed his performance and his ability to persuade me into believing he was an actual vampire. I realize that movie makers do their best to depict the novel as accurately as possible and that it must be conveyed within only a couple of hours, but I didn't sense any fluidity to the movie. Anyway, I'm no expert. I'm merely a fan of the book who was let down by what could have potentially been a great film. Hopefully the second will persuade more chemistry from the leads and portray the storyline more sinuously."

","As a fan of the books (I always like to mention that I'm a 20 year old guy, to show that the demographic isn't solely teenage girls), I was very pleased when walking away from the cinema. There was a good, yet delicate, balance of humour and action with the romance taking up a fair proportion of the movie; as was the intention if you've read the books. I attended the screening with 4 friends who also thought it was enjoyable. Bearing in mind none of them had heard of Twilight before now, I thought their thoughts were fair. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the casting was perfect. Whilst the girls in the audience swooned after Edward (Robert Pattinson), I was fixed on Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Alice (Ashley Greene). They are stunning. I believe the chemistry between Pattinson and Kristen Stewart (Bella) was spot on; this no doubt may have something to do with their apparent off-screen romance whilst filming. Good luck to them.<br/><br/>Fans of the books will notice a few added scenes (no more than a few however), and also that Bella's narration has been adapted to set the scene, when the film can not do so. It's always going to be difficult to convey so much emotion between two characters when all you can do is watch, therefore the narration is necessary and I believe is very effective.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it was a great movie. Granted, it's not for everyone, however it seems that we live in a world where everyone is a critic so it's always nice to see good reviews on the internet for once."

","I absolutely LOVE the twilight books. That being said I felt that the movie wasn't as good as it should have been. I think that the casting was excellent although I wasn't expecting the small town of Forks to have THAT much diversity. However I felt that the movie was missing the magic that the books had. In the books you could really feel the love between Bella and Edward; however I felt that the movie didn't portray the falling in love part of the story that, to me, was most compelling about the books. It seemed that the movie hit all the high points of the book without going into any of the details, which made the storyline harder to follow and kind of dull. The movie definitely did not have the same intensity as the books and therefore left me feeling empty. For Twilight being my favorite in the series, I was disappointed because I was expecting something much better--- however overall it was still pretty good for the resources they had. I cannot wait for New Moon to come out and for the movie to have a bigger budget where they can really build the storyline."

","I was persuaded by my teenage daughter to read the Twilight books as I have been a Vampire nut since I was four, thanks to Hammer House of Horror and Christopher Lee. Stephenie Meyers' books were well written, with a great story line. When my daughter told me that they were making it into a movie I was eager to see how it would transfer to the big screen because usually books to movies don't work very well. I also had my doubts about the choice of actors player the lead parts. The movie was good but not what I had expected. I found it quite fragmented in parts. I think that I would have probably enjoyed it better if I hadn't read the book. The story line was lost a bit and you didn't get the chemistry that was created by Bella and Edward. I know that you can't put everything in the movie but Hardwicke missed out a great deal of the story that would be vital to the forthcoming books/movies. Hardwicke should have included the part fact that Bella doesn't like blood and she completed erased the fact that James held a grudge against Alice and the Cullens. Kirsten Stewert, who I had doubts about, turned out to be a good choice for Bella. The movie I found quite funny in parts. I don't know if this was intended or not. All in all I enjoyed it and will be waiting for the next installments. I just hope that the next director stays true to the books."

","Hm, it was okay for a movie. I've only read the first twilight book. I was excited to see the movie. and I left feeling, sort of satisfied. The movie was nothing spectacular. But lemme get on with the problems before i get on with the good stuff.<br/><br/>First, one thing that bugged me VERY much, BELLA SPOKE IN A MONOTONE! Just what the heck is up with that? What is that supposed to set up? The mood of the movie?! I don't know myself but still, I could have done better and i have NO acting experience.<br/><br/>They took out SO MANY IMPORTANT SCENES out of the movie! Like, come on! They really didn't show how Bella and Edward's friendship grew, it was a huge thing in the book, Bella went from hating him to thinking he wasn't such a bad guy to hating him again in the book, where as she goes straight into loving him in the movie! NO! They shouldn't do that i mean i know it happens a lot with us teenagers today, but really, take a big important part like THAT out? Just nun uh.<br/><br/>The scene with the glitter, no, just don't do it. Just no. It wasn't portrayed like that in the book, just no. I'm sorry but that scene was so bad, i could write a review on just that particular scene.... don't dump glitter on someone and have a random chick call him beautiful, good god. -___- I REALLY REALLY expected that the part where Edward played the piano for Bella to be so different, it just looked fake to be honest, all that lighting, its like they were in a studio seriously. In the book i just thought it was a regular like, family room or something. Which brings me to the music of the movie, it was, mediocre.... should got Joe Hisaishi in there :P! (for those of you who like hayo miyazaki films, you should know what I'm talking about) Okay, also i really didn't like the bit where she was running in the forest ""I KNOW WHO JOO ARE EDWARD CULLEN D:!!!"" Like, that was done so differently in the book and why didn't they do that in the movie?! they were IN the car! Ugh, and like, i loved all the questions that Edward and Bella asked each other in the book, and they were all teasing each other about it too saying ""NO its my turn now."" That just made it extra sweet :). They hardly asked questions at all in the movie! Also, like, after that scene when he took her up and he just zoomed off with her, i didn't like that either. it was portrayed so much better in the book, i mean she was going on a date with him, they hiked, clayed down at the top of the nice field, and they confessed their love even more. Loved that bit in the book, VERY disappointed they didn't do that. Besides, wasn't their FIRST KISS on top of that mountain anyway? Why was it in the bedroom then?! Ughhh....<br/><br/>I could ramble on for hours, but seriously i think i have shown you enough proof.<br/><br/>Anyway, good stuff now. Edward was pretty nice looking, but his acting was alright, coulda done better. same with Bella. I LOVEEEDD the way Alice looked, she was VERY pretty. Rosalie.....HM...nah, not how i depicted what she'd look like. Bella was pretty, but, they should have casted someone else, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>The scene where Bella's hand was burning definitely kept me on the edge of my seat even though i knew what was going to happen. :D which is good. The leaping around the trees with Edward etc.... just jumping around in general, it REALLY looked fake, they could have used some different angle shots to make it NOT look fake. just looked too fake. Hehe I'm saying more bad than good but still. The fight scenes were mediocre, coulda done a lot better.<br/><br/>I Liked VERY much how that person was watching at the end, i think it was Rosalie or that red headed girl i cant remember now ha ha. But i liked it a lot. Defintiley a cliff hanger for sure! Overall, get a new director, get a new Bella actor, fix up your....stuff....<br/><br/>MAKE THE NEXT MOVIE MORE TRUE TO THE BOOK Don't ADD ANYTHING IN THERE!!! GOSH!! D:!"
"DavidSim240183","5","1","4","22 December 2008"," Not the worst vampire film I've seen. But not the best either
","The vampire genre is something that peaks every few years. The 1980s brought about a new take on the whole vampire ethos. Films where vampires have adjusted to their modern surroundings and have no trouble at all using them as they're hunting grounds. Fright Night and in particular Near Dark provided fresh perspectives and bold ideas.<br/><br/>The 1990s gave us the brooding, conflicted vampire. Ones not too comfortable with killing. Like the underrated Interview With the Vampire, and the whole Buffy phenomenon, where Sarah Michelle Gellar carries on a relationship with one.<br/><br/>Indeed Twilight bears more than a few resemblances to Buffy's relationship with Angel. And I'm almost certain that's where Stephanie Meyer drew inspiration from when she wrote the novel the film is based upon. I haven't read any of the books, in spite of they're huge success as a franchise. So I can't debate how faithful the film is to the novel. But judged on its own merits, Twilight is a passable, if not overly brilliant tale. Certainly undeserving of the applause showered upon it by the mostly teen, female audience its clearly aimed at.<br/><br/>The film charts the growing relationship between new girl in town Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). They both go to the same high school, where they notice one another in corridors and canteens, but Edward keeps her at arms length. When he saves her from being killed by a car, his speed and strength clearly mean he's not human. And when he confides in her his secret, the two fall in love, but Edward can't risk getting too close without endangering her.<br/><br/>The whole theme of a vampire with a conscience is not a new one. Interview With the Vampire delved into some fascinating areas. Of a vampire ultimately trying (and failing) to assimilate into humanity. And Buffy did some equally brilliant things. Exploring the various pitfalls to be found when a human tries to get it on with one. But Twilight never really knows what to do with its idea.<br/><br/>The whole relationship between Bella and Edward lacks conviction because unlike Buffy & Angel, I never sensed much chemistry between them. Twilight has all the things you'd expect. Bella finding Edward's dark nature a turn-on. Edward trying to restrain his bloodlust whenever he's around her. But I probably would have liked the film more had it embraced danger rather than just flirted with it.<br/><br/>The 12A certificate really holds Twilight back. Imagine how much better, how much edgier it would have been on an 18 certificate. Or even a 15! The film could have really pushed the envelope and taken us on a searing, bloodthirsty journey. But that type of story doesn't get innocent tweenies to the cinemas. Since the producers had them in mind when making Twilight, its a strictly tame vampire picture. Very little blood, no fangs(!!!), and soft violence. I've seen more blood and gore in episodes of Buffy then there is in Twilight.<br/><br/>As is usually the case of modern vampire stories, writers like to update the myths and include new novelties. Here, they don't sleep in coffins or gloomy mansions. Just up-market ones. They're familiar with Google. And in the film's most striking innovation, vampires can move about in sunlight without burning up. They just light up instead like a Christmas tree! I have nothing against fresh revisions on the old myths and legends, but this is one that just feels wrong. Its certainly original, but I'm not sure what Stephanie Meyer was going for here. Its what a vampire film might be like if made by Steven Spielberg!<br/><br/>Twilight is a very calculated film too. Its designed to bring in big box-office numbers by casting attractive actors, hip songs and cool fashions. And in the case of Robert Pattinson, he's only been brought in to glower handsomely from the shadows. He doesn't really have much in the way of talent. Nor does his inner struggle convince because he doesn't have the acting ability to pull it off.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart on the other hand brings an effective presence to Bella. She at least doesn't play her as a swoony schoolgirl. She's an intelligent, driven young woman who doesn't throw herself at Edward. She takes the time to sort out her feelings first. The first half of the film is quite effective the way she pieces together what Edward is from the different clues that come her way. But the problem with Twilight is once she knows what he is, there's nowhere else for the film to go.<br/><br/>The 12A certificate limits the film's options. And when we start getting rival vampires with zero inhibitions, the potential buried within the story can't be acted upon because the material is kept on a short leash. The result is a really quite anodyne vampire picture. In the end, Twilight is a vampire film for those who don't like too much blood and guts. Which is a contradiction in terms. You can't have one without the other. Twilight seems to think you can.<br/><br/>Twilight is not an awful vampire film. But it is a disappointing one. It does make an admirable effort to invest vampires with depth, (unlike a truly awful one like The Lost Boys) but its all played far too safely. The ending leaves the door open for a further saga, but unless they raise that rating, I won't be rushing to see the sequel in the foreseeable future."
"jasleen_kaur","7","1","4","22 December 2008"," Twilight the movie vs Twilight the book in comparison with other film series' adapted from best-selling books
","I agree with the majority of previous comments made about Twilight the movie and like many people who have rushed to watch the movie; I have read most of the series of books and am in the process of moving on to the final book.<br/><br/>I too also believe that not enough attention was placed upon Bella's and Edward's relationship which was the fundamental part of this story. I am not sure whether the director is to blame or the actors themselves.<br/><br/>I found the personality of the character of Bella come across a little too aggressive and she is supposed to be seen as an innocent girl. The scene in where Bella works out Edward is a Vampire seemed too easily done in the sense that in the book, it was done in the car journey after they eat at the restaurant and I believe she never does out right say he is a Vampire in front of him. However, I do believe this was put in the film to get the adrenaline going which I do not protest against.<br/><br/>The prom scene was all wrong. Bella is supposed to be dreading going to the prom and in some ways irritated with Edward, yet she willingly goes with him to the prom in the film.<br/><br/>Another important scene in terms of showing their relationship develop is the scene in the book where there is a Biology less which involves blood and Bella seems like she is going to faint and I believe it is Mike who wants to take Bella to the medical place. However, half way there Bella decides to lie down on the pavement for a while and then Edward comes to pick her up despite her stubbornness to stay on the pavement and takes her to the medical place himself. I believe this scene may have aided in showing the development of their relationship much better in the film.<br/><br/>I completely understood why James and his coven were seen at the start of the film but only at the end of the book and I believe this was helpful in making the film captivating.<br/><br/>I also believe there was something missing from Edward's personality in the film compared to the book; I'm not entirely sure what.<br/><br/>Although with every film there are also great features. I believed the special effects were great and they weren't too over the top or too mellow. The baseball scene was awesome and better than described in the book. Rosalie's acting was great as well as Alice's to some extent. Bella's suffering after she is bitten by James is depicted excellently and we feel the pain with Bella. I also loved the idea of showing how James was killed at the end which isn't described so well in the book. I thought when Bella explains to Edward during the prom that she wants to become a Vampire and Edward asks her if she is ready now and she puts her head back and he puts his mouth in position to bite her was done very well.<br/><br/>The craze of Harry Potter here in the UK is said to match up with the craze of the Twilight saga in the States, and I must point this out that Twilight after its premier here was said to beat Harry Potter's record and I believe it will not be able to as after reading the Harry Potter books I felt the movies matched up much more precisely to the films and they didn't fail to even captivate the readers who knew what to expect and Warner Bros managed to go one step further in impressing the readers as well, which I felt didn't happen with the movie of Twilight.<br/><br/>Finally, I thought it was great that they hinted in the film what was to come in the sequel New Moon which doesn't occur in the book and overall as this film wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be, I hope it was just a warm up as to what is to come in New Moon, Eclipse and probably Breaking Dawn, because the team have got their work cut out for the upcoming films of those books. _____________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>I just want to say also, is that seeing it for a second time does really help. Especially when you go with people who are also as interested in the Twilight series as you are. I learnt to like it the second time because I already knew what to expect and saw it for what it was and it did change my pessimistic views slightly...but not immensely. I still believe Warner Bros. could have done a better job and I think I should be glad their changing the Director for the sequel, New Moon."

","Meet Bella. Bella just moved from a warm place to a very cold place. Bella is an outcast - knows no one in the high school she rolls into, doesn't know the town or the people that live in it. Meet Edward. Edward has been living in the cold town for ages and he's an outcast too, but in an entirely different way. When the two of them get together the story starts rolling.<br/><br/>Based on a book this film is the first film to be made out of the series of books and I'm looking forward to seeing the next part. I've never read the books and I probably never will, but as a film this one works out pretty well. The growing romance between the two isn't half bad as it plays out and the response of the world around them is believable in many extends.<br/><br/>The main characters play their roles correct enough and the general setting of the film feels a bit like a chick-flick but not so bad that it becomes unwatchable for people not falling into that category. I've seen worse, I've seen better, but this looks like a promising start to a trilogy.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 lovers under a dark moon"

","""but dying in a place of someone I loved, seems like a good way to go¬Ö.""<br/><br/>It can happen. Even words like courageous, passionate, inquisitive and daring can describe a girl. If he was a teenager, Count Dracula would be proud. Bella, a young, deeply passionate, teen aged human girl and a not so young, if not even more passionate, (am) seventeen year old vampire boy, Edward meet, greet and fall in love. They fight the odds to stay together. There are both good and bad vampires in the mix, all gorgeous (because ugly vamps don't sell movie tickets :) and there's a number of decent human souls as well. To my surprise, young or old, they all delivered fine performances. Then, again, I am just a cat. I give mucho kudos to what I liked best about Twilight - direction. The setting, the blocking, the lighting, the film in general - Catherine Hardwicke rules! The books are great and Melissa Rosenberg wrote a nice script, but Hardwicke made the film for me. The action is great, the inaction if even greater and combined with a fabulous soundtrack, Twilight is absolutely kickerz! Some say Twilight is the poster child film for teen abstinence. Others go as far as labeling the genre abstinence porn. I say: get a dark side, folks! This is a vampire. He doesn't want to get into her pants, he wants to get into her veins! The picture is great.

"ecorig","8","1","4","21 December 2008"," Was great, but once again not as good as book
","Let's face it, nothing (no film or T.V series) will ever be as good as the book it is based on, but it was a good effort. The chemistry was there, good casting and the extra scenes (fight scenes with nomads, making dinner for Bella at the Cullens house, etc) were all very good and detrimental to the movie plot. I thought Charlie was also very well cast, and the relationship between him and Bella was exactly like the book. I wished that they brought more of Edwards ""cockyness"" to the script, that seemed to be a little lacking. I would have liked more of the meadow scene (my personal favorite in the book), and the kiss they share...well, it was nothing at all like the book. And they should have put Esme in more. But I would still recommend it to all the twilight fans, just enjoy seeing all your favorite characters brought to life!"
"horsesrock901","7","1","4","20 December 2008"," Loved it, but could have been better
","Overall, I thought that this movie was good, not the greatest, but definitely enjoyable. It was cast really well and some of the scenes were great. The dialogue tended to be cheesy and there were a lot of parts that weren't supposed to be funny that had the whole theater laughing.<br/><br/>The cast of the film was great! I thought that everyone was perfect for their roles, especially Alice, Emmett, Edward, and Charlie. Charlie was spot on and exactly like the character in the book. I also liked the cast of Forks kids, although I doubt that Forks is that diverse. Kristen definitely needs some acting lessons though. Sometimes characters over acted but when they settled into their parts they were great. I love the characters of Alice and Jasper and Emmett, and they were totally de-emphasized in the movie.<br/><br/>Edward and Bella's relationship definitely happened too fast in the movie. I've been rereading the book and they talk a lot about everything possible. There should have been a lot more development. One thing that bugged me was in the book the meadow scene is one of the most important, where Bella and Edward pledge themselves and pour their souls out to each other. In the movie all they did was lie down and look at each other. Edward's reaction in biology class when he first met Bella was ridiculously over the top and never once in the movie did they say ""I love you""<br/><br/>I wished they would have told the histories and background stories of the Cullens/Hales and said what Jasper's ability was, as it would have made more sense to people who haven't read the books why he looked in pain all the time.<br/><br/>The special effects could have used some work, especially the sparkling. However, I thought the baseball scene was great, one of my favorites. The flour-like white makeup, especially on Carlisle, was terrible looking. I've seen other movies where they manage to make the characters look very pale and it looks real, so hopefully for the next movie they'll get a better makeup crew.<br/><br/>I think while the story of James wasn't as important, they had to include it in the movie to help it appeal to a wider range, guys mostly. I loved the action scene, though it wasn't in the book, and I thought James was delightfully evil and cruel. He gave me shivers.<br/><br/>Summit fired Catherine Hardwicke for New Moon, so hopefully the next director will be a lot better. I think she caused most of the problems in this movie."
"coop720","4","1","4","20 December 2008"," Mediocre flick
","I found out about Twilight when Paramore were posting about their new songs in the film a a few months ago before the huge parade of Robert fanatics appeared. <br/><br/>I told my girlfriend because it's the kind of thing she'd be into and she read all the books in just under 2 weeks before the film trailers were released and was insanely hyped up about the film (not about Robert Pattinson).<br/><br/>As soon as the trailer was released I instantly saw what it was, just one of those really successful novels turned into a Hollywood abortion full of terrible script and dialogue and poor representation of what the fans actually read in the books, just so the production companies can make some money off the fans. Sigh ...<br/><br/>So I endured the horrible screams of girls (and a few lads) at every corner and waited for it to come out.<br/><br/>When my girlfriend forced me to see it, I literally couldn't think of a worser way to spend two hours of my life. <br/><br/>So heres the negatives: - Bad acting - Pattinson and Stewart (I think is how you spell it) did not work as a good combination. Her blankness ruined pretty much 3/4 of the film and Robert tried to compensate with his fairly OK acting, but it seemed to fail with her around. The scenes with just Edward were fine, but there were not many. Everyone else had minor parts, which were fairly OK, but James (the Tracker vampire) was a really bad villain and seemed to ruin the last speedy minutes he was in.<br/><br/><ul><li>Sped up scenes - Even though the film is 2 hours long, there is a lot of scenes which just move way too fast for you to really catch everything or start to enjoy them. The first hour and a bit were really strung out though even though the scenes were really short.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Far-fetched - Some things were really far-fetched especially when Bella is bloody going off to meet James. No person would be that stupid would they? And so many of the things in it are just hard to believe during the social things (like Bella when she first meets Edward, I wont ruin it too much.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No colour and depressing - I don't know what it is, but the film is SO colourless and depressing right up until the Prom which was definitely a saviour of the movie. So don't watch this if you're suicidal or scared of grey and black.</li></ul><br/><br/>There's a lot more things that you can figure out yourself, but thats not all.<br/><br/>Positives: - The musical arrangement - There was a lot of good composition during the movie that really did help the mood, but some of the songs did not totally fit. Such as Muse in the baseball scene really didn't work for me.<br/><br/><ul><li>The ""climax"" - This film was so anti-climactic, but I think the climax with the fight scene between James and Edward was quite good but was over WAAAAAAAAAAY too quick. That was a highlight</li></ul><br/><br/>I can't really think of anymore but it was definitely more negative than positive. Bella really ruined it along with her acting and unconvincing social skills.<br/><br/>But for Twilight fans and movie-goers not as serious as me, it's one for you.<br/><br/>For non-Twilight fans and serious movie-goers, give it a miss, its really not that special.<br/><br/>Overall : 4.5/10<br/><br/>AKA: ""S'alright"""

","Well, this comment is for all the people, the ones who read the book and the ones that don't. I personality read the book and i was anxious to see it, but i didn't get my hopes done, cause i knew it won't be good like the book, well....<br/><br/>it wasn't, but it isn't a bad thing. you see, the book is almost to romantic, but in the film there was more action- a good thing indeed! the dialogs unfortunately wasn't that good, but they weren't that much dialogs so thats OK. I can tell you one thing- you will for sure laugh at this movie- and a lot, and if you like the movie its because this, and because ROBERT PATTINSON. He was excellent for the roll, but I didn't like Bella, well because it wasn't much Bella. Kristen played OK but she just didn't play Bella good enough for me. I think for the money that cost to do the movie (35 m?) its a very good movie! My friends who didn't read the book really enjoyed it, and me, at first i was a little disappointed, but it happened to me all the time, and thats because it was different from the book and i wasn't use to it. Now? i really want to see it again! look at the movie like a movie, and don't like a book- and I can guarantee you enjoy it!<br/><br/>And sorry for my poor English- it isn't my Language, so i hope you understand it."

","Before I start I'd like to just say despite completely loving this film (I saw it yesterday and am now taking my sister to see it Wednesday!) I understand why some people will hate it...<br/><br/>Personally I think it was amazing, the chemistry was perfect and actors/actresses were incredibly well cast. Alice was just perfect, Jasper was good (although some of his reactions were slightly laughable), Emmett surprised me I wasn't sure when I saw the trailers but he was actually well suited, Rosalie was brilliant, sassy and full it attitude, Bella and Edward I could feel the chemistry oozing from the cinema screen they were just incredible!<br/><br/>and it was just amazing. It drew you in and suddenly you were in this world where vampires attend high-school and sparkle and play baseball (Love Alice's Pitch for the record) and then there's the reluctant whirlwind romance of our two amazing main characters which somehow just works.<br/><br/>I've read the books and adore them, they're almost poetic in places. And while I do wish there were a few scenes that I feel should be in there I love the film it's a wonderfully done adaptation and gives me high hopes for the sequel.<br/><br/>However I see why people may not enjoy it. It is romantic...incredibly romantic and for those looking for an action packed Vampire film this really is not for you.<br/><br/>I do however recommend it highly as what it is, a beautifully done adaptation of a beautiful book.<br/><br/>Enjoy!!"

","I was a bit sceptical when I heard that the book was being made into a movie but, honestly, I've never been more satisfied in my life!!<br/><br/>I love the way Catherine Hardwicke used the camera to create an abstract effect. Speaking for someone who has only just seen the movie, (It came out on the 19th in the UK)I'd have to say I have no idea what the other people who reviewed this movie watched but I think they must've taken a wrong turn and gone in to see another movie because I enjoyed it A lot- despite all the screaming fan-girls. :D I was SO not one of them.<br/><br/>Seriously though, I told myself not to repeatedly compare it to the book as I knew that no matter how hard they tried, they could never put on screen what I saw in my head when I read it. <br/><br/>I think Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart played their parts amazingly well and were very believable. I was definitely drawn in from the moment it began. Everyone in the cinema even clapped at the end, which is a rare thing for the British >.< 10/10!!"

They all cheered when certain people came on, and stood up to clap at the end.<br/><br/>However, as an amateur actress myself, I was vaguely disappointed in the acting. There seemed little way that these actors could really 'do their thing' as 80% of the entire thing was incredibly uncomfortable closeups.<br/><br/>funny spoof;(www.cracked.com ---- if twilight was 10 times shorter and 100 times more honest.)<br/><br/>Another thing that really got me, was the sheer number of times Kristen Stewart can flutter her eyelashes in such a short space of time!

"marianne-grace-x","8","1","4","19 December 2008"," A really good teen film and a decent adaptation of the book.
","I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to book adaptations; especially adaptations of books I love such as Twilight, so I went into the cinema full of anticipation but knowing full well that I could leave disappointed. I didn't. I was pleased and impressed with the casting and acting, though it's clear that as the film went on some of the actors settled better into their roles (Robert Pattinson being one of those; though he was a good Edward all the way through, there were times were he was a little TOO dark!). The scenery was fantastic and beautiful, and the writing stayed true to the book and they didn't really skip anything that important. All the iconic scenes were there (at which some of the younger and more irritating fan girls screamed, giggled and 'oohed' and 'ahhed' at.. though I have to say, that's one of the few things I can actually complain about), and some of the dialogue was lifted straight from Stephenie Meyer's well loved pages. <br/><br/>Some people are going into the cinema and what exactly are they expecting? They know it's a teen vampire romance flick, so why are they leaving saying 'ahh there's vampires and TEENAGERS in this film, how would that ever happen?!'. You all know the plot line, you know it's a bit of light hearted fun for teenagers (or older!) with action carefully mixed in here and there. <br/><br/>Overall I'd say Catherine Hardwicke did a good job though some of the camera work (where it pans around and upside down and vertically, etc) did make me feel sick - though this may be the effect of the big screen; I'll have to wait for the DVD to see whether this is the case!<br/><br/>Look out for the baseball scene, most of the high school scenes, the scenes with Bella and her father (Charlie), and the meadow scene, I'd say they're some of the highlights!

"seiya_fan","8","1","4","19 December 2008"," So it was't perfect . . .
","I went to the movie, not with high expectations but I did go expecting something that would entertain me and solidly resemble the Twilight book and I think that was what this movie was. So what if the script was a little cheesy and melodramatic but honestly, so is the book. It's not as easy to tell that the book is a tiny bit over the top when you're just reading it but hearing it out loud does sound a little unnatural. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book! It's just that some of the dialogue felt a little over the top sometimes.<br/><br/>It was kind of annoying to hear crazy tweens screaming every time Edward appeared on the screen but I went to see Twilight again the following Tuesday at 11:30 AM and all of the screaming tweens were in school and it was a lot easier to concentrate without them . . .<br/><br/>While I think that some of the scenes were a bit too ""artsy"" and lost on the teen audience that this film was intended for (I really think that Catherine Hardwicke was a poor choice for a director) in my opinion, there were two extremely well done scenes: the baseball scene and the scene in the ballet studio. They were just visually perfect! <br/><br/>As far as the casting goes, I did have some qualms with some of the actors chosen but nothing big, mostly just their outer appearance which when casting should be a factor but really the acting should be a bigger factor. I thought the acting on almost everyone's part was very well done. I think the best performances given in this film were by Peter Facinelli, Ashley Greene and Robert Pattinson. I felt that they really understood their characters.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked the movie enough to go see it in theaters twice, which is rare for me. I think that there were good and bad aspects about each part of the film and it's not as bad as some people are saying. I can't wait for New Moon!"
"tawisdom","8","1","4","17 December 2008"," Blank and Random
","I did like the movie Twilight very much, probably enjoyed watching Robert Pattinson more than anything; I was a bit disappointed in some of the things that went unnoticed in the film. The book describes Bella and Edward's love so passionate and the movie does not really show how they became so obsessed with each other it was more like OK..i love you. ANd with someone who has not read the books it possiably could be hard to understand their connection. Another thing, everyone is saying that the connection between Kristen and Robert was SO good. But there was NO eye goggling and the passion that was in the eyes of one another when they looked at each other, Kristen's looks were kind of blank to me. I did enjoy the movie a lot though, but I would recommend that everyone should read the books before seeing the movie. I did have to see the movie twice because the first time seemed a little choppy to me (just because I knew what was coming and in the film industry you cannot film an entire novel). Another thing that I was disappointed in was the meadow seen. I thought that is was so randomly placed in the movie, that when they were talking in the woods all of a sudden Edward says 'you have to see what I look like in the sun' in the book it is so elaborately depicted and the movie, to me, did not display this ""magical place""<br/><br/>But all in all I think they did the best that they could and now I am obsessed with the Twilight series and cannot wait for New Moon to come out!!!"

","As an avid Twilight reader, I have to say that for the first 40 minutes, all I could think of was how Summit was absolutely ruining the book. I was so upset that the sequence of events were changed, and that actual moments were shifted and misrepresented to the point that I would have gotten up and left had it not been for Robert Pattinson's awkwardly handsome face. And then, I let go of my attachment to the specifics of the book, and actually started paying attention to the dynamics of the film. It's a very well done adaptation. It's aesthetically pleasing, and is cast very well. The colors are perfect, and the depiction of the awkward relationship between Bella and Edward is at points hilarious, and at other points, poignant. Go see it, if not just to plug into the hype, but to appreciate the differences between the film and the book, and how a film does not need to perfectly copy a book to be just as lovely."

I loved the posters and the previews (mistake number three - those were the best part of the movie experience).<br/><br/>I'm not clear how you can take subject matter that two-thirds of the teenage English-speaking world, and a good portion of the rest, found riveting, and turn it into dreck, but it happened. I was actually so bored during the ""let's run up the tree and share confidences (so confidential we need not involve the audience... we'll just have burgeoning music)"" I nearly walked out. I didn't because I had built this thing up for my husband for months, and I refused to admit I didn't like it.<br/><br/>The make-up was dreadful. I expected something like Johnny Depp in Willy Wonka - I got John Waters. The dialog seemed non-existent, and inadequate at best. I liked the actors, but I'm sure I'm showing my age, when I say that I just didn't get why Edward had to have more hair in that odd cut than Wolverine. My husband hadn't read the books, and he didn't feel like there were gaps in the story (actually, he didn't feel there was much of a story) so maybe reading the book didn't make a huge difference...but that's the only reason why I stayed through the whole movie.<br/><br/>I think I'll hang on to my money when the next one comes out.

"Iloverabbits","4","1","4","16 December 2008"," Alert: Must read ""Twilight"" before looking at the Movie!
","Where to begin. Well I have read the entire twilight saga recently. I read the book before I saw the movie Twilight. The movie isn't bad, but it isn't good either. The movie strayed so far from the content of the book and left so many questions unanswered. Firstly, the pace of the film is a problem. The scenes with Bella and Edward are so short that the audience doesn't really get the notion that they are madly in love with each other! (Bella is willing to risk her life and become a vampire for Edward. And Edward is willing to expose his coven just to be near Bella) And if someone watching the movie has never read the book they wouldn't understand why the characters were suddenly confessing their feelings to one another so fast. For example, when Edward asks Bella to meet his parents in the movie it seems rushed, but in the book there are plenty of scenes of Edward and Bella falling in love before this. Secondly, the most important scenes in the book are not even in this movie, or are, but not depicted correctly. Examples are the meadow scene and the blood type scene. With the meadow scene in the book, Bella and Edward finally open up to one another, and confess their undying love. Edward simply touching Bella's cheek brings a chill in the reader's spine. The scene is very romantic and important for the overall story of ""Twilight."" Yet, in the movie the meadow scene lasted less than 3 min. and consisted of Edward and Bella lying near each other staring into one another's eyes. Also the fact that Edward in the book had asked Bella if she wanted to go to the secret meadow (i.e a Date) showed the reader that he did like Bella. However, the movie completely ignores this and has Bella walking into the woods outside of her school for some odd reason. And when Edward follows her he tells her in what is supposed to be a scary voice, that she has to see how he looks like in the sun. (Cue the scary music) This made the whole scene unromantic. And then there are the actors!!! While I thought all of Bella's human friends were well casted, Edward and his family were not. Except for Alice, I thought she was perfect. The rest of the family seemed out of place. Especially Jasper...Was he trying to make people laugh with that face? And then there is Edward himself. It's simply way overdone, and overacted, but Edward isn't the main problem, It's Kristen's Bella. I have seen other movies this actress has played in, and she always brings a depressed vibe to all her characters. She portrays Bella as twitchy, certain, and extremely melancholy. Moreover, Bella in this movie appears to not really care for Edward. This can be assumed by the lack of personality Bella shows around him. She barely even laughs. So all in all this movie could have been much better, and it fell short. But a reader of Twilight will most likely find joy in merely seeing the few scenes that were adapted from the book."

","when i first heard of the twilight series i figured that it was just some stupid romance. finally, after hearing all the positive and negative reviews(and seeing several of the trailers on TV, i decided that i couldn't fully have my own opinion of the books until i read them. i was a bit surprised when reading twilight. it was not something like the house of night series or any of those other stupid romance novels. it was about 2 people who loved each other to the core but whose romance was perilously dangerous. what makes this romance so additctingly sweet is that it is taboo/forbidden fruit(whatever you want to call it). both protagonists can't be as close to each other as they want to be because of the danger of one injuring/accidentally killing the other.<br/><br/>anyway, i can also see why this book got such awful reviews from more""mature"" readers. Edward Cullen and Isabella swan-charming as thy are- are in a well disguised obsessive and somewhat self destructive relationship. there's Edward-who before finally getting with Bella spied and followed her, and then there's Bella- who couldn't last 1 hour without Edward. I'm not saying that Stephanie Meyer is a poor writer-on the contrary, i believe she is very good. its easy for someone to write about the negative aspects of a relationship in novel and able to get it across the reader that thats bad. its much much much harder to write about the above mentioned but make it seem like its o.k maybe even romantic. and thats what mer did- she made the whole Edward spying and Bella""cant live without Edward"" thing seem what was supposed to be in relationship, what is o.k. she was able to get the reader to think that that wasn't obsessive at all. but enough of that back to the movie review:<br/><br/>i was very disappointed with Catherine hardwicke's take on twilight on the big screen. the chemistry between Edward and Bella had nothing leading up to it-it just popped out of nowhere, suddenly they were in love. also the dialog and special effects were very cheesy and poor. they really could have done without the long voice overs to. if they are making new moon into a movie, i just hope to god that Catherine hardwicke either gets better at her job or someone better gets to direct because if she gets to do this again then shes going to ram the franchise into the ground and add more to twilights dwindling reputation. and as for my title- to all you twilight fans who loved the movie because Edward is beautiful-STOP MAKING REVIEWS BECAUSE THE LEAD CHARACTER IS HOT! LOOK BEYOND THE PRETTY FACE!!!! look at the story,the plot, then write!"

","My fianc√©' had wanted to see this movie and I had been putting it off for weeks. I consider myself a serious film goer, and had no interest in seeing a tween targeted movie. I do not know if it was because I expected to hate it, but going in with very little knowledge and low expectations I found Twilight quite enjoyable. The acting was surprisingly good, the setting was beautiful and the story kept me going. I would give it a solid B. If I had to give the film any criticism at all, it would have to bee that the Cullen family all looked too good. It was like a vampire supermodel convention. I was pleasantly surprised to see Peter Facinelli in this film, he has always been one of my favorite ""under the radar"" actors. All in all I would recommend this film as a great popcorn movie."
"featherly24","8","1","4","13 December 2008"," I liked it ...I simply don't get postings on here.
","I have to disagree with a ton of the ratings on here. I have seen this movie numerous times, now. I think it improves each time I see it. I am 28 years old, not a fan girl, not emo. Not into that scene. But I love the books. But I am huge HUGE reader. The books aren't Pulitzer prize winners but they are fun and they speak to the girl who loves men with a Mr.Darcy complex in me. As well as the girl who developed a weird thing for vampires when I was 12 and read LJ Smith books. I thought it was an interesting interpretation of the book. I have seen a ton of books made into movies and most fail miserably...but we go into those movies with expectations that they will be based completely on the books. A movie can never include all the great parts of the book. When we watch a movie we lose some of the insights we get from the narrator's dialogue. Somethings, when translated to screen, come across comical or silly...like Edward's reaction to Bella in the Science room. But how can one bring the drama of both their thoughts about what another to the scene in their severity with no dialogue...big reactions. We all need to honest parts of Twilight are kind of hokey and cheesy like that lion and lamb stuff...I mean who says that...really. I think under the circumstances the brought the essence of the book to the screen. I like the idea of vampires who aren't like vampires. The novels seem to be more about temptation, chastity, self-discipline, co-dependency...than about vampire love. The fact that the vampire aren't fanged and seem more human makes the story less fantastic and more accessible. I thought Rob was great. There are a couple of question moments in the acting and dialogue but overall I thought they were great. It is called a dramatic interpretation...main word - interpretation. I enjoyed the weaving of humor throughout to make the story less Romeo and Juliet dramatic. I like Nikki Reed but I think it was a bad decision to cast her as Rosalie. All the other Cullens are perfect. When I go see a book adaption, I walk into it with low expectations and hope for the best...I was pleasantly surprised..."
"slarync","7","1","4","13 December 2008"," Nice movie, but a bit overrated
","I went to watch Twilight with my friends, and I was excited to see it from all the good hype, the dark theme and the aspiring trailer. And guess what, I wasn't disappointed. As I am the critic between my friends, they went by my opinion and some of them REALLY liked it as some other thought of it as ""Yeah, it was good."" <br/><br/>For me, Twilight was good, but not as great as people overrated it. Teens used to overrate things like High School Musical and its sequels, which I find silly from my side, mainly because of their lightweight storyline and constant teen-pop, but also rated well Hannah Montana, the nice show with not-bad pop-rock and good comedy and plot. I was confused whether to watch Twilight or not at first, but when I saw the trailer and also continued to know the plot spoiler from here, I had to watch it. It was fun.<br/><br/>Pros and Cons:<br/><br/>PROS:-<br/><br/>-The dark theme is well done, and Pattinson is good for Edward's role.<br/><br/>-The cheesiness is much cut out, unlike Disney movies, and the characters do actually suite what teens are today (e.g. Eric) <br/><br/>-Effects, semi-intense scenes, soundtrack and emotions are well presented and well done.<br/><br/>-The relationship is more realistic than in other teen movies, and is truly deep.<br/><br/>CONS:-<br/><br/>-The entrance of the movie was partly bad and confusing. For people who did not read the book, it did confuse a bit. Thanks God I understood what was happening because I read a synopsis earlier. <br/><br/>-The chase of Bella Swan was given good timing, but is a bit disappointing for who saw the trailer. It is not given enough time to make it a good movie chase, but it is not that bad. <br/><br/>-If you can wait for a DVD, it's better if you want quiet watching. The hype of teens completely ruins the movie with constant laserpen pointing, girly screams, fights, booting and other mess. I hate hyped movies, especially when they're good to watch but not in theaters.<br/><br/>To be or not to be, to watch or not to watch?<br/><br/>TO WATCH OR NOT TO WATCH<br/><br/>-Watch if you like dark themes, thrillers, romance, drama, action, vampires, dark but not horror, semi-horror, serious teen movies.<br/><br/>-Don't watch if you like constant action, constant effects, or hate corny-joke movies, dark movies and instant-relation movies. <br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>That makes it up for me and you all out there. I tried to be as fair as I could, and that's what I came up with. :)"
"paintbeforeassembly","6","1","4","13 December 2008"," Good...if you keep an open mind.
","I can see how some people might dislike the movie, especially if they go into it with the idea of ""vampire movie"" in their head, because really this is more of a teen vampire romance. The studio did the viewers no real favors by pitching this with a more action-style trailer, because this isn't an action packed movie -- the tension between the characters is everything. However, I went into it, both knowing what kind of movie it was, expecting something so-so and keeping an open mind; and I enjoyed it much, much more than I had expected to.<br/><br/>It was fairly fun, quite interesting, and I found some of the slightly different angles taken with the vampires to be intriguing. Some people have complained that the romance angle was predictable, but I think that the differences of the relationship presented by this particular take on the vampire myth really change the dynamic around a lot. There are elements that you could guess, but there are plenty of others that you might not, and a few small twists and ideas made this entirely worth the watching for me.<br/><br/>I also found the movie to be quite funny at times, but I had picked up from my wife (who read the books) a few ideas about what was going on under the surface, so I don't know how many of those funny situations would be lost on people who watched the movie without seeing it. However, if you chose to watch this movie with an open mind, and left the idea of ""vampire flick"" outside the door, I think you'd probably enjoy this film a lot."
"audreyway1","Null","1","4","12 December 2008"," in reply to Twilight's movie goofs
","I was on the movie goofs section for Twilight and there's a few that are wrong.It's obvious that people who check the goofs have not read the books.Well here are a few of the things that should be corrected; the scene where James' reflection is seen in the mirrors at the ballet studio is not a goof because the vampires in Twilight are different than the legendary,average vampires.The vampires in Twilight are able to see their reflections. Edward is not actually sleeping in the hospital scene he's pretending because Renee is in the room with Bella. The part where Edward is wearing sunglasses is to conceal himself from the other Cullens because it's dangerous for vampires to hang out with humans,obviously because it endangers both humans and vampires. The Cullens are never seen chewing on food; they touch their food throughout the movie but never eat it or appear to be eating it as it says in the goofs sectiom.When Bella and Edward are in the tree their constant change in position is because their in the tree for a period of time with each other. Jessica says ""Dr. and Mrs. Cullen"" not ""Dr. and Mr. Cullen"" as it states in the goofs section. Bella's right leg always appears to be broken; and it does not change from left to right ever in the movie as it says on the goofs section. Mace cans come in different colors, which would explain why Charlie gives Bella a green mace can. When the vampires breath and do human things it's for them to appear normal.Bella's been in forks for a few months not just one which would make it possible for edward to watch her and say he's been watching her for a ""few months"".<br/><br/>I'd encourage the people who check the goofs to actually pay close attention to the film and report things that are actually wrong.They should also read the books because half the goofs on the goofs section aren't goofs."
"bg11215","7","1","4","8 December 2008"," Good but a couple things were a little off
","I don't know if I think what's-her-name as Bella was right for the role. I just wasn't totally convinced by her performance. I thought it could have been fleshed out lot more. Though that could have been the directing. A few scenes I think could have been re-done to tweak them for more clarity and dramatic effect. But overall I liked it. The forbidden love part of it touched me the most. The guy who played Edward Cullin was perfect for the role I thought. And very handsome. It touched me how he was attracted to her and was this monster at the same time. So really he wasn't a monster inside. He had a human aspect to his character."
"somak_halder","6","1","4","7 December 2008"," Average movie with a dark shade
","Well guys, this is going to be my first movie review so it will be a bit rusty, bear with me. Just now I came home after watching ""Twilight"", supposedly a 'vampire' love story. Well I can't see I am very much impressed, I have seen much better vampire movies (did I tell you that I am a fan of ""good"" vampire movies?). But this one was not total disaster as well, the director was in fact creative at times. Frankly speaking I didn't expect it to be that much 'dark'. And its the dark shade in it that impressed me. The location, the acting, the silence, the weather, almost everything; the director surely wanted to throw some gloomy stuff and let me tell ya, she (I guess I am right) is successful in that. But the storyline and script, sorry to say, wish were as impressive. Kristen as Bella Swan acted as the perfect and helpless damsel-in-distress, but at times she acted too much 'helpless', as if she didn't have a clue what's happening. The others were so-so. I didn't understand the reason behind bringing the character played by Cam Gigandet (that guy played a powerful character as Kevin Volchok in the ever popular show ""O.C""). I mean why suddenly he will be after Isabella's life like crazy is still unclear to me (I mean there are so many more ""bella's"" around to feast upon, right?)!! Anyways overall its an average movie but a couple of points for the dark shade, I really enjoyed that part."
"itisarramscl","8","1","4","7 December 2008"," Loved It!
","I loved this movie! I know it was extremely cheesy, they moved the camera around too much, there was really bad music in the background. I still liked it though. I think most of the characters were bang on! The only one I pictured differently was Esme. I pictured her to be more motherly. She looks 17 as well! I also thought Angela would be a blonde. Emmett was perfect though! It's too bad he didn't have a bigger part. If you read the goofs, beware, some of them are false accusations! When it says James had blood on his lip during the fight scene and vampires don't bleed, keep in mind he just bit Bella. Of course he had blood on his lip, it was hers! Also when it says in the hospital Edward is sleeping, he's only faking it for Rene√®'s sake. If you've read the book you should know that."
"yodabucky","7","1","4","5 December 2008"," Twilight the movie vs. Twilight the Book
","I totally agree. Although I enjoyed how the characters were depicted and felt they were quite developed, I felt the rest of the movie was too choppy. After being a fan of all the Twilight Saga for so long, I thought that the movie should have been allow an extra 1/2 to 1 hour more to convey the full story of the first book. I think if it had been directed in the style of the Harry Potter movies or Narnia, much of the depth of the book would not be lost as it was translated into a movie. I appreciate the fact that they took on this venture, but felt it was not all I hoped it to be. But, alas I have now seen it online several times, and still crave to see more of how Edward and Bella's lives will be depicted in New Moon when it comes out in movie form."
"rockergirl2067","5","1","4","1 December 2008"," disappointing but not bad
","I am huge twilight fan, reading the books before i heard there was even going to be a movie. I admit i was excited to see the movie. I saw it the day it opened, Friday night. A HUGE line formed, full of excited twilight and Edward fans. While waiting to get in for the movie, me and my friends met up with our other friends who saw it before us. Most f them, mostly who haven't read twilight or read it a week before the movie came out. were THRILLED about the movie, which unfortunately got me more excited. When we got in girls SCREAMED when the movie started. It started nice and slow, the way it should've. Edward came up(who i admit is VERY hot) and the theater was filled with screams and shrills. Every time he would do something romantic or hot, they would scream, it did get annoying and probably would've enjoyed the movie a bit more without them.<br/><br/>Here's my main problem with the movie. They cut out WAY too much. I have a feeling if they took it slower and add more juicy it would have been better. I think hey got the cast pretty much perfect and that they weren't able to reach their full potential. I ended up leaving the teather pleased with the cast but disappointed. I just hope they take it slow for New Moon. I KNOW they can do better"
"ashna_rocks96","6","1","4","29 November 2008"," this was...
","First of all, I am a die hard Twilight fan and I absolutely adore the books. When I saw the trailer,I thought it would be horrible and it...<br/><br/>was. I wanted the movie to be as good as the books but the movie could not compare . For the most part, I thought the Cullen's were good actors but not the main characters. Casting Bella was a crucial part of the story and I thought Kristen Stewart did a horrible job.My favorite character in the series was Bella and she did the character no justice.She did not deliver a compelling performance.Bella is supposed to have a certain type of charm bit I felt like she had no emotion .Her voice was monotoned all throughout the movie.I wouldn't have cared if she got eaten by a vampire at the end because she seemed like she was already dead. Robert Pattinson did okay but he didn't do as well as i hoped he would have. Taylor Lautner did a pretty good job and I liked him the best.I felt that the movie was very awkward in a sense because Robert and Kristin lacked a whole lot of chemistry.I felt like in just 2 days they fell in love when they should have expanded on their relationship. I wanted to make myself believe that this was a good movie but I couldn't.I was deeply saddened about this movie because the book are so amazing and this wasn't."
"chukkagirl","6","1","4","22 November 2008"," Casting great, too much brooding, ""fast"" special effects -- puh-leeze!
","First of all, I enjoyed reading all the books (well, maybe with the exception of the fourth one - ugh), so I really enjoyed seeing the characters come to life on the screen. The casting was really well done; RP is certainly close to what I pictured as Edward -- very believable.<br/><br/>Secondly, the scene at the theater made me glad I attended opening night -- total mob scene of teenagers! I'm a 48YO mom, and it was just amusing to be so outnumbered. Wow.<br/><br/>I went expecting to be somewhat underwhelmed, but actually the movie was entertaining. A tad too much somber broodiness, which would have been alleviated with perhaps some voice-over POV's from at least Edward in addition to more from Bella. If someone hadn't read the book, they'd be left in the dark on a lot of it. What's going on in the character's heads is extremely important, and explains the why's and how's of the dilemma of this relationship.<br/><br/>What I found most disappointing (and yes, I understand that it didn't have a big budget) was the true cheesiness of the special effects. The extremely fast running (in the woods) and climbing around the trees for the most part just looked like they were flying on a wire, or at best, like the movie was fast-forwarding. And that, I felt, was truly distracting and made certain parts feel like a B-movie. I felt bad laughing and rolling my eyes, but really...! But the baseball scene was better than I thought it would be, and the car/rescue scene as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can see why some love it and some hate it. It could have been way better. But all in all, it was an enjoyable film for those like me who enjoyed seeing Stephanie Meyer's books fleshed out (a little) on the big screen."
"USAneworkluver","5","1","4","21 November 2008"," My new favorite movie
","As you can probably tell by the username (twilightfanpire) that I love the Twilight series. I am a die-hard fan. Well, this movie sums up all of my (very high) expectations. The acting was amazing -- Kristen Stewart (Bella), Robert Pattinson (Edward), and Peter Facinelli (Carlisle) portrayed their characters beautifully -- the script was very good, and the soundtrack fits the scenes perfectly. The special effects were slightly detrimental -- they seemed corny and a little old-fashioned for the 21st century. However, I was so engrossed in the movie that I hardly even noticed the iffy FX.<br/><br/>I heard this as very good advice, and so I pass on this to you: don't waste your time trying to compare it to the book. It is relatively close to the book (more so than, say, the Eragon, or Da Vinci Code movies) although parts have been added or changed to make sense for audiences who haven't read the books. For a while I tried comparing, until I simply gave up and enjoyed the movie. I am disappointed in how the movie introduces the bad guys, James, Laurent, and Victoria (the book's way was better, in my opinion) but I still think this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."

"cloarox","6","1","4","24 November 2008"," Very few movies are as good as the book... So... does that make Twilight a bad movie?
","Warning: Possible spoiler for anyone who hasn't read the book or doesn't know anything about the story line! Search IMDb for any movie adapted from a book and you will see tons of comments about how bad the movie was.<br/><br/>When reading a book there is more time for character development. You get to hear what the characters are thinking and feeling. You form images in your mind of what they look like, what their voices sound like etc. Unfortunately some books (like the Twilight series) emphasize the characters attributes to such a degree that its almost inevitable you'll be disappointed as to how the characters are portrayed in the film. More often than not they fail to capture the detail of your minds eye.<br/><br/>For instance, an earlier reviewer said they were disappointed with the way Edward's skin glistened in the sunlight. Granted, while the film did not even come close to capturing the dazzling, glittering spectacle of Edwards skin as described by the author in the book, the films special effects would be more than satisfactory to the average movie buff unfamiliar with the book. That said, I had my own disappointments. When Edward and his siblings first appeared in the school scene I was shocked by the poor application of makeup used in the movie in an attempt to make them look dead. I thought they looked more like a family of Mimes! Edward, with his pancake makeup, eyeliner and lipstick. Yuck! It didn't work for me. I wasn't expecting the drag queen persona. One can only assume the makeup applied to the characters that portrayed the Cullen family was the directors attempt to make them look dead, (or at least like vampires¬Ö)The poor use of makeup. Carlisle Cullen, (Edward's father), was almost comical in appearance. Rather than looking like my idea of the distinguished handsome doctor described in the book he looked more like a cast member from Bob Fosse's movie Cabaret. The raspberry colored lips and eye makeup applied to the Cullen men had them looking like leftovers from a Glam rock band of the 1980's.<br/><br/>As stated earlier, when reading the book you develop your own ideas about what the characters look like and how the scenes are portrayed. When reading the book I found myself asking ""How in the world will the film even come close to capturing the feeling, excitement and suspense of the baseball game?"" It didn't! The book did a much better job of explaining why the Cullen family played during thunderstorms. Watching the film you almost get the idea they only played in the rain because they had less chance of being seen by outsiders, rather than using the storm to mask the sounds they created when playing.<br/><br/>Just because a movie fails to capture the same level of excitement as the book, does it make it a bad movie? No, it just makes it a movie that is not as good as the book. Plain and simple.<br/><br/>Could Twilight have been done better. Yes, without a doubt! Considering the intended audience for this film, will the same group of people also turn out to see ""New Moon"" if it gets released to film? That's highly doubtful.<br/><br/>Based on this films mediocre portrayal of the Twilight book... would I go see New Moon? Probably not, I'll probably wait for the DVD release. The only exception will be if it gets rave reviews from members here in IMDb. I personally don't care what the professional film critics have to say about a movie, regardless of what radio or television network they work for. However I do care what members of this web site have to say. IMDb provides a genuine cross section of the movie going public. You get the cynical with the flamers and the sincere with the unbiased¬Ö. In other words a TRUE ""average"" of what the viewing public thinks. If reviews by my age group in IMDb say a movie is not good (at least 6.0 or better)¬Ö I typically stay away To my friends I've been recommending ""See the movie first¬Ö then read the book"" NET: If you've already read the book¬Ö try and dismiss all your mental images. Go to the movie knowing it won't be as good as the book and you should be okay. I wasn't expecting to be blown away so I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Without the book promoting the current run of this film, this movie would have been considered to be nothing more than just another B Sci-Fi movie. However, the story line and the character development made this a much better movie than your normal run of the mill science fiction film. I actually found myself pleasantly surprised... especially after reading all the negative reviews."
"barrys82","5","1","4","26 November 2008"," A vampire love chick flick
","Twilight fans from all around the world will hate me for this review. Twilight is very far from being a good movie why, for the reason that it is focused mainly for the female viewer. The movie is about a teenager that leaves Phoenix to to leave with his dad in a little town in Washington and falls in love with fancy and stylish vampire risking her life for this relation in my opinion is kinda corny. If you take the vampire theme out, it is just another love movie and a chick flick. The only good part from the movie is the baseball game scene its maybe the only enjoyable part. The movie is so slow that it may turn tiresome to the viewer. The special effects are lame. The cast formed mainly by new, young actors delivers barely decent performances some of them are even ridiculous. But not everything in the movie is bad, the landscapes from the locations are beautiful and the music is pretty cool. In conclusion, the movie is worthy on for those who are real fans, they will enjoy every part of it. If you're not one of them you might think it twice before seeing it."

","This movie isn't so bad but I find something lacking. I didn't get bored watching the movie but I am not completely satisfied when it's over. I find the special effects pretty dull and it's just like watching a TV episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel. The story is very simple really.. it's about a girl who falls in love with a vampire and the vampire in turn must resist eating her. There's nothing spectacular about the movie, it's plain old story telling. I'm pretty sure the teenage girls would love this movie because of the love story in it but it's definitely just another fairy tale. The actors are decent in this movie, for sure they're not getting an Academy for this but they played it fair."
"lorrainewal","1","13","173","9 June 2009"," Very disappointing
","I couldn't wait to see my favorite book being brought to life on the big screen and instead 'Twilight' was released, in no way did it represent the book, it was an extremely disappointing movie.<br/><br/>I appreciate this was a low budget film but come on..... the only way I knew the plot to this story was because I've read the book, if I hadn't have, I wouldn't have had a clue what this film was about, it felt like I was watching trailers not a movie.<br/><br/>The Cullen's except for maybe Alice and Emmet were all completely wrong, as was Jake and his friends. What was with Jake's hair? You could tell it was false. James was like I imagined, however I thought Victoria had red hair? as for Edward Cullen he was descried as angelic looking, very well turned out wearing designer clothes, graceful and polite and he was none of the above, in fact he was quite the opposite all of the Cullen's were, none of them had the right actions or looks, and why was Bella so miserable and moody she didn't came across that way in the book.<br/><br/>This movie and any others after will only be famous because of the books, and if the first movie Twilight is anything to go by the rest are going to be just as bad if not worse, if they insist on making any more movies then will someone please read the books and interpret the characters, scenes, actions everything correctly before putting us through another bad film, at least that way something good might be produced and worthy to watch.<br/><br/>I would recommend the books to anyone but I definitely tell them to stay well clear of the film/s."

","Just to put my review in the right context: Yes, I am a Twilight series fan. However, my opinion about the movie Twilight has very little to do with that.<br/><br/>It took me about a year after reading the series to finally build up the courage to see the movie. Partly because I didn't want to ruin the faces that my personal imagination had put unto the character's faces and also because a movie rarely is satisfactory after reading the book first. Lord of the Rings being one of the exceptions I can think of right now. <br/><br/>After finally watching the movie I was left mainly feeling embarrassed for Stephenie Meyer and baffled that a movie like that ever made it to the big screen, let alone became such a sensation. The movie just doesn't make sense. And here's my big issue:<br/><br/>I certainly get that movies do not always have to be exact replicas of the books they came from. I have no problem with that. It seems that that is exactly what they tried to do with Twilight, since they certainly added quite a lot of scenes to the movie that are nowhere to be found in the novel and completely changed the setting (and feel) of several key scenes. So they wanted to kind of step away from the book. Fine. Then why, oh why is the movie completely incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't read the book? It's like they haphazardly picked scenes from the book and then threw them into the movie without bothering about continuity or actually connecting them as to make it clear to the viewer what's going on, why and how this all came about. Everyone that I have talked to that had seen the movie without reading the book, admitted they really couldn't make sense of what was going on. Go figure. Either make the die hard fan happy by giving an exact rendition of the book (especially in the key scenes) or throw it all overboard to make a stellar movie mainly based on the book, while taking a lot of liberty in translating the novel to the big screen. Don't jumble it up leaving everyone disappointed.<br/><br/>So if Twilight was some artsy exercise in portraying an erratic dream sequence onto the big screen, then I gleefully will have to admit I didn't get it. But as it stands, it looks more like exactly that: an exercise. An exercise by a film student in his or her first year, where they weren't taught yet how to link scenes together. I am happy New Moon got a new director. Maybe he'll be able to figure out how to adjust a book to the big screen and still have it make sense to everyone, including, for instance, poor boyfriends that got dragged along to the theater but never read the book. I might deep down still not be happy that it's not quite exactly like the novel, but at least it will make sense."

","Ah, where do you begin with something this awful? I have not read the book, so this review is based solely on the merits of the movie itself...and it sucks. I've no doubt if I had read and liked the book, the movie would almost certainly be better even if it didn't live up the expectation of the novel. That said, I never read Harry Potter, either, but enjoy all those films, so the filmmakers of Twilight must have dropped the ball somewhere. I understand the girls think the guy is cute, but the rest of the story is beyond shallow. One of the other comments summed it up perfectly when they asked how a 100+ year old man (in the body of a hot teen boy) finds his intellectual and emotional equal in a 17 year old girl. And she doesn't have anything going for her. She's displaced trailer trash without much of a personality and only modestly attractive. At least make her wicked smart, or have a glowing personality. Yawn. Not enough action, not enough cool vampire stuff, not enough of anything remotely interesting. All I can say is read the book, because the movie is beyond weak."

But it was entirely way too slow. I was bored throughout most of the movie. There were two great scenes, that were really well done. Other than that... blah!

","I came into the theater not only as a Twilight fan, but as a skeptical movie watcher. I had fairly low expectations for the movie, not because of its faithfulness to the book, which was almost spot on, but because its value as good cinematic work. What I was expecting was a poorly scripted, cheesy movie with actors that didn't deliver. Fortunately, for the most part, the movie a satisfactory. But only for the most part.<br/><br/>It was a cute movie. I laughed a lot, especially when Billy Burke and Michael Welch appeared on the screen. They were, in my opinion some of the best actors in the movie. Robert Pattinson nailed the looks and mannerisms of Edward Cullen, although he sometimes left me behind in acting. I'll give her this, Catherine Hardwicke is pretty good at awkward. It certainly lightened up the movie when it could have been nothing more than a droll, teen love story.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in the script. Given, it must have been incredibly difficult to transpose the book onto screen, but there was so much more the screenwriter could have done do make the script more believable. Both Pattinson and Stewart must have had a hard time working with those lines, although I was much more pleased with Pattinson than I was with Stewart. She simply did not seem to be totally into her role. I was left dry with her portrayal, although I believe it had more to do with the script than the actress herself.<br/><br/>But, over all, I saw hope. Even if this wasn't a perfect movie, I saw the potential for better sequels, which everyone knows are coming. I believe it will be easier, as the next two books are better written than the first. But the effort has to be made to improve by everyone involved with the movie, or else the audience will simply give up."

I found that the way the movie was put together was also very choppy. Worth seeing if your a twilight fan, just Don't get your hopes up. A lot of major points didn't exist. :( A teenage romance full of awkwardness and laughs, but not up to par with the book. Kellan Lutz and Nikki Reed played their characters perfectly, with Billy Burke being one of the most interesting supporting characters to watch.

","You're dying. Already. Every second you get closer. Stephanie Meyer's romantic thriller emphasizes the undeniable importance of reaching happiness in one's short life. Human? Vampire? Werewolf? No matter. Love can come from anywhere. Forget the responsibilities instated by society; attraction, affection, and gratification are steadfast in their pivotal positions as the virtues of life. With never-before-seen filming angles, smooth and flowing screen writing, masterful acting, and a remarkable subliminal message, Twilight becomes a peerless cinematographic experience.<br/><br/>The film is cinematically superb. It was seemingly shot with an acidic color filter over the lens for emphasized melodrama in the movie's color palette. The camera also seems to capture scenes from original angles every time, in a completely original way.<br/><br/>The intricately devised plot doesn't need much to tug at your emotions. The very thought of a deep romance unbound by the cruel, dividing line of species is captivating in itself. A romance so deep, that a teenage girl with much of her life ahead of her is compelled to end her life of normality and enter a world of unknown for her love.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the writing is especially strong in the significant design of each character and their incorporation in the main plot line. It seems like there wasn't a character introduced in the movie that hadn't been referred back to at least dozens of times or at least been someone of great importance to the mysteries of the families. The excellent character designs were bolstered by marvelous acting, particularly the work of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, who's performances were smooth enough to make even the most uncomfortable situations seem natural.<br/><br/>In spite of the fantastic performance, however, it is important to recognize the bold, insurgent theme to the movie. Should the protagonist, Bella Swan, be kept from pursuing her sensual desires by the feeble morals bound to her fragmented family? Indubitably not. Why try and mask one's true desires? Desires personified in the mound of glittering soap sculpted into a picturesque heartthrob that is Edward Cullen, who lowers a hook into a sea of vulnerability shared by Bella and countless other young women, and reels in their untainted innocence only to be devoured by his dark enveloping clandestinity.<br/><br/>A movie with such great execution, charm, and powerful meaning will not go unnoticed in cinematographic history.<br/><br/>*Unfortunately for all you twilight adorers, me and a buddy of mine wrote this as a satire for a school assignment. The movie was painfully awful."

There were a few additions that made it odd and in personal opinion it could have been a bit more suspenseful and dramatic and a little more action. With luck, they'll spend more time on the next movies and roll out better details and follow the novel a little closer (though we always hope this will happen it rarely does). But all in all it was a good movie. Definitely going out and buying the soundtrack and the movie once it comes out on DVD in a fancy collectors edition with some super shiny poster or something of the like that they put in those movie boxes nowadays.

"TheNabOwnzz","2","1","5","29 May 2018"," Might as well have been called 'The Zombie love story'
","I reckon it is no secret that Kristen Stewart is quite possibly the worst actress of all time, especially considering that for some weird reason she is hugely popular despite not having any acting talent whatsoever. The idea about creating a romantic love story between her and someone else is just so laughable due to her zombie-like wooden performances that this is such a terrible film that it basically becomes an unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>Well... atleast there is one little thing that Twilight did get right, and that is ( some parts of ) the cinematography. While not consistently visually beautiful some scenes did have some beautiful lightning ( Such as Edward playing the piano ) and some great use of beautiful environments. This is not consistent though, because a lot of the film is also quite pale and grey and ugly, most notably all the scenes that have to do with the school. This is pretty much the only positive thing i took out of this film, though. It is a shallow one dimensional linear clich√©'d love story with such obvious and predictable twists and turns while having a terrible screenplay and terrible acting to enhance it.<br/><br/>I suppose it no secret that the romance between Bella and Edward is not even close to being believeable by anyone that has a working brain and an IQ that reaches over sixty. Ofcourse it doesn't help that you have the worst actress of all time in the role of Bella, but we'll get to that later. Robert Pattinson isn't a very good actor either since he too has zero personality, and this creates an extremely emotionally vacuous kind of romance which leads into the hilariously comicly bad sometimes and cringy all the time. Their attraction for one another makes little sense since a normal human being wouldn't meddle with the kind of sinister weird type of guy that Edward is, and still meddle with him after he keeps threatening her. but i suppose this film isn't clever enough to understand anything about humans or human behavior anyway.<br/><br/>Now i found Scarlett O'Hara for example an incredibly annoying female lead in Gone with the Wind, but it wasn't due to a terrible screenplay or a terrible performance, those were all right in place. It was because she needed to be like that to move the plot forward. What we have in Twilight, however, is an absolutely abyssmal screenplay combined with the worst actress of all time, which results in Bella Swann. 'I don't really like the rain, any cold wet thing i don't really...' 'I mean, you don't even say hi to me'... followed by a 'hi' response are just some basic examples of what a thoughtless mindless dumb insulting screenplay this is. It seems like the scriptwriters wrote this movie specifically for the dim-witted among us since everything is always obvious yet explained about twenty times for no reason. Kristen Stewart unintentionally steals the show with her weird head shaking, zombie like behavior and wooden narration. I sometimes doubt if she is really human since she has no emotional depth whatsoever. Her delivery is absolutely terrible and cringeworthy every single time due to her weird unnatural abnormal behavior.<br/><br/>Now we also have the three villain vampires. The reason these three evil vampires are in the film makes no sense other than having to be there to create the clich√© hero villain kind of situation. I can fathom the fact that the black guy is the only sensible one of the three ( Even though that is such a lazy political message nowadays ), but what i can't stand is that they have absolutely nothing to do with the main characters and even though there are millions of people in the world to feed on, would still go after Bella who is protected by the only creatures in the world that could possibly be a threat to them. What is the entire point behind these villains? It makes no sense, but then again this script makes no sense anyway. Also let's not forget that the main villain also wants to talk to and film Bella a little bit before killing her so that she can be saved. A typical hero villain clich√© once again. <br/><br/>The film could have been a bit better with ANY other lead actress, but it still wouldn't have saved the mediocrity of this script and the insulting nature of the film towards its audience."

You only watch ""real"" movies. ""This is so unfaithful to vampire movies"". ""Kristen Stewart cant act, omg!"" ""It's so cheesy and clich√©.""<br/><br/>I roll my eyes every time I have to read a review about how you rolled your eyes at the film. Watching twilight, for me, was kind of like being sprinkled with pixie dust. It just feels like something magical. If you're going to be obnoxious and start tearing the film apart to compare it to much better pieces, you're going to come out short. Twilight is no cinematic masterpiece, but it is an epic love story. The movie is very cheesy and very clich√© and these things works to it's advantage. It isn't trying to be something more than a fantastical movie about a girl falling in love with a supernatural being and all the glitter that surrounds it. If you take the movie at face value and stop comparing it to better pieces, because that's not at all how you watch a movie (morons.), Then you'll definitely enjoy twilight.<br/><br/>Fyi if you're one of those people who likes to jab Kristen Stewart, I find myself again rolling my eyes. She's an incredible actress, you just have no taste in films. Have you even seen cafe society? Clouds of sils Maria? Personal shopper? Goddamnit, ADVENTURELAND was released around the same time as twilight and it was freaking brilliant. Acting isn't about giving an Oscar worthy performance every time the camera pans to you, it's about fully embodying a character, and she nails Bella as an iconic character in an iconic movie, whether you agree or not."

","I watched 'Twilight' via Netflix one night, as I am a fan of other teen series such as 'Harry Potter.' Sure, this isn't the greatest movie ever, but I still don't think that it deserves 1 star. The people who review it so low are men who get 'dragged' to the movies to watch it with their wives or people who are in love with the book and who obviously think that it should be the exact same narration and speech. Yes, some of the acting should be better (ahem Kristen Stewart). <br/><br/>Kristen Stewart looks the part of Bella, but one thing that I find really annoying is the little 'huh' she makes every time she says something. And her expressionless face. She barely shows any expression but I give her credit for the part where James bites her, when she is in pain from the venom she acts the part well. <br/><br/>Robert Pattinson does great at playing Edward, I feel like he understands his character well.<br/><br/>Ashley Greene is probably the best actor in the series. I believe that she is Alice, not Ashley when she is playing the character.<br/><br/>Billy Burke is the perfect actor for Charlie, and all his witty one- liners show that he is just a good actor. <br/><br/>Nikki Reed also deserves a special mention as her job as Rosalie was great, especially in the 'kitchen scene'. <br/><br/>Overall Twilight is a bad movie for most people but if you can see past Kristen Stewart's acting then you might like it. This is personally to me one of my favorite movies, but everyone has their own opinion."

There are suspected animal attacks but that turns out to be supernatural as well.<br/><br/>It's stupid that vampires have to go to high school. There are lots of things about this movie and this franchise to pull apart. At its core, the movie is saved by a compelling coupling of Stewart and Pattinson.

","I support pretty much every gripe people have against the Twilight series: weak characters, ridiculous vampires, etc. I watched Twilight to have a laugh, and laugh I did.<br/><br/>Good Aspects: Well, the scenery was pretty, I'll give them that. I do like rain and woods, and this movie was full of them. It felt like a slight green tint had been given to the movie and I honestly kind of liked it, but others may not. Also, the idea of a vampire and a normal girl falling in love actually has a lot of potential; this could have been a very thought provoking film if Stephanie Meyers had written the books differently. The way she went about the idea is not something that I like, but I'll give them a few points for the potential it had.<br/><br/>Negative Aspects: My biggest question is this: why in the world is Edward so drawn to Bella? The moment he laid eyes on her he was in love. She really had no personality to speak of and they barely spoke before he became obsessed with her. It felt ridiculous. And him watching her sleep was creepy. This, of course, stems from the book, but it really should have been cut out. Another problem is that most of the vampires aren't threatening. We know Edward has trouble controlling himself, as he doesn't want to hurt Bella, but I never once suspected that he would lose control. And the sparkling? What in the world? The effects they used to make it look like Edward was climbing a tree or that the vampires were running fast were laughable, and the dramatic scene of them playing baseball, while not serious, just felt silly. I'm not an expert on acting skills, but Kristen Stewart's performance left me unimpressed. Pattinson, while not that great, was tolerable, as was his vampire family and the three antagonistic vampires. <br/><br/>In short, the story had potential, but it was terribly wasted. The scenery was good, and it wasn't the absolute worst film that I've seen. But the uninteresting romance and mediocre acting, along with serious moments that were laughable, ruined any chance the film had of being taken seriously."

For starters, and I know this is the most obvious thing in the world, Kristen Stewart has NO emotions. I have seen statues with more facial expressions than her. She is not a very good actress for this role, she lacks depths and does not connect with the role of Bella in any way. This leads onto the next issue, Kristen's lack on emotion has an impact on the chemistry between her and Robert Pattinson a.k.a Edward, in the sense that there was none! Watching their relationship actually felt awkward. Despite all of its faults, the general story line, of Twilight, is decent, a bit clich√©d but decent. Also, the sets and sceneries, in the film, I thought were great, they had a real feel to them, edginess and mystery, exactly what you want in a vampire movie.

I have seen Pattinson and Stewart in other films before, and while they may not be the great actors of our time, I certainly think they deserved better than the dry, shriveled up husks of characters that I saw in the film.<br/><br/>Stewart plays Bella, a brooding teen who is escaping her mom's remarriage by moving in with her biological father and (apparently) deciding never to smile again. She meets lots of very friendly people, who are genuinely nice, though a little immature, and then proceeds to blow them off throughout the movie in order to get close to a vampire named Edward (played by Pattinson) who doesn't seem to want to have anything to do with her, but doesn't mind stalking her from afar.<br/><br/>Bella is rude, self-centered, and withdrawn, but despite these qualities (or perhaps because of them, as Edward is equally rude and stand-offish) Edward can't seem to keep away from Bella. He eventually reveals himself as a vampire, and they begin to date.<br/><br/>The Characters had no true chemistry. The attraction Edward and Bella displayed for one another seemed to be nothing more than pheromone-based. Edward lusts for Bella's blood, while Bella is drawn by Edward's irresistible vampire qualities. They possessed no commonalities. They exhibited no depth in their interactions. As a love-story it was asthmatic.<br/><br/>The only metaphorical rays of sunshine in the film were the atmosphere of the rainy and dreary town of Forks (which fit the mood quite aptly), and the character of Alice who added life to a superficial dive of a movie."
"Robert_duder","5","1","5","15 January 2012"," Proof that mass hysteria can sell a film
","How can I speak ill of a movie that made over half a billion dollars and launched one of the most successful film franchises of all time. That, however, does not make a good or even entertaining film. I will say for the record the Twilight films got better with time and maturity but this first film was dead on arrival and not in a good way. I read the first Twilight book years ago, long before I saw the film, and I found it just too sappy for my lacking. Well this film makes the book look like a Pulitzer Prize winner. The acting is downright awful, some of the worst I have ever seen. And the thing is I don't think the cast are bad actors. I often wondered throughout the film is the director purposely ordered the cast to act really bad. The romance that holds this entire series together is creepy and obsessive and just downright terrible. The story for Twilight crawls along and nothing of any significance happens in the first film. I am completely mind blown that this was so popular but marketing was done so well and the hype was in full swing so it hooked everyone in.<br/><br/>I don't believe Robert Pattinson is a bad actor. I've seen him in Remember Me, where he did a decent job, but he just exudes awful in this movie. He acts like a horrible Harlequin Romance cover and his look, his style, his dialogue is just atrocious. Kristen Stewart is also not a bad actor. Also for the record, although this is an unpopular opinion, I don't think she does awful in this movie. Its not great but she does okay with what she's given. I also think her chemistry with Pattinson which is supposed to be this epic passionate earth shattering love is pathetic and creepy. Their scenes together will make you laugh out loud. Billy Burke does a good job as Bella's father, Taylor Lautner is okay in a small role in the film introducing us to Jacob. Edi Gathegi is okay as the killer vamp in the film but he gets treated and performs like a B-Movie actor. The rest of the cast are all lumped together as sub par silly and over acted.<br/><br/>I think everyone should wake up and realize and be angry that director Catherine Hardwicke and everyone else involved in this film thinks that you're all foolish enough to enjoy this crap. Its dumbed down, its silly and pretentious and over-acted and just generally not interesting. I remember I started watching it years ago and I gave up half way through it was so awful but I wanted to force my way through it so I could see all of them and write a fair review. The movie probably scores a 5 in my book because it entertained me in the way that it made me laugh at the stupidity and the B-movie qualities. Plus the battle at the end was okay so its not the worst garbage I've ever seen. Still if you haven't seen Twilight...don't...save yourself the suffering even if they do get better. 5/10"
"Tweekums","7","1","5","23 August 2011"," These vampires are different
","Not being anywhere near the target demographic I had no intention of watching this film but when it was on television and there was nothing else of interest on I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I must say that is was better than I'd expected; the story was pretty good, there were some child-friendly scares and a few laughs. 'Twilight' is the story of Isabella a seventeen year-old girl who moves from Phoenix, Arizona to the small town of Forks in Washington State. At here new school she meets a boy by the name of Edward Cullen; he and his family keep apart from the other children but he is drawn to her in the same way that she is drawn to him. He tries to keep away from her and to persuade her to keep away from him but that just seems to make her more interested. Eventually she learns the secret of his family; they are vampires! Unlike other vampires they only feed on animals and accept Bella even though she isn't one of them. They might not be a threat but other vampires are; especially one who has been killing people locally and has decided that Bella will be interesting prey because of another vampire's desire to protect her. Bella flees but is pursued; she is in real danger unless Edward and his family can kill the vampire who wants to kill her.<br/><br/>I was surprised that I rather enjoyed this; not enough to rush out and buy it on DVD but I expect I'll watch further instalments when they are on television. Kristen Stewart did a good job as Bella and Robert Pattinson was fine as Edward even if his hair did make him look too much of a pretty-boy to be taken that seriously as a potentially dangerous creature! The story was quite good and the characters were well established by the time of the final confrontation. Many people I've heard talking about this film criticise it for radically changing the vampire mythology; instead of bursting into flames in sunlight the sparkle! This change didn't bother me too much; the only real criticism I have is that it went on a little too long after the 'final' confrontation and it wasn't subtle in setting up the fact that there will be further films¬Ö although that shouldn't surprise anybody given that it is based on the first of a series of books. I wouldn't recommend that everybody rushes to see this film but if it is on television it is worth watching even if you aren't in the target demographic."
"imagination4427","8","1","5","30 June 2011"," This movie was very well done, great job of Bella's personality, and a beautiful scenery!
","Ah, Bella, in the book, she's very kept-to-herself, shy, not very giddy, and of course, pale. In the movie they did exactly that! Kristen did really good on portraying Bella!!<br/><br/>Edward seemed a little different then what I would've imagined him. But in the movie though he was so charming and gentleman-like, as if every move he did, he moved with his sharp, charming personality, its hard to explain... But anyway, Edward didn't meet my expectations though in one case because something about him sort of intimidated me, but I suppose that's what the director wanted to do, for the watchers to have mixed feelings about Edward, yet in the book Edward seemed more approachable, in a distant sort of way, like saying ""Come, but not too close."" I found that different.<br/><br/>THE SOUNDTRACK!!! I <3ed the soundtrack, mostly I <3 carter Burwell!!! Bella's Lullaby!!! <3<br/><br/>I love the places they filmed the movie, because it gave me that weird chill down my spine and made me feel gloomy, with all the clouds and the music too!!<br/><br/>I think that everything was good, like how they portrayed the plot and all that!!"

I'm now a few years over the target demographic, so you can guess what I think.It is what it is. Broody vampire meets bland teen. Not an awful contribution to the urban fantasy world.<br/><br/>The acting is fine. Stewart has a confidence that compensates for her character's lack of a spine, Pattinson's lack of expression fits the undead theme and Lautner...Well, with a face like that, who really cares? <br/><br/>But the young cast, cardboard cut-out characters, and lightweight plot are all completely outshined by the cinematography. The photography is absolutely scrumptious.

"woinaroschy_1979","8","1","5","19 April 2010"," If you love romantic movies watch it!
","First I am a female and I like romantic movies, so be warned! As I am not a teenager anymore the whole Twilight craziness passed me by. I watched the movie on ""pay per view"" 1 year after it had appeared in cinemas without any knowledge about the saga. And I got hooked by the chemistry between Rob and Kristen! It's something absolutely extraordinary, really, that first kiss and the gazebo scene make me feel knots in my stomach every time. And Robert Pattinson, he just...takes your breath away! It's difficult to explain how I feel when seeing him in this movie. You know the feeling of awe and wonder when you see something very beautiful, like a painting or statue or a landscape...well the same thing you can also feel when you see a truly beautiful person. That's how I feel when seeing Pattinson as Edward. The thing is, he is after all just a regular guy, and he has changed in the meantime, he is not that half man, half boy anymore, he has matured, and that sweetness that still clung to his features in Twilight is gone. Don't get me wrong, he still looks great, but that perfect magic that he was in Twilight is unfortunately gone. In Twilight he IS Edward, the 17-year old vampire...in New Moon he looks much more mature, like 21-22, and that is not because of the old fashioned clothes he had to wear, he just looks older (as it is normal, we all age). Also I think he concentrated a lot more for doing Twilight than for New Moon. All the cast play their roles in a great way, I liked each and every one of them. The details so dear to me fit perfectly: the clothes, the atmosphere, the colors. The music is fantastic, it is a different beauty of this film! Catherine Hardwick has a very good feel about these details, which really count and I absolutely appreciate her work. There are two minuses for the movie: the special effects which are not great (but I appreciate the fact that she made the actors do all the effects, it made them work together as a team and that is really important in a movie) and the fact that she cut out an extended meadow scene which was absolutely great. The idea that vampires sparkle in the sun really bugs me, but this is a Stephanie Meyer issue in fact. After watching it I watched NM and bought all the books, plus read all extras on SM website. Basically I became a Twilighter because of this movie for a couple of months, but I am starting to get over it...the magic is slowly but surely disappearing. I highly recommend this movie for people that like romantic movies and are still young at heart. If you remember how it felt falling in love when you were a teenager, how magical those first moments were, if you appreciate beauty under whatever form it is you will enjoy this movie. If you are looking for an action movie with vampires, or a more passionate dramatic love story this is certainly not the thing for you. The love story is passionate but it's expressed only in gestures, not in words. What can I say, thank you Catherine Hardwick and thank you Rob and Kristen!"

"callanvass","8","1","5","12 January 2010"," It's aimed at teen audiences, for Pete's sake!. I'm a male adult, and I thought it was enchanting!.
","I have never read any of the Twilight novels, not one of them, so I can't compare the movie, to the novel. Remember that before judging me on my review, OK?. I have seen Twilight twice now, and enjoyed it just as much as I did the 1st time, does that make me a flake, too?. I think a lot of the Twilight hate, is due to all the hype about it. Whenever something is really big, and over exaggerated about by the media, people immediately begin to trash it. The fellow men can't stand, that there girlfriends are screaming and raving, about Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner all the time, therefore they get jealous. If your not the romantic type, Twilight isn't gonna appeal to you very much at all. if you're a romantic type, whether you're a guy or girl, you will find a lot to like here. Twilight has a lot of heart to it. When were not hearing cheesy dialog at times, or seeing the somewhat, corny special effects|The wire use is obvious!| It's often compelling you with its storyline. Bella is a complicated, but likable heroine. We appreciate the fact that she's different from all the rest.<br/><br/>The romance between Kristen and Robert is pretty convincing as well. We can feel the realism, the pure love between the two of them, and I enjoyed the passion they shared together, their chemistry is natural. There are some pretty nifty action sequences in the film too. The big scuffle with Edward and James, was pretty entertaining to watch, if a little on the cheesy side. I also thought the ending was very well done, it was a great little prelude to New Moon. I don't care that Twilight is cheesy, and I really don't care that it's for teen audiences. All I care about is that a movie entertains me, and Twilight certainly accomplishes that feat <br/><br/>Performances. Kristen Stewart is actually excellent as Bella. She had just a likable sense of awkwardness to her, while hitting all the right emotional tunes for the most part. She has this stunning unique beauty to her, that you can't take your eyes off of, when she's on-screen. I felt for her as Bella, I could feel what she was going through. Her little patterned ticks might be annoying to some, but I thought they were adorable. Robert Pattinson is pretty good for the most part. He came across a little awkward at 1st, but once he got comfortable, it was smooth sailing all the way for him. My only complaint was, he could have been a tad more aggressive in a couple of key scenes. Taylor Lautner isn't much of an actor at this point, in fact he uses his flashy smile, and charm to get by for the most part. Billy Burke is pretty awesome as Bella's father. To me that was a big key in making Twilight work, was his relationship with Bella. His cold, yet endearing performance made it work. Nikki Reed is so hot she could make steak sizzle. Performance wise she is up to the task for the most part, as Rosalie. Peter Facinelli&Elizabeth Reaser made for effective parents. Ashley Greene is pretty cute. I enjoyed her enthusiasm as Alice. Cam Gigandet is OK as James. He was menacing, yet kinda cheesy as well.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. Twilight entertained me heavily, and really that's all I all I care about. Personally I think the people who purposely put low ratings for this film, to make the rating lower, or join in groups to trash it, is even more pathetic than the people who obsess over it. To be honest the only reason I rented this in the 1st place, was because of my big crush on Kristen Stewart. Thankfully I ended up enjoying the movie too. If you ignore all the annoying teenage fan girls, and the constant over hype, you may be able to get into Twillight like I did.<br/><br/>8/10"

","When young Robert Pattinson enters the life of Kirsten Stewart he was sure like any other young man she was likely to meet in her small town in the Pacific Northwest. He was unlike anyone she was likely to meet just about anywhere.<br/><br/>Pattinson plays Edward Cullen of the Cullen clan of vampires. And Stewart's character of Belle Swan and Edward Cullen have become cult heroes for this younger generation. Needless to say both older Swans and Cullens aren't crazy about these two kids going out. Still as another popular film of a decade ago remarked, somehow these two complete each other.<br/><br/>This film like the Harry Potter series has inspired a bunch of sequels made and in the planning stage from the novels which are bestsellers among current teens. Pattinson and Stewart are an attractive pair of young people and vampire or not, I sure see what they see in each other. More importantly they do communicate love to each other and to the audience.<br/><br/>The Twilight series is going to be quite a money maker for a long time to come."
"bobsgrock","6","1","5","12 November 2009"," All they're missing is a cape.
","I must start this review by saying that I am not the audience for the books of Twilight, so the movie probably wasn't made for me either. Still, I intended to see the film in hopes of it being able to cater to all fans whether they were interested in it because of the novel, or simply wanting to see a good fantasy film about teens and vampires.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film misses on a lot of what it intended to do to bring in outside viewers and that is a shame because had it done better in some categories, it could have been more accepted by those not interested in reading the books. Nevertheless, it certainly has been a big hit with lovers of the novels, as will the next one which is due in theaters next week. I didn't expect to love it but I had hoped to embrace it as the Romeo and Juliet movie of this generation. The actors certainly help with it there as Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are both very adequate as Bella and Edward, the human and vampire in love with one another it seems because they like to be alone together. Stewart can be a bit too lacking in emotion at the most emotional times, but still manages to carry the role of a young girl just drifting through life until she meets the dark and mysterious Edward. And as this moody and unpredictable fellow, Pattinson shows he was the best choice not only because he is quite handsome, but also because he has the acting chops to pull off the mood swings and insatiable lust for Bella very few others could. Together, they do have serious chemistry and they will probably be voted years from now as one of the best on-screen couples of the movies.<br/><br/>What is missing is the bite, for lack of a better term, of the story. It is a fantasy, but there are some elements that do not make sense even in a fantastical world. For example, why exactly does Edward seem so obsessed with Bella? And why does she return this same sentiment despite the fact that in the first 20 minutes of the movie he flees from her like the H1N1 virus. Perhaps we are supposed to just believe it but I wanted more credence. I also wanted more back-story on the Cullens and their abilities to do what they do. They have super-speed, super-strength, and see visions of the future. All that's missing is the superhero cape. Still, I was unimpressed with how director Catherine Hardwicke and screenwriter Melissa Roseberg seemed to tiptoe around the meat of the story, which lies not in the romance between Edward and Bella, but the why and the how of the situation. To really establish true emotional content in these characters would have lent the movie true credence and given the audience something to care about in these characters. Instead, we just get shots of the two looking at each other intensely and sweeping helicopter overviews of the evergreen forests of Washington.<br/><br/>The best thing here, besides Pattinson, is the supporting cast, particularly the kids Bella befriends at her new school. They are funny, goofy and lend a realism to the story the rest of it seems to lack, despite the material. Also, the special effects depicting the vampire superpowers are quite unimpressive. I do hope the new film gives more thought and time to the vampires than just blurring their speed and editing choppily as they scale trees. As books, I am sure Stephanie Myers was able to establish exactly what was needed to believe and feel for these characters. Unfortunately, the transition to the screen loses something in translation and even though it will always remain a hit, I will always wonder if it couldn't have been a hit and something more..."

Bella try's to talk to Edward to get information out of him about how he stopped the van. Going to the beach she meets Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and he tells Bella of the Quileutes which are descended from wolves, which is where his tribe comes from. The Cullen's were found by the Quileutes hunting on their land back when his grandfather was chief of the tribe and made a deal with them. If they stay off the Quileutes land they would not tell the pale faces who they really are. <br/><br/>I could go on with the whole or most of the beginning here, but I'm just going to give the basis of the story since almost every girl who was obsessed with the movie has seen it already. Filled with cheesy lines and funny reactions to situation leave you not being able to stop yourself form laughing. Like the moment in the Biology class when Bella comes in was pretty hysterical. After Pattinson's sudden death in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", he was asked to be in ""Twilight"" and he fit perfectly for the character of Edward Cullen. Kristen Stewart on the other hand this was her big break in her acting career. Along with the others in this movie this was their moment to be famous and be known and no longer known as a no-body in the acting world. Although this movie seems ridiculous at first the more you watch it it's not so bad and it's the start of more Twilight's to come. With the new movie of ""Twilight Saga: New Moon"" looming every girl who was and still is crazy about Edward and Jacob's new wolf body is going to be there at the midnight showing in excitement to see what new things will happen in this one."

","I didn't think Twilight was a terrible movie as such, but it is not a fantastic one either. I will admit it wasn't my cup of tea, hence my mixed score, but there are redeeming qualities. I haven't read the book, so I can't judge its faithfulness or lack of to the text. I am going to start with the negatives. The dialogue felt very clunky and awkward, and I honestly felt the actors didn't have that much to work with. The plot takes a very long time to get going, and while it gets going, there were parts that felt underdeveloped sadly. And there were a number of bits towards the beginning that were unintentionally funny, and I think that was to do with Robert Pattinson. He is a real heart-throb I know, but his acting came across as rather hammy and even overdone. When me, my family and my sister's boyfriend saw it at the cinema, there was a lot of laughter at the scenes where the character Edward Cullen was staring into the camera. However, there are some good points. Kristen Stewart does give an assured performance in the lead, and Cam Gigandet does give one of the better performances of the movie. The soundtrack was somewhat decent, the camera work was good on the most part, and the scenery was splendid. Overall, I had mixed feelings on Twilight, it wasn't bad or good, just a little on the average side. It was a vampire movie but without the bite. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

","I saw this movie because I was curious as to the phenomenon; I figured that if I saw it I would understand and not be hooked. I was wrong. I fell in love with the story and immediately read the books. I am now a huge Twilight fan and totally Team Edward.<br/><br/>Unlike some other Twi-hards, I liked the movie. Granted, things were left out, but what movie adaptation doesn't leave stuff out? I also enjoyed the performances of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. Both bring life to their roles and are very passionate about the characters they play. Stewart is very pretty; she makes Bella's beauty subtle, like it should be. Pattinson, however, is absolutely GORGEOUS! I am 'unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.' Amazing. Some have complained about his performance, that it wasn't passionate enough. When I saw the movie for the first time, without having read the books, I saw Edward as being tortured. That is how Pattinson plays him, like he is tortured over the thought of hurting Bella. You can see how much he loves her and how much he wants her blood. Likewise, you can see Bella's torture of being away from Edward in Stewart. I think that her portrayal of Bella at times seemed 'rougher' than what's in the book, but everyone's interpretation is different.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning with the cinematography of Forks, Washington. The costumes are modern and appealing to teenagers. Bella's prom dress (lent to her by Alice, Edward's sister) is stunning and Stewart wears it well. The supporting cast is perfect, especially Ashley Greene as Alice and Jackson Rathbone as Jasper. Kellan Lutz as Emmett also deserves special praise, as does Nikki Reed as the self-absorbed Rosalie. Taylor Lautner, although absent from most of the film, gives a fine performance as Jacob. Although I am Team Edward, I like Lautner. Muse, a band which I had never heard of, steals the show with their song, Supermassive Black Hole. Played during the baseball game, it is a toe-tapping good time. And the best one on the soundtrack. Also of interest is the fact that two of Pattinson's songs appear in the movie and Bella's Lullaby, written by Carter Burwell, is absolutely beautiful.<br/><br/>I have watched this film more than I can count and plan to watch it many more times. If anyone is curious about the saga but isn't sure if he or she wants to read the books, I say see the movie. It may whet your appetite for more. That's what happened with me."

I noticed Bella was as pale, if not paler, than all the Cullens/Hales. It was so not an attractive trait of her character. Jessica, Angela, Mike, and Eric were exactly the kind of friends you NEED in (a new) high school, but Bella is a total loner. I loved the friends' characters, but they were way too perky for Bella's type, I guess. Oh yeah, and I have to say the best part of the whole movie was Jacob Black played by Taylor Lautner!!!! No offense to the other characters, of course. I can hardly wait to see that hottie turn in to a wolf!! New Moon is going to rock!! I'M SO EXCITED!!"
"EchoMaRinE","6","1","5","15 August 2009"," not more romantic than a love story between a cat and a mouse
","Let me start by saying I like vampire movies and I don't have any prejudice for a human falling into love with any creature. The movie is about the love between a vampire which is quite different than all the vampires I have seen so far and a human girl. The first problem with this setting is the abilities the vampires have. They can walk in the sun light, they don't die by silver, they are fast, they are ultra strong, they are unbeatable. I think they confused the vampires with super heroes. The problem is, all these upgrades they made to usual vampire kind make them a strong predator and a love story between such a predator and a human is certainly not more romantic than a love story between a cat and a mouse. During the whole movie, I was waiting for a scene where Robert Pattinson eats Kristen Stewart. If this is your understanding of love, go ahead and watch."
"inyourimage","9","1","5","27 July 2009"," I wanna be a vampire!
","I really liked this movie because it made me think of a life where interesting stuff happens. Why can't vampires really prowl around stirring things up a bit and offering us a little real romance? Ennui is the curse of those who don't have any real life. The vampire life is the way, let me tell you. At least interesting stuff happens. This movie had romance, suspense, intrigue, and a fantastic element that I thought was superb. I want a vampire family to adopt me! Maybe then something unexpected might happen! Nothing unexpected happens in the real world, its just the same old sh...stuff, day in and day out. Pour yourself a nice glass of wine...or 6...and enjoy a real movie that makes a movie of the drama we all wish would really happen to break up the mundane and ordinary."
"patent10-1","9","1","5","31 May 2009"," The making of Twilight was as close to the book as they could get.
","I have read Twilight. Actually the whole series. The movies was great. the actors to me became the characters themselves. The book was packed with so much that there was no way to get it all into one movie. What was in the movie was definitely all the highlights of the book.<br/><br/>I read the whole series and saw Twilight three times plus the extras on the DVD. The making of and so on. They put a lot of work into it.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed was that there was a lot of green in this film. Edward seemed to ware green quite a bit and the family. The hospital part of course was green. I like to see more color in the making of New Moon. That is just my personal opinion. Other than that can't beat perfection. This is coming not from a teen. I am in my 40s and can't believe I fell for a young vampire movie but I did."
"YoGreve","10","1","5","23 April 2009"," I'm in love with Edward Cullen ..
",".. and i'm not a teen ;D<br/><br/>I watched this movie a week ago, just borrowed it from a friend as I had nothing else to do. When in theaters, I had no intention of seeing it, as a romantic vampire film isn't what I prefer. But I loved it.<br/><br/>I haven't read the books and I don't know what I would think of the movie, if I had ? But,<br/><br/>From the very start I thought it was good. I didn't need it to run 30 minutes before realizing I would love it. The whole love story appeals to me even though i'm not teenager, but I am now waiting for my very own Edward Cullen ;D I like the characters, the setting and I don't mind the conflict arrives late in the end - When there is 4 books, it doesn't surprise me they had to show a lot of ""basic stuff"" in the beginning.<br/><br/>The movie is sweet and the chemistry between Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart is undeniable. I thought Robert Pattinson did a great job in this, but Kristen Stewart was a little annoying at times. Don't know if it was just for this role, or if she will annoy me in other movies as well!<br/><br/>I would recommend everyone go see it . At least to make their own opinion, instead of assuming they wouldn't like it. Just as I did.<br/><br/>I am glad the director is going to be someone else for the 2nd movie, though :)"
"bob-rutzel-1","8","1","5","19 April 2009"," Exceptionally well done
","Bella (Stewart) goes and lives with her father in the state of Washington and meets Edward Cullen (Pattinson) in a high school biology class. Guess which one is the Vampire.<br/><br/>Where does one go to find a good Vampire movie these days? The Lost Boys must have found themselves, Buffy stopped fighting them, Ann Rice doesn't write about them anymore, and the Moonlight TV show was cancelled (Boo Hoo, btw).<br/><br/>Get ready for a love story that is exceptionally well done. The chemistry is what this movie is all about and like Progresso Soup: it's in there. The entire cast was very good too, but without the chemistry between Pattinson and Stewart that dog won't hunt. Yeah, we all know it's wrong and there's no such thing as Vampires (Say what?), but someone has finally put a credible love story out there. If you can just get over one of them being a Vampire (doesn't exist, remember?) you will enjoy the dialogue, banter and some unusual CGI. No, no gore. Didn't I say this was well done? Okay, there is some blood, but hey, it's a vampire movie (yes, they don't exist, we know).<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson has Christopher Walken hair (though darker), and he could almost play Elvis. What a combo. Both Pattinson and Miss Stewart did exceptional jobs. <br/><br/>I do have a question though: does Stewart's name of Bella, in the movie, have anything to do with reminding us of Bella Lugosi? Hey, I won't stick my neck out too far on that one.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is nothing uncomfortable in this movie and guess what? They are currently filming Twilight II ( 2009) because you like Vampire stories so much. Just can't get enough, can you? I know. Me too. They don't . . . . . what?<br/><br/>Violence"" Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"samyy_866","8","1","5","19 April 2009"," Beautiful but i think im obsessed!
","I have to say I'm a little late on the uptake with Twilight, I watched the film for the first time last week and admittedly wasn't too sure about it. I had never read the book and so had no idea what to expect.<br/><br/>Im a fan of Supernatural so I suppose I was expecting your typical vampire behaviour to be shown in the film. Hence upon first watching I couldn't quite figure out the flow and initially found it a little boring and strained. However after the first hour I was beginning to find it more compelling.<br/><br/>Since then I have watched the film a further few times and I've also bought all four books and have to admit it is becoming somewhat of an obsession. I've only just started the books but so far i think the film is an amazing adaptation, but maybe thats because i've essentially done things the wrong way round.<br/><br/>Anyway Im not reviewing the book so will move on to how my thoughts about the film changed on second and subsequent viewings. The film, in essence is a stunning, romantic viewing, the chemistry between Rob Pattinson and Kristin Stewart as Edward and Bella is amazing. You can feel the respect and admiration their characters have for one another coming through the screen and by the end I was left in complete awe.<br/><br/>AS the film goes on you get to know more and more about both the leads and find each quite endearing. By no means is Bella a damsel in distress looking for love and at first the relationship is more of a curiosity on both parts. Similarly Edward is not the usual movie love interest. Rob Pattinson in my view did an amazing job of communicating the battle Edward goes through on a daily basis, he lusts for her blood yet feels protective and loving of her.<br/><br/>The scene is which Bella tells Edward she knows what he is I found particularly powerful, the sexual tension and Bella's need for him, to understand him was truly evident. From then on the relationship deepens, Bella brings Edward ""back to life"" and the scene in which they kiss was beautifully shot and very poignant. The tension and lust is almost unbearable and you could truly feel how much they wanted each other but also how he was still unsure he could trust himself.<br/><br/>The scenes in the forest after Bella is taken to meet the Cullens family were also some I found particularly beautiful, the forest is Edwards world and Bella is now the centre of his world.<br/><br/>The Ballet studio scene was another favourite, considerably added to by Rob Pattinsons haunting song ""let me Sign"". Edward's love for Bella is truly evident in his protective role and her trust for him is so deep she doesn't struggle when he bites, she believes he can stop and that gives him the strength he needs to do so. The following hospital and prom scenes only strengthened the affinity I felt for each character. Their need and desire for one another was beautifully captured and a relationship i think many people can relate to.<br/><br/>If you like deeply romantic films then this is a must see. The location and sets are beautiful as is the movie score, the special effects are suited to the movie in the way they are not too flashy as this would detract from the storytelling. I found the character development to be particularly well shot also.<br/><br/>Overall an amazing film which has captivated me on such an emotional level I cant truly put words to how I feel when watching the film. I do apologise as this has probably come across in the review but it is for this reason I have given the film a 10/10."

"Gav14","8","1","5","14 April 2009"," Great movie! From a guys perspective.
","First off, I went into this movie not looking forward to it. I went in thinking that the movie was a complete girls movie and was dreading the 2 hours I had to sit through it. I watched it with a few friends, all teenagers, and to my surprise, everyone (guys and girls alike) came out having enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>PLOT <br/><br/>The plot was very compelling. It had a ""Romeo and Juliet"" like feel to it while still being original. How many vampire films are about romance instead of horror.<br/><br/>ACTORS <br/><br/>The acting was good in this movie. Edward was played by Robert Pattinson and he did a great job. The make-up was great and he looked like a vampire, all pale and stuff.<br/><br/>Bella Swan was played by Kirsten Stewart and I think she did a very good job. She looked exactly like the girl from the book was described. (I have now read the book... after the movie). Her emotions were good and her voice, for the most part, complied with the part of the movie. This is my pet peeve, movies where the voice acting wasn;t good.<br/><br/>MUSIC <br/><br/>The music was great, no complains there. I have since bought the soundtrack.<br/><br/>SPECIAL EFFECTS<br/><br/>The special effect, although few, were ... interesting. The running at superspeed wasn't bad but it could have been much better.<br/><br/>MISC.<br/><br/>spoiler: The fight scene at the end was absolutely epic. I enjoyed it a lot.<br/><br/>Spoiler: The cliffhanger ending was very good and left us wanting a sequel."

I especially liked the part where Bella and Edward are jumping tree to tree and the way the light illuminates on them in the dance scene and well there's so much good about this movie.

"sweetjesska","10","1","5","4 April 2009"," to the twilight fans!!
","The movie ""Twilight"" was an ideal and unforgettable experience for any fans of Stephenie Meyer's ""Twilight"" novels. It was as compelling as the story and though everything happened quite fast in the movie unlike the novel, the characters were played stunningly by every single actor. Robert Pattinson was the ultimate ""Edward Cullen,"" beautiful, strong, daunting and irresistible. Kristen Stewart was the perfect Bella, unlike other reviews I've read saying she can't act, those people are obviously delusional. Bella is your typical, clumsy yet ordinary girl next door type, she's not materialistic and she's not into the ladidadida of high-school or boys until one very peculiar boy comes into the picture. The props, scenery, location, effects and music were all absolutely exquisite and very faithful to the books. It is not just a typical teen-bop blockbuster but so much more, it appeals to both male and females yes even to the adults out there. It is the story behind Twilight and these remarkable characters which puts almost everyone in a coma¬Ö ""Twilight is my personal heroin"" I give props to Catherine Hardwicke who did an extraordinary job with the movie as well as the ideal cast who brought the characters to life on screen. This movie is definitely worth seeing at the movie theater, the 122 minutes fly's by. If you haven't read the books yet, please do!! You're missing out, and you're a fool if you are not a Twilighter.<br/><br/>p.s. lookin forward to New Moon!"
"sharmari1","8","1","5","1 April 2009"," Excellent storyline.
","Once again, a Brit cast in the lead role in an American movie about Americans. However, this is one of the times when it actually works. Robert Pattison is the brilliant new young British actor that was cast in the role of Cedric Digory in the Harry Potter movies. However, his talent was lost in that role. In the movie ""Twilight"", Pattison was able to spread his wings and fly. He was superb in the role. I wish I could say more, but I would not wish to spoil the movie for first time watchers. What I can say, is that it was a refreshing new direction for vampire movies, and hope there will be more like it in future. It would be interesting to see a part 2, or even a series. However, the true essence of films are sometimes lost in sequels or in a series, like the disaster they made with the Blade TV series. If they do make a sequel or series from this movie, I sincerely hope they do not ruin the original storyline. If you have not already seen this movie, then you are missing a excellent movie. Although with most movies, I, personally, always think they could have been so much better. In the storyline of ""Twilight"", I would only have made one improvement, but I cannot say without spoiling the movie. Perhaps you will be able to guess what it would have been. :-)<br/><br/>Update: I just checked, and apparently the sequel is already in production, and judging from what I read, they already plan to do exactly what I feared ...ruin the original storyline. What I read was so very disappointing, so I will give it a pass. Pity, it could have been so much better."
"TxMike","Null","1","5","28 March 2009"," Good, entertaining vampire love story, with some humor in the script.
","The only thing I knew about this movie before seeing it was (1) it involved vampires and (2) it is very popular with the younger generation of females. After seeing it I can understand why. While it is neither a great movie nor a poor movie, it is a very interesting story of forbidden love, and even though I am not a female of the younger generation I found it very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart, still a teenager, is Bella Swan, living in Arizona with her mother. But mom recently re-married and her baseball husband travels a lot, so Bella decided to go live with dad so that her mother could have more freedom. She didn't do it with malice, just because she is a caring and wise girl for her age.<br/><br/>Billy Burke is her dad Charlie Swan , the sheriff in the local small town of Forks, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. (I have vacationed in that area, it is beautiful as the film shows and was a good choice for this movie.) Bella had spent some time growing up there but had not visited for a number of years. So her return was a reunion of sorts, but she quickly became the new girl at school, and attracted a lot of attention.<br/><br/>But the one student who really grabs her attention is Brit Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen. Just looking at the screen we are struck with his looks, almost as if he has lots of makeup on, and later we find out why. By chance Bella gets paired with Edward in Biology, but he seems to have an immediate dislike for her, is rude, and tries to get a transfer to a different class. This puzzles Bella.<br/><br/>The movie is almost 2 hours long and my wife and I enjoyed it. Some of the dialog was predictable, and the unresolved ending which sets up the sequel is predictable. But the movie is filmed beautifully and the idea of a human and vampire relationship is treated in a fun and novel way.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: As probably everyone knows Edward is a vampire. When asked how old he is, he responds ""17"". When further asked how long he has been 17 he responds ""A while."" He was saved from dying in the 1840s, and being an immortal vampire stays looking 17. He and his family (dad is the doctor in town) have vowed to give up human blood and live a vegetarian life. Edward and other vampires are addictively attracted by Bella's scent, and that is why Edward tried to get away from her initially. Now he is her protector, and has to destroy a vampire from a different clan that tried to have Bella for dinner. But one of them survives and we see her as if to say ""I'm going to get Bella."" So there probably will be a sequel."
"nhikki3","10","1","5","27 March 2009"," Loved it!
","I have never read the books behind this film but the reason why I love it so much is because of the romance in it! UGh! What girl wouldn't love to be in that position?! Now, if the directors would have focused more on the 'other' aspect of the story then I think the reviews would have been a lot better. But for me personally, it was a fantastic movie. Definitely a twist to your average romance. One of the few movies out there that I could watch more than once.<br/><br/>I do wish they would have told a little bit more on the history of the plot of the story. It just seems in a sense they kind of rushed that aspect and told the bare minimum of what the audience needed to know. At the end of the movie I still had some unanswered questions (perhaps it was just me?). So hopefully they come out with a Twilight 2? (Containing the same cast!)"
"danniminako","10","1","5","21 March 2009"," The Best Movie Ever
","First of all, let's begin with saying, bravo. Bravo to Stephenie Meyer for coming up with such a wonderful book. The movie was wonderful as well. They are both similar, but different in minimal ways. If you put into a movie, everything you read in the book, there is no way you can make a movie that you can watch. The movie would be days long. Second of all, this movie was romantic and wonderful. If you don't like it you shouldn't come on here to talk bad about it. I've seen it a bunch of times and I love it more each time. Robert Pattinson is a talented actor and made the character of Edward come to life in a way no one could imagine. If you say this movie is just a love story, you're highly wrong. This movie has a lot of action too and I'm sure all the Twilight fans are looking forward to seeing Twilight 2 which comes out in November. The first Twilight movie includes a lot of action, from the scene where Edward saves her life from the van, to the scene where he saves her life from the weirdos on the street, to where he risks his life to save her from James. That is the kind of love everyone wishes to find and that you have to look hard enough to locate. A dire need to find someone like that and if you lose them.. You can't live. Bella's love for Edward is something that no one understands, or most people don't. Bella would love Edward if he didn't even look fine. She's obsessed with him, but it's a good kind of obsession. One that makes you wonder how you were living before without that person in your life. Edward tries to stay away from Bella to protect her, but yet, he couldn't. He fell in love with her too.. She wants him to turn him into one of them (vampires), but he doesn't want to because he wants her to live a full life and experience everything she could. I've read all the books and I can say I can't wait for the second movie to come out. I'm sure everyone will enjoy it. <br/><br/>~Anais, Twilight Fan #1~"
"FireAndIce1124","9","1","5","21 March 2009"," I enjoyed it...
","First of all i would like to say that it is amazing how many people on here were cutting down the acting and cinematography of the movie before the movie was even in theaters. Seriously guys when you read the comments look at the dates on them.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was great, I read the entire series before the movie, including the part of Midnight Sun Stephenie Meyer made available on her site. And everyone that is cutting down the movie because they think they left so much out of the movie, you have to understand the fact that it is really hard to translate a book into a movie. And also that it was a small budget film. I believe there is a very good chance for the rest of the movies now that they have a bit more money to do them.<br/><br/>The movie on it's own is great, it brings a different sense of the supernatural to the screen. When you see the movie, put the book in the back of your head so you can actually see the movie for a movie and judge it by that. Yes, in old movies and stories vampires don't sparkle or try to not kill humans, but that's the amazing spin Meyer puts on the series. It gives you more to think about...and I loved it!"
"sparky41985","7","1","5","5 March 2009"," Twilight not as imagined
","Twilight was not how I pictured it in my head. Some character choices were not true to the book. Over all the movie was well done but lacking storyline. The movie seemed to focus on the wrong things. Over all the movie was acceptable, but not nearly as good as the books, which is most often the case. I have found that a better place to talk about Twilight is a forum at Twilightforums dot org. I like it better because it covers the books and the movies. I think that everyone should see this movie to get an idea if they like the plot, and if it interest you then go out and read the books and skip the movies. Perhaps it would be better to wait until the next movie was available on Netflicks or something cheaper then going to the movies to see it. I am not sure if I will see the next one in the theater because the first one wasn't what I was hoping for and, I don't want to waste the money to see the second one if the results are not going to be any better."

","I think Twilight is a great movie. I mean it's nothing compared to the book, but have the movie ever been better than the book. I mean Stephenie Meyer is a genius, and she approved of the movie. So maybe that's the we she imagined it would look like on screen. Aside for a couple of slips and mistakes, it's actually pretty good. I like the actors, Kristen Stewart is a great actor, they could have made Bella a little more lively like in the book. But other than that they got it right. Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward, he behaved just like in the book. Edwards family is perfectly portrayed, they all look like I imagined in the book. (Expect for Emmett)"
"janne016","9","1","5","1 March 2009"," Is this real or not?
","A month ago my friends and I decided to see a movie in the cinema. We choose the film 'Twilight'. We didn't know this movie but would try him! When the film was over everyone was crazy! We didn't understand that this was possible. We needed a few minutes to calm down and to realize that this wasn't real. We are very different girls and we all like different kind of boys. But this vampire was an exception. We all loved him! The subject of this film is the impossible strong love between a vampire and a normal girl. She doesn't care that he isn't human. For him this love is very difficult. His love for her is strong enough to compensate his thirst of her blood. Edward isn't the only one who likes the blood of Bella. Edward's family doesn't eat humans. For them it is normal not to kill Bella. But that doesn't mean it's easy. There are other vampires outside their family too. They want to kill Bella because they like the smell of her blood. Will Edward's love be strong enough to save Bella's life? This film is directed by Catherine Hardwicke. The actors in this film are amazing! Robert Pattinson is very hot and is a very good actor. A lot of girls are jealous of Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan in the movie). She is the girl that is in love with Edward (Robert Pattinson). Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Ashley Greene, Jackson Rathbone, Nikki Reed, Kellan Lutz,¬Ö are the other actors in this movie. The screenplay was adapted by Melissa Rosenberg.<br/><br/>Twilight is a young- adult vampire- romance. Because we are talking about a vampire, this movie is very fantasy! The film is a romantic story about a normal human girl and a vampire in love. There is also action because they are fighting with their enemies. I think that this movie is so popular because every girl wants this boy. He is not only hot but also very protective. He wants to do everything for Bella. He even saves her life in a car accident. Which girl doesn't like this boy? I think this movie is not only popular by girls. I think boys also like this movie. Maybe they didn't like the romance but they like the story of a vampire and the fighting. That is just the best thing about this movie. Everyone likes it! I like this movie because the actors are very good. Edward is different then a normal human. He moves different, he speaks different and his eyes are different. I think this is an exceptional performance. I like the way they act. I didn't know the actors before this movie. But I can not wait to see more of them! I also like the story of this film because it's romantic. I know that it isn't real but that's just what I like about it. Your fantasy can go his own way. Because when this movie was about two normal people you know this can also happen in this world. This movie let you dream. It's nice to think about this movie because you can't compare it with your own life. You can dream without realizing that it isn't real! There are also a lot of beautiful landscapes in this film. The special effects are amazing! When you look at this film you don't see the special effect. You just know that it must be a special effect because it can not be real. But everything looks so real. The music in this film is very good. There is a video clip of one of the songs of the film. So you can see the music is also very popular! I recommend this movie to everyone who likes romantic stories and people who like to dream. Just sit down in your seat and look at this film. I promise you, you will sleep wonderful that night!

"girlish_evil","9","1","5","24 February 2009"," When the next one?
","This movie is good ! I really like it; the fact that finally people make vampire movies were (some) vampires are good. This,the True Blood HBO series and of course Queen of the Damned.<br/><br/>The story isn't bad at all, a love story between a vampire and a human girl, the slight rejection and the huge attraction between them, the love and the retain from killing.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book and even though the movie plays for 2 hours, I do believe it must be longer. Or maybe everything happens to fast. From the ""Hello, my name is Eduard"" to the "" You are my life now"" is like 3 weeks (because prom was in a month at the start of the movie). But who knows, life can be different as a vampire in love.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the fact that there aren't any huge and fantasy-like special effects. It makes everything look real, believable. People are not exaggerated, there aren't any spoiled brats mean girls, there are good people, normal people.<br/><br/>You don't see vampires really killing in this movie, there is a scene but it's subtle. Interesting fact really, because you never see fangs and the bite on Bella's hand is like a normal human bite. There is action in the movie,pretty good one really, but not to much, because it is focused on the connection between the two main characters.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that there is no sex scene in the movie, no major kissing, and still the love and passion between the two main characters can be seen really good. It's so subtle and yet so obvious. I believe this because in every movie made these days, that involves love, sex is everywhere, after the first date, at the first kiss, it happens so fast, no wonder kids these days loose them self's so early.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie was a clich√©, but let's face it, how many movies have you watched lately that wasn't.<br/><br/>But I do hope that the vampire character won't be changed anymore in future movies, like it was changed in this one. Vampires walking on daylight is kinda enough, because it will ruin every fact about them with which we were raised with.<br/><br/>I will say it again: I LOVE the fact that I can see a vampire movie, where some vampires aren't on the bad side. For the watchers that enjoy vampire story's and are fascinated by this, it's a good feeling to watch this movie.<br/><br/>It isn't extraordinary, it isn't super good, but it's worth it, every 122 minutes of it."
"tamsin_is_always","10","1","5","21 February 2009"," it's all in the chemistry
","despite the awfulness of the books, twilight as a film was good. i fell in love with Robert Pattinson, like the other billion teenage girls out there. and i love Kristen Stewart too. i hadn't heard of her before. anyway, what made the film was their chemistry. serioussssssly. in the kiss scene, in Bella's room, you really see it. and you don't want him to stop her ! mad. also what made it was how completely amazing Rob looks. i mean, the whole pale thing he had going on as Edward, OHHH my godd. have you noticed i've started adding extra letters like a teenage fan girl? it's because i am one. i swore, before i saw the film, that this wouldn't happen, but it did. i need to stop being like this.<br/><br/>anyway so the film was good. i don't like teen films on the whole. i like Wes Anderson stuff etc, so not much like twilight. but really, it was OK. it's not the kind of film which deserves some sort of award, mainly because it's a bit ridiculous, but then again, look at the dark knight? i loved that film, but that's ridiculous too ! why do people never see this? but so.<br/><br/>i saw it twice actually. because of Rob. sorry. anyway so on the second time we laughed a lot through it. it is quite cheesy. like when you first see the Cullens and it's all slow-mo. and it was so hilarious when Edward and Bella are in the classroom and he sees her, and like, reels away, because of his thirst and whatnot. but it looks like she just stinks. and you see her smelling her hair. god that was actually really funny. the jokes in it are OK i guess. also they toned down the creepy-stalker-super-controlling thing Edward has going on in the books, which makes him a lot more appealing. AND i really warmed to Jacob, unlike in the books, where he comes off as an immature loser. actually to be honest i warmed to all the characters because the films makes them all more realistic and developed. can you tell i think the books are terrible? so i thought the film was good, yes. not good-good, but i mean, it was OK good. it was watchable. i didn't get bored once, UNLIKE Benjamin button.<br/><br/>there's been comments about special effects being bad, but i didn't notice anything. i thought the walking fast and everything was pretty good. but i'm not much of an action fan so i don't know so much about it. on the whole, the actors really really made the film, i would say. if it hadn't been Rob with Kristen, or whatever, i can't see it working. they were electric. i can really see why there's been comments about them dating in real life (i know they aren't), because really, it was mad.<br/><br/>oh and Rosalie was really good. i can't believe it's Nikki reed ! from thirteen ! crazy. anyway i thought she was funny, and also one funny scene was where the Cullens were making a meal for Bella. and Rosalie goes ""is she even Italian?"" (because it's pasta). and Emmett goes, like, ""uh, her name is Bella"". gold.<br/><br/>OH also the soundtrack is cool. except the excess of Paramore. i liked the black ghosts before but it really got me into them for real. i liked that there was only one muse song on it. i can't believe Stephanie Meyer has playlists for her books. i actually can't believe how she is a Mormon oldish person who likes teen emo music to be honest."
"aiki-nodle-soup","8","1","5","9 January 2009"," You like it or you don't, it's as simple as that
","I think this is the best adaptation of the book that anyone could ever make. If you really want to start comparing both, the book will always be better than the movie, since it's always difficult to respect the chronology of all events. The good sides of the movie are that it's really well shot. The acting, stunt scenes, special effects and captions are quite wonderful. Also, most of the dialogs were said as they were in the book, and most of the events are truthful to the ones in the book. Plus, the music choices are perfect, as well as the original score composed by Carter Burwell. The downsides are, perhaps, that the movie is too fast and it was hard for most people who hadn't read the book to understand it (wasn't the case for me, and I didn't read the book before seeing the movie but after I had seen it, but well). Of course it's cheesy, it's a movie based on a teen novel. Most people rate it badly because they didn't like the story/book, and that makes perfect sense, but I still don't get it how it didn't beat Narnia and the Prince Caspian, which I'm sure the book behind was great but I slept for like half of the movie. You like it or you don't, it's as simple as that. I liked it."
"sleepwalking91","8","1","5","3 January 2009"," really very sweet
","well, before watching Twilight, I had never read the books, so when I saw the movie I really enjoyed it. Although I wasn't and am probably still not entirely crazy about Kristin Stewart as Bella, I thought the film was really entertaining, and it had me leaving the theater wanting more. After seeing the movie, I decided to read the books, and I liked those even more. (not surprising, books are always better) so if you have read the books, a piece of advice...don't go watching the movie expecting that it will measure up to the books. I wouldn't try comparing, because when it comes down to it, there is no comparison. The books and the movie are just two very different, but also very good pieces of work. I think Robert Pattinson did a really great job bringing the character to screen, he's definitely got that ""something"" that makes you want to watch him. Again, I wasn't crazy about Kristin Stewart, in my opinion, she began to get a bit boring and dull as Bella, I just wasn't really ""sold"" but of course, it's only my opinion.<br/><br/>all in all I give the movie an 8 out of 10, if you're going in hoping to see an exact or near exact portrayal of the book, you might not enjoy the movie, but if you're just looking to watch a nice love story, this is a great choice."
"ellen-137","9","1","5","30 December 2008"," Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. They fall in love, but he wants to eat her. Sheer brilliance!!
","This has to be one the most eagerly anticipated films of 2008 with millions of fans across the world who love the books. I am one of them. I went to see this on the 19th December with my two best mates and even though we were an hour early there was already a huge line girls sitting outside the cinema doors waiting for them to open. When they did, the guy opening them was squashed into the wall and looked quite frightened as the wild stampede ran past. So this film better not disappoint and it didn't. why was this film so good, well where to start? The two leads who played Edward and Bella (Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson) where fantastic and their strong on screen chemistry was sizzling all the way through. Before the film came out there was a lot of disagreement about the choice of Pattinson as Edward Cullen as he had previously played Cedric Diggory, but to me it was the next logical step. He got his character perfect. Edward is a very complicated character as he hates himself for what he is (a vampire) but he loves Bella for reasons he can't explain or control, this leads to more self loathing as he keeps wanting to eat her. He is so complex and interesting to watch because although he has a menacing side he is also charming, drop dead gorgeous, kind, brave, funny and passionate about everything that is dear to him. Robert Pattinson portrays all of this an is exactly how I imagined him to be when I was reading the book. Many fans (myself included) have fallen in love with this character so congrats to Rob for getting it right. Bella is played by Kristen Stewart was a mirror of the book as she often talks in monotone and is constantly doubting herself. Stewart's performance was particularly good in the final scenes such as the fight scene and the hospital scene which follows. this is because Bella lets her guard down a little bit as she finally realises she can't live without Edward. Other characters such as the Cullen family were also very true to the book. Rosalie, (played by Niki Reed), showed her true dislike of Bella and general bitchiness, Alice (Ashley Greene) was quirky and pixie like, Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) was actually amusing to watch with his facial expressions where he always looks scared of something and Emmett (Kellan Lutz) even though didn't have may lines was great in the baseball scene. Peter Fancielli and Elizabeth Reaser did a good job as the 'parent' vampires, Dr Carlisle Cullen and Esme Cullen. Cam Gigandet was fantastic as the villain James who wants to kill Bella as part of some sick game he has came up with in his head. It really makes you feel good when Edward wins the fight between them and makes you realise what dangers Bella is prepared to face by being with Edward. <br/><br/>The music in this film is accurately suited to it's genera, particularly Supermassive black hole by Muse in the baseball scene, but can be a bit overpowering bordering on cheesy. However this is few and far between. The only other criticisms I can make are that it does stray from the book partially as the blood typing chapter was missed out which disappointed me a little. Overall a fantastic vampire romance and I can't wait for the sequel next year!"

","A user on here said Twilight was Embarrassing to watch. Don't you think that is a bit harsh? You gotta understand these people work long hours for our entertainment. I mean I would love to have the opportunity that they have. I loved the movie and cant wait for New Moon to come out. Also, this movie was only on a 30 million dollar budget. Many movies have over a 100 million dollar budget, so if this movies effects were cheesy, they may be better in the next movie. I believe your comments were very harsh. You try to produce a better movie and then try saying that. Lol. Just had to get that out in the open. Thank you, i believe I've made my point. You should think about those things first. Wait till the next movie. Maybe you'll enjoy that one much more."

The acting was very good in my opinion. Nikki Reed was perfect as Rosalie, and Ashley Greene was very good. I did not enjoy the Bella they cast, she looked the part but she was a little too monotone for me.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was great. Action picked up in the right spots. it was balanced.

","This movie was great! I read the book and could not put it down... i also voted the book 10! ha ha! Stefenie Meyer did great! I would definitely recommend this movie! There isn't much violence in it so I don't see why it is rated PG-13... :(<br/><br/>I do not now why the critics said this movie was dumb! it was very good and suspenseful that is why i went to see it! This movie was a lot like the book... unless you are picturing Jacob with short hair and being nice! ha ha... he didn't seem very nice to me! O, the ending was great! it was the 3rd best part of the movie. i am not going to say anything about it but... the music is great too! <br/><br/>Overall this was a great movie... few few few flaws!"
"shazygirl_1","10","1","5","21 December 2008"," STOP hating people!Wasn't as good as the book, but a great film
","I don't understand you fans out there that expect the film to be exactly like the book. The book would not translate well into a film and it wo9uld be like 10 hours long. The director and cast have done great job portraying the film and even though all of the emotions aren't there from the book it is a great adaptation. They have also made it very MODERN and relevant to teens nowadays. Such as the baseball scene and also Bella's friends who are very much like how kids nowadays are. I think that Robert did a great job with Edwards character and so did Bella. Charlie was also a good casting job. I also thought that Jacob and Bella lacked tgeh chemistry that they need on screen and also that lautners acting was not very good which is probably why he is being changed for the next movie. I would also like to big up the soudtracks to this movie as they all fit well into the movie and are all tunes. Rob played the piano! Wooooo! People man don't hate go on and watch it. Don't take these haters opinions into account go and watch it for yourself."

","first of i am a huge fan of the twilight series and have read all of the books and it annoys how people are saying its bad because Bella does wear exactly what she wears in the book and giving the movie a bad score because of that.<br/><br/>i think Robert Patterson as Eward was perfect,he was exactly how i imagined Eward, the first time i seen him i near passed out he'gorgeous . the other Cullen's were perfect especially Alice and jasper. i know a lot of people said the actress who played Bella was horrible, i don't agree completely.at the start of the movie , i thought shes how i imagined Bella and i disagree about people saying she could have showed more emotion in the hospital scene at the end, i thought she did great in that scene.<br/><br/>i think its very closely based on the book. i was so happy wen i saw they included the baseball scene,its my favourite scene the special effects were awesome,, especially wen Eward and Emmett both go to catch the same ball and crash into each other, also love it wen Bella told Rosielle she was out, i couldn't help smiling at that bit laugh out loud and the music was great as well.<br/><br/>the only thing i didn't like was wen Eward went into the sunshine, in the book he sparkles like a thousand diamonds where as in the movie he only sparkles a little bit.<br/><br/>can't wait until new moon comes out. i recommend that you c this movie even if you haven't read the books 10/10."

So don't gain a hatred for this film from people's bad reviews.<br/><br/>I believe that the cast were perfect for this film, and I quite liked the artsy camera actions.<br/><br/>Even though IMDb says this film is rated 6, if you look at the full stats, it has more votes in the 10 category than anything else, this shows that this film is a really good film!"

","When going to see this movie I was not excited because I felt as though they picked the wrong thespians for the roles, but I only came to find out that I was wrong. The remarkable Robert Pattinson played an incredible Edward and was rather good looking. As well as Kristen Stewart who played the perfect Bella, she made me understand the heat between their love. This movie really proves that true love can overcome anything. It is great for anyone who is interested in viewing the great love story written by Stephenie Meyer, or even the cute boys in the movie such as Robert Pattinson, Cam Gigandet, and Taylor Lauther.<br/><br/>One of the greatest, must-watch movies of 2008!"

","Are you a thirteen year old girl? Are you an eighteen year old lad? Are you in your twenty's, thirty's or even forties? Why am I asking you these questions? Because every review I've read on Twilight says this film was made for every young kid in this world, well all I say to that is that is rubbish. I just got back from watching this great film and I'm a twenty two year old guy.<br/><br/>First of all we have Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) a pleasant young girl who moves to a new town to live with her father. Next up Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) part of a large family and well know but also with a secret that you shall find out as the film progresses. When I booked my ticket I was told the screen would be full of teenagers and that it had also been sold out all day, the cinema even had to cancel one film to accommodate a second screening of Twilight so I chose to go and watch this film during a late showing and yes it was well worth it as I was the only one in the room.<br/><br/>For those of you wondering this film is more of a drama slash romance not a horror but then again the romance is told is such a great way that you don't dare leave the room to nip to the toilet because it's full of great cinematography and storytelling, my advice don't go and watch this film during the day when the room will be packed, go and see it when you can watch in peace without someone talking or kicking your seat because this film deserves more glory than what most people on this site are giving it. I'm not a huge fan of romance but this film is totally different, it's unique and engaging, I'm giving it a whopping ten out of ten."
"laurencu","10","1","5","19 December 2008"," Amazing.
","As you may know Twilight came out today. Half day - so I watched Twilight with my friends. One of them really loves Twilight like me. The other 3 - 1 of them has read all of the books but was very sceptical about the movie. The other one read Twilight half way and gave up. The other one never read Twilight. All in all, we laughed and smiled all the way through.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved it. It seemed weird, it being on screen. I was going to book tickets seeing last night there were only 20 seats left (2nd screening). We got there just in time, and we thankfully all sat next to each other.<br/><br/>I had watched here and there on you tube and I thought it was pretty good anyway, but watching the quality and everything was wicked. It was so packed. All I could hear was the people but then I yelled at them and it was okay, I could hear once the movie had started.<br/><br/>I'd say the crowd was pretty much like the American screenings (So what I have heard from reviews..) Everyone screamed when Edward came on, laughed in the biology scene. There were some parts everyone seemed annoyed about9What some USA people have said) but I loved them I didn't like the way they didn't mention Jasper's ability. But, who cares, they can add it in later. And the whole random scene where Edward follows Bella, I was like eh, but I just can't hate the movie.<br/><br/>I though Kristen done amazing at the recovery scene, people were laughing and then I started yelling. Again. I don't mind if you think its funny, but when you can't hear anything its annoying. I thought the ballet scene was so much more than I expected! So..what can I say? I loved it. I've been in a good mood all day and that just made it better! Awesome.<br/><br/>Although, I was wondering about the Rosalie-does-something-to-tree thing, I thought well, they done that so the tracker would follow Rosalie, and Bella isn't with Rosalie, so that's all good. But then he changed direction. I didn't get that.<br/><br/>I loved the prom scene, awesomeness. Although how did Edward not know she was there? I know its a total blow, but obviously from NM/eclipse we realise that Edward cant tune into Victoria, so maybe he can't tune into the smell, either? If not, he probably just focused on Bella's smell. It doesn't bother me that much to be honest.<br/><br/>I know many people were upset, but I know some people who had very very high expectations, and who didn't realise the budget and time of the movie.<br/><br/>Movie is made of awesomeness. Also, Charlie's 'stache"
"meganlynntds","10","1","5","18 December 2008"," acting-good, directing...... wow
","okay first off, like one week before i saw this movie i had read the book, and i was HOOKED! on you tube i saw some behind the scenes stuff, and originally thought the director was a little strange. but now I'm quite angry, because she just screwed up what could've been one of the best movies ever! true, she had an understanding of teens and a natural edginess to the movie, which i liked, but COME ON! look at that makeup! Edward's character still looked gorgeous but wasn't he supposed to look PALER THAN KRISTEN? i understand that it being a teen movie and all, a little cheesiness is okay, but I'm a teen and some of it was just not necessary. okay the glittering scene was so amateur. it even had sound effects which really made it weird. some of the things Edward said was funny and i loved that about him but some of the lines were just downright stupid! ""better hold on tight spider monkey!"" god... no Catherine... no.<br/><br/>despite the director, the acting was very good. Pattinson made the stupid lines he had, believable and understandable. In my opinion, he was the perfect Edward. But the scene where he covers his mouth when Kristen walked in was a little funny to me. He looked like he was about to puke. Overall, I thought he was a really good actor and helped make this movie so much better. Stewart lacked complete emotion, but for some reason, i like her as Bella. i think she is the perfect person to play her. but the stuttering, was unbearable, like in the hospital. ""w-what w-what are you saying. i-i-i-i-i don't understand......"" for a second i thought Edward was going to laugh. Robert and Kristen had very strong chemistry though but i felt like i couldn't feel the passion between them as strongly as i did in the book. it sped right through and got straight to the action which wasn't so great. the special affects were embarrassingly bad. god. and then when Edward is sucking the blood out of Kristen (which is supposed to be a serious moment) she's cross-eyed!! i couldn't stop laughing. the book was serious and this movie was funny! i'm so glad that that other guy is directing the next one. it was so weird how Victoria was watching them dance. i know it was supposed to show a cliff hanger, but come on! what is she doing at prom?? my verdict, the acting was what MADE the movie, but Catherine really needs to put the camera down and let someone more worthy of making this series take over."
"kkc780","7","1","5","18 December 2008"," i feel dissed
","(i'm not entirely sure if this is a spoiler, but i checked it to be safe)<br/><br/>OK, well maybe thats a little harsh. but seriously, i am a HUGE fan of Twilight. i walked in, knowing that they took out some scenes, the script was different. but really, that much!?<br/><br/>i admit, there was some pretty good parts. but trust me, do NOT try to sit there, comparing the movie from the book. i did that, i was very disappointed.<br/><br/>like, you cant even tell that they like each other!! neither of them say 'i love you', or anything. his lips only touched her skin about 4 times. they took out 4 kissing scenes!! they only kissed twice! i read twilight for the romance, and there was none! oh, and chp 14 (mind over matter)? vanished. gone. blood type (chp 5)? never happens. you never find out that Bella gets sick from the smell or sight of blood. and she also never mentions that she talks in her sleep. I mean, you can't miss the chemistry between Rob and Kristen, but you can't tell the chemistry between Bella and Edward (sorry if that's confusing, but's that's the only way I could put it). The camera shots were really bad (kind of like ""stay in one spot please!""). I think hardwicke tried to hard.<br/><br/>OK, if rob was trying to look scary during the bio scene, he didn't do a very good job. he made the whole audience laugh! jaspers face was hilarious too. the rest was horrible. Alice needed to be more bubbly, Jasper needed to be in it WAY more, and especially rob and kristen could've been WAY better at delivering the lines. Jacob needed to be more...idk...manly I guess. I don't know how to describe it...he seemed to be too mature. Whenever I think of Jacob, I always think the mechanic, not-afraid-to-get-his-hands-dirty, childish type of guy. I don't think Taylor did a good enough job...hopefully he gets better in new moon.<br/><br/>Well, not all of them were horrible. Charlie was awesome, loved Renee, I thought that Nikki (Rosalie) was really good about showing her dislike towards Bella. Carlisle and Emmett (i love him! sorry, fangirl moment...haha) was pretty good also.<br/><br/>so, overall, i would give this movie, if this was just basically the movie, a good C-. but, to the book, a D+. not kidding. if you are still motivated to see the movie, i only have 1 tip. whatever you do, DO NOT TRY TO COMPARE THE MOVIE WITH THE BOOK, AND GO IN WITH A OPEN MIND. OR YOU WILL BE Disappointed!! if you haven't read the book, PLEASE, for the sake of twilighters, please read it after you see this movie. trust me.<br/><br/>oh, and I just watched the deleted scenes on youtube. If they added those, I wouldn't be as mad. just saying..."
"kate-833","7","1","5","15 December 2008"," Solid adaptation of a brilliant book
","The easy to thing to do in a review like this is to minutely compare the movie to the book. And as an avid fan of the book, I had to resist that urge for a while in the movie. This series totally rocked my world - I know it is aimed at people younger than me, but it totally captured me.<br/><br/>So going into the movie, as a book purist I was nervous. How would the dynamic between Edward and Bella be maintained? Would that intensity be there? Because in the book, that is my strongest recollection - their relationship is so intense that I can feel it eating the page as I read the words. And I am not an automatic fan of Robert Pattinson so didn't have that sense of teen-scream adoration. Was pleased then to see a solid character/relationship development between Robert and Kristen - it was a joy to see some of my favourite sections of the book be realised.<br/><br/>Billy Burke was wonderful as Charlie and I started to get a feeling for the Cullens and their family/friendship dynamic, but I wished that we saw more of them, that more was done with both their backgrounds and their character arcs during the actual film. In many parts of the book they create the patina to the Edward/Bella relationship, and I felt that was missing from the movie. Characters like Mike and Jessica felt like broadbrush sketches rather than fully developed characters.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong ... I came straight out of the movie and wanted to see it again ... immediately. But I felt that the intensity was not there between Bella and Edward - I never felt like their relationship was going to swallow the world. I thought Robert and Kristen were well cast, but I think that the direction/script let them down a wee bit. I never felt challenged, and some of the scenes slipped into B-grade schmaltz occasionally. Here's to a better adaptation of the second book - all the more difficult because of the lack of Edward for much of it! I wanted to be fiercely captured and captivated by this movie. I wanted to be challenged and fall in love with the magic of Bella and Edward all over again. But I wasn't unfortunately. It was like eating a fabulous dish with a key ingredient missing, the ingredient that unlocks the magic."
"max_bimbi","6","1","5","15 December 2008"," Exhibit A: Movie, Exhibit B: Book. TWO Separate TEXTS
","Firstly, those who have read and enjoyed the book must watch the movie as a separate text. Do not think of it as the book. If you go in there with expectations that it is the same and will be just as good (or bad) you will be sitting there picking at every little thing.<br/><br/>Yes, there were a few changes that i didn't agree with, but what can you do. Although there were a few things that i loved, such as the baseball scene. However, you think that being a blockbuster film they would have invested into more of the special effects regarding the movement of the vampires, not just a tacky blur, also they should have reinforced the special powers that the Cullen's possess.<br/><br/>In response to another review, the reason the movie focused on the fights and action is due to the fact that Meyers does not include a lot of those in her books. I think this is due to her religious values or whatever reason. But in every book the fight sequence that occurs is omitted as Bella is always removed from the battle. Which is annoying as a reader, but what can you do. So in that aspect i enjoyed the movie as it exaggerated the fights for the purpose of entertainment."
"SherrieNeil","10","1","5","15 December 2008"," Loved the Movie Loved the Books!
","I was first told about the movie and books a week before it came out when my family was planning to go. I went to a preview of the film with no expectations just knowing that it came from a book. I loved the film. I then wanted more. After watching The Love between Edward and Bella I just fell for the story and had to have another dose. So I picked up the books and read all 4 with in 2 weeks. It was hard to put the books down. While the books are more detailed and have much more insight to them. the MOVIE was awesome. The movie covers all the basics and keeps your interest. I have now seen it he movie 4 times but I do not plan on leaving it at that number anytime soon. I do however feel bad for the actors as they are just actors and should not have to deal with all the crazed women out there, People need to remember that its the charicture they love NOT the actor.

"minivann","8","1","5","14 December 2008"," RE: worst. vampire. movie, ever.
","well OF COURSE it was the worst vampire movie ever! Because of one main reason; it wasn't a vampire movie. Twilight wasn't meant to have the typical blood and gore vampires. This was how Stephenie Meyer saw her vampires. I just think it's kind of funny how people are STILL calling it a ""vampire movie"" when hundreds of interviews with the cast and Stephenie Meyer herself have repeatedly said ""this is not your typical vampire movie"". So if this just wasn't your taste then I'm fine with that, but don't classify it as a vampire movie. It's like saying West Side Story is a movie about gangs. Yes, it wasn't a very good movie but there are thousands of fans out there who love it just for the story. If you read the books you would appreciate it a whole lot more."

","Twilight was a great movie. I had watched it before reading the novel though. The novel was definitely ten times better and I'm usually not the type to read. After seeing Twilight with a friend who had read the novel, I knew it was a necessity to read it. I thought the movie was great, but she was disappointed. At first, I couldn't understand why she would have felt this way. Then a read it. I do like the movie a lot, but it missed key points, including the biology blood test lab, and Bella's lullaby. Major events were missed, but i guess there wouldn't be time to put everything in. The acting was phenomenal. I think the directors did great picking out the Cullens. Even though some weren't what i imagined them looking like, they played the part well and changed my opinion. Robert Pattinson was my favorite actor. At first, he wasn't as good looking as the book intended, but after watching the movie again, after i read it and seeing the romance and chivalry, i immediately fell in love. So, I would recommend this movie to anyone, and it isn't just a chick flick either. It involves action, gore, and anticipation, which could appeal a guy too. I went with two guys, and surprisingly they liked it. I thought they would fall asleep. Oh, and if you want your man to be more romantic and proper, bring him to see it and say how much you would love to have a guy like Edward."

","She had the physical look;however no emotion!!! According to the book she has found the love of her life and is in complete euphoria. Not once do they tell each other they love each other in the movie. I understand that Bella is insecure and feels she doesn't deserve Edward, but Kristen stewart does not make us believe that; instead she looks almost bored. The one and only time you hear a tiny laugh out of her is going up into the trees with Edward.... It was frustrating to watch the scenes where she was getting upset, it was such bad acting! If she is going to continue with the movies, she needs to read the books again, and again. Bella has A TON of emotion. Bella is serious as well; Stewart has got that part down, now she needs to work making us believe she is actually in love and blissfully happy like Bella is portrayed in the book. Rob Pattison, was perfectly cast and his performance was excellent..."
"RaileanKassota79","8","1","5","12 December 2008"," Book is better but movie is still good
","I did make the mistake of reading the book first. I swore to myself if I knew a book was being made into a movie I would wait for the movie, especially after the Harry Potter catastrophe. I spent every single move to busy going, ""Yes, I remember that part."" ""Yea it happened like that."" ""That's not how I pictured it looking like."" And so on and so forth. That was how I spent the first viewing of Twilight. The movie, to me seemed to pass by really fast. I was able to pick up on a lot of underlying sub-plots but that was again because I had read the book.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to view it a second time with someone who had not read the book. So at the end I asked her what she thought. She felt the story and plot were great; there were a few things she didn't understand, like Alice's whole vision things. I did explain a few concepts behind the visions and she said it help a little to understand some parts of the movie. It wasn't that the movie skipped over it, it was just explained to fast and she missed it. She did love the chemistry between Bella and Edward. It kind of reminded her of Romeo and Juliet. For those who have read ALL the books they understand why that comparison is very entertaining.<br/><br/>So unlike other good books that are turned into movies I felt that this one was able to hold it's own without someone having to read the book, you just need to go see it a second time, which I feel it worth the money."
"nilo_popo","7","1","5","10 December 2008"," Not bad, But I still prefer books
","OK, I know this film has been selling so well, And I got to see it sooner than I should. and I have some things to say about it. I read the twilight series in the past month, And I really enjoyed it. they were some of the most romantic books I've ever read, and I absolutely loved the series. I expected the movie to be not exactly as good as books - as it happens all the time, e.g. for harry potter - but I also expected that they notice some little things that make big differences in the story line. First, I wanted to say that Kristen Stewart played Bella really well. and about the movie, The relationship between Bella and Edward is not how it is pictured in the book. In the movie, it seems like they are strangers to each other, even after falling in love. They barely talk, and in the scene where they go to Cullen's house, Bella acts like she's talking to somebody she doesn't know at all. I felt the loving relationship in the books was very deeper. there are some little things I don't like about the movie. Like Bella imagining Edward biting her, as soon as she found out he's a vampire. This never had happened in the book. not even in a fraction of second. Her trust towards Edward totally avoided this imagination. and then, when Carlise tells Edward ""Stop, You're killing her"" this sentence really got on my nerves. Edward didn't need anyone to tell him to stop drinking her blood, he did it himself. I think this little sentence weakened the sacrifice Edward made to save his love's life. Over all, I think the movie wasn't very bad, But I really imagined it a lot more better than this. I hope new moon will get better."
"super-fondue","8","1","5","9 December 2008"," Perhaps the crew is to blame?
","I have read all the novels and found that Twilight and New Moon were my favourites, as they had fairly consistent plot/characters, unlike the next two which I think get progressively messier. However, all the books have a very immature writing style - I'm not sure if this is just Bella's simplistic way of saying things or if Meyer is not a talented writer - it had very little imagery (at least, original imagery that didn't involve teen angst).<br/><br/>I just watched the film Twilight and as in the books, the plot and characters were consistent (with the exception of the Cullens - as in the novel Twilight, they were underplayed), but the cinematography, score/music, and direction was poor. <br/><br/>In many scenes, I felt irritated with the music chosen, as it either accompanied the scene unnecessarily or was used inappropriately. The only song I felt remotely worked was Muse's Supermassive Black Hole in the baseball scene, but even then it could have been a better song. I know Meyer loves Muse and there are many better songs by Muse out there!<br/><br/>The cinematography was altogether messy. I recognized it immediately from Catherine Hardwicke's Thirteen - the camera moving, overused shots, constantly changing shots - which worked perfectly for Thirteen, as it is meant to have a realistic feel to a very human story, but it was poorly used in Twilight. Elliot Davis is a talented cinematographer but his application of shots in Twilight made me frustrated and the excess of different angles and traveling shots did not at all benefit the story. <br/><br/>The acting however, was surprisingly good. Edward at first was a little weak but Pattinson really pulled through by the close of the film. I've always considered Bella to be a weak character and was pleased to see Stewart make her into less of a whiny girl and more of an independent woman. <br/><br/>When I was waiting for Twilight to come out, I had hope that it would translate onto screen beautifully, as it has the potential to, but instead it was average, and sometimes irritating, as if it were screaming, ""YES, THIS IS A FILM. LOOK HOW MANY SHOTS WE CAN DO IN ONE SCENE!"" I think Catherine Hardwicke, instead of adapting a book, tried to re-create something of her own, which is fine IF you can pull it off. I think with a new director, New Moon will be much more successful. All up, it was good, but certainly not clever."
"WickednessIsAMyth","7","1","5","5 December 2008"," The Hype, The Reality, The Movie
","I have a somewhat unique perspective on Twilight. I didn't know about it until a few months ago when I saw a teaser-trailer. So, rather than immediately give in to the hype surrounding it, I decided to try an experiment. I bought the book, but didn't read it. I waited until the movie came out, watched the movie, read the book and then watched the movie again. So, I can honestly say I've seen the movie from multiple perspectives. I have just recently finished reading the next three books in the series so my knowledge about the series is fairly well-rounded.<br/><br/>So, first of all, is Twilight a great film? Sadly, no. It's a...good film. It is a solid ""C+"" effort. And it will probably wear slightly better once the hype wears off and the audience calms a little (i.e., DVD/Blu-Ray sales). The hype storm surrounding the movie is part of the problem. People started expecting so much of this rather small-budgeted *teen* movie that the movie itself failed to meet the somewhat extraordinary expectations. Twilight = $37 million; by contrast Harry Potter 1 = $125 million. Get the difference? I didn't want to compare the two franchises, but it does seem rather impossible to avoid. Sorry.<br/><br/>I know people say they understand that film and print are two different media, but when one invests so much time in a single medium (print) it is difficult to divest oneself of the connection. So the secondary medium (film) will always be worse. It takes a conscious effort to remove the print expectations from the film and it can be difficult. In this case, it actually should have been easier than it seems to be for a lot of people.<br/><br/>When I first saw the movie (before reading the book) I was...let's say, less than impressed. I probably wouldn't have even given it the C rating I now do. Without knowing the story, the film could easily be conceived as jagged -- the pace was certainly too fast by half. However, I followed through on my experiment and am now grateful I did. Please remember, this was a five hundred page book. You will lose things -- important things -- in the translation to a two-hour movie. It is inevitable.<br/><br/>However, the reason I say the translation should have been easier is because I also give the *book* a C (some days a B-). I am a Harry Potter girl and I have spent a good chunk of time over the last ten years (Good God, has it seriously been ten years?) reading and beta-reading fanfiction. Now, the Twilight story itself is a good one and the universe Stephenie Meyer created is also intriguing, but it almost reads as fanfiction to me. It certainly carries that flavor. *Good* fanfiction -- better than probably 99% out there currently (and I would know). However, please, someday, do what I did -- pick up Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone again. I can easily remember why I was so unimpressed with the Harry Potter series until book 3.<br/><br/>Twilight is not great literature, but there is a lot of space between the great American novel and bad writing and the Twilight series fits in that spectrum somewhere toward the former. And I find myself understanding the movie more after having read the series. I think the book rating and the film rating are roughly on par with one another and can easily be related. Which is why I'm giving it a C+ rating.<br/><br/>Now, forget the book. Let's talk movie.<br/><br/>To begin, it is a Romeo/Juliet, paranormal *romantic* teen movie. Bear that in mind. It didn't attempt to be so much more than that because that is the universe it exists in.<br/><br/>The acting was a solid B average; in some places it was more, in some it was less. The chemistry between the leads is apparent from the first moment they're in the frame together. This lends the movie a nice head start because Bella and Edward are what the series is about. So, once they've got that chemistry, the filmmakers are already ahead. I think, in general, the casting choices were great, but some of the lines they were given to act were...not so great. Again, that kind of fanfiction feel to it; and even great actors can have difficulty with moronic dialogue (to which the screenplay occasionally degenerates). And remember, the two leads are still in the infancy of their careers. Give them some time to mature.<br/><br/>And yes, the special effects were simplistic but so what? Since when are special effects necessary to make a movie worthwhile? I rather like the fact that it had a smaller budget for such a hyped-up movie. Remember, $37 million. A week of rehearsals and 44 days of principal photography. Knowing the numbers, I'm even more impressed.<br/><br/>And just as a note on a few bits of the praiseworthy: thank you to Robert Pattinson for getting his accent down perfectly. It is a difficult thing to act with any accent, let alone a subtle one that is so far removed from the natural voice. Also to Kristen Stewart who played a lovestruck teen girl to perfection without being any more annoying than necessary (excepting perhaps one scene).<br/><br/>This movie is what it seems to be. A teen romance with a paranormal edge and smaller budget. Try not to compare it to things it cannot be compared to¬Öincluding the book. You'll just end up disappointed. Accept the movie as is and enjoy what is there to enjoy. You'll be much happier, anyway."
"hannahbry27","8","1","5","3 December 2008"," I liked it. - Minor spoilers
","I'm a huge book-to-movie skeptic. I always expect them to be awful. But I saw Twilight and it followed the story fairly well - there were a few different things, of course, but it wasn't enough to make me think, ""No, it didn't go like that!"" The characters were good, and the actors portraying them did a good job for the most part. There were, of course, down points (Kristen Stewart's sputtering in the hospital bed and in the hallway), but overall I think that the movie followed the book well and delivered a beautiful love story. Some parts were a bit silly (""Hold on tight, spider monkey!""), but it appeals to the masses of 14-year-old girls who all went to see Robert Pattinson as Edward :) and I must say, he IS gorgeous!"
"carmel_latte118","7","1","5","2 December 2008"," Twilight: Not as bad as people have been saying...
","To preface this review, I read all four Twilight books this past summer after hearing about the series through several friends. At first, I was hesitant toward reading the series, envisioning all Twilight fans as being Gothic Hot Topic enthusiasts or Anne Rice worshippers. To my surprise, I became hooked on the Twilight series and thoroughly enjoy rereading the books to this day.<br/><br/>With that said, I eagerly anticipated the release of Twilight, despite how cheesy the trailers depicted the film, through Kristen Stewart's monotone voice and Robert Pattinson's incredibly pale skin; in turn, I had skeptical opinions on how the translation from book to film would turn out.<br/><br/>To my surprise, Twilight, in fact, translated well into a movie, considering that the film had a low-budget and a mediocre script. Likewise, I think that Robert Pattinson's portrayal of Edward Cullen the first half of the film was somewhat awkward, particularly his tone of voice and his approach towards Bella; for instance, the scene in which he questions Bella in the school hallway about her mother moving to Jacksonville and then walking away from Bella differed from the Twilight novel Edward; I had always envisioned Edward to detest Bella at first, but never be shy of her. As the film progressed, Pattinson's acting improved, and illustrated the mystery and darkness surrounding Edward's character.<br/><br/>Another significant part of Twilight the book that screenwriter Melissa Rosenburg could have improved on for Twilight the movie was Edward and Bella's love. It seemed as if their relationship was rushed, especially compared to the novel; rather than a romance, the movie made it seem as if Edward and Bella were nothing more than a typical high school couple. I wish that Rosenburg would have delved deeper into their relationship, seeing that the basis of Edward and Bella's romance is the driving force for the whole series.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought that Twilight was an enthralling film for its projected audience¬óthe classic tale of forbidden love and wanting what one cannot have. I believe that the Twilight series has potential to become a successful movie series and that the next film, New Moon, will work wonders with a bigger budget and a more action-based story."
"freemetal-1","8","1","5","1 December 2008"," Not the best movie ever made but a good one no doubt about it ...
","I'm one of the persons that have seen the movie before reading the book so maybe this is why I don't have reprehension words for it. I didn't expect more then a movie with a vampire and a love story rolling down the middle. After seeing it all the way through I remained with a sentiment of enjoyment and excitement about getting my hands on the book as fast as I can. So I bought it and read it the same day and it made me realize it's way better but the movie was not such a disappointing in any case.<br/><br/>Let's think about it. This movie made someone who did not hear anything about the book be so interested in it and read it so fast and by the end be madly in love with the characters and the story itself. That's a good thing, right? :) Also I liked very much the main actors, Robert did a great job and Kristen was not so bad either. The story line surely could have been better, the scenes were not so connected, the character personality was not so good outlined, the intensity from he book was missing and not sticking to the story in many cases did a bad job to the movie. But over all this was a very enjoyable movie. Maybe not so much for those who have already read the book, but certainly not the hugest disappointing they were bragging about. If you have read the book and expect the movie to rise to its status then you're a fool, nothing is better then you imagination in designing the story set up and characters so nothing will even be close to what it is supposed to be in your mind.<br/><br/>Some said they came to see the movie with little expectation and still it was lower then they would've thought, I'm wondering what were they expecting then? ... and is it not enough that the movie made other people and I bet a lot of people anxious to read the book?; some said the actors were to blame, I think they were good and actually am glad to have seen the movie and enjoyed the main characters because is easy to read and imagine something with a drawing already set up in your head and the faces visible and of your like; some that the effects for the movie were bad, just blur when they were moving fast, I also like to see nice visual effect but this was not the focus of the story and if I think about great movies with great actors or money that should have been over any limits and instead the simple driving of the car was made into an on set pathetic action I'm happy about the way the effect in Twilight turned out; some say the movie had too much attention to the scenery and landscapes rather then the story but I find that this was a nice thing, it's hard to only follow the story of the inner struggle of the characters and if the landscapes help to explain not only the power of Edward but also the life he's leading why not take advantage of them?<br/><br/>Overall I'm happy with the way this movie turned out, even after reading the book, it could have been definitely better, maybe some more parts of the story being actually evoked and not replaced or changed but I think(hope :) ) the writers and director will do a better job for the next ones. Or at least I'm happy I discovered a really good story and will certainly enjoy the rest of the books as I read them."

","Like many other people, I love the twilight series! I was very excited that they were making a movie. Of course the movie will never live up to the book, that's just the way is it. This film was very good. The audience was very into it also. Edward (Robert) was well cast and so was Bella (Kirsten). This film has everything in it, and its great for all ages. You will fall in love with the story just as the characters fall in love with each other. The acting was good, and the fight scene was crazy and just how I imagined it. The music was really cool, they had muse and linkin park, {Linkin Park} is described as bella and edward's band in the books. This comes from someone who didn't think she would like the movie, but I love it. Please go see it if you haven't and go see it again if you have, I know I will.<br/><br/>This film had the best of everything."

","I have to laugh at the people that didn't like the movie, they are clueless as to what is really involved with doing a screen play from a book. Rarely is it the same as the book. <br/><br/>I believe the casting for the movie was right on, I really care about what happen and felt the emotion, I did not read the book, but my wife did, I went to see it to make her happy and really enjoyed it. She was very pleased with the way they did the story line in relationship to the book.<br/><br/>I think they did a great job of bring the story out even if I didn't read the book. I was very pleasantly surprised and one of the best story lines have has seen in a couple years. <br/><br/>Hollywood has been putting out a lot of movie lately with no heart and this one had plenty of it. Yes, the could have use more money for the effects.<br/><br/>I remember the first Terminator was quite same with a low budget and the 2nd Terminator actually made for money, but the first is a classic as this will be.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to next movie to see what they can do with the larger budget and such a great cast."
"kathyeweb","10","1","5","30 November 2008"," Loved the movie AND the book!!
","I really Loved the Movie Twilight!! Now I know there were differences in the book, but you get that when you change formats from a book to the screen. Some things in the book are not as visually appealing, so you change it up for dramatic effects. I thought they did a great job considering the budget. There are things that were not in the movie that I loved in the book, but you can't have everything in the movie and still keep it at 2 hours. There is one thing that I learned when moving books into film is that you have to see it more than once. The first time you see the movie you will be comparing the movie to the book, which is only natural. The second time you see it, you will be watching the movie for the movie itself. Things tend to flow better and you can really engross yourself into the movie. I have watched the movie Twilight 7 times and LOVE it!! It is my escape, just jump into that world for awhile. I have read the book Twilight 15 times, and the rest of the series 12 times. I love the way she writes her books. There are serious parts and really funny parts. I will be reading and just start laughing and my husband wonders what is going on. It is great!! Her other book ""The Host"" is really good too. Just remember Edward and Bella are not in this book, so don't look for them in it. So for those of you who didn't like it and only saw it once, go see it again. Just enjoy the movie and don't pick it apart. Remember it is for entertainment, you are not getting graded on it. And enjoy the audience around you. Whether it is a group of teenage girls or a group of adults (men and women), it is a great experience that I would love to do again!!"
"sugarthegnome","1","1","5","30 November 2008"," I Liked It!
","OK, so I'm one of those die-hard book fans, but I wasn't set on it being completely like the book to begin with. When I went to the movie I wasn't going to be checking for all the details, and making sure it was like the book. I just sat back and got ready to enjoy it. That's really all you need. It is a lot like the book, but look at it as something different too, otherwise you might be disappointed. I walked out liking it, and all giddy over it with my friends. :) I thought Robert Pattinson did okay as his role as Edward, although some of his facial expressions were overdone and he looked angry a lot of the time. I didn't feel exactly like Kristen Stewart was Bella, but not enough that it ruined the film for me. They had some awkward scenes, but good ones, together. I especially liked, however, some of the supporting roles. Cam Gigandet made a very good James in my opinion. He got the whole ""bad vampire and slightly animalistic"" thing down great. The same for Rachelle Lefevre as Victoria. Nikki Reed did a good portrayal as Rosalie with her personality and dislike of Bella. Ashley Greene was cute and happy, like Alice. Jackson Rathbone was a good Jasper, and I liked his pained facial expressions throughout the film. (By the way, Jasper and Alice were very sweet together.) :) I really liked all of the Cullens.<br/><br/>The baseball scene was my favorite. I also liked the parts they threw in with the bad vampires, attacking people, which they didn't really have in the book. The movie's still cute and fluffy, but it threw in more darkness and violence, which the Twilight series lacked in some spots. They showed a little more of the ""real vampire"" side in the film.<br/><br/>So, I recommend it. It's not perfect, and has flaws, but over look those things. You should be ready for it being different than the book, but just enjoy it. It's something different, but also stays true to the book."
"leprkan","8","1","5","29 November 2008"," 2 cents from a non-fanatic
","As a twenty-something unbiased non-twilight, non-harry potter reader I have to say that I thought this movie was pretty good. I've noticed that most reviews are very biased by either twilight fanatics, or those who apparently hate the book and entered the theater thinking the movie would be horrible and refused to absorb the movie. I wasn't expecting much but I thought the acting was decent and the characters portrayed the aching love they felt for one another rather well. It took me back to that time in my life that every girl has felt, falling in love so hard it hurts and usually with a person who's bad for you in some way. I would have liked a little more action and the action scenes to be a bit more realistic but I understand that this was on quite a strict budget and perhaps the sequels will allow that. Overall I really liked it and now will probably read the novel. I say just have an open mind and don't expect an Oscar worthy film and you should enjoy it."
"shaneslily-1","9","1","5","29 November 2008"," Awesome!
","Twilight is one of the most beautiful modern love stories ever put into a motion picture. If you happened to have read the book first, you will still enjoy the passion and danger portrayed in the motion picture. If you haven't, like me, you will run to the nearest Barnes and Nobles and buy a copy. It has intrigue, humor, passion, drama as well as trauma and the best of all, handsome men and women to look at. I love romantic novels and movies. I have a full collection of them. And as a scholar of English literature, I have placed Twilight among one of the classics. If you enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, etc.,and their modern counterpart Underworld, then you would definitely must go and see Twilight. It will make you fall in love all over again!"

","I'm not much of a Twilight book fan. but after I saw the movie, I thought it was so good I would read the book because I thought it was going to be just as good. But I just gotta say, after I read the book, I was very disappointed. I know everybody's opinion matters and all, but I have NO idea why people are saying the book was way better than the movie. The movie was more exciting, funny, dramatic, etc., while the book...not so much. I love the book and all, but the movie seemed 150% way better.<br/><br/>Another thing, the acting was superb! Robert did a perfect job on being the lead vampire and Kirsten played her lines perfectly."
"ElwynP","8","1","5","29 November 2008"," Excellent entertainment. Good artistically.
","The entire audience was enthralled with the movie--and it wasn't just young women. During the last scenes there was absolute silence. And that is rare. I greatly preferred the movie to the book. The purpose of a movie is entertainment and I give that a 10<br/><br/>Artistically, however, the movie so uneven that I'd give it a 6. Carlisle's make-up to age him is obvious in one scene. Edward's hairstyle is weird and distracting to the point that I found myself staring at it and not following the movie now and then. The dialogue is honest and simple,which is appropriate for this movie but it could have been better.<br/><br/>The main problem I have is that three of the important Cullen family are two-dimensional while lesser characters are well-rounded. Rosalie is a witch and Jasper is the great stone face and that's all they are. I don't even remember what Emmett looks like. This is poor writing and a missed opportunity. You can round out characters without telling the mysteries of their lives.<br/><br/>Acting was also uneven. Bella was acted all right but nothing special. While all of the acting was acceptable,these are the characters to watch: Jacob, Alice, Charlie Swan, and the three traditional vampires, each one well done. Rob's creation of Edward is outstanding, as I expected. He also did something that few actors have the knack for: taking an ordinary line and speaking it in a way that you remember it. If his interpretation of the ""hero...bad guy"" line was intentional, Rob is one of those few.<br/><br/>Go see it for the entertainment alone and you'll love it."

Of course everyone has the "" Romeo and Juliet"" thing but was so different.Of course the movie isen't going to be the same as the book no movie is but they way Robert and Kristen portrayed Bella and Edward was great. Kristen did a great job playing Bella even down to her klutziness, and rob as Edward did amazing as well.

"TheTalkingStove","7","1","5","21 November 2008"," Of Course It Had Flaws, But I Still Loved It!
","So, Twilight. What to say about Twilight? <br/><br/>Cast: The casting director clearly did their job extremely well because everyone did amazing. Robert Pattinson as Edward was maybe the best decision about this movie. While watching the movie, I actually forgot he was British. Though his accent may have faltered some times, he seemed to do just fine. The supporting cast pulled off their characters pretty well. Especially Nikki Reed. I do however, wish I could say the same with Kristen Stewart. Several times during the movie, it seemed like she didn't put much effort into it, or she overacted way too much. But for most of the movie, she was tolerable.<br/><br/>The Script: Melissa Rosenberg did fine for the most part. She kept some of the main lines in there like the ""heroin"" one and the ""lion&lamb"". But she did feel it was necessary to add her own cheesiness in there. There were some lines that left me thinking, ""What the hell does that mean?"" On a lighter note, it was unexpectedly funny. I didn't expect to laugh that much. A lot of it came from the human friends of Bella. It was a nice surprise to laugh.<br/><br/>The Setting: Breathtaking. It was just so, green. And remarkable. Oregon was a well chosen place to film.<br/><br/>The Make-Up: Noticeable. You could see Edward's contacts and eyeliner in the film. I liked it how Kristen Stewart said ""...you're pale white..."", but yet, she is exactly the same color.<br/><br/>The Special Effects: Probably the worst part of the movie. I knew the budget wasn't high, so I didn't expect anything great from it. The ""speed"" effect kind of reminded me of Benny Hill. The ""sparkle"" effect however, I did not have a problem with. I was very pleased with it. And the baseball scene? Brilliant. The jumping from tree-to-tree wasn't that great. You could tell they used wires. It just seemed a bit, off.<br/><br/>The Music: I loved the music very much. The songs seemed to match the scene just fine. Like Supermassive Black Hole with the baseball scene was great. As well as Let Me Sign towards the end of the movie. And Spotlight when Edward was telling the back story of the Cullen family was another favorite of mine. The score was alright though. I loved the lullaby, but the rest of the music with the electric guitar reminded me of a 90's porno.<br/><br/>Goofs: Of course there were some, this IS a low budget movie. But I'll let you spot them out. :) But best scene out of entire movie? Baseball scene. Everything about that was amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought it was very good and I didn't think it would be that good. It was a fun movie, and I plan on seeing it more than once in the theater. And I can't wait for New Moon.<br/><br/>7/10"
"courick11","8","1","5","22 November 2008"," Entertaining - not the book, but I liked it =]
","Keep in mind that no movie is as good as its book. It's impossible, seriously. And two: The movie can never ruin a book and it can't take the place of a book. And don't compare the movie to the book, it's not totally fair anyway. On that note: <br/><br/>I really enjoyed myself. I'm one of those obsessive twilight freaks you either see buying shirts or read about. Nice to meet you. <br/><br/>I went into the theater cautious because of the reviews I'd read. However, I went out thinking I don't think I saw the same movie everyone else saw. Yes I did feel like parts of the book that were left out would have filled the holes I noticed, but it still was pretty good. The beginning of the movie was the worst part for me. I felt that there were a lot of holes and if I hadn't read the books, I'd have been a bit confused and rushed through. I didn't really like the changes in the Biology scene. But I'm okay with it. As far as the acting, I thought it was fine. Yes, a lot of people disagree which is fine but also sad. I think the acting deserves more credit than it's getting. Rob did a pretty good job playing Edward. Kristen did a good job at playing Bella. I really liked Cam as James, he did an excellent job as well did Rachelle. My favorite part of the movie was the baseball scene. I loved Muse's song during that scene and just how awesome it was. The baseball scene all the way to the end is the best part of the movie for me. I felt a bit sad about the awaited meadow scene as it really wasn't that scene I read in the book. And when Edward saves Bella in Port A. I felt giddy like I did reading the book. <br/><br/>Overall I thought the movie was good, maybe great, but not perfect. The thing that everyone seems to neglect is A. the movie didn't have the money that like Harry Potter or a Batman movie would get. It had to make do. B. It could have been a lot worse. Bella could have been changed completely as could have the other characters. <br/><br/>It's not fair to treat this movie with high class before it's viewing and than bash it when it is out. And it wasn't as bad as a lot of people are saying, those who may not even love the books as much as I do. Everyone needs to remember that there is a fine line between a book and the movie it is BASED off of. You will always love the book more. <br/><br/>I think that everyone should be thankful that Twilight is actually getting it's deserved attention and that a movie is made. Let's hope that negative comments won't ruin this film saga so the films can grow with time and money. <br/><br/>IF you're wondering if you should see it and you've read the book: Go see it. IT's not the book, so it can't ruin it. And it is a good film. I really enjoyed it and this is coming from one of those obsessive freaks =]<br/><br/>If you wondering if you should see it and you've not read the book: Go see it anyway. I will be honest and say I felt that if I hadn't read the book, there are plot holes. But that could just be because I read the book. My step mom saw it with me and hadn't read the book and she enjoyed it and got the main idea. And now she wants to read this book i've been trying to get her to read forever. So you may walk out wanting to read the magic that the film was based off of. <br/><br/>Thanks and keep an open mind. I really liked it. =]"
"Critic620","9","1","5","21 November 2008"," You'll surely sink your teeth into this!
","Twilight was much better than I expected. Sometimes it can be very hard to pack a long book into a movie. Take the harry potter series for instance! You've got a tremendously long book, and only 2-3 hours to fit it into a cinematic masterpiece! Twilight certainly did well in this area, but of course there were some good parts left out.<br/><br/>Now, every movie has its flaws, but Twilight only had a few. First, in my opinion, it was a bit too...fast. Scenes literally flew by in seconds and you never really get a chance to catch your breath. Of course, I understand they may shorten scenes to fit more of the book into it, but they may have been a bit..too rushed. Secondly, and probably the part that really irked me, was that Bella...was...emotionless. Her voice was just..static. It never quite changed until certain big parts, but it was pretty much Mono-tone throughout, and I didn't like that.<br/><br/>Aside from those negatives, I think the movie was very well done, but I would hope that for the next installment, they take a bit more time and clean it up a bit before it hits theaters.<br/><br/>OH and one word of warning. Should you decide to see Twilight in theaters, be prepared for the constant screams and laughs...and possibly tears! That's just how much this movie truly gripped some Twilight fans."
"Michael Kenmore","4","1","5","23 November 2008"," OK movie; has that TV Movie of the Month feel
","I went to the movies Friday morning to avoid tweens and teenyboppers in the audience. The screening met my expectation -- no obnoxious fiddling with illuminated cell phone/PDA and no seat kicking. Even old conservative geezer couples were there, which is amusing considering Twilight is intended for the youthful audience.<br/><br/>I never read the book the movie is based on. However, I read the in-depth negative reviews that proclaim the book, with the fair use quotes of flowery narrative sentences as proof, to be spectacularly awful.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of the movie is awful. Contrived narrative dialogue and contrived scenes with actors pretending to play horse for exposition. I felt annoyed and embarrassed with a smirk on my bearded face because the introduction is so lame. However, at the point when Edward saves Belle's life, the movie really began to pick up and never let go until the very last minute deflates the momentum with a blatant open door for a sequel. Hollywood needs to quit giving away the hint for sequels.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart delivers a decidedly average performance with almost minimal acting. I was impressed with her acting as a foul-mouthed tween in The Panic Room and a horny jailbait in Into the Wild, but in Twilight Kristen's character acts like a coy upstart. Maybe that's the exact character as depicted in the novel, because in the movie Belle comes off as a brunette bimbo walking through the high school hall like her crap don't stink only to be saved by the prince with the shining armor...no, someone handsome with the strength and dexterity of a superhuman. That would be Edward, but no need to spoil further. But the movie does have severe logic holes that would be laughable if it were applied to reality.<br/><br/>For example, why would the vampire family comprised of young adults repeat high school for decades? Belle's quip ""that's miserable"" notwithstanding, this is illogical. Immortal vamps should have attended colleges and universities on days when the sun don't shine. Their lives spent on higher education wouldn't go to waste, because they'd rack up more than 100 specialized field degrees combined. They'd have genius IQ and be fabulously rich. The private property the family own...how can they afford the huge house with flat screen tvs and a modern kitchen and current make of vehicles? Only the vamp ""doctor"" brings the dough while the vamp teens hang like bored bums around high schools doing nothing other than baseball? <br/><br/>The idea that immortals would endure excruciating boredom with the monotonous routine of life is absurd -- there is more to life than being stuck in a nothing town living the secluded lives. Why Stephanie Meyers chose to force the vampire characters to repeat high school instead of giving them the varieties in living life *to the fullest* as immortals is a mystery. I agree being an immortal can be damned boring after a few decades pass, but come on. Vamp from Metal Gear Solid 2 and 4 should kick their pale buttocks and give them the pointers how to be like Green Berets/Navy SEALs, superbly educated and make love like Casanova. Being a 118-year old hopelessly romantic virgin as an ephebophile (a step above pedophile) must've suck.<br/><br/>Dumb logic notwithstanding, the movie paces fairly well, albeit with some annoying flashbacks and sequences that are hyperedited like MTV video rotation. The baseball sequence is interesting but undermined by meth editing and self-consciously hip acting (really, do we want to see how a vamp boy twirls the baseball bat in slow-fast motion like a cocky jock?). The lovey-dopey story in the string of lame, maddeningly illogical scenes don't impress me but I enjoyed Edward's explanation of his background with Belle and running with her on his back in the mountain forest the best.<br/><br/>After the pursuit by the bad vamp ends up in the fight that culminated in Belle's near-death endurance, the ending is left to be desired because it does not adequately explain why the particular character would be interested in getting the bite of Belle. Plain lame-brained bamboozling the audience to expect the sequel once Twilight makes the ka-ching at the box office. The movie ending surmises that the audience should be treated like idiot sheep to be drained of blood...and hard-earned cash in surrender to hype.<br/><br/>Overall, a fair movie sandwiched between the pretentiously execrable beginning and the condescendingly idiotic ending with poor ""goth vamp slash fanfic"" logic thrown in.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and Narnia have nothing to worry about competition from Abercrombie & Fitch Vamp Boys and Hot Topic Vamp Girls. Twilight the movie was strictly made to siphon cash out of screaming teenyboppers and tweens.<br/><br/>** out of 4"

","so who thinks there will be a rise in tree make out related accidents b/c of the scene up in the tree? hahahaha I can just see all the teeny boppers trying to lure their crush du jour up a tree only to fall out and break their arms he he and about that scene in the books Bella was supposed to be super clumbsy and fall all the time. How come it looks like they are dancing around each up a tree that looks a hundred feet high?Should she be falling out every ten seconds only to have Edward rescueing her and chastizing her for not being more careful? The movie was pretty good for what it was but I think they should have made it half an hour more and built up the relationship between Edward and Bella a bit more. It was super rushed in the book and here it was like I hate you and now I love you??? Did it feel undeveloped to anyone else?"
"XHeartWillGoOnX","9","1","5","21 November 2008"," Here's how it really is....
","OK so i've never done this before so go easy on me....<br/><br/>i've been a twilight fan since last November before the even started filming the movie and before i even knew there was gonna be one. so i had pictured bella and edward and all the other characters without the hype or even seeing the people who they had cast. so when i finally did see them i was in a way floored at how well they had been cast. sure i had my doubts like yes, they may look like them but can they act like them. but that was immediately erased when i saw the movie. They were just so perfect, i was happy that they had gotten that right. Now i've read the reviews and i'm not talking about the ones on here i respect everyone's opinion on here, i'm talking about the ones written in the newspapers about how it lacked action and only got two stars and you know what that p****s me off. First of all no offense to the critics but most of them are 30-40 year old guys doing i don't know what the hell with their life and you know Twilight is not aimed at people like that. It's aimed at girls from the ages of i don't know 12-20 and i guess older because i know tons of moms who love it too. So they can't really write a movie review on a movie made from a book which they probably never read and was not written or made to attract them. Second, i'm sick and tired of people saying where is the action? HELLO!!!!!! it's a LOVE STORY that happens to have an action scene in it! with an exception to the few cool stunts throughout the movie, so you can't say there was no action... what happened to it? because it's not meant to be there at least not in Twilight maybe in the other movies that they hopefully make from the other books it will be there but not Twilight. It sets the scene for the love story it's meant to be and i think that the movie really captured that. Now on to the movie itself i think that they had all the important things in the movie that needed to be in it. Sure they changed things around a bit like something was said but it didn't happen that way. That's gonna happen what do you expect it's Hollywood! but for the most part i thought they did a great job not leaving out any of the important things and making sure you understood everything. i like how they had bella narrate a few parts to get a real feel for the book and how she feels and to really help piece things together. Obviously all the actors had chemistry with their partner such as brilliantly: bella-edward, jasper-alice, emmett-rosalie, carlisle-esme. and i thought they were all perfect together. i thought the lines were delivered well and the acting not cheesy which is what i was afraid of. Bella's friends were perfectly cast as was charlie, billy and jacob.<br/><br/>So overall i think Twilight was a success and from someone who was a Twilighter before i even expected a movie and who pictured the movie and the actors in my head before even seeing the actors or the movie or the hype i thought it was right on. So you know what those 30-40 year old critics can go on complaining about no action and comparing it to True Blood (which i'm sorry i think is really stupid and really copied by Twilight i don't care if it was written before Twilight why did the series come out at the same time as Twilight? and i think True Blood should be compared to Twilight not the other way around). But i and i know many other Twilighters or Fan-pires (lol) who throughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>so go ahead guys leave your comments i'm interested in seeing what everyone else has to say about twilight itself."
"shortstuff112189","9","1","5","21 November 2008"," I liked it....
","Okay first off let me say that I am one of those crazy obsessed Twilight fans. I went to the midnight showing at my local theater. Anyway getting to the point. The movie was very enjoyable. Now keep in mind it is not possible to condense an almost 500 page book into 2 hours. So realize some stuff is cut out, which was kind of a disappointment to me. The only thing I had an issue with was that the camera was a bit shaky at times and made me feel a little sick. The cast did a good job and believe it or not Robert Pattinson played Edward very well. I was loving his performance and okay I admit his looks helped. Kirsten did a good job as well, I expect more from her if they do make the sequel. Overall, do not expect this movie to be the book word for word. Expect it to be like any other movie based on a book. It is worth the money because lets be honest, you all want to see Bella and Edward in action besides in your heads. To the people who have never read any of the books parts of this movie will not make any sense to you, so take along a twilighter and you are set.<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 out of 10. Go see it!"
"auscan76","8","1","5","27 November 2008"," Twilight should of be a 2 and Half hour movie
","I have been an avid reader most of my life but the last few years I have been busy raising my boys.<br/><br/>I saw a Trailer for Twilight and thought OK why not go and get the book. I read it in one day and believe me that was a feat with to young Boys. Since then I have read all four numerous times.<br/><br/>Now for the movie, I did go into it thinking it was going to be just like the Book and that it was going to be a great movie, something I could talk to my friends about.<br/><br/>I decided to take two of my girlfriends who have not read any of the books and they had NO IDEA what the movie was about, they just wanted to get out of the house.<br/><br/>During the movie I was comparing it so much to the book that I was so disappointed but my friends actually enjoyed it and said that it was a good movie. So with that I went home and thought about some other movies that have been adapted to screen and this is what I came up with.<br/><br/>+ Twilight was rushed and should of been at least 2 1/2 hrs maybe 3hrs, Bella and Edward needed more time to form their relationship, the Cullens needed to be in the movie a bit more then what they were. Some of the lines were cheesy and laughable when they should not of been, the special affects sucked but Stephanie Myer said its was she pictured about the Diamond effect, hum I'm on the sidelines with that one, i wanted to see more of Alice and Jasper and Bella together, that part was rushed way too much. <br/><br/>All in All this movie could of been better if they had a bigger budget and gave the movie more time to develop the storyline and characters.<br/><br/>I think and I am hoping that when I see it again this weekend that I will just go in there and enjoy the movie and not compare it to the book as I have learned with Harry Potter the first movie is always a learning curve and each movie gets better, so lets hope that New Moon, Eclipse and if they do Breaking Dawn gets better and please make the movie not so rushed and make it LONGER, I am pretty sure that Twilight Fans want mind sitting in a theater for more then 2 hours to watch one of there fav books on screen. I know when the credits rolled no one clapped or got out of there seats straight away, it was like, ""IS THAT IT"", again disappointing.<br/><br/>I say go and see it and DO NOT compare it to the book.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>So i saw it again and this time i went into not thinking of the book and i actually enjoyed it. The story was good, little bit fast as i said above comment and the CGI was a tad bit cheesy. Some of the lines were well cheesy.<br/><br/>But I have to say the actors played there parts well and I truly think that it they had a bigger budget in the start it would of been a TERRIFIC movie. All in all I enjoyed it better second time around and not comparing it to the book.<br/><br/>I say go see it, you will laugh and giggle and enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>I hope New Moon has a BIGGER BUDGET and they do the CGI better."
"deewind","7","1","5","23 November 2008"," Twilight - Definitely see more than once
","When I saw the movie for the first time (Friday) I was disappointed because I had high expectations for it to be exactly like the book. I took someone else's advice and saw it a 2nd time (the next day) with my teenage daughters. Lving at home our former expectations, we went to the theater just to enjoy a sweet romantic movie and left thoroughly happy. Seeing it for the 2nd time, made a difference. So my advice to Twilighters out there is that if you didn't like it the first time, go and see it again only leave behind your high expectations. Stephanie Meyer's story left big shoes to fill and it is difficult to accomplish with a short amount of film/edit time and a small budget. Unfortunately time will be of the essence when filming the remaining stories because vampires can not age. Because of that I do hope that they get more funding to help with the staffing and effects and finally the romantic side of me hopes that Kristen Stewart gets a little more convincing when it comes to showing Bella's intense love for Edward (i.e. stop looking down and blinking when you are talking to him). All in all, the movie is entertaining and worth seeing again."
"efakie1","5","1","5","22 November 2008"," Crowd Pleaser
","Given the low budget and inexperienced acting, I thought the film was as good as it was going to and needed to be. The target audience is so easy please. Just give the girlies attractive actors and some good sexual tension and they'll swoon. You know these are the viewers who are going to see the film multiple times while it runs in theaters. They really don't care about special effects, cinematography, acting ability, direction, etc. It's really just appearances. In my opinion, the actors make a great cast...physically. The casting director did a great job matching descriptions; however, I think most of the cast lacks experience. <br/><br/>The cinematography was decent. The acting, OK. I really think the direction could have been better; however, Hardwicke was an excellent choice for the targeted audience. And I didn't really like the editing.<br/><br/>For all those out there who are quick to judge, give the franchise some time to grow ($$$) and mature. I believe that New Moon will have better quality. Honestly, I'm really interested in how each actor will develop their character. I think the franchise has great potential, especially after such a tremendous turnout for Twilight.<br/><br/>Though Twilight had me feeling awkward and tense 3/4s of the time, I will be waiting in line at midnight for New Moon.<br/><br/>I recommend this film for any girl with a wild imagination and an open mind. Not recommended for film snobs, most males, and vampire lovers (as the vampire part of story is basically only there for the ""wanting what you can't have"" aspect).<br/><br/>Bottom line: the production hit its target right in the bullseye."

The only thing I did have a problem with was that it was to fast paced. I feel that Catherine could have added maybe half an hour more to the film, and put in the significant scenes which were not present.<br/><br/>But, I did like the whole pride and prejudice idea and how it was well adapted into the film. PEOPLE TWILIGHT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ROMEO AND JULIET. NEW MOON IS THE ONE THAT HAS THAT IDEA.<br/><br/>all in all I would recommend people to go watch the movie."
"dianeamontenegro","8","1","5","26 November 2008"," NON-biased review
","No offense to anyone but I didn't really like the movie. I have read all the books a number of times, hoping that the movie would go along with the book and the actors to do a good job. I loved the scenery, it was beautiful but I was kind of disappointed because the movie did go along with the book but they kind of rushed things, leaving out main parts. The actors were I have to admit hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I got multiple hushes and stuff but I wasn't the only one with the hysterics. I know the book has a lot of details about the character's body language and it might be hard to act out. But even when they were talking they sort of ruined the movie with their facial expressions. I was also laughing when they showed Jasper off, though he only had one line. They said he was ""suffering"" and he looked like a zombie. But the way the directors and screenwriters portrayed the actors also didn't go along with the book as much. They made Edward not as gentle, or mysterious as the book. Rosalie I would say she did fairly good in acting along with Alice, Emmett, and Jacob(but at the end they made him suspicious in the end and they didn't even talk about his car he was building which I think was a big thing). As for Bella, she didn't do as bad as Edward but i wouldn't say she was good either. I think they left out some major parts like Bella fainting because of the blood testing--which was one of her major traits they should've shown. Also they should've shown that Jacob broke the treaty by telling Bella of the Cullens and what they are so she wouldn't of had to go to that bookstore and just follow the book. Lastly they should have shown Alice a lot more and bring out her joy and have Edward bring out everyone's story especially Carlisle's more with the Volturi. I didn't think the special effects were that good. With Edward shimmering and running. But the fight scene was okay it wasn't like amazing though. When Bella got hit in the head on the wall it should've made her unconscious right there because you can actually hear the big bang. I would recommend you to just read the book instead of the movie because they make the book look cheesy and slow--I felt really tired at the end. This is only my opinion. You might love it and everything and I hate to say this about a story I have a ""second life"" in but they could've made the movie a lot better without one of the main actors with an accent and struggle with the words. Even though it might not be a good rated movie the box office will be filled with money and there is going to be more movies to the series. Let's just hope the next three movies will be better and more accomplished."
"meelin23","9","1","5","25 November 2008"," Twilight Movie True to Book, Teen Anthem
","Twilight Movie True to Book, Teen Anthem Posted 11/22/2008 11:18 PM CST on theleafchronicle.com Hot or Not? blog/column by Melissa Tyndall<br/><br/>Twilight has the potential to be the kind of teen anthem that Rebel Without a Cause was in the 50s or what Sixteen Candles and Say Anything was in the 80s. The dialogue between the main characters is intense, smart and plays up the fact that some teenagers are ""old souls"" (some more than others). What really gets teens reeled in is the fact that, not unlike Say Anything's Lloyd Dobler and Diane Court, characters Bella Swan and Edward Cullen are love's underdogs. <br/><br/>Robert Pattinson, the British male lead who plays Edward Cullen, could surely be the 21st century James Dean for teenagers ¬ñ if James Dean was reincarnated as a vampire. When I watched a 5:30 p.m. showing of the movie on Saturday, an entire row of teenage girls sat in front of me, glued to the immortal, because of what I assume every teenage girl is attracted to ¬ñ the unobtainable, gorgeous, brooding boy across the cafeteria. Pattinson is the master of facial expression and fervor, as he looks pained and scared when he finally kisses co-star Kristen Stewart (Prior to the kiss, anticipation is the name of the game; with that kiss, he's afraid he'll become carried away and give into his killing nature). He's continually injured as he discusses with the woman he loves the internal battle a vampire must face in order to avoid the monster within him that lusts for blood, though he loves her and wants to keep her safe. But the girls shouldn't worry -- there will be plenty of moments to squeal with delight (as the girls in front of me did) the times he smiles. <br/><br/>Though the news indicates that rapid teenage girls are flocking to Pattinson's press events (hundreds of which showed up to a California mall event, trampled other girls and got the event cancelled), those with this modern Beatle Mania-sort of frenzy over the books, movie and merchandise should not forget who has top billing. Twilight is Bella's story, and Bella is played by 18-year-old Kristen Stewart. Stewart masterfully portrays the character in a way that epitomizes the unrepresented teenage girl. Bella is not a supermodel; she's not the richest, the most popular, the most athletic or the prom queen. Instead, the leading lady is smart, stubborn, driven and sure of what she wants. She is selfless, confident and reminds audiences of all ages what passion and love are like when you feel it for the first time and you refuse to give in until it is yours. <br/><br/>There were very few things about the movie which can be picked apart by adoring Twilight fans. One is that not every scene is depicted as it is in the book. However, avid readers must understand what it takes to make a 400 to 500 page book fit into a two-hour movie. Scenes just have to be combined at times. I also expect that fans will have some qualms if they're ""Team Jacob"" fans, since the scenes with Taylor Lautner are brief. The only thing that is surprising was the choice for character Mike Newton, as the book depicts Mike Newton as the ""it"" (human) guy at the high school, but audiences didn't seem to pay him any attention in comparison to the dreamy, undead Cullens across the lunchroom. <br/><br/>For Twilight fans, the movie might be as close to the book as it's going to get. As an English teacher, the thing I can appreciate most about the teenage audience is that they've actually read the books and laugh when they recognize the dialogue or when the lead character falls (Bella is clearly a klutz in the book). <br/><br/>Audiences should also expect some pleasant surprises. In the second caf√© scene (just after Bella speaks to Mike Newton), look for Twilight saga author, Stephenie Meyer to be at the lunch counter with her laptop. In addition, the movie is sprinkled with dry humor that audiences will appreciate ¬ñ such as Bella's father, the chief of police, cleaning his gun when his daughter's boyfriend comes to pick her up for a date or how Edward laughs at Bella for telling him to put on his seatbelt. The most pleasant surprise, however, may be the soundtrack. My favorite tracks were performed by from Paramore (Decode), Iron & Wine (Flightless Bird, Amercian Mouth) and even Robert Pattinson (during the scene where Bella has been attacked by James and has her flashback, Pattison belts out ""Let Me Sign"").<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is true to the book and gives audiences a two-hour glimpse of what we all want ¬ñ a love that lasts for all time"

","An avid twilighter and lover of the series, I was completely stoked when I found out the book was being turned into a movie. And after watching the midnight showing I was in two words ""blown away"" summit was completely faithful to the book, almost, really almost (please remember its a five hundred page book fit into two hours), every major scene in the book was in the movie. <br/><br/>Not always in the exact same order, but to where it fit and made the movie run smoothly. Im not going to continue typing and say it was a perfect movie, it wasn't, no movie ever really is. But by personal preference, and opinion there was more positive then negative. The movie was done smoothly, meaning the length of the book was made into a strong storyline and made sense, what might had made it difficult for those who didn't read the book,was the pace. Where it should have been slow, it was slightly fast(like the hotel and meadow scene).The added scenes made the story much more enjoyable,it never took away from the story.<br/><br/>the locations were beautiful, the acting was great,rob did an amazing job,as did Kristen. In truth all the put downs for all the actors casted(and there were a lot) they all did amazing jobs. the makeup was amazing. The other only little glips I see with the movie ,were the stunts,the length of the movie and the script. they could and hopefully for new moon, make the stunts look more realistic,natural, and less cheesy.and the script, maybe take out just a little drama from Bella,no matter how prone she is to danger,she felt stronger in the book, then she did in the movie. And finally, I hope the next movie is longer. two hours was not enough. The movie as good as it was(and it was good),was not enough to sate my appetite. I want more. More little details that will make us twilighters go crazy with joy. And I simply cannot wait for the next installment.new moon."

","I'll admit, being a HUGE Twilight fan, I was hesitant that the film would ruin the book. I've had my share of that and didn't want to see it happen again. This wasn't better than the book, but it does stand on its own. It doesn't need an internationally bestselling novel to accompany it. <br/><br/>When the theater grew dark, and the screen finally showed the word ""Twilight,"" you would have thought that Edward Cullen was actually in the theater because of all the screaming and cheering. Then, to add to that, when Robert Pattinson (Edward) appeared on screen, I didn't think my ear drums would be working for the rest of the movie. Not to say that I wasn't excited, I just wasn't screaming my head off. The same reactions occurred for when Peter Facinelli (Dr. Carlisle Cullen) and Cam Gigandet (James) appeared on screen.<br/><br/>The cast was (almost) perfect, which is one of my few complaints. All of the actors playing the Cullens were perfect in their perspective roles. I loved watching the emotions in Robert Pattinson's face as Bella got closer to Edward. I could see the struggle that Edward goes through every moment Bella is near him. He did the role perfectly. Ashley Greene (Alice Cullen), Nikki Reed (Rosalie Hale), Jackson Rathbone (Jasper Hale), Kellan Lutz (Emmet Cullen), Peter Facinelli (Carlisle Cullen), and Elizabeth Reaser (Esme Cullen) all looked exactly like I had pictured their characters to look. The only let down was Kristen Stewart as Bella. She didn't look like I thought Bella should, and she didn't portray Bella like I thought Bella should be portrayed. <br/><br/>Like I said, the movie isn't as good as the book, but it's good on its own. The focus is a little shifted from the novel (not so much on how their relationship develops and how they deal with all the complications, but more on the romance itself), and of course it isn't as in-depth as the novel. Otherwise, it's just about perfect. I can't wait to see what happens in the future movies!"

","I, like so many others, went on IMDb before i was able to see the movie to look at the many reviews of Twilight. They honestly worried me a lot. I've read all the books and have been a fan for a while and was really hoping that this movie would definitely lead to summit making the rest of the series. I just saw it and i can tell you (other than this comment) a lot of what i saw was wrong generalizations of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>First, Don't go to the movie with any false pretenses. Its a movie adaptation of a book. The movies are never as good as the books. However, with that being said it wasn't nearly as bad overall as all the comments that i have been seeing about it. There are certain things that i need to address that were not so hot about the movie and some things that they did really well.<br/><br/>NOT SO GOOD: *The directing was terrible and i hope for the other movies sake that she will not get her hands on the others. The scenes were choppy and jumped way too fast to promote any real character growth There were too many close ups and then pan outs. If she had taken the time to grow the characters instead of panning out and putting music on while they pretend to talk it would have made a world of difference.<br/><br/>*My boyfriend who i brought with me left the movie asking several questions.. one of which is the most important. Why the hell does Bella like Edward so much? Again character growth would have fixed that.<br/><br/>*The movies superfluous scene was not necessary at all. if they would have had the 2 main characters talking during that time instead it would have also contributed to the question of why does Bella even like Edward..<br/><br/>*Some of the scenes were OVER acted. Especially Bellas hospital scene, and the scene where Edward first sees her. He really didn't need to look like he was going to throw up for the message to get across to Bella that he couldn't stand her.<br/><br/>*Harry potter was over 3 hours long or close to it. this movie was 2 hrs 2 mins long. IT needed to be longer to grow the characters. The scenes moved way to fast to get the full effect of the relationship.<br/><br/>*They didn't explain why the cullens disappear.<br/><br/>Things that were done well: *Although i really didn't like Nikki reed being cast as a blonde..the cullens casting was done very well. Besides the fact that jasper looked a little scary at parts.<br/><br/>*There was a lot of laughs. Bella is awkward, her dad is awkward and they conveyed that very well. The dialogue was very good in a lot of parts.<br/><br/>*The kissing scene was done very well. you could tell she couldn't control herself and he was fighting to do just that.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole was good. Not great but good in spite of the horrible director. I will definitely buy the DVD. Future installments will have issues (Especially new moon) because viewers will have a hard time understanding why Bella is so upset that Edward left because of Hardwicks inability to grow the 2 MAIN characters."

","I left this theater breathless. I was not expecting much, considering the book is amazing, and nothing could live up to that, but this movie came pretty close. I have to admit that there were definitely some flaws--sometimes Edward (Robert Pattinson) was a little melodramatic, more than he is in the book. But otherwise, everyone in the theater was dazzled. I also had my doubts about Kristen Stewart as Bella, but she WAS Bella. Now, what I didn't expect was for the theater to erupt with screaming whenever Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) stepped into view. He was amazing as Jasper, and needed more screen time. Taylor Lautner was perfect as Jacob, a young and awkward teen. His dad, Billy Black (Gil Birmingham) was really good too, and he and Edward's glare during one scene showed that he has some character in him. The rest of the cast was good as well, especially the humans. I feel no one got enough screen time except Bella, Edward, and Charlie. Though they left out my favorite scenes (blood typing, meadow, Edward sleeping over for the first time) or made them shorter, this movie still deserves 10 stars. The fight scene, though having bad wire work and other things, still got many screams, especially when Edward saved the day. I am still in a stupor. 10/10"

","Well... I have not laughed this hard in a long time, so for that reason this movie earns a rating of 1/10 and not 0/10 (which it deserves for many reasons).<br/><br/>What caused this laugh to almost make me faint was that scene where the vampires play baseball. Omfg! I... I... Just watch it. Geez.<br/><br/>So, what is so bad about this movie (besides the obviousness of baseball-playing vampires)? To sum up: Everything. The acting could have been better done by a bunch of retarded, headless monkeys. The direction would have been better if the director would just have stayed of the freaking set all together. The music was clearly created in like 30 minutes (if that). Who edited this movie... I mean, come on!? The list goes on...<br/><br/>Like that other guy wrote: This is a 2 hour photo shoot for Robert Pattinson (that pathetic excuse for an actor).<br/><br/>This movie sends the wrong message to its target audience from second number one till the moment Robert Pattinson's name scrolls of the screen in the end credits. I hope he earns good money, because when the Twilight saga (sigh) is over, this guy will become dust...<br/><br/>Alright. He might be saved by a talented director if he's really, really lucky to get a respectable one to work with him.<br/><br/>I understand this is a fantasy-movie, but when it becomes all about glamor and fashion and looks and glittering skin (how pretentious is that unless this had been a movie about homosexual vampires; then I could have bought it) something tells me this world just got a little bit colder, darker, more cynical and generally more shallow.<br/><br/>Just try to imagine The Lord of the Rings being created by these people with this style... Yeah, scary isn't it.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor: Don't see this movie (or if your life depends on it - like a torture-type-situation - do what I did: Download it! - don't pay these talentless people a freaking' cent). Go watch a brick wall, urinate on your neighbor's door, punch a baby in the face or set a forest on fire instead. It would do the world less harm."

When he saw her for the first time in science class he looked more like he was dying or on drugs rather then someone who was intrigued and lusted by the smell of a humans blood.

","Vampires...They have the the ability to turn into bats. They wear long dark capes and have black slicked back hair. They prey on the innocent for sustenance, they...sparkle? <br/><br/>Twilight is basically a teenage girl's fantasy brought onto the big screen. In fact that's exactly what it is. Stephenie Meyer who wrote the just as popular book openly admitted that it was inspired by a teenage fantasy she had. <br/><br/>So maybe other teenage girls and their lonely moms can relate, but what does that mean for the rest of us? Well put simply, it means that it sucks.<br/><br/>Twilight's plot revolves around the idea of a girl falling in love with a vampire that lusts for her blood and somehow this makes her love him more. Sounds stupid doesn't it? Well it doesn't end there.<br/><br/>The characters are paper thin, and Edward Cullen and his fellowship of fanged fellows all look like their makeup artists went a little to far with the makeup and not far enough with presentation. Edward himself is someone who tries to be mysterious and longing and Bella, who admits to being average, comes of as nothing more than that, yet her blood must be above average in Edward's opinion and Bella risks her life for his desire, is it because she loves him or is it because she thinks he's awesome for being a vampire? don't scenarios like this happen with teens in real life? It's not him, it's his car...<br/><br/>Anyway, about the film. The look of it is about on the same level as a high-budget TV series and comes off as cheap and bland. The CGI effects are some of the most laughable and goofy looking effects seen in awhile. There's one scene where Edward, ""sparkles,"" when exposed to sunlight and there's the running scene that looks highly unconvincing. The sparkles are also a unconvincing part of the story itself. I know these aren't your classic vampires, but sparkling is just lazy.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons the story falls on itself is because, Edward says he wants to ""protect,"" Bella, yet creates a constant danger to her. It seems like if he really cared about her, he wouldn't put her at risk, but what do expect from someone who's 104 years old and is still in High School?<br/><br/>Twilight tries to convincing and epic, but comes off about as much as a Syfy original and it's weak plot and undeveloped characters come off as un-inspired. It's nothing more than a dumbed down romance and an even dumber fantasy. Unless you're a 13 to 16 year old girl or a lonely mother or grandmother, don't waste your time here."

","This will probably be a pretty biased review. I apologize in advance.<br/><br/>Even as a teenage girl I have never been into the Twilight craze. I hadn't heard much about the film at all until I starred in my school's one act, low budget play, 'Sure As You're Born'. As an after party, my drama teacher bought a bunch of pizzas for us and we watched Twilight.<br/><br/>Let me just say I am glad I was busy on my phone this entire time and missed about seventy percent of the movie. When I got home, my mother had bought the movie on iTunes for me to watch, but my sister enjoyed it more than I did, as I suffered through the worst 177 minutes of my life. The movie was terrible. The acting was mediocre at best, especially from the female lead, Kristen Stewart. Watching Stewart's performance was as about as enjoyable as being burned alive (that sounds a little harsh, but I feel Stewart should use her salary from the Twilight movies to hire an acting coach).<br/><br/>The scenes ran horribly together and it felt like I was watching a bad TNT drama than a movie. Feeling that I was too harsh on the film, I read the book, which was not an improvement.<br/><br/>On normal circumstances I would give this film a higher rating, but I can't stand it any longer. I have been harassed and bullied something terrible because I don't like this series, which has lowered my tolerance of anything Twilight related.<br/><br/>To make a long story short, this is the movie you want to see if you enjoy sparkling 107 year old men with fetishes for high school teenage girls."

","This movie was terrible.<br/><br/>Reasons: <br/><br/>1. Vampires cannot go into the sunlight because they will sparkle (their skin glitters in the sun.. this is the only effect the sun has on them - no harm done whatsoever).<br/><br/>2. The vampires claim to be ""vegetarian"", so they eat animals instead of humans.<br/><br/>3. The vampires play baseball in their free time. (self-explanatory)<br/><br/>4. The lead character (vampire) spends half of the movie running around the forest like a chimpanzee, carrying around some girl. Its terribly cheesy and its obvious he's got a crotch-harness on that whole time. (there's nothing to smash) It's some scene that should be left in Tarzan.<br/><br/>5. With pretty much no explanation at all, the main character (vampire) has the ability to read minds.<br/><br/>6. The movie has events that are entirely stupid - time and time again.<br/><br/>ie. Vampire pitches the ball to vampire batter.. vampire batter hits the ball and it flies 5 miles out. Vampire outfielder waits.. (because he knows he's just that fast) and then runs out there (faster than the ball) and gets the ball. He throws the ball back to home plate. (somehow the vampire batter can't run around the bases before the outfielder runs 5 miles). <br/><br/>Most demented of all, why would the vampire THROW the ball back when he JUST DEMONSTRATED that it would be faster to run the ball back and tag the runner. (Not to mention it makes no sense that he can run faster than a ball that was hit with a bat) The movie is simply irritating with its nonsensical garbage and terrible special effects. Not to mention it craps all over the established vampire genre with its sparkling, vegetarian, tree-climbing, base-ball-playing vampire BS. There is pretty much no mention of wooden stakes, crosses, garlic, fangs, bats or anything other than lame vampires that sparkle in the sunlight."

Then again, my expectations were not very high if it was a movie to be based on a very over-rated book.<br/><br/>The characters are one-dimensional, stereotypical and clich√©. The poor attempts in focusing on a back story are lost on the overzealous nature of showing Edward as much as possible (which I believe to be catering to all the tweens who fantasize about him), the extremely poor dialog and the plot line which fails to differ from any other cookie cutter romance movie that has ever been made.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone besides the people who obviously prefer sub par writing and brainless romance clich√©s over and over.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am a little biased, as I am a big horror movie fan and I must say after the appearance of sparkly vampires, Bram Stoker is spinning in his grave."

I knew that the film was a vampire romance, two genres that should never be mixed, so I simply asked myself: sparking vampires who stalk teenage females, how bad could it be? To my dismay what I found was a very shallow, tiring, detestable film. Let us first begin by looking at the writing. Perhaps some of the funniest dialog that I have seen in years, this film becomes increasingly disagreeable with every passing moment. With such immortal words as: ""You know, your mood swings are kinda giving me whiplash,"" and best of all: ""I'd compare (my life as a vampire) to living on tofu and soy milk,"" it seems obvious that I cannot take this film seriously. I distinctly remember literally falling to the floor laughing for most of it. I would love to say that this was where the horror ends but of course there was the sub par acting to contend with. Awkward moments punctuated by horrific gazes, this was a clumsy performance from both main actors. I only wish they would spend their newly found fortunes on acting lessons. The only item which I believe was tolerable was the directing. While there was nothing new to add to the cannon, with such an atrocious script and actors, I realize the director had a lot to contend with.<br/><br/>I would beg the reader to never see this film.

","Many forget/don't realize the film is based on the Stephenie Meyer romance book saga 'Twilight.' The story is of a girl, Bella, who meets Edward, in a town she moves to. The two start a romance, however stakes are high when she finds out that he is a vampire.
Unrealistic as it sounds, the film is meant to demonstrate the forbidden love of a mortal and immortal. Much like The Vampire Diaries or True Blood, a human and vampire love isn't ""allowed.""<br/><br/>It is important to remember that this film was the breakthrough role for Kristen Stewart (Swan) and Robert Pattinson (Cullen), as both did not do much commercially large films before (apart from Stewart's roles in David Fincher's ""Panic Room"" (2002) and Greg Mottola's ""Adventureland"" the year prior). Twilight is different, as it is romantic, dramatic, and fantasy. Being a relatively low-budget film, the story captures the novel's plot well. However, a story of a teenage girl falling in love with a vampire generally appeals to only child or adolescent audiences. The film may not be everyone's favourite, as the acting can be dull at times. But, the story does follow the book almost exactly, even the appearance of the characters are basically perfect.
While it may not be a good film for older audiences to enjoy, it does remain a classic (regardless of poor ratings) for younger audiences. There is no mature content, other than an intimate make-out scene between Bella and Edward in her bed. The film could've been executed better in terms of acting style, however that may have been a subjective choice of the director since there book itself does not describe the personalities of the main characters, unfortunately."
"soccergirl1995","4","1","6","17 February 2014"," Sucking Venom out of Twilight
","There are many ways to go wrong with a movie like cheesy romance, predictable characters, and terrible special effects, and 2008's Twilight did just about every single one of them. Based on the #1 New York Times Bestseller and written by Stephenie Meyer, Twilight was turned into a movie that had teenage girls rushing to the theaters, and teenage boys running in the opposite direction. The movie starred the incredibly awkward, Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan), and movie-made vampire heartthrob, Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen). The movie, Twilight, proves that any book can be turned into a movie even though some books should stay within the pages. <br/><br/>Twilight starts out with Bella moving from Arizona to Forks, Washington to live with her dad, Charlie (Billy Burke). There, Bella meets Edward Cullen in her science class, and their creepy chemistry stays throughout the entire movie. In the middle of the movie, Bella learns that Edward is a vampire, but he isn't your typical vampire. His skin sparkles in the sun, and he has the ability of read minds. He can also run fast and has strength like Superman. The over originality of the movie makes any person want to tell someone about it, but Bella is so intrigued in Edward and vampires that she wants to be just like him and doesn't tell anyone. She is not even scared of him at all, even though, Edward told her that he wants to suck her blood the most because he cannot read her mind. <br/><br/>With the acting of Kristen Stewart and the character of Robert Pattinson, Twilight turns for the worst. Kristen Stewart is so awkward that she cannot even answer a question without making a weird noise beforehand, and she keeps her mouth open the entire movie. She never looks happy or excited either. When she finds out that Edward wants her, she doesn't react. She just stares at him like usual. She is pale too. Shouldn't someone who is supposed to be from Arizona be even a little tan? I guess she is pale, so she can blend in with the crowd.<br/><br/>In addition, Edward Cullen is a frightening vampire. He became a vampire when he was seventeen, but vampires stop aging. He is about 110 years old which is way too old to be still going to high school. He watches Bella sleep too and stares at her all the time. In fact, their whole romance is based on staring at each other and gazing at each other's awkward behaviors. <br/><br/>If their acting and characters aren't bad enough, the special effect is way off. Vampires can run faster than cheetahs, but the effect makes it look like they're in slow motion. Vampires can jump high too, but anyone can see that they used wires because the jumping looks awkward. The sparkle effect on their skin looks off too. It isn't like a shimmering diamond. It's a sparkle of uneven snow that the sun is shining on that makes it look fake. <br/><br/>The setting isn't right too. I get what the director was going for. Forks, Washington is an average town with average people until one day when Bella Swan shows up, and the whole movie changes. However, the place is so pale and boring it makes Bella's pale skin fit in. The vampires even have to travel to a different place for the fight scenes which are darker. <br/><br/>Twilight is just the first installment of the saga, and if the first movie didn't want you to watch the rest, then there is no hope. The storyline gets even crazier, and Bella becomes more obsessed with vampires that there's no hope of getting her acting career any better."

","The extent to which you'll enjoy ""Twilight"" may well depend on just how much romantic melodrama and teenage angst you can put up with in a two-hour period.<br/><br/>Based on the insanely popular novel by Stephanie Meyer, this first in a series of tales dedicated to vampires and the-humans-who-love-them overdoses a bit on pasty faces and soulful ogling, but it still manages to revamp the genre in some unique and interesting ways. For instance, these bloodsuckers can apparently move around and function in daylight, or at least subdued daylight, which is pretty easy to find in the perpetually overcast Pacific Northwest where the movie takes place. Moreover, these vampires do not sleep in coffins and are able to thrive as well on animal blood as on human, being just a matter of willing oneself to do so.<br/><br/>Bella (Kristen Stewart) is a moody, seventeen-year-old high school student who comes to live with her police chief father (Billy Burke) after her mom (""24""'s Sarah Clarke) and step dad take off on an extended road trip across the country. Almost immediately, Bella discovers that there's something not quite right about Edward (Robert Pattinson), the mysterious and darkly brooding boy who seems to have taken a more than casual liking to her. As the feeling is mutual, Bella takes it upon herself to find out everything she can about the enigmatic lad, eventually discovering, with a little help from Google, that Edward is indeed one of the undead, albeit a dreamy one for a girl with a matching pallor who's already a bit emo herself.<br/><br/>The self-loathing vampire, tormented by what he is and what he has to do to survive, has been a staple of the genre ever since Barnabas Collins hit the scene in the 1960s, and Edward certainly follows in that tradition. The other thread the story pulls from is the doomed-teenage-romance theme a la ""Romeo and Juliet,"" only in this case the young lovers are separated not by warring families but by the fact that they hail from different species. This brings the added complication to their relationship that if Edward becomes too uncontrolled in his passion for Bella, he might just wind up quite literally devouring her. This sex-equals-death theme has always been a major and recurring subtext running right through vampire folklore, and the story does a nice job bringing it to the surface.<br/><br/>The romantic moments are, for the most part, handled with tenderness and delicacy, and the scenes with Edward's ""family"" - who have all sworn off human blood and are trying to live at peace with their human neighbors - are some of the cleverest in the movie. Moreover, the film generates a good deal of energy and suspense in its latter half, though it does tend to sag a bit in its closing moments.<br/><br/>Written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by Catherine Hardwicke, ""Twilight"" isn't as sophisticated or imaginative as the similarly-themed ""True Blood,"" but for a tweenie romance with a supernatural twist, this ain't half bad."
"sn0bordrd004","7","1","6","6 August 2009"," Better than the book
","I am a 22 year old male. I read the book, and thought Twilight was pretty bad. It was clearly a book written for young girls, and has almost nothing to entice an older, male reader. It was extremely melodramatic, poorly written, and left out scenes that would be interesting to readers who are not enthralled by extremely hokey and immature teenage ""love."" That is not to say that I cannot appreciate love stories or chick flicks; I read Pride and Prejudice, and thought it wonderful. I started to read the books after the movie had already come out, and I had already heard the disappointing reviews, but I still was interested enough to rent the film, and invest 2 hours of my life into it. Like the book, the story was almost nonexistent, but that is okay! Like Pride and Prejudice, the relationships and the emotional response of the characters IS the story. I thought the casting was perfect, except for Kristen Stewart as Bella; she was unconvincing and unrealistic, but Robert Pattinson as Edward more than made up for her, which was enough to get me to buy into the romance, and Edward and Bella's real devotion to each other. For the special effects including the fast ""vampire"" walking, running through the woods, and even the sparkling in the sunlight, could not have been done any better. I have read a lot of complaints about them, but while reading the book, what was done in the movie was exactly what I visualized and expected. It would have been easy to overdo the jumping, and the climbing, and the sound effects when Edward was sparkling, but I think the director blended those effects naturally into the middle of the romance, without drawing too much attention to the effect itself. The soundtrack was excellent. The emo/punk rock sound was perfectly selected to reach out to the teen audience, but it was the sounds of Carter Burwell music that caught my attention, really adding to the eerie feel of Bella's situation. It also seemed to enhance the ""falling in love"" sequences, with the long scenes of beautiful music, beautiful scenery, and non-audible dialogue. The visually stunning scenery of Oregon really made the whole story seem out of this world, but the realism of all the characters makes it just believable enough be enticed. The writing was below par, and the immature high school scenes were a bit annoying, but did not distract me from the sexual tension between Edward and Bella, and seemed like more of a backdrop for the surreal world that Bella is really living in. Besides, what goes unsaid is far more important and revealing than the dialogue; this only seems to get you caught up in the you-wish-it-were-real romantic passion all the more. The movie appeals to a broader audience than the book, possible at the expense of disappointing its original fan base. It took me a while to return to the real world after spending 2 hours in a world of beautiful romance, which seems just realistic enough for viewers to not automatically dismiss it as too good to be true. Like the newest creation of Pride and Prejudice (with Keira Knightley), when watching Twilight, get ready to delve into a romantic and thrilling world that sucks you in, and makes you wish you didn't have to leave at the credits."

","Twilight is a very great movie and finally i can say it is my favorite movie of the hundreds i've saw, I never get to say that. It has a remarkable romance story (and I'm on the novels already) that captured my heart and forever will. Twilight shows a completely different point of view and expresses vampires in a whole new different creative way. I strongly believe they've picked the perfect actors--now you can see Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in a new perspecive. I will never be persuaded that this movie is terrible, shows vampires stupidly, and has over-actors or terrible un-watchable acting, because it doesn't--it is a remarkable love story, truly amazing.<br/><br/>Please don't say the movie uses vampires all wrong, because if you READ THE BOOK it'll say there is many types of vampires--one is human-like and sparkles in the sun and all that--as they say in the movie is ""the cold ones.""<br/><br/>i hope this comment is helpful and that you see twilight in my view, and be as exited for new moon as i am."
"dwpollar","8","1","6","22 April 2009"," Very well executed story about a young girl...
","1st watched 4/16/2009 ‚Äì 8 out of 10 (Dir-Catherine Hardwicke): Very well executed story about a young girl leaving her mother in Arizona to move in with her father in a small town in the state of Washington and her encounters in this new environment. Her main encounter is with a strange albino-like young boy, played by Robert Pattinson, that appears to be repelled by her at first but she is infatuated by him. The girl, played by Kristen Stewart, eventually finds out that he is part of a family of vampires that just recently moved into the area. He becomes protective of her and has his own fascination because he can't read her mind but can read everyone else's. She falls in love with him and things get a lot more complicated. Upon visiting his family, who survive on the blood of animals instead of humans despite their thirst for this, she is picked up by a tracker(who once smelling a human's blood won't stop til he's made a kill) who belong to another group of vampires who do feast on humans. She then has to run and hide from the tracker without letting her father know what's going on. The movie is really kind of a twisted love story for girls but is also enjoyable for others since the characters are so well played and the story flows so easily. There is definitely more than romance in the story for all types to enjoy as well. There is a side conflict with a local Indian tribe that is introduced near the end of the movie to open up the definite sequel. The ending also more than hints at this. This is definitely OK by me because I'm looking forward to how this story evolves and what else happens to the characters. Yes, I have to admit I'm now just as interested in this series as my daughter who's read the books! This movie is very captivating and expects much money and praise ‚Äì so go see it!!"
"vitaleralphlouis","6","1","6","11 April 2009"," Teenage romance spotlights Kristen Stewart
","In a teenage romance written, directed and mostly made by women (see credits), a pretty teen girl seeks love with the bad kid and finds he's not so very bad after all. There are worse traits in a guy than being a vampire and living in a coven. For example, he could have been an ACORN worker fraudulently registering voters in the battleground state of Washington. But no, he just has this vampire thing and he's trying to go veg. Truthfully, the whole coven of vampires seem pretty nice, and if they moved into my neighborhood I could do worse.<br/><br/>Men, for certain, will like Kristen Stewart. She's pretty, petite, slender, small-breasted -- all the physical things I like; plus if you read about her she also has good values. The real question is what do girls really want. This movie gives you the answer. From the novel's author, going right through the movie's 76% female credits, they are telling us they want an interesting bad guy and they want to apply their love to make him over.<br/><br/>As a vampire movie, Twilight is awful. Even the ""bad"" vampires aren't so bad. But Twilight is NOT a vampire movie; it's pure romance. Not bad."

Just remember to watch his face when he struggles with the kiss.. Its perfect. You can see the pain and hunger all at once. Ja its a vampire story and a love story.

I did not read Stephanie Meyer's novel.

They really are very sweet & do come across.<br/><br/>Billy Burke plays Emma's father & Peter Facinelli is the Vampire who created Robert many years back.<br/><br/>There is no real violence till the last few scenes,& the violence is slightly muted.<br/><br/>The film has a proper PG rating, it is a movie' for the entire family.<br/><br/>Eagerly waiting for the next film.<br/><br/>Ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points(out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)"
"pammiie_420","10","1","6","26 January 2009"," Breathless
","In my opinion, I was absolutely amazed. The interpretation of the book was great. I am really proud of the 'Twilight cast', especially the screenwriter, because, they didn't really have much things to say if they made it exactly like the book.<br/><br/>I am, also, grateful that they didn't make it almost exactly like the book for a few reasons: 1. If they did make it like the book, our imagination of it would have been completely ruined. Us, fans, don't think the same. We each have different imaginations. (eg. I imagine Edward's room as an entertainment room) 2. Because the movie was great since there wasn't much dialogue in the book. In the book it was mostly bella's thoughts- it was a great book though. And in the film, Kristen Stewart couldn't just read the entire book, I think her part was the most difficult.<br/><br/>I would only like to say, I didn't like Edward Cullen. I mean sure Robert Pattinson was pretty hot- for a lack of a better word- but his character was kind of..I don't know, stupid. In the book he was way more sweeter and cooler and perfect, especially after he decided to be strong and stay with bella, but in the movie, he was kind of awkward. I'm not blaming Robert Pattinson,he was great, I think I'm blaming the director. I didn't like the way it was directed. I got my hopes up, after watching all the sneak peeks, TV spots, whatever, and the movie was little let down. I know it makes no sense, it was a little let down, but i still loved it."
"oliverreviews","6","1","6","10 January 2009"," this comment may contain small but unintentional spoilers of the movie.
","I had never picked up the twilight book or read any of the other books in the saga. I had also only seen the movie trailer once. After seeing the movie, i quickly read the books the preceding weeks afterward for comparison. So a few points need to be made about the movie. Overall the movie was OK. It was not the best, and butchered the book in a few aspects-that actually made me uncomfortable. The book itself could almost be directly translated into a script the way it was written but was not. And the actual translation was extremely poor. The script was one of the main reasons that the movie failed. It altered the storyline in unnecessary ways and ultimately rushed through and left out important parts of the love story. I can see that they wanted to keep in mind the viewers that did not read the book; but it was absolutely unnecessary to show the ""animal attacks"" of the nomad vampires. That time could have been used to incorporate overlooked dialogue into the movie. Even the actors in the movie said that at times they did some improv and left out lines they thought were extremely cheesy. In order for the actors to compensate for the sub-par script; they actually tended to make up for it in body language/facial expressions that at times were a little over the top.<br/><br/>As far as the directing goes, Catherine Hardwicke made a nice attempt but ultimately lost the vision of the movie by getting caught up in unnecessary sub-plots and some artsy(?) camera work. The editing of the movie was also poor. It was so choppy and incoherent at moments that if you did not read the book you may not have known what was going on. It was like a marathon trying to sprint through scene after scene after scene-especially when some were very unnecessary and the ones that were missing were important(specifically the original meadow scene and biology lab, lunch in the cafeteria, etc). I know there's a time limit but seriously, some poor choices were made in the editing process. And what was with all the crazy zooms and camera angles? Those were a little overdone and were distracting at times. <br/><br/>As far as casting went, i think the casting directors deserve a pat on the back. All the characters were pretty similar physically to what i envisioned while reading the books. As far as the acting-it was okay; i felt the script ultimately led to that downfall as well. I thought Alice was good-possibly a little bit more bubbly though. Jasper was right on target. Jessica was right on target. Esme was exactly what i pictured. Emmet and Rosalie were also as i pictured. Carlisle was slightly different from what i pictured but i think the actor did a good job. Charlie was so on target it was not even funny-that is exactly how I envisioned him. The two main characters however are the most important. Kristen Stewart definitely looked the part for Bella swan, and even acted how I imagined Bella-however, Kristen over acted at some parts through body language(script again) and did not act enough at others; she also seemed a tad apathetic at parts; but still fit the role of Bella well. I think further development of the character on her part and fixing a thing or two would have made the job way better. Robert Pattinson is physically similar to the Edward i imagined while reading, however how can one fully fulfill the title of one of the most attractive men on earth? His acting was okay. It should be interesting to see how it progresses in the second movie. He seemed to over-act just a tad through body language/expressions etc.(probably due to the script again). He definitely gave his own spin on a pretty hard character to precisely pin-point. <br/><br/>The visual effects of the movie were a little disappointing, but that was obviously due to the small budget the movie was given. This also includes the make-up which seemed a little bad at times; especially with Carlisle. The stunts were okay, any fault with them is to be blamed on the tight movie budget as most of them had to be done the old fashioned way; and kudos to the actors for their okay wire-work. It really is not that easy when you have to center your weight and move without swaying in one direction too much. <br/><br/>The ultimate downfall of what could have been a good movie could be blamed on the directing, editing, and ultimately the script. The actors deserve a job well done with working with so little and even trying to compensate for the lack of dialogue with their body language and facial expressions; also the tight shooting schedule and budget. However, pivotal scenes were left out and the love story was jumpy going from ""Hi"" one minute to ""I cannot live without you the next"". The development of that should have been the main focus of the movie with a little bit of creative interpretation giving and taking some, but not the important dialogues where Bella and Edward actually get to know each other and the depth of their feelings for one another. I am glad that the movie was different from the book though. It was interesting to see how they interpreted it to the screen. I only hope that a better job is done with New Moon. It is going to have a different director so we will see what he brings to the movie if he reads all the reviews and takes some of the things into consideration. I also hope that he deviates a little from the book as it provides a breath of fresh air to be a little surprised from scene to scene."
"Cutiecat0322","10","1","6","10 January 2009"," Missed the mark
","I went into this movie expecting very little and I was still disappointed. I quite understand, as an avid reader, that the movie will always be very different from the book. Most often, the movie still portrays the important information, and manages to be entertaining for the vast majority of viewers.<br/><br/>This just wasn't the case. The story was excellent, and not drastically changed, but nothing flowed. My major problem seemed to lie within the acting of the lead characters. Edward was actually quite good, less the fact that he came across as very arrogant, and seemed to be laughing at half of his lines. Bella, on the other hand, lacked any emotion whatsoever. At no point do they seem like they are in love. Bella just looks angry all the time. I think that this ruins the focus of the movie.<br/><br/>I am hoping that the director learns a few things about putting together a quality movie, and our leads learn to portray their roles a bit better as the plot progresses and things get more serious. I would hate to see a disconnected Bella in future movies."
"skip221-1","7","1","6","3 January 2009"," Worth it if you think Rpatz is gorgeous
","I read the books before I saw the movie and loved the books so much that a month after the movie came out I decided I needed to go see it because I loved the story so much. I made my boyfriend take me thinking he would like it too but to be honest I kept laughing at what was suppose to be serious and romantic parts because they were so cheesy, and I felt bad for him. With that said, I still enjoyed the movie and although I feel she didn't show enough emotion at times, she still did well. I couldn't have imagined a better Edward but then again I think he is devastatingly handsome and embodied what Edward really was in the book, a boy who loves a girl more than anyone ever has. I know this movie was made for teenage girls so I expected some cheesiness and angst, so even though I am 24 it didn't bother me to the point that it took away from the movie. I am excited for New Moon, hoping they can do better with that one."
"gcgirlss909","7","1","6","26 December 2008"," great actors, bad effects.
","I LOVE all of the four books and I believe that the casting decision was phenomenal. You could tell all of the actors have wonderful chemistry and I wouldn't be surprised if some of them ended up together some day. I am quite fond of their choice for Alice in particular, Ashley Greene fits that role perfectly.<br/><br/>But all of the greatest actors in the world could never overshadow the awful special effects. I know this was a low budget film, but SERIOUSLY! Everyone I have asked about Edward sparkling in the sun has said the exact same thing: he just looks like he's sweating. That was a huge letdown to many fans. Also, the way the vampires move is ridiculously corny. Really? He just flew out of a window, in a parallel line? Lame, Catherine Hardwicke made some very bad decisions in the effects department, possibly costing some of the actors awards in the near future.<br/><br/>I pray that they put that money made from Twilight to good use for New Moon. If they have the same cheesy special effects again, they have absolutely no excuse of saying that they have a 'low budget'.<br/><br/>But, after getting past the effects, i really did like the movie. I would recommend it, but warn you that it's definitely not as good as the book."
"Otoboke","7","1","6","26 December 2008"," Driven by heart rather than fangs.
","The vampire sub genre of the much broader class of horror film is one that is very rarely taken as a serious means of delivering drama or characterisation, never mind palpable romance. Twilight, the first of what is set to be a series of films based upon the popular books of the same name, counteracts this popular trend successfully, establishing a world that retains its otherworldly charm and yet still manages to deliver a story that most of us humans will be able to digest. It's a feature that is bound to polarise viewers; those attracted to the vampire complex will undoubtedly be let down by the lack of focus on such, and those repelled by the genre will most likely be the ones to enjoy it. In this vein I wasn't particularly looking forward to my viewing of Twilight ¬ñvampire movies have only very rarely managed to entertain or engage me in the past- but I was pleased to find the experience rewarding, intelligent and fittingly driven by heart rather than fangs.<br/><br/>Focusing around teenage misfit of sorts Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) as she moves to her father's cold and inhospitable town whilst her mother goes on a state-wide roadtrip with her new boyfriend, Twilight is first and foremost a character story. Not only is it such, but it directs its attention on a personality that isn't driven by the desire to feast. No doubt, Twilight wouldn't be much of a movie if it didn't feature vampires, but it does well to get the balance right in terms of focus. Where the key involvement between Bella and the cold ones comes into play however isn't through danger or a series of spooky 'boo' moments, but rather through subdued teenage-tinged romance. This key shift in momentum makes director Catherine Hardwicke's movie a much more subtle and slow moving feature than one might expect, and the result is potent in its ability to draw the mind and heart within its tale. Those looking for campy, rudimentary fun best look away; Twilight strives to be a little more than such.<br/><br/>What's most interesting about the feature however lies in its unconventional mix of action, drama and romance. Very rarely is it seen that movies with any degree of fantastical or action-orientated elements plays them in the background to the attention-demanding elements inherent within drama and romance. In this respect, Twilight achieves a tone and pacing quite unlike most examples out there; sure enough, the movie would undoubtedly be better off with even less of a focus on the thrills and chills or vampiredom, but one can at least attest to the fact that this small risk for the most part plays off in a refreshing manner that feels natural to the story that it tells.<br/><br/>So who exactly are these vampires and what do they want? Well, one group particularly ¬ñthe Cullens- simply chose to ignore their impulses to feed on human blood, and live together outside of town where they respectfully live on a ""diet"" of animal blood instead. One of these comes in the form of Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison), an attractive figure of mystique and animosity to his peers, who, by chance ends up falling for Bella in a strange way. This passion that Edward experiences for Bella plays out as a dualism consisting of lustful temptation and protective love; conflicted by his overwhelming desire to feed upon her, and at the same time convince her of his love, Edward is for the most part the tale's major source of character interest. Bella herself is straight forward, and plays as the catalyst for Edward's eventual conflict, but as a pair the two share a wonderful dynamism that often leaps from the screen in wistful, whimsy and romantic flares of imagery.<br/><br/>Part of what makes such moments as powerful as they are ¬ñaside from the performances of those involved- is the potent sense of atmosphere that is created from the meshing of Hardwicke's romantic, otherworldly style and the similarly themed score penned by Carter Burwell. Echoing the dynamism and refreshing qualities of Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay, Burwell's music creates layers of different atmospheres that always propel the feature forward into a realm of its own. There's a distinct prominence of ambiance here too, that brings in less than traditional movie-score instruments to pull the job off and the effect is always interesting to behold. Furthermore, while not quite as daring as one would hope, the photography of Elliot Davis too adds much needed dimensions to the film's body, complementing all other elements with coherency and relevancy to what is being explored within the characters.<br/><br/>Granted, there are more than a few missteps that take place within the boundaries of what is for the most part a surprisingly effective anti-genre movie, but one can't help but be slightly distracted when they do come along. Kristen Stewart, although doing a fine job in much of the movie's less emotionally demanding scenes, too often falls pray to a lack of heart; the romance as a result during the middle section of the film feels a little underwhelming and disempowering. This and a slight dive in momentum and focus during the movie's final ¬ñmore action-driven- act constitute what are the only real major drawbacks of the film. Other than this, Twilight is a real treat. Intelligent but emotionally driven with a tone that is at times surreal and yet distinctly human, Twilight achieves what most dramas with less of a fantastical nature only wish they could; sure this isn't high-culture stuff, but that's part of its graceful charm. If there is one reason to see it, it isn't for the macabre themes, the fantasy or the vampires, but rather for the dark romance; Twilight is a rare breed of such that successfully mixes all of the required ingredients in a palpable, character-driven tale of warm sentiment.<br/><br/><ul><li>Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","I think the books are incredible and the movie didn't let me down at all. I thought the movie was fantastic and even my mother thought it was fantastic, claiming that Twilight was the sort of movie that she would never get sick of watching- if you are interested in vampires and a general love story told in a new and sensual way- then this is very true. Twilight is a fantastic movie, everything from the cold atmosphere that we are confronted with on the screen to the incredible acting of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart who shines as Bella. All the actors in this film have their place and their roles are all significant in the movie- the movie just flows so well and the acting is very solid which only makes this movie all the more appealing and wonderful to watch. Robert Pattinson is amazing as Edward, he is the perfect person to play the character and he does it in the most sensual, sexy and cold way he is amazing on the screen. Kristen Stewart plays Bella beautifully, in such a confused, vulnerable and curious way to the point where you almost envy her and her moments of passion with Edward. Twilight is a wonderful film. Most definitely one of the best films that I have seen all year."

","First, let me start off by saying I am a mother of three girls one of which was in the process of reading the series and of course felt the need to drag me in to see the move Twilight with her. Honestly I had no prior opinion of the series or the movie prior to this. Then I saw the movie and immediately fell in love with the entire story. Not having read the books I was completely immersed in the movie itself. And I must say after watching this beautiful story of destined love I could not have pictured this movie with a different cast so I must say the person in charge of casting could not have done a better job. I've seen a few reviews where the actor Robert Pattinson has received much criticism for his performance but I (just your average movie lover) never saw him that way. Even unspoken you could see the anguish pouring out of his eyes or the forced restraint he put on himself to avoid hurting Bella. And then the actress playing Bella, wow. They were beautiful together as was the rest of the cast.Needless to say I read the entire series within the week and it made me realize that it wasn't just the actor playing Edward or Edward himself but rather the combination of the two so perfectly expressed on screen the love, fear, and anguish Edward was going through as his human emotions slowly came back to him because of the forbidden kismet love of Bella his ""soul""mate if you will. Long story short, let go of any pretenses of this being some kind of teeny bopper chic flick and see this beautiful story of a love that surpasses life and death exquisitley portrayed by an extraordinary cast for yourself."

Yes, she did an amazing job, but the stuttering got on my nerves a bit. If you love the books, and even if you don't, you will most likely love this movie!"

","the movie is just too short and shallow. no one will understand how the love has gone so deep without reading the books. pattinson's performance was poor. he failed to show the determination and confidence that edward possessed. it was a bad choice to let pattinson to play edward. kristen is acceptable, perhaps she is more experienced and capable of acting. for those who want to see the twilight movie, be prepared that it is just a low-budget and below-averaged production. other than luck, i cannot figure out any other reasons that it could be a box-office hit. people who are really interested in the story, the books will be a way better choice than spending money on the movie.<br/><br/>and about the music, bella's lullaby sucks. just couldn't figure out why and how they picked this piece out. it doesn't necessarily have to be an original or newly created. think of ""somewhere in time"", isn't the rhapsody on a theme of paganini really really nice and fit? the music was created way earlier than the time of the film story background, but so what? who cares?<br/><br/>heard that the movie is moving ahead to new moon, however, Catherine Hardwicke is no longer the director. perhaps it is a better move. the company should re-think the whole thing since there is so much room for improvement. i am a big fan of the books and hope the company can make a best plan for the sequel. please create something that is worth spending money on the movie tickets and dvds."

","So, i've read the books and it did follow the book very well. I liked all of the cast with the exception of esme- definitely kathryn morris from cold case just looks like esme, i just didn't quite connect with Reaser, the acting was pretty good though. As far as Bella- I like Kristen Stewart from the other movies i've seen her in, and was excited to see her as Bella, but was not impressed with her performances in the more distraught/emotional scenes, it was very fake. Edward by Pattinson i liked- very good and brooding. I think the next books will be better adapted, since this one got the ball rolling and they can see what to do differently."
"Mac34de","10","1","6","25 November 2008"," A fun film for fans and non-fans alike.
","I loved this movie, granted I'm a very loyal fan of Stephenie Meyer and have read the Twilight series as well as ""The Host"" which was an excellent novel as well. I went into this movie planning to grade it on several key points.<br/><br/>The first being adaption quality. I feel that they did an excellent job of bringing the pages of the story to life, going as far as to actually use whole passages of dialog. The atmosphere was exactly the way i saw it as I read the ""Twilight"" way back in 2005 when it was first released. Everything about the sets and story pleased me as a movie goer. I did find that the relationship between Edward and Bella was slightly rushed and found that, while this was understandable because of the confines of the movies length, it took away from the extreme bond they were portraying towards the end of the film when the crisis involving James takes place.<br/><br/>Secondly I looked at casting and was for the most part blown away. the Cullens were casted wonderfully and of course Bella and her parents were perfect as well. the only character that I don't care for is that of Jacob and this is not due to his acting ability, but mainly because he doesn't fit the picture I painted in my head when reading the book. This however, is my own personal issue, so moving on...<br/><br/>Finally I waited for the end of the film to arrive. i knew to expect some form of cliff hanger and I must say I have mixed feelings about the one that was presented to me. I loved the way Victoria was shown watching them from above at the prom, however i do worry that they are planning to move up her story line and that bugs me. I would like to see the films run in line with the novels, not branch off now that the first one has established the characters. Also, while I loved the look of the tear smeared mascara(did I even spell that right?) on Victoria, I don't think vampires cry do they? lol Over-all i found that the film lived up to my expectations, if not surpassing them on certain respects. While it certainly won't please every audience member, there are more than enough references to the book to please the hard core fans and general readers alike. The cast is great and the effects are above average for this type of teen fare. Quick note, you can find an author cameo at the diner the second time Bella and Charlie are there. the camera starts on her as she is presented her meal, a salad."

","So, I went into Twilight expecting another Harry Potter movie, a horrifying representation of an amazing book. However, I was so wrong!!! The characters were played very well, they matched their parts physically and emotionally. Kristin Stewart and Robert Pattison worked very well together, although sometimes they were awkward and over-dramatic, for the most part they were spot on. Kristin's hospital scene almost made me cry. The Cullen clan was SPOT ON!! Bella's first encounter with them is so funny and so real. Carlisle seemed like a protective father, Esme a protective mother, Rosalie a bitch, Emmett strong and intense, Alice graceful and bouncy, and Jasper in pain. The visuals were sometimes dumb, like with Edward running and his glowing skin in the sun could have been better but overall they were good, especially in the fight scene. Finally,the end was perfect and sets up the next movie so well! I'm expecting great things to come!"

","Girl moves to new town. Girl meets boy. Girl loves boy. Boy says ""I'm not good for you"". Girl lovboy. Boy says ""I'm not good for you"". Girl loves boy. Boy loves girl. Beneath all the paper-white makeup and ""brooding yet sensitive boy"", that is all there is to Twilight, the first in a series of novels-turned-movies currently sweeping North America, the rest of which are soon to get their chance on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Twilight is the movie version of Stephanie Meyer's claim to fame novel, which has wrestled with success in the same manner as a younger generation's Harry Potter. Unfortunately, the vampire-centric series is unable to hold a Nosferatu-killing flame to the wizard's legacy, in neither film nor print.<br/><br/>Within the first five minutes, viewers are introduced to Bella, an overly pale girl who has just moved to a small town known as Forks. The film spends as little time as possible with her as the new girl before introducing her immediate best-friends, who we see pop up once or twice throughout the next two hours. The main plot line lies between Bella and the Cullen Clan, as the lead protagonist begins falling for the Clan's heartthrob, Edward.<br/><br/>Films such as Twilight have both upsides and downsides to their built in fan-base, acquired over the course of four novels and countless hand-offs from friend to friend. As the film was a near-guaranteed success, studios realized they need not spend tens of millions extra on such trivial thing as special effects and stunt doubles. The only problem is that in a film that focuses on vampires and their abilities¬Ö Their abilities looked horrendous. In many of the ""action"" scenes, the entire choreographed fight seemed reminiscent of 1970's wire-work in low budget Korean films. This goes part-in-parcel with the makeup effects on the vampires, whose resemblance was closer to The Joker than it was to any descendant of Dracula.<br/><br/>Previously seen in the Harry Potter series, Robert Pattinson portrays Edward in a way that fans were destined to love, filling his performance with dark, meaningful stares and looks of deep concentration. Sadly, his character was two-dimensional enough that a Calvin Klein model could fit the vampiric role with room to spare. On the other side of the spectrum, Kristen Stewart plays an equally bland role, bringing the lead femme to life as Bella. Mirroring Edward's character in every way, Bella leaves Stewart with next to no room to act, as they're ""love"" is expressed through confused stares and questionable tilts of the head. A supporting cast of rebel vampires brings a darker side to the story, although the actors behind the foes leave no lasting impression, becoming as dispensable as the Soft Sponges with which they apply their makeup.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, Twilight is what it was meant to be ¬ñ pointless amusement for teenage girls who truly want to believe that dark, brooding men with soft sides truly do exist. To those of you who have not read the books, I would advise you to stay as far away from the film as possible. And to those of you who have read the book¬Ö Search up Anne Rice.<br/><br/>2 ¬Ω out of 5"

","Twilight was simply amazing. It was so interesting seeing someone else's interpretation of the book. Also, when reading twilight I couldn't picture Edward sparkling in the sunlight. It was good to have a visual aid. I know that a lot of people are bad mouthing it but really, I can't see why. It was a treat and a joy. My favorite part would be when Bella is reading about vampires and she's imagining Edward biting her and he has the dark circles around his eyes and the blood dripping from his mouth. It seemed so...Tim Burton-y...I think. Also, my favorite part of the book (when Edward spends the night with Bella) was beautifully portrayed. Now, there were only 2 things I didn't like. However, they are minor. I will be honest, I thought Jacob was ugly. However, I don't like Jacob so he can look ugly. Also, I was sad that Bella didn't say ""Holy crow!"" That was the only part in the book that I laughed out loud. On the other hand, this movie had some funny little moments. (Charlie with the gun for example.) All in all, beautiful beautiful beautiful...Edward is a sexy babe...NO HATERS!"
"garywalden-1","1","8","142","25 March 2009"," One of the worst films I have ever seen
","I have to say, I don't get why there is so much fuss over this film. I know, I am not a teenager, but I thought that teens were smarter these days. When I went to see this film, I saw a bunch of bad actors trying to portray all of this angst and ended up looking really constipated. The story drug on and on, with no connections. And the vampire's skin turns glittery in sunlight? Is this a vampire film or My Pretty Pony? Stupid and a total bore. I apologize to all of the people who love this film, I think that a lot of the fans of the picture are also fans of the book series, which warrants the sequels. I, as a viewer who had not read the books, found the characters, especially the protagonist, annoyingly vapid and vacant. This film makes me worrisome about the younger generation."
"bkmcdermott","1","7","119","26 May 2009"," Bad cinema at its... worst?
","I first saw Twilight with a friend on opening night. I had never read the books nor heard anything about it, so I went in with a clean slate. I found myself laughing at inappropriate times (such as when the film-makers tried to use a blue filter to mask the fact that the actors were standing in direct sunlight) and whenever Kristen Stewart went into one of her spazy-blinky episodes. Knowing the movies had such a following with the books, I promptly went home and read the entire series and went to see the movie again. I now own the DVD as something to put me to sleep.<br/><br/>As someone who works in television I am frustrated that such a horrible piece of garbage made it to the big screen. The acting was sub-par (though I rather enjoyed Billy Burke's performance), the special effects were atrocious, and the script belonged on a low-budget day-time soap NOT a big Hollywood production (I continuously had to ask my friend, who had read the books, what the heck was going on and I'm not giving anything away when I say that the love story was nonexistent).<br/><br/>So, if you want to veg-out for two hours as you stare at a screen of over-glamorized teen life and drama with absolutely no build-up, Twilight is the movie for you."
"brazzle","1","8","143","11 May 2009"," worst... movie...ever
","I went into this movie hoping for good things but holy F... this was probably the worst movie ever The plot was completely ridiculous, the acting was mind boggling bad and the screenplay was worse.<br/><br/>Bella had no character development, depth or personality. The fact that people were even talking to her in the movie is a mistake as in real life no one would ever speak to a rude, emo and sulky girl like her. This actress must have based her character off of a Vulcan which can clearly be seen from any lack of emotion or excitement in her portrayal. Also, when a vampire tells you he wants to kill you, one does not respond with ""I trust you""...<br/><br/>Edward was no better, he had no subtlety to his acting, his makeup was poorly done (look at his neck) and you get tired of his one expression 5 minutes in the movie... AND THEY GLITTER IN SUNLIGHT? that's why they don't go outside...because they glisten like a morning dew? WTF. Also the lines ""hold on tight spider monkey"" and ""you are my own personal brand of heroin"" gave me a cramp from laughter <br/><br/>The celibacy theme is so 'on the nose' the entire time you are not surprised at all to find out a Mormon wrote the novels <br/><br/>The fact they are making more sequels to this movie makes me vomit in my mouth. I will be there in theatres though laughing my ass off at the horrible screenplay I am sure it will produce and the complete awkwardness of every line.<br/><br/>To say this movie is fit for dogs is an insult to canines everywhere. Only saving grace is that it makes a great addition to 'bad movie night'<br/><br/>ALSO, for anyone who says its such an original and great idea about a vampire falling in love, watch the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Series... It's superior in acting, writing (due to the brilliant Joss Whedon) and you actually feel something towards the relationship between buffy & angel."

","I don't even know where to start...<br/><br/>Never read the book but one should be able to watch any movie today (if the movie is worth its weight) without having to do so - heck, Lord of the Rings pulled it off.<br/><br/>The casting in this movie was dead awful - I haven't see this many cardboard actors since The Phantom Menace. The direction was equally bad - slow-moving and trying to be all artsy - and the hype centered around this movie is a crime that should not go unpunished. The special effects were laughable as no one's done the ""fast-running/fast-climbing"" thing convincing enough yet. With so much to work with material-wise, it's a shame that people can still muck things up like this. Any one with any creative vision would be able to do more with a cardboard box and some tape.<br/><br/>I sat through this 2-hour crap-fest to please the wife, who was not pleased herself with the translation from book to screen. Ashame that they wouldn't give roles like these out to a more deserving and talented set of young actors - whoever picked these two - yikes! Just about everyone involved in this cast was terrible.<br/><br/>At least there are some laughable moments in this film - though I don't think they were suppose to be laughable.<br/><br/>Any Michael Dudikoff/Chuck Norris/Treat Williams flick has more heart than Twilight."

","The world has been taken by storm by the latest pop culture fad, Twilight. The book was released in 2005 by Stephanie Meyer and has since snowballed into a series. Every teenage girl has been swept off their feet by the perfect boyfriend Edward, constantly praying for the hunky vampire to give them their own happily ever after. The book series have become the new Harry Potter, and so a movie was expected.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The book and film are both about a young girl, Bella (Kristen Stewart), that moves to the rural town of Forks, WA. She begins her classes at a large multicultural school (oddly located within the small town), and makes friends with a variety of people. At lunch she spots the sterling young hottie, Edward (Robert Pattinson), with whom she establishes an immediate connection. Bella eventually concludes that Edward is a vampire, as his features suggest, and does what any clever girl her age would do, date him. The two of them eventually end up in serious trouble (vampire trouble) and Bella and Edward need to fight for their lives against the evildoer, James.<br/><br/>***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The film doesn't stray too far from its source material, Romeo and Juliet, which eventually hurts the film. Of course I speak of the forbidden-love clich√©, which I've seen too many times. Twilight however, tries to add a new twist on this clich√© by literally making Bella forbidden fruit, as Edward would eat her if given the chance. Although this prospect appears new, the vampire-human relationship was done a thousand times better in the long running television show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br/><br/>The film also uses atrocious special effects that could easily be pulled off by film school students. The ending fight scene is also horrendous, as the stunt-work used looks like garbage. Fixing these minor details would have made the film adequate, but the dreadful delivery caused the film to be even worse than it already was.<br/><br/>The acting would have been better if performed by Paris Hilton and Uwe Boll, rather than the appalling Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. The chemistry between the two of them is like watching a duck talk to a brick. Kristen Stewart does nothing but mumble her lines, leaving your ears wondering what the heck they just heard. Robert Pattinson on the other hand deserves this year's Razzie award for worst actor, as every line of dialogue he delivers sounds like a satire of dialogue, overacting all the way home. A key example of this is where Edward wants to show Bella his sparkling face, then begins shouting and yelling at her over nothing.<br/><br/>Many of the young girls tricked into seeing this film say they like it because of the book. The problem with this is that the film alienates the audience that didn't read the book. Although, I must admit that I did read the book, and this did not change my thoughts on the movie, besides make me hate it more. The film was drastically altered from the book, although the filmmakers would argue that it was a fair adaptation. The big problem comes from the fact that Bella and Edward's relationship moves way too fast in the film, making the watcher laugh at how accepting Bella is to finding out that Edward is a vampire.<br/><br/>Twilight is a film that stretches the belief of the fantasy genre to great heights; providing that you haven't seen any other fantasy films. The film itself is laughable and will be lost in the crowd of romance-horror movies that plague the shelves of the local video store. I only recommend this film to loveless teenage girls that liked the book."
"abennihana","1","8","143","24 January 2009"," Poorly written, but the acting was... well, bad
","The book I understand was pretty good. This screenplay was obviously aimed at girls aged 23 and under and is crap. Skip it. Maybe someone will do a remake in 20 years that's worthwhile. I will say the director did a fair job with the actors she was given. The male lead has that sullen ""I'm actually a sensitive but complicated guy underneath all this unavailability"" quality that I, and a lot of other boys, had when I was 15. But it's hard to buy from a ""life form"" that's supposed to be a hundred years old. I realize that it's a vampire movie and isn't supposed to be reality. That said the characters, with the exception of the female lead, aren't very well developed and leave a lot to be desired before they become capable of inspiring anything in an audience."
"Mary-810","1","8","143","24 January 2009"," Worst movie from a book ever made!
","This was a horrid movie. A big reason was the low budget. 1st of all the actors were poorly chosen. Edward having to wear way to much makeup and Bella moving her eyes around way to much. The book is wonderful, but the movie completely ruined it. I have no will to read the book anymore :( . It's a great series and I'm sad it had to be ruined because of this disaster. Another thing was that Edward and Bella fell in love to fast. It would be nice if they fell in love later. I know the big fight seen has to happen, but I think that that part should have been a little longer. The movie in general should have been longer. <br/><br/>Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy - her are all the cheesy parts in the movie. Edward and bellas kiss - it was horrible, it was like the actors have never kissed before Edward sucking the venom out of bella - very badly done, let's say it was funny Flashbacks when carlise bites them - like above, funny And more <br/><br/>One last thing, I didn't see much of the non main characters (Cullen family, quiliates, mike, Tyler etc.) because of that I couldn't really connect or understand them.<br/><br/>All in all, don't buy it, don't see it, rent it before you consider buying it<br/><br/>There are many other problems with this movie and these are just the main ones"
"dragongirl346","1","7","120","30 May 2009"," Disgusting
","I had never thought anyone would be capable of creating an unwatchable film.<br/><br/>Then they went and made this movie.<br/><br/>Never have I had such a compulsion to reach up and stop the movie, eject it from the DVD player, and hand it back to my friend the next morning. There were three basic tenants that drove this need to get the movie out of my sight.<br/><br/>First off - pacing. This film moves incredibly slow in the parts where it can't afford to lose speed. The viewers already know most of the details that are being revealed at a snail's pace and as a result, they start to drop like flies. Unless they're squealing over Robert Pattinson/Edward Cullen, who I thought looked like he needed to take a bath. I mean seriously - if you're a hundred and something year old vampire, you can make time for personal hygiene.<br/><br/>Secondly - acting. You'd think the filmmakers would try to cover the fact that the female lead has the emotional depth of a rock. But instead Kristen Stewart plays the part exactly as it was portrayed in the book - a shallow, mindless klutz whose life suddenly revolves around a scruffy looking vampire for absolutely no reason. Stewart is at her most vapid, breathing loudly and delivering dialog in almost a monotone. Pattinson is slightly better, but the rest of the cast falls in with Stewart, delivering a performance that is only memorable for its terribleness.<br/><br/>Thirdly and most importantly in my view on films - soundtrack. Guitars plucking randomly in the background do not ""create a nice ambiance"". They are ANNOYING. And in this film, they are omnipresent. By around the forty minute mark, I could not take it anymore, stopped the movie, and grabbed my iPod to cleanse my head with real film music (the only stuff I keep on there).<br/><br/>In short, this movie isn't even worth watching. Thoroughly unentertaining, entirely vapid, how else can I say it.<br/><br/>1/10, because they actually made a film and all. It gets a star for that."

","I've heard a few negative reviews about Twilight and it is understandable. I can see that it probably wasn't everyones cup of tea or the fans were disappointed that some material was left out. Honestly, I thought it was spot on and very enjoyable. <br/><br/>I've been a fan of Twilight for over two years now, I've read Twilight front to back about ten times... maybe more. I'm a huge fan-- but I'm also logical. I know that it was impossible to fit a 500 page book into a 2 hour movie, without boring the general audience. I felt that Twilight (The movie) flowed very well and kept the viewer interested. Even if they hated it! Catherine and Melissa kept the most important things from the book in. Albeit, they weren't in the right order, but honestly having an hour of pure conversation between Edward and Bella, and then Edward saving Bella over and over again. Would have been repetitive and boring! For a book to movie adaption, Twilight was pretty amazing.<br/><br/>On to the acting! First of all- my God Robert Pattinson! He stole the show for me. Not only was he impossibly good looking but he had all the right movements, eye contact, facial expression and line delivery. He completely left me dazzled! One problem, was definitely some of the dialogue... which of course was not Rob's fault. I felt that he did a stand up job with the material he was given. <br/><br/>Kristen- surprised me most of all, I went in the first time totally expected to be disappointed by her acting, because I've seen some of her previous movies that were horrible! But she really pulled it off. I hate when people say, she had no emotion or facial expression! If you watch it again- you'll notice how she totally connects with her eyes. <br/><br/>The chemistry is what fueled this film, they were absolutely amazing. I sincerely believed that they were in love. People say that their love was too rushed. But first love is always rushed- you can know you love someone right off the get go. Besides, Bella and Edward(if you've read Midnight Sun) were basically in love with each other from the start. <br/><br/>I personally didn't have a problem with the special effects, because for one I know they didn't have much of a budget. And two: Twilight isn't about the effects, it's about love! :)<br/><br/>The whole entire cast was great and perfect for each of their roles.<br/><br/>10/10!<br/><br/>Cannot wait till New Moon!!"

","I've seen the movie Twilight many, many times. Granted I work at a movie theater and can watch whatever I want as much as I want. But I CHOOSE to go in to see Twilight every single time over all the big named movies that have come out since Twilight's premiere last month.<br/><br/>I don't agree with some of the comments comparing Twilight to Harry Potter. I know both book series backwards and forwards (and many others, I read A lot!), the comparisons are going to come #1-both are beloved book series and #2-because Robert Pattinson is in both movies.<br/><br/>I love both of these book series, they are well thought out and sometimes take you in directions that you weren't expecting which is awesome! And the plots and character are all solid.<br/><br/>The thing for me though, is that I felt that Twilight (the movie) really encompasses the heart and soul of the book. There were some differences - of course - you can't go word for word when adapting a book to the big screen, but I still always feel that big **SIGH** when the movie Twilight is over and I can't wait to go see it again.<br/><br/>On the other hand the Harry Potter movies are entertaining, yes, but I've come out of each movie feeling the ""Lacking"" for what the book represents. The HP movies could be so much better...I just feel that there's a missing piece.<br/><br/>I've discussed both book series and movies with friends who've also read the books and seen the movies and even a couple who've not read the books but have seen the movies, and have found overwhelmingly that they agree with my assessment."
"rebreb-2","10","1","7","5 December 2008"," The Best Movie since Harry Potter that has be made from a series of novels
","I have seen Twilight and I think that it is best movie of the year. The way it depicts a relationship between a vampire and human. Bella and Edward can help loving each other its animal attraction, and the fact the Edward and his vampire are ""vegetarion vampires"" it help the relationship unlike show's like Buffy and Angel when it Angel had a moment of pure happiness he would start killing everybody.<br/><br/>I glad that the decided to show another side of vampires beside the human killing ones. The devotion that Edward shows Bella is something not seen in movie these day so it's a nice change. In the later movies like New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn we will see and another side of devoted that is never seen, that way that he protect's her that glass.<br/><br/>But that is also a very obsessive side of Edward who doesn't like Bella being friends with Jacob because he's a Werewolf. But let's not forget readers that Edward did tell Bella that he didn't want to be with her anymore and he didn't love her. But then it came back and didn't want her to have anything to do with Jacob even though Jacob was there for Bella more than Edward ever was.<br/><br/>But that's one persons opinion and I can not speak for everyone else."

"dollierobot","5","1","7","25 November 2008"," A mere guilty pleasure.
","I'm not going to lie to you, I enjoyed this. It has it's funny moments, intentional or not, but it also has its flaws: <br/><br/>#1, Most fans will be pleased that the majority of the script comprises lines direct from the novel. I, myself, found it predictable and boring.<br/><br/>#2, Poor acting. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson provide rather vapid, awkward performances, and Pattinson's vain attempt at an American accent repeatedly slips.<br/><br/>#3, Edward and Bella had only known each other for a few weeks (I assume) and by the end she's willing to give up her human life and everything in it for him. Plus, it hardly seems like love; rather, lust and infatuation that is grossly exaggerated.<br/><br/>#4, Cheesy special effects. I am aware they had a small budget, but COME ON.<br/><br/>That, and several other aspects I do not care to mention. But, Charlie's almighty 'stache of glory makes up for it, among other things.<br/><br/>My conclusion? It was enjoyable. A guilty pleasure, if you will. They left this in the hands of Catherine Hardwicke, who took away the compelling charm that the books had (no, I'm not too biased. Books = BAAAAD, but oddly lovable). Do not take this film too seriously."
"night_mare09","7","1","7","24 November 2008"," Edward, a vampire, falls in love with Bella, a human girl in the small town of Forks, Washinton.
","I'm going to start out by saying that i'm a huge fan of the Twilight series. I love the books and I'm very attached to Edward and Bella and their love story.<br/><br/>I sat in line for tickets on premier night, and honestly my expectations weren't that high. The previews made the movie look cheesy and low budget.<br/><br/>I've watched the movie twice and I liked it better the second time. There are good points and there are bad points. I'm going to start with the good: <br/><br/>The directing for this movie was beautiful. The film is filled with scenes of forests and and greenery. It made me want to go to Washington state. The film opens with a deer grazing with Stewart narrating in the background.<br/><br/>The casting for this movie was amazing. The characters, especially the vampires, are almost exactly like I pictured them. Alice looks like a pixie, Rosalie looks beautiful , Emmett is comparable to a bear, Carlisle is attractive, and Victoria and James look savage and evil. I've heard a lot of people complain that Robert Pattinson wasn't good for Edward, saying mostly that he wasn't attractive enough. Almost every line in the book is infused with Bella obsessing over how amazingly beautiful he is. That's a hard thing for an actor to live up to. Not everyone is going to be happy, no matter how attractive the actor looks like. Kristin Stewart portrays all of the awkwardness that Bella entails.<br/><br/>Another amazing aspect of the film is the soundtrack. The music, especially, Bella's lullaby is beautiful and fit the movie very well. One of my favorite songs of all time is super massive black holes and I was thrilled to hear it in the baseball scene.<br/><br/>Also, the movie did an excellent job following the book. I'm an avid reader and i've had many of the books I've read have been turned into movies. One thing that I've learned is to never expect a book and movie to be the exact same. Having said this, there were direct lines from the book in the movie. One thing that I would have liked to see expanded was the meadow scene. Also, one thing that I thought that the director and probably the writers failed to do was to show the depth and evolution of Bella'a love for Edward. It was as if it just happened. There was no development.<br/><br/>There was decent amounts of humor in the scene, mostly in the interactions of Bella and Charlie (I did laugh in parts that weren't supposed to, if from nothing else than pure cheesiness). The interaction, especially in Charlie's part was probably some of the best acting in the entire movie, which leads me into the not so good parts of the film.<br/><br/>Charlie was supposed to be a minor character yet i think that he was one of the best actors in the film, as were the other minor actors. Alice did a wonderful job being a graceful pixie and Rosalie was excellent at portraying her hatred for Bella. James was creepy and Jasper looked like he was in constant pain, as he should be.<br/><br/>The place were I have the real problem is with Pattinson (Edward) and Stewart (Bella). In the very beginning, with the scene in the biology lab, Pattinson's acting made me want to bang my head into a wall. I understand that he was trying to mask Bella's smell, but it look more like he was having a seizure. His accent was awful at first, but it got better as the movie went on, as did his acting abilities. His makeup also improved. There was way too much in the beginning. The chemistry between Pattinson and Stewart was undeniable but i'm not sure if that was enough. Stewart had decent line delivery but her expression between lines was awkward and exaggerated. On some of the parts were it was bad (maybe horrible?) acting, its hard to decide if it was poor line delivery, or poor lines to deliver. This can be seen in the scene when Bella first says out loud that she thinks Edward is a vampire. It would take excellent actors and actresses to perform those lines well and Pattinson and Stewart just didn't seem to have the stuff. I suppose I'm only trying to point out the faults of the script. I would never call Pattinson and Stewart bad at what they do. I just think that they could have used a few more takes.<br/><br/>I think the worst scene on Stewart's part would be when she was bitten by James and was 'trying' to be in pain. on Pattinson's part, I would say pretty much most of the bio scene was painful to watch.<br/><br/>Another thing about the film that bugged me was the lack of sparkle. When Edward stepped into the sun, I had to point out to my friends that he was sparkling.<br/><br/>The scene in which Edward and Billy black were driving by each other was stupid and cheesy.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was far from a crash and burn. It's not something that would be a favorite for me, but neither would I condemn it as a failure. I would recommend it only because I think everyone reacts differently to it and that its something that everyone should formulate their own opinion on."
"kenya_hicks01","10","1","7","24 November 2008"," Twlight Was Great
","This movie was really great. 95% of the time the movies are not as good as the book because of course they have to cut things out due to time limits. I think that they did great job with this movie and with the time they had. They were able to show their emotions quite well I thought. I loved the first time Edward smelled Bella and the first kiss. I mean when he would kiss her and inch back and kiss her again and inch back it was like it hurt so good. My girl Bella was ready though she grabbed a hand full of hair and was going for it. I have to say I melted my seat about right then. My gosh it looked so real I do think they did a very convincing job with the emotions they were trying to portray.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Edward is supposed to be so fit and beautiful that he looks like he was chiseled out of Marble but when he showed his sparkle he had hair on his chest. Umm yeah No ....""Robert you need to shave for the next movie"". I know it could just be me. Having said that the movie was really great. I do think that Steph should follow the Harry Potter movies and make it 3hrs so you can get more of the story in and actors. Believe me I will go see it more then once. I have already seen Twlight twice"

","Whenever a movie comes out, I'm always hysterical at how people over analyze, over criticize and just plain freak out. Mind you, I'm not the target audience for Twilight, but this movie was great (and I'm 35!) So here's my guideline: if you fall into one of the following categories, you should not see this movie:<br/><br/>1. You didn't read the book 2. You're a man (the idea of monogamy and abstinence are probably shocking) 3. You don't like female directors (for some reason people tend to diss movies of female directors quicker) 4. You're expecting blood and nudity<br/><br/>However, if you fall into one of these categories, you should see this movie:<br/><br/>1. You read the book(s) 2. You're a hopeless romantic and/or you always secretly wished to be desired by someone dangerous or forbidden 3. You don't over analyze things and just enjoy movies for what they are 4. You know that the book is always better<br/><br/>Does the movie do the book justice? of course not, they never do. You never get the same emotions out of a movie. But just as Interview with the Vampire was a better book and is still the best vampire movie out there, Twilight is an amazing read that makes a great flick. Considering the amount of really bad vampire movies made in the last 10 years (Van Helsing, Dracula 2000, John Carpenter's Vampires, etc.), this is a welcome change. I can't wait for ""New Moon""."
"tyler_miracle","10","1","7","23 November 2008"," An excellent movie no matter the age...
","Though Stephenie Meyers' ""Twilight"" saga is ultimately directed at teens ( or so many think ), The movie, i feel, will be enjoyable to everyone, no matter their age! It includes something for everyone... the action-lovers, the vampire crazy kids, and most importantly.. the romantics. This is one of the most romantic, sweet movies i've ever watched! In every aspect, Robert Pattinson did an AMAZING job portraying the vampire, Edward Cullen, along with the rest of the cast. It is so sweet, that you're almost guaranteed to get a little bit teary eyed. Whether you've read the books religiously, or are just interested in watching, you can not afford to miss this must see! I definitely plan on watching it again! :)"
"marshallemerica","7","1","7","23 November 2008"," Staring up at the moon ""Twilight again"" The movie review
","Hello, <br/><br/>Twilight for me fell on a Friday evening upon a re-reading the book before the premiere. The movie turned out to be far better then I expected it to be easily. Of course you can't cram everything of a 500 page book into an hour and twenty minute movie. But you can surely try and get the point across of a well written story. Which directer Catherine Hardwicke did almost perfect in my own opinion along with others. When the movie starts you notice a few parts jumping ahead seeming to go by in seconds (introductions,narration,character development). And you will realize this ties in perfect with what the directer wanted to achieve, so just bare with those facts. Almost right after the intros etc.. the movie jumps right past the first quarter of the book and every thing moves smoothly. You see Edward and Bella's awkward beginning to his sincere love and caring for her along with his family. Then you may notice a little more of the book is left out the less important ramblings from Bella you can say. Then your right back into the movie as you read the book. And again nothing can compare to ones imagination, but they sure tried and sure did nail a great bit of what I had in mind. The acting in this movie was just wonderful Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart just work on screen with each other very well. Almost instantly you felt there pain/emotions threw their eyes and the way they composed themselves they just nailed it! I could ramble far more about this movie, but I wont do that to you :D. This movie is good as it could of been for a so called ""teen girl fantasy or love story"" But if your looking for a movie with great acting and a great story then do yourself a favor go see this movie! Over all I am giving this movie a 7/10 just because parts could of been better. Also I am a male and genuinely fell in love with the books and movie on my own. Please give this a try your not too macho to see this movie!"
"khlav41-1","10","1","7","22 November 2008"," Go into this movie with an open mind.
","I completely agree with the people that say this isn't the same as the book, but as most novel to movies go, they don't tend to be the same. The books are way more detailed than the movie, BUT you have to go into the movie knowing that. Don't get your book to movie expectations too high because you will in fact be let down. There are parts in the movie that are different from the books and if you've read them you will catch them and say oh wait thats not how that happened...well its a movie and can't be as intricate as the books because they have a limited time span to get all of the information in. So my advice is go into this movie with an open mind, do NOT go in with the expectations that it will be just like the book, the main parts are in fact the same but the special features are not. Overall great movie, i was smiling the whole time. I have read all four books (finished the last one about an hour ago ha) and am excited about the next movie to come out!! Enjoy!"
"mhzfutbol5","7","1","7","22 November 2008"," Better than what I thought it was gonna be
","First of all, I have read ALL of the Twilight books and while being a straight male, I openly admit to enjoying the books. While Twilight was my second favorite of the four, I wasn't going into this movie expecting anything more than a bunch of screaming girls obsessed with Edward. It was because of this I was able to enjoy this movie more than I thought i would. I was surprised to find that this movie was quite funny in some parts and kept my attention for the ENTIRE 2 hours. Kristen Stewart is a PERFECT choice for Bella and does a great job portraying her. I also enjoyed Bill Burke's Charlie. I found him to be very funny and also very believable as Bella's dad. This unfortunately interesting movie and great book was hindered by lackluster special effects (ie: Edward running) and yes, the throng of teenage girls. Also, I feel that Robert Pattinson wasn't the perfect choice to play Edward. His performance felt strained and awkward. But these are small prices to pay for a better than average movie that will leave fans of the book and newcomers alike with a satisfied feeling."
"freefallinlove","8","1","7","21 November 2008"," A Movie as Strong as the Vampires Themselves
","I am a huge fan of the books. But I wasn't expecting the movie to be exactly like the book. That being said, it was thoroughly enjoyable. I knew there weren't going to be the exact same scenes and the movie would leave out some parts of the book, but I think that's what made the movie beautiful and unique in its own way. It stayed true to the book's overall plot, and I think Melissa Rosenburg did an excellent job on the screenplay. She interlocked all the scenes and aspects of the relationship between Edward and Bella flawlessly, and as a plus, she threw in a bit of humor that provided comic relief after a particularly intense scene. The scenery, of course, was impressive. The beautiful, lush green backgrounds took my breath away.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson did respectable jobs. Their chemistry on-screen was absolutely amazing. It was excellent and carried the movie. Together, they were magnificent. Even (the few scenes they were) apart, they acted well. Contrary to what some say, Kristen Stewart gave a very convincing performance and moulded and shaped herself into the Bella I had in my mind. Robert Pattinson stopped my heart every time he was on screen. Not just because I think he's gorgeous, but because his torn, brooding portrayal of Edward was so convincing and played out even more so.<br/><br/>The background characters provided extra structure to the movie. I was especially surprised as Charlie's performance in the movie, I thought it was great. As I said before, he provided comic relief and the appropriate father-figure to Bella. Anna Kendrick also gave a very convincing performance as the quirky Jessica Stanley, even though the character was never one to be liked. Even though some of the Forks High School humans were changed and moulded, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The movie was a refreshing take on the book. I refuse to be upset or angry over a few left-out scenes, no matter how good I thought they would've turned out, or the added scenes, because I thought they blended with the plot and didn't do any harm. The credits, though, strangely enough, I was impressed with. I thought it was really cool they had Victoria walk down the stairs while the credits rolled. I liked that. I left the theatre feeling satisfied, wanting to watch it again. The only negative thoughts in my head were the few goofs committed and how New Moon wasn't made already."

","I read the book when I was a butterfly-lover teenager, and of course I loved it. i pictured EC as god transposed in the body of a devil('cause good guys are never hot, and we don't even know what EC is because he NEVER does anything wrong, poor guy). Then, after I fantasied almost an year about the upcoming movie, I started despising it just before it came out, when i saw the trailers. And now I simply laugh at ""I loved the movie"" and I write this critic review NOT because i want to fell good(because you fans say that us haters spend time here because we actually like it), but...just because i want to feel good, actually. And decrease the above 6 rating it has, the most overrated movie ever. (Higher than ""Chasing Liberty"" which is a nicer cheesy movie than this) But the movie? There isn't anything to like about it. Firstly, not at least one of the actors make a good job. Robert Pattinson, I simply have no idea about his acting, because he doesn't really have anything to show considering the quality(1/100000) of the movie...and he is attractive, OK(but a total goof in real life). but KRisten?! I have never seen a girl in a hospital bed, being threatened by the love of her life with leaving her(and trust me, I watch a lot of romantic movies) mourning over this like she is transforming in ""Terminator"", just like those worms in Matrix...And poor girl, sets up her Jaw to Rob to bite it, or kiss it? And then, the background...all movie takes place in a FOREST, jeez. I could have filmed that with my handy-cam. Plus, they wear the exact same clothes the entire movie and they don't really have any single type of charm related to them... The directing, terrible. the movie doesn't inspire anything! Nor romance, nor tragedy, nor thriller! What it is, is a pathetic attempt to make the ""love story of our lives"" to look charming. Oh, and yeah...EC sparkles. Like the fireworks you put in your Christmas tree, not even glowing. SPARKLING. And people compare it with Harry Potter, which is simply disappointing. HP was first made for the like of children, but know it caught everyone in its charm, because it is original, funny and exciting! Don't insult JK and the movie's directors. No wonder several Cullens and Swans rejected their parts. Smart guys."

I'm a huge fan, seen all the adds and watched every Youtube.com video containing Rob Pattinson & Kristin Stewart. I went to the midnight premiere and stood in line for 2 hours to see this movie. I admit, i think they rushed the movie to much.. a lot more scenes would have made it more passion filled. He was supposed to kiss her a few more times and she was supposed to faint and such. Jasper was a little goofy, reminded me of Edward scissor hands. All of the Cullens are perfectly chosen actors.I especially loved Rosalie and Alice. Rob did an awesome job as Edward. Bella was amazing as well. Very shy & a loner, but when it comes time shes bullheaded and brave. The nomads are AMAZING i loved how they left it with Victoria at their prom watching them, but wouldn't Edward have smelled her? or heard her thoughts. I still wish the movie was longer and more of the book scenes were in it. they should have focused on the lullaby more. Overall, i say screw the movie critics who rated this movie a ""1.5"" i love this movie and i will watch it a million times before i ever get sick of it :) Keep up the good work, MAKE NEW MOON :D"
"iamjaysun","1","9","189","4 April 2009"," Clich√©' a Plenty Some Spoilers
","I have to first say I'm a fan of all movies, even chic-flix. I actually found something appealing about ""Legally Blonde"". With that said, I have to admit that Twilight is one of the most shameless attempts at appealing to the teen audience since the whole ""Dance-romance"" genre started.<br/><br/>This movie made NO attempt to add any depth to a fairly shallow plot. For example, what was behind the attraction between the two lead characters?Was it a deep understanding of each others problems?, No. Maybe a bonding of two misfits, once again the answer is no. The viewer is forced to swallow that truth that there really is no reason behind the attraction other than the lead vampire being really cool and really hot and really mysterious. They then threw in every ""Cool Man"" clich√©' in the book. He saves the damsel not once---not twice---but three times. He shows her things that NO MAN can EVER show her including trips over snow-capped mountains,treks through mile high trees, and tops it off by playing classical music while she sits in a luxurious chase lounge chair. Sounds too good to be true? Well not in Twilight.There's even a scene where the lead vampire tries to warn his love about the dangers of being with him by revealing his TRUE self. Do you think this TRUE self would resemble anything like an 100 year old vampire monster? Nope, his true self is actually even better than the way he looks normally with a sort of sparkling crystalline look. He asks her if its horrific. She says ""No,, it's Beautiful""-----That's because IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. What the hell was he warning her about ?These vampires apparently look exactly like they did when they were transformed. No beastly like creatures here all beauty but no substance."

","this movie is really stupid but not in an obvious way. They have a secret 'subtly'running for the first hour which if you haven't seen a T.V you might not guess. My advice is to watch any Heath Ledger movie cause it has a far better plot and cute guy. Enough said<br/><br/>The thing about this is that it is not a funny comedy, an eventful action movie, an emotion filled drama or basically any type of genre. I, for one, was confused. It was obvious what was going to happen to a three year old. FYI I watched this with a three year old who thought this was far to unintelligent. Although it may confuse am.... no one.<br/><br/>Can I saw to summarise that I was confused as to the point of this. The director laughed his ""you know what"" off all the way to the bank. This movie contained more stars less tanned than me and i'm a red headed Irish man. <br/><br/>But in closing, this film is an amazement to any person who cannot tackle the complexity of George of the Jungle"
"Nyx_Selene","1","7","141","17 December 2008"," Not okay
","If I say that I read the novel ""Twilight"" 3 times the first 2 days I held it in my hands, I probably don't need to say anything more on how much I like it.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like the movie at least half as much, but I almost felt like crying from disappointment when I saw it. ALL my favorite moments from the novel have been cut short or cut out; I found myself trying to fill out the gaps in my mind, while the movie moved forward so fast it made my head spin, never more than flickering past, hardly touching the surfaces, of most characters.<br/><br/>There is really so much to all the Cullens. They each have a background story that explains who they are, why they do what they do, and feel the way they feel - like Rosalie's dislike for Bella. The movie shows none of them. Nor do we get to see the inhuman beauty of their entire appearances, or how they dazzle any human that looks at them. These roles are excellently cast, which just makes it more frustrating that they're so underdeveloped.<br/><br/>I love the personality of the novel's Bella; she's very kind-hearted, mostly unintentionally funny, slightly cynical and somewhat older than her years. Her clumsiness and awkwardness is endearing next to the vampires' nearly god-like grace. The movie's Bella, to me, came across as vacant, indifferent, arrogant, cold, and sort of bitchy. (And though she says she's clumsy, I must say she hides it really well...) In addition, most of her lines sound like she's reading them for the first time, right off a teleprompter.<br/><br/>But of course, like most other girls and/or women, I have Edward Cullen as my dear favorite - and I guess that's why what they did to this character bugged me the most. Robert Pattinson looks absolutely gorgeous, and I love his voice. He has the makings of a perfect Edward Cullen, I'll give them that, and I understand that it must be difficult to find a 20-something-year-old with the certainty of a 90-year-old, but to me, he was acting too young, with all the insecurity and self-consciousness of a teenager. Edward is supposed to be strong and mature, with authority and integrity; a person that'll make you feel like nothing in the world could ever hurt you as long as he's around. Brooding and serious, yes, but not self-hating. I wanted him to be intimidating and cold, growing warmer as the movie progressed. After all, in the novel, when he finally admits that he can't stay away from Bella any longer, he has actually been trying. In the movie, he constantly follows her like a shadow, more than any other guy, and Bella is nowhere near as shy and insecure as she should be. Instead, she pushes him around, making him seem even more insecure. <br/><br/>I am, however, not going to blame Stewart (Bella) or Pattinson (Edward), since the director was the one who obviously thought the characters should be that way, while I'm wondering if she's even read the book;<br/><br/>I mean... What was up with Edward's horribly exaggerated reaction to Bella in biology? He was just supposed to glare. Why did Bella look insultingly bored when meeting Edwards family in their home (in fact, insultingly bored, period)? Why was she paler than the vampires? How dared they turn the warm, genuine love between Edward and Bella into a teen crush, and the entire breath-taking meadow section into a Polaroid? Where was the growing friendship between Alice and Bella? Why, oh why was there a sparkling sound whenever the sun hit Edward's skin, when I had actually managed to choke back any unfitting laughter up until those moments? I guess they were meant to enhance the visual effects, but instead do a wonderful job at highlighting their failure. <br/><br/>And finally: Why is too big a part of the movie spent in trees, and why would anyone wear sunglasses in a constantly clouded town?<br/><br/>Despite loving the book with all my heart, for most of the movie I sat wishing that it could have been a manga, so that a decent director for the genre could have made an OVA (using the actual novel as screenplay).<br/><br/>I'll give this 8/10 for the casting and scenery, 2/10 for the screenplay, direction and special effects, and 0/10 just for the movie completely missing the soul, essence, warmth and humor of the book.<br/><br/>It wouldn't surprise me if this movie is given a Riff Trax commentary in the future, because the absolutely worst part of it was that I didn't cry - I laughed, as did the rest of the theater. It came every now and then; the horrible sound of an audience feeling embarrassed for the cast.<br/><br/>I probably won't see the sequels. I'll just watch the stills of Robert Pattinson and read the books again, since it's clear that the movies - at least with Hardwicke in the director's chair - will never measure up to the visions in my head."
"LatinaC90","9","1","8","23 August 2009"," Very well done movie
","I have to say, this movie grew on me. The first time I watched it (and I didn't want to because I thought the book/plot sounded ridiculous) I thought it wasn't very good. (I think it was mostly because I didn't want to like it) But then I decided I would read all of the books which are surprisingly very interesting. After reading all of the books I re-watched the movie. The movie is really very good. It catches all of the books main themes and the actors match their characters very well. For a vampire/romance novel brought to life it was very good. All I have to say is don't judge it before you watch it (or read it) because there is a sort of thrill to the entire series. Just give it a chance."

","Everybody is too damn picky with movies. I have been a huge Twilight fan since the books came out. I am smart enough to realize though that it wont be exactly the same as the book, especially since everybody has a different idea of how the book should be adapted to film. Give this movie a chance and don't be so quick to judge. It was great for what it had to work with. New Moon will be better since the budget will be larger and they have picked up a much better director, so just give this series a chance to settle in and I am positive you wont be disappointed. The directing of this movie was questionable but the performances were incredible. If this movie was given more time and money it would have been better, but just stop and think about just how little money they worked with and still were able to make this a great movie. Every film has flaws and what-ifs but take this for what it is... a good start to an even better franchise, give it time and you wont be disappointed."

Geared for the romance female audience with a vampire twist. Lot's of junior high school gals in the theater for this film. You can guess how they marketed this film and for who. She, me wife, says the movie was romantic, suspenseful with a great storyline. I mention there was no Chuck Norris in the film. Maybe, Chuck could have added to the film, but my wife said no. Great date movie. I would give this film an 8 out of 10 for date night. Date night is cool so Twlight is a cool film to bring that date too."
"scallywag52","9","1","8","24 November 2008"," Shut up and enjoy the film.
","I saw Twilight. And I will see it again.<br/><br/>As a whole, the movie was very interesting. First off, the casting was exceptional. Robert Pattinson is an appropriately sexy Edward. His American accent was rather believable, despite the fact it wouldn't be able to support today's colloquialisms with much conviction. However, that works with Edward's character. Kristin Stewart looks and sounds as Bella should, however her emotionless interpretation was slightly disappointing. Not that her acting was bad (I was very impressed with the monologue in the final hospital scene), but her version of Bella was much less sarcastic than I found apparent in the books.<br/><br/>Now, the Cullens. LOVED THEM! Carlisle was positively perfect, with his refined attitude, yet warm (haha, the irony) fatherly approach to others. Esme was also brilliantly portrayed as the motherly figure. The children are basically gorgeous, and that's how it should be. Jasper is just funny to look at, but his self-proclaimed isolation is very endearing. Alice's bubbly disposition is slightly less than imagined, but effective nonetheless. Rosalie - spot on. And Emmett, ditto.<br/><br/>Mike - just as annoying as he was in the book. Eric - amusing. Jessica - a little more likable in the movie than in the book. Angela - Susie Crabgrass, WHAT?!!? But her friendliness to Bella mimics the book well.<br/><br/>Characters aside, the organization provided the movie with a flow that would not have existed had the book been a direct influence. Overall, the differences between the book and the movie are subtle enough to not destroy the story. The movie was very enjoyable (despite the fact I was ready to drink my brain through a straw due to awkward tension). But that's okay, because that's supposed to be there.<br/><br/>So, please, stop with your pessimistic shenanigans and enjoy the film as it was meant to be enjoyed : as a film, not as a comparison to a great book."

","I am a huge die hard fan on the Twilight series. I was so excited to this film, I have been waiting for it all year long, and after I was done watching it I was so surprised that it was so reliable to the book. However they did miss some parts and added new parts, but it's hard to put a 498 page book into a two hour movie.<br/><br/>The actors did a pretty good job and the plot was decent, however I feel like in the end they rushed things a little bit. But like I said, they're trying to put a 498 page book into a two hour film.<br/><br/>Even though some people didn't really like this movie, they shouldn't compare this movie to the novel so much, because it's a great film, even though I felt like the film got to my expectations.

"mike-925","Null","1","8","24 November 2008"," Vampyr Love Means Never Having To Say You're Sorry., Never!
","The movie was great. Sun never came out, drizzled nearly every day. A rainy Washington, a dazzling vampire from an interesting vamp family. Somebody named Bella Swan's father, Sheriff's Department deputy Charlie Swan. That's the name of Marcel Proust's hero in the first of his seven novels, Swann's Way. Now I've got to find out if that is something the screenwriter dreamed up, or if the author was responsible. At first it was surprising, but about a third of the way through, you could see plainly how the author was going to keep the antagonism between the two characters roiling: The Vampire loves the girl so much, there's an inner struggle to keep himself from killing her and draining the blood from her body. Naturally, she eats that s**t up, as the FBI guy in Thelma and Louise would say. Each time the vamp goes through this ""I want so badly to fang you to death"" routine, Bella becomes more bellicosely aggressive. Its startling to guys watching to see how she goes after him. Kristen Stewart who played the girl at the swap meet who has the brief love affair with the young kid in Into the Wild, is doing all the acting in this film. She is mostly submissive and passive but she is the audience's moral guide. She even tells her father to quit eating french fries at lunch, to have a salad like her. The vampire is having nothing, thank you. Stewart has Piper Laurie's chipmunk teeth from the fifties movies Laurie did with Tony Curtis. When you finally see that Bella has jumped on the side of the Family, you know the Studios have at least two sequels in mind, maybe three. Wonderful rainy Washington State exteriors. The look of the film is exquisite and effecting right through to the end of the film. They're leaving high school though, which means no more cheering for the Spartans. She hasn't graduated yet so its only fair that the family place her in Jacksonville High for her last two years. If she isn't in high school, the sequel is going to lose fire. Catherine Hardwicke, who directed the under-rated Lords of Dogtown (2005), which I thought one of the best films that year, was production designer on Three Kings in 1999, as well as on Antitrust and Vanilla Sky. Her direction here may make her the first new major woman director in the Big Leagues in awhile. The movie did $70 million this weekend, $4 million more than the James Bond opener did last week. Its a very big hit. I was scheduled to see the movie early Friday morning at 12:10 a.m., slept through the start, but took the trouble to drive by and discover 30 cars at the Rogers Theater in Sparta at 1:40 a.m.. That one showing in a thousand theaters early Friday at the same time, brought in $7 million. My niece pointed out to me that the film made back its cost including advertising and the cost of negatives on its first weekend, a rare feat in Hollywood. She heard about Twilight from a colleague where she worked in Chicago, and has read one or more of the four books. She is raring to see it today. I'm really onto this not because its a teen film- most of those are nose-holders, but because this is the latest example of an emerging genre known as the Blockbuster Chick Flick. As recently as last year, they were considered risky by H'wood. The reason was that in couple situations which were assumed to be a guy and a girl before the Massachusetts Supremes acted, the guy would choose the flick and it would be Unforgiven or the Hulk or some other male clunker like Appaloosa. But now more than ever, young people are bowling alone. The Studios pulled out the stops for the movie version of Sex and the City. That film was loaded with anti-Male jabs designed to infuriate young guys but at the same time pluck at the strings of a girl's heart. Masochist that I am, I found myself loving those jabs. In the nearly all woman theater where I saw Sex and the City, selected couples were forging the beginnings of same sex marriages as I watched. uh, the film. My niece has since purloined my single copy of Sex and the City forcing me to return to Red Box for a fresh one to make a copy from. Its no fun to watch at home, though, without a bunch of frenzied women in the seats nearby. Since then I have been to every chick flick, even the bad ones like 27 Dresses and the rest of the Judd Apatow awfulness, which aren't just chick flicks but also wallow in male excess like f*rting. Before Sex and the City, women clung to their copies of the Notebook DVD and other Nicholas Sparks tearjerkers. Sparks' latest, Nights in Rondanthe, was a limited success, possibly because there wasn't enough male bashing in it. Its a great time to be alive even with the financial world melting. But parents need to cut back in their efforts at reviving Ophelia. Its young Hamlet who needs resuscitation most."

I really did enjoy the movie but i do feel like they missed a lot of important scenes like the Biology blood typing scene. Also I also felt like they changed some stuff that shouldn't have been changed like the car accident scene, they have Edward save Bella but then he runs off leaving her there and not even saying anything to her. But I really did love the movie, and my mom never read the books, and she understood the movie. But this is a great movie and i felt like the actors did a good job portraying the roles! I felt that Robert Pattision did a great job."

","I saw this movie on opening night with my husband, who has never read the books and really had no interest in seeing it. We both enjoyed it a lot. I thought the director did a great job of creating atmosphere, the cinematography was beautiful, the soundtrack was evocative, even the special effects looked pretty cool and believable. Of course it is very talky and obsessive and not a lot actually happens - same as the book! I thought the movie stayed very true to the source material, and enjoyed watching the two leads interact. Stewart pretty much nailed Bella's plainness and clumsy demeanor - Bella is not an emotive character, unless she thinks she is losing Edward (e.g. hospital scene). If you hype anything too much it's going to lose its flavor, but if you go into it with an open mind, you should not be disappointed. A- for artistic rendition."
"Kelsey_mcd","10","1","8","23 November 2008"," All in the Details
","I have been a fan of the Twilight Series way before the production of the Twilight Movie was even announced. I thought the movie was amazing and it is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Now granted the movie didn't contain every single thing in the book, but that's to be expected it's a movie. If the movie followed the book exactly it would probably end up being 4 to 5 hours long. Robert Pattinson did an excellent job as Edward and Kristin Stewart was amazing as well. They both have excellent chemistry together. They brought the love and anguish of Edward and Bella relationship to life. And if the author, Stephanie Meyer was amazed and pleased with the movie and had no problems with it, then why should we? I'm sure that even if the movie followed the book to the T, people would still complain about who was playing the parts because some people are never satisfied. The directors and everyone who worked on the movie did the best they could and put hard work into making it to what the fans would like. And if you're not pleased with the movie because it's not like the book then, you'll know not to watch the sequels. So, keep you're negative comments to yourself please because you're just spoiling this amazing experience for us true twilight fans. In Conclusion, GO SEE THE MOVIE!"
"beth_ross1389","10","1","8","22 November 2008"," Very good for being a movie made from several hundred pages of book
","*SPOILERS* I watched the midnight showing of Twilight on Thursday night, and I was very happy with it. I know that a lot of people complained about how awkward it was between Bella and Edward, but they were pretty awkward through almost the entire book. The awkward parts were hilarious, but that's because it's how love is. It's insanely uncomfortable and awkward, and laughable if you're not the one experiencing it. It was brilliant that as the movie progressed, the chemistry between them got better and they were perfect with each other at the end. It's important to remember that the entire time they were together, Edward wanted to kill her.<br/><br/>I didn't like Carlisle's makeup. It was incredibly obvious and distracting. They could have done better.<br/><br/>Also, there were times when the Cullens were in the sunshine and weren't shimmering. It happened a lot when Edward was in Bella's bedroom.<br/><br/>The movie did move very quick, but did anybody really want to sit through 4 hours of movie? It was condensed very well considering the book is several hundred pages long."
"supermanisever","10","1","8","22 November 2008"," This movie was up to my expectations and beyond!
","This movie stuck religiously to the book in all the parts it could while adapting slightly for screen use. As a major fan of the Twilight Saga I approached this movie with a somewhat open ind but also with some rather high expectations. From the very beginning I was in awe of the imagery of the Pacific Northwest. The portrayal of Renee though she doesn't have a huge amount of screen time is pin point perfect of how I expected Bell's hair brained, erratic mother to be played.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewarts portrayal of the low self esteemed, and yet strongly independent Bella who is a plain Jane sorta girl thrown into an unbelievable circumstances, was spot on perfect. She fell head over heels for Edward fast and yet slow enough that you're not questioning her sanity.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson was someone I was unsure of but when I saw this movie I was left ""Dazzled"" at his performance. Not only did he manage to make me believe her really loved and cared for Bella but he also made me feel his pain on that first day in biology class. Robert allowed me to feel the pain, loneliness and sometimes out right despair at what he was and the monster he thought himself to be.<br/><br/>The Cullens were portrayed beautifully and perfectly. The performances that stand out the most are Peter's Carlisle, Ashley's Alice, Jackson's Jasper and Elizabeth's Esme. Though that's not to say that the rest of the performances aren't stunning for Niki Reed did an amazing job of being mean and hateful towards Bella.<br/><br/>While Mike and the gang reminded me all to well of the immaturity of High school. The actors played their roles well and they made me feel like I was surrounded once more my immature hormone driven teenage boys.<br/><br/>The scenes that stick out the most are the car save, the reveal/meadow scene, when Edward and Bella get out of the car on their first morning at school as an official couple, the meet the family scene, the ballet studio scene, along with the prom.<br/><br/>All in All This movie is one for the record books in my opinion. It was hauntingly beautiful, and a wonderful portrayal of a wonderful book."
"lindsayfinnie","9","1","8","22 November 2008"," Twilight (2008)
","I have been a Twilight reader for well over a year now and when I heard that they were making a movie adaptation I was a little worried. Knowing how hard it would be to find the perfect Edward Cullen and Bella Swan I couldn't see any director or film company being able to do Meyer's story justice. I just saw a screening of the film Twilight and walked away a satisfied fan.<br/><br/>When the film opened and the first ten minutes passed the only thought running through my head was ""oh no, they've destroyed everything,"". Everything went by really fast, it was like the first two chapters on A.D.D and I wasn't having it. It was also very different from the book, and as an avid reader and fan I was ready to walk out.<br/><br/>But please do not fear, it got immensely better. Yes, there were many changes made and Hardwick's indie style was definitely evident but she made it work. I feel she stuck to the book but made the movie her own, it would have been terribly boring if she just took everything word for word, scene for scene. She was spicy and imaginative and I LOVED it.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson is without a doubt the Edward Cullen, argue that if you must. Not only is he amazingly gorgeous and exactly how I pictured Edward physically he was also able to embody everything else Edward is on the inside. I think Pattinson went the right route when he decided to play up Edward's suicidal personality. Edward absolutely hates himself, sees himself as a monster, and Pattinson was able to deliver. I was in tears during the final fight scene when Carlisle had to pull Edward off James and then when he couldn't stop drinking Bella's blood. Leaping forward to book four it was in those moments when I think we got a glimpse of the ""burning man"". Pattinson was dark, seductive, and self loathing and I ate that up.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart, she did okay. After seeing her in interviews I was so worried and disappointed, she seemed too aloof to be able to play Bella. My predictions were somewhat correct. I found Stewart's portrayal lacking in the passion and obsession that dwells in the character of Bella Swan. She played her very strong headed, a real Ms. Independent if you will. There were moments when her facial expressions were just right, like when Edward went in to kiss her for the first time, but other times I just did not feel like this boy had become the centre of her world. I like Kristen, I think she is extremely talented but I could have done with a little less ""I can hold my own"" and a little more ""I am so obsessed with you"".<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was wonderful. I wanted to hug Elizabeth Reaser for playing Esme exactly how she should be played and Nikki Reed had the sass needed to play a convincing Rosalie. Emmet was just wonderfully hilarious, a real big brother and Jasper kind of scared me at times. I liked Ashley Greene, her voice was dead on. Don't even get me started on Billy Burke, he was just fabulous and I loved him as Charlie.<br/><br/>Now although I left the theatre already planning my next trip to see it, there were some things that left me feeling a little deprived. For example, like the beginning of the film, the building of Edward and Bella's relationship was so fast paced it was almost hard for me to feel it at times. I wanted to watch it grow and strengthen, like in the book...instead they clumped a bunch of different conversations into one scene and all the sudden Edward is speaking the ever so famous ""and so the lion fell in love with the lamb,"" I kept repeating, not yet, not yet. Robert and Kristen made up for it though with their wonderful on screen chemistry. Another thing that made me feel a little empty was Bella's lullaby. I had heard it before the movie and didn't like it at all, way too fast and not enough passion. In the movie I still felt that way but what made me even more upset was how it was never mentioned, yes he played it for her...but there was no ""you inspired this one"", no touching moment where Bella cries...for someone who hadn't read the book they wouldn't even know Edward wrote it for her...they'd just be like ""oh he plays the piano...cool"". Bella's lullaby is a monumental part of the story, it carries on through out all of the books and it should not have been shoved to the side the way it was. I found that a lot of the intimate moments between Bella and Edward were taken out, I mean...Bella doesn't even say ""I love you""...never, not once. There were a few times I thought she was going to say it, and then I was disappointed.<br/><br/>So I have managed to make this a novel but I am now coming to an end. When everything is cut up and put out on the table, this was a fantastic adaptation. Yes there were some intimate moments I would have liked to have seen but they weren't deal breakers. I think it was the directing and the casting that made it so wonderful, like I said..Pattinson was perfect. Although there were some changes the movie still stayed true to what the book emulates...wanting and tasting the forbidden fruit. So for those who haven't seen it and are scared to I say to you, just go and see it. It's one of those movies where only you can make the judgment."

","The reason I loved the Twilight movie was because I didn't expect it to be amazing, or just like the book. I quote the screenwriter of the movie, Melissa Rosenberg, ""We're not making Twilight: the book, we're making Twilight: The Movie"". Overall, I thought Robert Pattinson did an extremely awesome job at capturing such a complex character, Kristen Stewart was slightly weak in her performance (but sufficient), and the Cullens were near perfection on the screen. Catherine Hardwicke did the best she could with a smaller budget than most, and the writers managed to fit all of the right lines into the movie, even though they added some pretty cheesy ones as well. Favorite part: the Baseball scene. It was shot, played, and edited beautifully.<br/><br/>So, go see Twilight. Because they've already announced the production of New Moon, and it's pretty much guaranteed to be breath taking."
"devotionxdesire","4","1","14","22 November 2008"," Accept it for what it is.
","I'm an avid fan of the books, and I have to say, the movie wasn't too bad. I didn't go into it with high expectations, because like a lot of people, I was very disappointed by most of the Harry Potter movies. I think this helped. The acting was sort of silly sometimes, but I was amused by it more than annoyed. It has to be hard to put all the thoughts that were in the character's heads into a movie, so they had to make the expressions a little over the top for people to understand. I was actually really happy with the way everything was put together; it was very close to the book. There were some changes, but they were necessary for people who hadn't read the books.<br/><br/>The things I didn't like: the special affects. When the vampires were supposed to be running fast, it looked very choppy and comical. I also really think they did a bad job on Carlise's makeup or something. He looked very strange. Even for a 'vampire'. They also really didn't show the extent of Bella's relationship with Charlie, which is important I think.<br/><br/>Honestly though, the second time I saw it, the things that annoyed me the first time around annoyed me less. It really wasn't too bad and I'm not disappointed."
"hlpops","8","1","14","21 November 2008"," Sexy
","While I agree that this isn't the best movie ever made, it is certainly one of the sexiest (at least where the characters remain clothed). The humor throughout made this an enjoyable/amusing movie. I also appreciate the effort made to stay true to the books. On countless occasions, I have read a book and loved it only to go see the movie and be very disappointed with how far it strays from the book's storyline. It's also very curious that the characters seem to speak, act and look the way I imagined them as I read the book. The effects aren't Matrix-like, however they get the point across. While I don't often read books about vampires and werewolves, I can honestly say that I enjoyed the books more - mostly because I can create my own ""movie"" in my head. If you want a movie with a sexy male character then go see this one - Edward Cullen is one hot vampire!"
"JHardy1990","7","1","14","21 November 2008"," alittle upset...
","Compared to the book this movie is an OK movie to go along with the book. the most disappointing this is that major things in the book, like the fact that Bella cooked every meal for her dad was taken out. Also the ending was not the same as the book. When Bella escaped from Alise and Jasper it was in the Phoenix Airport not the Hotel they staid in. Also Bella went to her house before she went to the studio. Didn't do that in the movie. The fight was i little bit of a ""wtf"" Bella was the one who got thrown into the mirror not Edward. and the bit was between her thumb and her pointer finger not on her wrist <br/><br/>over all it was not a completely horrible movie, it did have its good spots and it did hit the base of the book. it is def a movie i would like to see again and own."

There was just something about that movie that interested me more than the book. All the characters were perfect and I found myself laughing at all the jokes and the funny things that were said. The movie was definitely funnier than the book. I cant wait for New Moon and the others to follow. Congratulations to all the actors, the Director Catherine Hardwicke, and Stephenie Meyer!"

","I was amazed by this film! I have read all the books and loved them. I was worried that the movie would not live up to my expectations, but if Stephenie Meyer (the author of the Twilight saga) approved I had to give it a chance. I was so wrong to ever worry! The movie may not have been exactly like the book, but it was fantastic. I even have to admit that I was a little worried about Robert Pattinson playing Edward because I had such high hopes for what Edward would be like. Again I was wrong. Robert lived up to my expectations and more I fell in love with him from the first time he walked on the screen, I think my heart may had skipped a beat he was amazing. Then there was Kristen Stewart again worried a little because I had high hopes for Bella. Kristen shocked me she played Bella just how she should have been played. Kristen is one of my new favorite actresses. The acting in the movie was fantastic every actor played their part perfectly. I have to say that one of my favorite parts of the movie was when Carlisle Cullen played by Peter Facinelli walked on to the screen for the first time Peter matched just what I thought Carlisle would look like I was absolutely in love. There is some humor in the movie that you might only get if you read the book, like the way he looks at Bella and smiles when another guy is talking to her because he knows what they are thinking. One last thing I would like to add is how much I enjoyed the way Edward sparkled in the meadow it was absolutely amazing and just like I imagined it! This is my favorite movie of all time and I can't wait to watch all of the other movies in the series. I recommend this movie to everyone!"

","I like the scene where the Cullens play baseball, the Cullens' house, the family bond of the Cullens. The music and costumes are good enough.<br/><br/>Bella as a character is very stiff, awkward, and flat. Jacob's character is totally useless. All the characters are underdeveloped, including Bella, her friends, Charlie, the Cullens, the werewolves, the villains. Their backgrounds and motivations are not explored. The Cullens just run fast, pose, and push. The romance between Edward and Bella is forced, and it exists for the sake of the movie.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1) The Cullens are obviously vampires. Common people should have figured it out from their appearance and habit.
2) The people should have been more familiar with vampires. If they could access the internet, books, or tales about vampires, then they were either brainwashed or never read about it.
3) Why Edward wanted Bella so much? What was so special about her? What had she done to Edward or the Cullens? What made her different?
4) Bella's friends were only presented at the beginning with so little background exploration.Bella's friends only introduced their names.Then, the situation was inverted. It was all about the Cullens and Bella's friends were gone. Bella did not even say hi to them when she went to school with Edward.
5) Why James wanted Bella so much that he would risk his life?
6) How did James know about Bella's old ballet studio?
7) Why should Edward suck the venom out of Bella, not Carlisle?
8) How did Carlisle know that Bella's blood was already clean? How did sucking blood would ensure that the venom was sucked out?
9) Bella did not find it disturbing that Edward stalked her.
10) Why could Edward not read Bella's mind?"

","About three things the Twilight producers were absolutely positive. First, Twilight was a vampire tale. Second, there was a part of it that thirsted for teenage blood. And third, adolescent girls were unconditionally and irrevocably in love with it. Indeed, American booksellers have hailed the author of the saga, which runs through four novels, as the new J. K. Rowling - Stephenie Meyer's first instalment selling more than five million copies in the US alone, and thereby helping to fill the void left by the departed Boy Who Lived. The fact that the film version arrives Stateside in what has become the pre-Christmas 'Potter slot' will only boost the comparisons.
The author, who had final cut, thought Hardwicke's first cut a little too steamy, hence the interaction between Bella and Edward becomes even more intimate,
The lead performance too is strong, Panic Room and Into The Wild star Kristen Stewart consistently excellent. She is the vehicle through which audiences are carried on their journey, and her keen intelligence prompts a mature performance.

","Voice texted for maximum error potential:
Yeah I thought there were four movies. Turns out there was one a year for five years. From 2008 to 2012. I suppose they were like OK entertainment. I thought about the author and if she really knew where any of it was going to go or if she just wrote the first book because it was like totally a fantasy of the ultimate high school girl wanting to meet the ultimate bad boy guy who even though he's a bad guy like a godd@mned vampire he's like Totally in love with her more than anything else in the world And he's totally this fabulously good person now that he's with her and he would do absolutely anything for her and protect her and all that. But there's a lot of creepy stuff about the story. Like the guy is 100 years old, even though he looks like he's 17, and she..Is 17. Then there's the whole vampire thing. Like the clan that the main character is in are ""vegetarian"" as they refer to themselves because they only hunt animals and not humans. And they live forever and what's the point. that would suck why the hell would you wanna live forever. And they supposedly have no souls since they are vampires. Which raises the question are they actually who they were before they came to be vampires. Or did their true selves, their souls, actually die when they became vampires. Or should I say when their bodies became vampires. Which makes them all the more useless to be in existence at all. Since all vampires do is kill humans, and in the case of these OK vampires who only kill animals, they still freaking kill! So what is the point. And if it would actually be true that their souls die when they become vampires then that would mean that the main character, Bella, who wants to be a vampire so she can stay with Edward forever, doesn't actually get to stay with Edward at all because she's actually dead even though her soulless vampire body is still living. So overall there's really just nothing good about the whole vampire thing. Even w/ a love story involved."

"filipemanuelneto","3","0","1","25 March 2020"," Is this film the cure for insomnia?
","This film was based on a series of ""best seller"" books about the romance between a vampire and a young human. I never read the books (nor do I intend to) to know what they are like, and I am willing to not talk about them, but if Edward and Bella's love story was supposed to be epic, something didn't work in this film. Despite this, the film was a box office champion, teenagers eagerly consumed it, the studio rubbed their hands in satisfaction and everyone was happy.<br/><br/>The plot is easy to summarize. Isabella Swan is a girl who has just moved in with her father in Forks (curious name), a small town near the Canadian border in Washington state. The city is horrible for a man like me, used to the sun and heat of Southern Europe: almost permanent rain or fog and a humidity capable of growing moss behind my ears. There, she meets friends from the past like Jake, from a native tribe nearby, and meets Edward, a strange schoolmate. Soon it becomes evident that the two feel something strong when they are close and that Edward has something different, visible in his cold skin, eyes that change color, unusual speed and strength ... he is a vampire.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is not that it is aimed at a teen audience, but its bland history and lifeless characters. The way the film was made took away all the involvement, and it unfolds without us feeling connected to what we are seeing. This, for me, is difficult to understand if the source material was good and the premises of the story told are excellent: adolescent and passionate love, supernatural creatures, the problems of adolescence, adaptation difficulties ... there was a lot to work with and good chances of developing a deep and engaging story. Quite frankly! We had stories made with much more fragile premises - Harry Potter is an example - but that gave rise to wonderful books and films. It is something that can only be understood by the imbecility of the director, Catherine Hardwicke (who definitely has no way of making this type of films) and the screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg.<br/><br/>Personally, I think there were also some casting errors that didn't help the film. Kristen Stewart is a weak actress with no presence, or at least she was here, and the same can be said of a dull Robert Pattinson, who seems to be more dead than his character. Both were poor casting choices. Better than them, Taylor Lautner is more intense and palatable, but he couldn't save the film.<br/><br/>For some reason I have only now been able to see this film in its entirety. It was not because I was virtually quarantined at home because of a virus, but simply because I fell asleep deeply in all previous attempts to see it in full. And I'm not even that guy who always falls asleep in front of the TV! It is a boring and dead film, compared to dozens of other teen films that involve the supernatural."

"WallyWaffles","4","0","5","5 December 2019"," Line...?
","This review applies to the entire 5-film Twilight series.<br/><br/>The Twilight novels were written with very poor character development around a very shallow romance, so shallow that it makes the hokey romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala easy to swallow, and the films have been largely faithful to that. Bella Swan, the ""heroine"" of the franchise, was characterized very ambiguously, so ambiguously as to be void of any literary soul, so that any reader could identify herself with Bella, whether she be a squealing 13-year-old girl or a screeching 40-year-old cat lady. ""Oh, Bella breaths oxygen! I can totally relate to this character!""<br/><br/>In reality, the Twilight franchise is nothing but a boring story about a girl who -- never acting, only REACTING -- literally DOES NOTHING but interlope in a world of mopey vampires, with a bit of distraction by angsty werewolves.<br/><br/>Amazingly, Christen Stewart was the perfect casting for Bella Swan, as she has only two facial expressions: Staring vapidly, and blinking with a nervous tick whenever orating.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson seemed alright in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, but in Twilight his performance as an animated corpse is quite stiff, and his just-rolled-out-of-bed hair style made me expect him at any moment to mention ancient aliens. (Cringy food for thought: We'll soon hear Pattinson stammer through lines like, ""I'm the... bat... man."")<br/><br/>As horrible as the Twilight films are, they have two redeeming qualities, earning them a score of ""less than adequate"" instead of ""hot garbage.""<br/><br/>First, there are MUCH WORSE films than this, and it's certainly not the absolutely most inane thing you could be forced to watch. With principle filming having wrapped in 2011, this franchise managed to miss the woke movement and, unlike most of the rubbish coming out of Hollywood today, is thankfully void of political agendaistic lecturing masquerading as ""entertainment"" with the intent of spitting in the eyes of the target consumer base while pandering to the demographic that does not consume the product and wishes only to see the world burn. (Go woke, go broke!)<br/><br/>The second redeeming quality of the Twilight films is that they are unintentionally pure comedy gold! I actually saw New Moon and Eclipse in the theater, on the premiere nights, because my sister got free tickets from work and had an extra ticket, so I went along. I laughed throughout the films as I not-quietly reacted with jokes, and because we were sitting in a theater full of Twihards, between laughs my sister kept elbowing me in the ribs and saying, ""Shut up, these people are going to kill you!"" It was a good time had by all.<br/><br/>For maximum viewing enjoyment -- or to make the Twilight films bearable -- watch them with the RiffTrax commentaries! If I were to rate the Twilight films WITH RiffTrax, they'd be worthy of 11 out of 10 stars; it's that funny.<br/><br/>More bonus Edward ""Batman"" Cullen quotes:
""Come on, Robin, to the... Bat... Cave! There's not a moment to... lose!""
""Quick! To the... Bat... mobile!""
To Joker: ""You killed my... parents... and stuff.""
""This is just the... beginning. If they hit the whole city with... toxin, there's nothing to... stop Gotham tearing itself apart through... mass panic.""
""Batman's just some kind of... symbol."""
"Ascendingsun","Null","0","2","4 December 2019"," The haunting magic of a teen spirit lost in a sensual spell.
","This film is quite sensational, it used to be quite groundbreaking in its time for its reinvention of the genre, in particular the dynamics in the portrayal of romance within such a genre. And you can feel its power, you can imagine and believe in its mythical world this film is building, that's a craft of magic, almost every shot carries a sense of longing, mystery and romance, perfectly capturing adolescent spirit lost in a sensual spell of forbidden and unexplored, while conjuring the haunting wonder and magick of Vampire lore that Bram Stoker imagined in his classic novel - the romance and horror merging together to create the world of mystery and sensuality, from my view he never had in mind to stress out horror, it was a perfect balance of love, sensuality, terror and mystery, and in this saga of films that is indeed masterful, without hyperbole perhaps the best most authentic portrayal of the dynamics of fear and love in a vampire world on screen to this day. Most films or shows about vampires, especially in recent decades have never dared to capture the seductive nature of love and terror in such an equal measure and balanace, the more terrifying the more seductive it is in this franchise, and that's what I feel is what Bram Stoker tried to capture, this real old myth existing in our culture for centuries. As a vampire film, Blood and Roses from 1960 might have made this balance successfully as well.<br/><br/>The film also flows gently like a wind touching the mystical and unreal. Truly beautiful and powerful example of a moving cinema at its best. Also it has to be said, this is among Pattinson's very best performances to me, the role he was born to do, fully based on subtlety and understatement, playing with the mastery of body language to a very good effect, it is true that he was never as good as in this series, which has a lot to do with the character he was given too, although he's been a very good actor since then. The impact on pop culture and cinema is very rare to happen, and there is indeed a reason it has gained such a huge following worldwide.<br/><br/>The pop culture landmark film that appear once in a while, the same like Wild One, To Have And Have Not, Saturday Night Fever, Easy Rider, 9¬Ω Weeks, Dirty Dancing, Pretty Woman, Clueless and Meet Joe Black, these films manage to target a specific audience, the right kind of cult audience it is either intended for, or who find themselves at its highest vibrational alignment with such films, I feel these are always the people that are the most conducive ambassadors of their quality and value, to provide a passageway towards their highest artistic potential for a human being. For every film does have a perfectly resonating target audience that can penetrate into its essence and throroughly evaluate it as it deserves to be, and perhaps the more perceptive or open minded individuals can find attunement or feel into such individuals, to find resonance with them first, to feel what they feel, before experiencing the same resonance with those films. Follow your heart, and you'll find pleasure out of every art, every song or film you encounter, for you become their highest energetic counterpart."

wilight is a very slow movie. It does a lot of world building and establishes the main characters of the saga, I understand that. I never read the books by Stephanie Meyer and I guess there are probably more dialogues in the book and Bella expressing her feelings in her thoughts. Just some things that are hard to transfer into a movie.<br/><br/>What makes the film even slower than it is, are the long but slow dialogues. I don't think they work very well. At least I couldn't really feel the attraction between them, all I saw were some teenagers awkwardly trying to talk to each other. The special effects are ok but I think that - especially in the ending scene - they could have polished the effects a little bit more. The casting is good. The one that in my opinion fits most into his role is Carlisle Cullen.<br/><br/>Twilight is a set-up movie for this world and in that regard it does well.

","Twilight is a phenomenon, whether you believe it or not. The saga enjoys a loyal fandom and I have known people who are ardent lovers of the books and the movies. My review, however, is rational and based solely on the movie; I haven't read the books.<br/><br/>Twilight is a simple, straightforward story of a girl who falls in love with a vampire and the consequences that follow such an affair. There isn't much in the movie that you haven't seen/heard/read before. The story does not even justify whatever few myths surrounding the vampires are portrayed in it.<br/><br/>Performances: Edward and Bella, the lead pair of the movie are, sadly, the weakest performers. The rest of the cast is not up to the mark but they are surely better than the lead pair. The cheesy dialogues between the lead pair might annoy you after a few minutes into the movie. The vampire family's behavior towards their son's human girlfriend is quite shallow considering they are the most feared family in town.<br/><br/>Atmosphere: The makers have surely not taken much pain over creating an enigmatic, dark and terrifying atmosphere. The scenic beauty, however little, shown in the movie is unsatisfying. The only pleasing entity in the movie is Edward Cullen's bedroom, which might make you want to have such a room for yourself.<br/><br/>Overall verdict: Twilight is a movie that doesn't need much attention while watching so one could put on the movie and very well do some other work while it runs in the background. Surely not a movie that you might want to watch over and over again."

Bella doesn't know that Edward is a vampire in the begin of the film, but she starts noticing strange things about him. When Edward finally tells his secret, Bella gets to know the family of Edward. All the family members were bitten by other vampires with their fangs. They bit other people to suck their blood and the victims became also immortal. She discovers how it is how to live like a vampire and how the whole family became a vampire. It is science fiction but when you're watching, you won't notice that the story isn't true. Vampires occur in folktales and the author tells that on a very creative way for teenagers. Bella has to choose between herself and Edward because she is in danger if she stays with him, so it is a film with a lot of action and romance. Also Edward becomes in a conflict with himself because he doesn't want Bella to be in danger but he also don't want to lose her so he has to make a choice, that creates exciting scenes. A negative comment on the movie is the end, because it has no end! Happily, there are 4 films to go yet until the end.

The Good: Extreme Longshots of Pacific Northwest; Anna Kendrick's astute critiques of the story itself; the unexpected fits of laughter I had with my daughter at emotionally dislocated scenes (we laugh/cried when Jacob & Bella's dad's ""goofed around"" in the background. Who pokes a guy in a wheelchair?). The Bad: the costumes, the hair, the lack of humor, Edward's complete lack of confidence, and the Cullens in general. Ugh.<br/><br/>There is no way to defend the series as a literary triumph, but they were absolutely fun to read. The film was not fun to watch. I felt sorry for the director who had to stick to the author's color palette, which has the visual dynamism of mop water, and contact lenses that actually made the vampires look like aliens. Instead of being the shrewd students of human anatomy, physiology, & psychology, the Cullens are conspicuous outsiders.I mean, a doctor in the hospital with winter- white painted skin and yellow eyes--in florescent lighting--would be hard to blend in. Are you sick, doctor? <br/><br/>Here's the solution: regard the Cullens as aliens, not vampires. It makes a little more sense."

","After watching twilight I must say that the movie itself was horrible. First of all the love story, I get now why people say ""still a better love story then Twilight"". It was literally the worst I've seen because the vampire got the girl by being strange and because he's a vampire but he did latterly no effort and just stalked her. And the biggest anticlimax at the end of the movie where he didn't bite her and they didn't even kiss. Then besides the love story there are happening things, but they aren't part of anything until needed later and that's why the movie became very predictable but still not boring. Their rules of vampires are weird too. If they can stand sunlight, are immortal, kill animals for food (which humans already do), get one superpower, etc. Then why in the world doesn't everyone become a vampire?! The problem of aging cured, you don't waste time sleeping, the problem of killing humans for their blood is gone if everyone is a vampire, etc. I don't get it, if they have no weaknesses or something then why must they hide from humans? And after all of this said, I must say that I want to see the next movie... The story grew on me while watching the movie, like Edward would say I shouldn't but I'm unconditionally and irrevocably hooked to this storyline. It's just that I didn't like the movie itself but like Edward it's storyline and the big plot holes with other vampires, turning into one, the war with the wolves, etc. these mysteries need answers. So I guess I know what I'm doing this weekend"

","the film is really awesome, the whole story line is based girl called Bella who goes to new school, but she can see things before it's she sees them. it's all about how Bella gets on with school. She meets Edward he is vampire, then there is Edward family which is called the Cullen's the movie is really brilliant you have to see it for yourself, I love it. it's best thing that's ever happened to me."
"smileyyanny97","6","0","1","16 March 2017"," Pretty Decent
","When I first saw Twilight I was around eleven or twelve, and I loved it and didn't see what everyone else has problems with. Now that I'm 19, I'm a lot less in love with it however I still find it enjoyable despite it's issues.<br/><br/>For starters the cinematography is one of my favorite aspects of this film. The way it depicts each location is very well thought through, I especially like how there is this grayish blue tint to everything up in Washington state.<br/><br/>The fashion is also nicely done. The teenagers aren't dressed too trashy and more like how actual teenagers back in the late 2000s dressed. The more high class Cullens aren't dipped head to toe in obvious glam, but more understated while still looking more on the wealthy side. The nomads are dressed in a way that makes sense. A mixture of stuff that looks like it was taken from both poor and rich people; their outfits are very ""a piece from here and a piece from there"" which works given their status as not powerful but still frightening. The makeup is also not too heavy but not too light. The visual aspects of the film are all pretty great. It's a good looking movie. <br/><br/>Another good thing is that the scripts isn't bad, it's not an exceptionally great script but it's decent given that, as someone whose read all the books, the dialogue in the books was semi-awkward (nothing compared to it's adult-centered failure ""Fifty Shades of Grey"") and that's toned down a bit in the film even though the deliveries can get either so HAM it's hilarious or so bland that you have to wonder are the actors even interested.<br/><br/>Speaking of the actor's, that's what's all over the place. Kristen Stewart's acting in this film is notorious for her glazed over expressions, excessive breathing, and overuse of a monotone voice. In the books, Bella wasn't the most charismatic person however she did have personality. Kristen Stewart doesn't do a great job of portraying her more. I feel like if she had better direction or researched further then she could have been a lot better and more well received.<br/><br/>Another actor is Robert Pattinson. He shined a lot as Cedric Diggery in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" but here, he's almost as awkward as Kristen Stewart. He's better at conveying emotions here but that's about the only difference. In the books Edward was a bit on the bland side but not to this extreme. Again, I feel as if the director tried their hardest to make the two leads as unremarkable as possible.<br/><br/>The other actor's vary. Anna Kendrick is HAMist of HAMs at some points but it has that Hermione in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" effect. It's delightful in that goofy way. Christian Serratos portrays Jessica as a fine side character, Justin Chon as Eric is good comedic relief, Michael Welch as Mike works with what he's got as the person whose affections for Bella goes unnoticed, Gregory Boyce as Tyler is also pretty fun. The Cullens all work pretty well and their acting is a lot more put together than most. The best is probably Peter Facinelli as Carlisle and Nikki Reed as Rosalie. Carlisle like Charlie is a funny, and calm yet worried father but he's a lot more collected and less hang-wired than Charlie. Rosalie is Edward's very worried ""adopted"" older sister who holds resentment to Bella for reasons I won't say because of spoilers. Alice is a wonderful lighthearted character and Ashley Greene does well with the character.<br/><br/>The actors as the Nomads were pretty fantastic. James is actually scary I legit still find Victoria pretty threatening. Edi Gathegi does a great job as the calm but feared Laurant.<br/><br/>Props to Billy Burke whose excellent as Charlie Swan and does a good job at being both a funny and calm yet worried father.<br/><br/>One thing I find is most overlooked in all Twilight movies is the music, the score and soundtrack are both great and do good jobs setting the moods for the movie. I highly recommend a checking out. Every song from the opening song to the closing song- they're all stellar and perfect on their own.<br/><br/>But the major issue with Twilight are the acting of the two leads and the fact that the romance is so jaded. You really don't understand what Bella sees in Edward other than the fact that he's a well, vampire. That's pretty much it. That don't share any real connection beyond something that most people would consider at a platonic level. It's just not that well progressed and would need a lot more work put into it beyond ""You're human, I'm a vampire, our love is forbidden but I don't care because you're so mysterious."" That doesn't equate to love and for a lot of people, this spoiled the movie and the main reason why Twilight has a lot of anti-fans. It's not just with the films, in the books it's also not that well drawn and overall just falls flat as a romance.<br/><br/>The target audience for them film, while it is PG-13, is mostly for people between 11-15 and it works. It's visually pleasing and still able to get by those who have a very impressionable and idealistic views on love and most between 11-15 do have impressionable and idealistic views on love. It also works for the parents to an extent because it's one of those PG-13 films that you wont feel bad for showing an eleven or twelve year old if you're really hung on ratings.<br/><br/>So overall, while I enjoy ""Twilight"" I doc it marks just for the fact that the romance is a big part of the story but not explored beyond the surface."
"acegoldring","4","0","2","6 October 2016"," Not terrible, but not too hard to watch
","Haven't read the books and have very little knowledge on the Twilight Saga, so this review is unbiased but possibly a bit uneducated.<br/><br/>I understand where the hype comes from - this film is perfect for young teenagers who enjoy romance and the paranormal. Twilight is surprisingly catchy and has some interesting concepts, but lacks a lot. <br/><br/>I think that the main issue is the writing. Nearly all of the interactions between Edward and Bella were awkward and almost cringe-worthy - and there's a lot of generic stuff to try and flesh Edward out as the mysterious, brooding teen. I guess that's acceptable given the fact that this is for teens, but as a teenager myself I found it irritating after a while. We get it, you're a troubled soul.The movie was mostly just a huge service to young people who just want to see vampire romance and don't care too much about the quality. <br/><br/>Pretty much every character lacked depth, and were often just there to pad out the movie or to give some exposition. Even worse, most of the exposition given was through internet searches (the absolute laziest way to inform an audience). There were TWO scenes in which Bella just googled things. It could've been much more subtle.<br/><br/>Something I did enjoy was the cinematography. This is a good looking film and has some beautiful settings. The editing, however, was often quite amateur. The 'fade to white' effect was used a few times and felt very Windows Movie Maker-esque. That may be nit-picky of me but I did feel like some of the over-editing really brought me out of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie isn't awful. It's certainly not good, but I could definitely sit through it. It is definitely a different concept and actually does get quite interesting, but it's just poorly written."
"morrison-dylan-fan","7","0","2","3 December 2015"," The Twilight saga:Chapter 1.
","Despite having heard from friends about the adaptations of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight books for years,I have never got round to taking a look at the ""saga."" With Christmas coming up,I decided to buy a box set of the titles,and finally open the first chapter of Twilight.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>With her mum Ren√©e travelling with her new husband, Bella Swan goes to live with her dad Charlie.As Charlie tries to make up for lost time with his daughter,Bella goes to a new high school.Whilst having lunch with a fellow student,Bella spots a strange looking group of students walking around,who she is told are related to the Cullen family,who were a historically powerful family in the area.<br/><br/>Walking at a slight distance from his family,Bella is left breathless by the sight of Edward Cullen.Trying to get his attention,Bella grows increasingly frustrated at Edward giving her the cold shoulder.Chatting to a pal a few days later in the school parking lot (which Edward is standing on the opposite side of),a driver loses control of a van and starts to drive towards Bella. Appearing from out of thin air,Edward stops the van from hitting Bella with one hand.As she catches her breath,Bella begins to suspect that Edward has a hidden secret.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>For the Washington state setting of the novel,director Catherine Hardwicke & cinematographer bathe the film in a light blue tint,which along with giving the title an icy rural atmosphere also cleverly matches the cold skin of the Cullen family.Whilst some drops of blood drip on the screen, Hardwicke keeps her sights set on keeping the horror trim and allowing the romance to flow,as close circling tracking shots surround Edward & Bella's growing love in lush green countryside.<br/><br/>Although the lack of a smile and a downcast gaze make her look like a member of the Cullen family, Kristen Stewart (known for her famous smile!) gives a good performance as Bella,with Stewart giving Bella a charming warmth towards her dad, (played by a terrific Billy Burke)and also making Bella's love for a vampire being pure innocence,rather than na√Øve daydreaming.Joined by sharp-toothed fellow vamps Ashley Greene & Peter Facinelli,Robert Pattinson gives a great performance as Edward Cullen,thanks to Pattinson keeping the dark brooding romantic figure burning,whilst giving Edward an unexpected playfulness with his fangs,as the first chapter in the Twilight saga closes."

"brchthethird","6","0","4","13 November 2014"," Cheesy, but watchable
","For a cheesy teen romance, this wasn't too bad. The style isn't too overbearing, nor is it too spectacular, but at least there wasn't an air of pretension about it. However, the style is definitely what the movie has going for it, because the story is rather ordinary and doesn't take too many risks. It can go without saying that most of the acting is wooden and that the leads don't have too much chemistry in the traditional sense, but the teenage awkwardness that is very much a part of the story lends it a sort-of authenticity that it never really is a chore to watch. It's unexceptional, but serviceable. Digging deeper into the plot, it is rather hard to accept that a teenager, presumably without a firm grasp on true love, would fall so hard for somebody she just met, but again, it passes by on the viewer without much event. There's also something inherently creepy in a lot of the implications of their relationship. Edward is a forever-17-year-old who is romantically involved with Bella, who really is her age (16 or 17, maybe?). I could enumerate some more plot oddities, like how Bella figures out who Edward is through internet research, but all of the complaints one could make can be attributed to one thing, which is the single biggest flaw here: the source material. Stephenie Meyer has such an immature view on love, sexuality and relationships and one that is also old-fashioned to a fault. Bella's greatest aspiration is to have a man, and they have to wait to consummate their relationship. The characters are also not written that well either. Bella is simultaneously dumb (by her own admission), yet is somehow perceptive enough to get a good psychological read on someone. Every character quirk doesn't seem to be natural, and instead is just necessary for the plot. That being said, the movie is somewhat interesting to watch for how much of a train-wreck the script is. And for readers of the books, probably mostly just teenage girls and their moms, the movie works just fine as a fantasy. One thing I did think was done well was the subtle hinting at the vampire-werewolf tension to come. Another thing I think wasn't done so well was the special effects, which weren't too believable. That, however, is a minor quibble when compared to the enormous problems inherent to the book which this is based on. Still, I was never bored watching this and, even though I didn't particularly get into it the way a fan of the books would have, it was relatively un-offensive and (dare I say) I enjoyed it a little bit. It's not a good movie, per se, but it did have a certain charm to it."

","Okay, I do not understand the following that this series gets. It is very slow to develop film, Kristen Stewart is so so as an actress and attractiveness. The whole movie revolves around her attraction to Edward who turns out to be a vampire. Fangless, no reflection in a mirror, and can survive in sunlight. Not the typical vampire scenarios. Turns out Edwards ""family"" are vampire vegans. They suck blood from animals and not humans. Of course there are those that don't and the Cullen's fight them. Some of the local Indians turn out to be werewolves. They only hunt vampires and not humans but only when they break the treaty. Definitely not the stereotypical werewolf lore. I do like the dad sheriff, he does his role extremely well. There are family under currents that are interesting. Watchable one time but no more than that."
"justimagine93","6","0","2","6 December 2013"," Read The Book
","This movie and all of the movies after it is like a gigantic slide show. There are no real details to care about unless you read the books. All of the things that are talked about about this movie, such as overly popular Bella, a 100 year old virgin, a cheesy teen romance...The book is in the point of view of a young teenage girl that discovers that her world is crawling with the creatures and legends that no one thought existed. Twilight the book is excellent because of its syntax, diction, and allusion. (A person would not appreciate this book if they hate lovey dovey romances, teenage moods, and vampires that are into talking not biting or if they are male) Knowing the story, this movie is a very bad interpretation. This movie translated a smart, responsible, and an often selfish girl into a mindless emo chick. The vampires are fairy like and look just fail in the movie. (I mean why would you make a supposedly terrifying male vampire sparkle and make sparkle noises!) The book makes Edward very alluring and he actually resembles a Greek statue. It may sound far fetched, but the vampires in the books were a lot more terrifying than the ones in the movies. To put this in another way: Twilight the book is like a tub of ice cream and the movie is like one single dippin dot."

But there are some weaknesses that make me withhold my ratings vote for the moment (for some further reflection).

"bungeeman17","6","0","3","26 April 2012"," Not As Bad As Many Would Have You Believe
","I guess I should start by saying that almost everyone I know ridicules the 'Twilight' series. Those few people I've met who like it are so fanatically obsessive towards it that I sometimes have to remind myself that it isn't a religious cult. Anyway, I decided that before I join in with either side of the debate I should give it a 'fair crack of the whip'. In all honesty, I was expecting it to be awful. However I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I think it is important to note that I'm not what many would consider to be the demographic towards which this movie aims. I'm a British, adult male and I'd imagine that the stereotypical twilight fan is perceived as being an American teen-girl. After all, the protagonist is just that and I certainly can't relate to what it must be like to be a teenager in an American high-school.<br/><br/>The first thing that surprised me about Twilight was the acting, which was pretty good. Kristen Stewart seems to have garnered a reputation for being a somewhat wooden and emotionless actress. I haven't seen the other movies in the series but I felt that she really owned the role of Bella. Rather than play an annoying and eccentric teenager, she opted to put forward a very realistic response, that of a normal girl in an abnormal situation. This was a brave choice on her part considering the reaction of humanity to vampires in most popular media. Of course, she was bound by the script, but she could have over-played it and she didn't. Unfortunately, some of the supporting cast seemed a little too stereotypical and this lack of chemistry ruined some of the scenes, but it wasn't bad enough to ruin the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Some of the characters seemed a little silly. I'm not too sure if this is the case in the books because I haven't read them, but some of the dialogue was quite inane and it made the characters seem a little one-dimensional. Fortunately, the core of the cast was interesting enough for me to be able to get past this.<br/><br/>The sound-track for the film seemed well chosen. The score fits the scenes well and is diverse enough to add a real sense of emotion when it's needed. The director made some pretty good use of light and dark, particularly in the forest sequences and the fights were well choreographed and quite exciting.<br/><br/>At times the plot was a little too predictable and often it felt quite contrived. This did make it hard to feel any real sense of suspense but the charmingly unusual nature of the concept which drives the film, that is, a family of benevolent vampires living in a small town, was enough for this to become bearable.<br/><br/>To summarise, this movie is certainly not the masterpiece that the hard-core fans make it out to be, but it is definitely worth an evening in front of the T.V if you're feeling a little bored. It has led me to wonder just how many of its detractors have actually bothered to check it out."

I personally don't like the first two actors and I just pictured James to be a bit more evil.<br/><br/>I like the twists on the movie that were not in the book, except why does Bella have to be all health conscious.

Robert looks like if he is sick at times and Kristen lacks emotion and has awkward gestures that quickly blacklist them as bad actors.<br/><br/>The script and plot are good however the movie is so slow at the beginning, it is easy to lose interest.

","Honestly the only thing wrong with this movie was the choice of actors. At first when I heard that Robert Pattinson was going to play Edward i was like ""Oh my gosh cool!"" But he really can't pull of the hot vampire role. I mean the ""intense stares"" he's supposed to do every five minutes is kind of creepy, I mean he looks like a stalker. And Kirsten Stewart (Bella) is not the best choice for acting at all. She can't convey emotions well and every time she says something she sounds confused and surprised. And then when she's supposed to be surprised or scared she ends up looking like a robot. And the relationship between Edward and Bella seem controlling and forced. Like every time Edward shows affection for Bella, a thousand needles are stabbing him in the back. The book was great but the movie was terrible."
"hnt_dnl","5","0","2","27 May 2011"," Huh...you know, it's not as bad as I thought!
","OK, so I'm trying to be very OBJECTIVE for this review of TWILIGHT (2008). It's difficult because I literally heard every bad thing possible about this movie, the actors, and the series BEFORE I actually got a chance to see for myself! I've seen youtube clips mocking it in the form of parodies and riffing and everyone under the sun trashing it. YET, amidst all the bashing, there are still a LOT of fans of this franchise!<br/><br/>I first saw the IMDb rating recently and...5.5?! For such a big movie that is this popular and such of a moneymaker, I thought 5.5 is a stunningly low rating! TRANSFORMERS is at 7.2, but that movie is a formulaic summer blockbuster with noise, splosions, and awful dialogue, all courtesy of the ""great"" Michael Bay! I like to make my own informed decisions. Frankly, IMDb is not the most reliable source for what are the best movies (the irony!). I just can't rationalize why manipulative crap like THE DARK KNIGHT is at 8.9, while movies that I KNOW are good like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is lingering at 6.9! <br/><br/>I think I know the reason why TWILIGHT is so low at 5.5. The main plot that drives the film, the ""Romeo-Juliet"" teen romance, is the weakest point of the movie! With corny dialogue overemphasis on angst, it really is a movie FOR teen girls. It just doesn't have the mass appeal of a typical summer action movie does. Yet it's a hugely popular series. And I guess that speaks to the power of teen girls! Now, having seen the sequels, especially ECLIPSE there's actually some stuff in there for the boys, too.<br/><br/>Back to TWILIGHT. Now, THE main problem with the movie (and series, frankly) is a doozy...the central character Bella Swan is truly the MOST boring character! I think that Bella is supposed to be this shy, lonely teenager, which actually makes sense that she'd fit in with the vampire crowd, but I don't know if it's casting, writing, or both, but Kristen Stewart just acts very poorly. Bella is literally a one-note character. She oddly seems soulless. It's hard to believe she has any friends (she actually has a significant number in this!) or would inspire a vampire to violate his coven's code! I mean, I just think Stewart's acting is too lazy. I felt like the character should have some signs of defiance and spunk in her, but she just reacts to everything around her. I just don't get why everyone is so enamored of her. Now, I know Stewart is a good actress because I've seen her do great work in OTHER movies! Maybe she wasn't prepared to carry a franchise like this one.<br/><br/>I had to watch this movie a couple of times to really make an informed decision about the plusses, but there are some things that I think are done fairly well: <br/><br/>*Robert Pattinson is well-cast as Edward Cullen. I think people over-focus on the mumbling vampire side of Edward (which makes sense as he's probably never tried to connect to any human in 100 years!), but what I think people overlook is that Pattinson does an amazing job with the American accent. Not just that, he really has the ""teen"" thing going, too. He has moments where he's very convincing as a typical 17-year old American male (he was 22 when this film came out) and that couldn't have been easy to pull off for a semi-adult distinguished Brit! I found myself enjoying Edward's ""teen"" moments much more than his vampire ones. And in terms of the vampire part, I blame that squarely on Stewart and her underacting as Bella! I mean, Pattinson must have had a difficult time trying to pull any kind of emotion acting off of such a bland character! I think Pattinson gets a bad rap.<br/><br/>*The Cullen vampire clan! I really enjoyed this family in the movie, what little screen time they had. Honestly, they may have been cast for their looks, but the actors Peter Facinelli (as family head Dr. Carlisle Cullen), Elizabeth Reaser (as Carlisle's wife Esme), Nikki Reed (Rosalie), Ashley Greene (Alice), Jackson Rathbone (Jasper), and Kellan Lutz (Emmett) do a great job with what little they have to work with, all I think getting at the heart of the characters that novelist Stephanie Wright had in mind. Frankly, I wish this family were fleshed out a bit more in this movie, rather than the Edward-Bella romance being such a huge focus. My favorite scene is when Edward introduces Bella to the Cullens and Edward's embarrassed reactions to his family's ""vampiric awkwardness"" was very funny. I really liked how they didn't overdo ""the vampire look"" of the Cullens in the movie, pale, but not too pale with dark brown eyes to relay to the audience that they were all just a bit ""different"" from everyone else.<br/><br/>*Some of the dialogue is actually pretty self-deprecating and funny, taking advantage of common vampire myths and kind of slamming the door on them!<br/><br/>*The story itself is OK I think. Bella-Edward have to establish a connection first, the Cullens have be established as earnest and not bloodthirsty vamps and have to slowly accept Bella into the fold and Edward's love for her, Bella has to hide all this from her human friends and her Dad Charlie (played well by Billy Burke).<br/><br/>Again, the elephant in the room is the tepid romance of Bella and Edward. I feel like it's very forced and hard to believe. Much of their dialogue and interaction is oddly stale so it forces the viewer to take at face value that there is just this strong unbreakable bond between them. Pattinson somehow rises above it to make Edward real...Stewart doesn't for Bella. And one half of a whole ain't good enough!"

","The features in the series reminded me of love-and-war type stories geared to those with a mature taste. The background notes with these suggest that the original novels have a large following among teens, if so they might be teens with a mature taste in reading if the tone of the novels is anything like the features? <br/><br/>First viewing, I found the first story, Twilight, to have an immediacy that I usually associate with low brow stuff. The next two as more demanding. The first feature had me wanting to read the novels and the next two made me more cautious; read them, maybe, but no great urgency. <br/><br/>I had discovered these features as a follow-on to Push (2009). I felt a need to know more of Dakota's later works and she has a small part in Twilight features 2 to 5. Other Dakota that I purchased included Bees and Charlotte's Web and while those have charm I also experience them as for those with a mature taste, not low brow. Even Charlotte. Coraline, now that is different. <br/><br/>I purchased the first three Twilight in the UK Blu ray version as there were second hand copies available at a nearly affordable price. I ended up by getting the final two in Blu-ray as well, but I waited for the second hand prices to drop. <br/><br/>So, I find the first story to be an effective lure to follow the rest. <br/><br/>I personally find New Moon to have an enhanced lure due to Dakota, though she does not have what I personally experience as a romantic role. An unromantic picture of her is included on my New Moon Blu ray cover. <br/><br/>I personally find Eclipse to have an enhanced lure due to Jodelle, though she does not have what I personally experience as a romantic role. An unromantic picture of her is included on my Eclipse Blu ray cover. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>The love and war has an sf setting of monsters and people and then more monsters. I prefer not to look into any real world aspects of that as I would then need to side with the vampires but, surprise, surprise, in this story they are sometimes bad guys. In my own world view I prefer to consider our rottenness as mostly a result of wolf pack attacks. That is not the view of this particular set of stories, though the question is raised re what turns people into wolves. What turns people into vampires, this story is just one of many that I tend to consider to be too simplistic. Aliens In The Attic is different and is pleasantly low brow, there is even Ashley Tisdale in a sparkle motion role. <br/><br/>The location is a different matter. This is the north western Rockies. The story is set in a very real part of that area, latitude circa central France, and the visuals are made by filming in other parts. Plenty of amazing scenery, but what is the real area around Forks like? For me this is a lure to armchair tourism and I found that the internet and low cost DVDs helped. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>I noticed one comment on Twilight that explained the appeal to some as pornography targeted at females. I totally could not agree with that. So, I am male to female, but I was starting to get to know more KS features and then I noticed that the cast includes Christian Serratos as Angela. A few months later, when I watched 1 to 3 again I found that I was noticing Bella and Angela a lot, the features took off and purred. I decided that I needed the Blu-ray of part 4. <br/><br/>I find part 4 to be as good as the first story. I had to wait a longish time for the disk to get to close to My Price, but I found it worth the wait. I found part 5 to be even better. <br/><br/>I consider the series to be under rated."

","I am not here to bash Twilight because its for teen girls. I am here to write a review on a movie that should have been better. So I finally decided to see what was all the fuss about this movie. People either love it or hate it. Some people take offense that this movie exist and some people take offense to anyone doing anything but praising this movie. Well.. I am sorry but I will offend you.<br/><br/>I think this movie was missing some true direction and the editing was really bad because the movie made some questionable leaps as if middle part of the movie was missing. There other people in the movie might as well not exist. They were basically treated as if they were an inanimate chair, which wouldn't have been bad if the leads did more than just stare. The script is horrendous. The part when she figures out that he is a vampire and they are in the woods and he just tells her to ""just say it"". Seriously? That's the biggest dramatic moment in the movie. I really couldn't tell the difference between the guy that played Edward and one of the trees in the forest. He was that wooden. They almost had a good story there with the vampires that do like to hunt humans, but they just didn't really do anything with it. And the supposedly climatic fight between the two vampires was pretty dull and it was over really quickly. The movie felt really long and really short at the same time. It didn't seem romantic at all, well maybe a little but that what its main thing suppose to be, romance. The love between the two advance so fast that if felt like a victim and her stalker. It advance with any reason what so ever and that was missing from this film. But, the movie isn't for me. I am not the movie's target audience, but I just thought it was poorly directed. The director should have required better performance out of her actors/actresses."

","Am I one of 2 people in the entire world that thinks Kristen Stewart can't act? I must admit The 1st chapter in this movie saga seemed like it was off to a good start even though it was riddled with flaws and slow paced. There was Jacob the werewolf and Cam as the evil vampire (why was he shirtless again?). The vampires had unique special powers which I thought was an interesting take. I like that these vampires live in a glass house or was it a green house? Hmm. Sparkling vampires, oh yes that made a whole lot of sense. I expected a bit more action before the credits but obviously this movie was for teenage girls. Overall though it was watchable especially if you had nothing better to do."

","Vampire based movies and TV shows were popping up everywhere when this film based on the popular series of books was released, but afterwards it has had mixed reviews, so I had to see why, from director Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen, Lords of Dogtown). Basicaly Isabella 'Bella' Swan (Panic Room's Kristen Stewart) is moving with her father Charlie (Billy Burke) from Phoenix, Arizona to the quiet and gloomy Forks, Washington, and she didn't expect much to change. That is until she starts the new term at high school, and after getting to know a few of the other students, she sees and is interested in meeting the mysterious but good looking Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). He and his family share a dark secret, and when he falls in love with Bella, Edward feels comfortable to reveal it to her, and she promises to keep it. It is of course that he and the whole family are vampires, but she is not afraid of the fact that he has a thirst for blood, obviously not for her, and the rest of the family get used to her to. It is in fact the opposing vampires that she is to be afraid of, as they find it a challenge to try and catch Bella and feed off her, she is severely injured near the end, but Edward saves her and they attend the prom. Also starring Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, Peter Facinelli as Dr. Carlisle Cullen, Elizabeth Reaser as Esme Cullen, Nikki Reed as Rosalie Hale, Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Jackson Rathbone as Jasper and Kellan Lutz as Emmet Cullen. Stewart is reasonably attractive and alright, Pattinson is okay too, they do have good chemistry, and though he isn't on screen as long in this first film Lautner is supposedly the pinup for young girls. As for the film itself, there are some okay moments of scary movie based stuff, the dark love story has some alright dangerous moments, I think this appeals much more to easily impressed teenagers and girls, but it's not a bad romantic horror fantasy. Worth watching, at least once, in my opinion!"
"KasinathCR","6","0","2","3 November 2010"," Wasn't that bad
","Firstly to say is that I didn't read any of the Twilight novels, so I just can't compare this movie to the book and secondly I just saw this movie for the hype my friends gave regarding the Twilight novels and to be frank, this movie just made me glued to the screen till its running time so am not going to write anything negative regarding this movie as I didn't still read the novel yet.<br/><br/>I believe Stephanie Meyer took an easy path in to writing a romantic novel because romantic novels always appeal to lot of people. But the description given for each romantic scene and the chemistry appealed well to me. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart had a very good screen time together(Can't say the same with their performances as both are very young actors but they looked good as the lead couple in the movie).<br/><br/>Carter Burke did a fine Job as Kirsten Stewart's dad and he gave a pretty decent performance compared to the lead actors. The plot was nothing extra-ordinary. It was a Fantasy-Romance type but the fantasy was kept subtle as possible to make way for a more romantic movie as the novel promised I believe.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner didn't have much screen time but kept as just another actor in this movie. Seeing this movie made me feel like not all vampires are blood-thirsty repulsive hideous type. There are some super-cool ones like the Cullens too. <br/><br/>The story is that Bella Swan(Kirsten Stewart) comes to Forks to live with her divorced dad Charlie Swan(Carter Burke) after her mom decides to travel with her newly married husband Phil who is a baseball pro. Like all the college movies you would've seen the new guy gets a bunch of friends who'll come and go now and then. This one isn't so different either.<br/><br/>One day Bella sees the Cullens, a weird gang in her high school. First thing she sets sight on Edward Cullen(Robert Pattinson), Its love all the way. Cullens are vampires but they don't have that thirst for human blood like most vampires do and so they live peacefully among the people at Forks. Edward also gets drawn to Bella by many-a-coincidences and both of them fall Head-over-heels in love with each other with romantic dialogues thrown here and there in good measure(Hats off! Stephanie Meyer. They were totally awesome!). <br/><br/>In between all this romance, there was a thriller waiting to unfold as 3 vampires Laurent(Edi Gathegi), James(Cam Gigandet) and Victoria(Rachelle Lefevre) hunt people for their blood thirst and Police investigation goes on like some animal is killing people at Forks. Bella and Edward get very close and Edward even takes her to introduce to the other members of his Vampire family.<br/><br/>The Cullens and Bella get along well and one fateful day the paths of Cullens and those 3 vampires cross due to one vampire, James, drawn to the scent of Bella swan and he'll stop at nothing to have his snack a.k.a Bella Swan. After this comes a climax where Bella and Edward get separated due to the intensity of the situation and the Cullens make some plans to distract James but James was too smart for them and gets to Bella.<br/><br/>The Hero, Edward Cullen finally comes to the rescue of Bella(as predictable as always) and saves her after she gets bitten by James by sucking the Venom out of her. Though Edward gets a chance to change Bella in to a Vampire, he remains controlled and restores her normalcy. James gets killed by the Cullens adding to the sorrow of Victoria who vows to take on the Cullens later in the name of James. End of the story.<br/><br/>So I'll recommend this movie for all those who all are too lazy to read novels but can enjoy hours and hours of time in front of a TV or PC. In the end you'll say, ""It wasn't that bad!"".<br/><br/>My Verdict- Twilight 6.5/10"
"MattCScicluna","4","0","2","10 October 2010"," At least everyone wears shirts...
","I never watched this movie until today. I know it's hard to believe, but what motivation do I have to watch it? It's based off a pseudo- erotic novel about Vampires, made for teenage girls. The only reason I watched it is because I'm the only guy who hasn't... that and because it got terrible reviews. Well... the first bit really wasn't that bad. Just the second and third acts led me to the realization that Katherine Hardwicke is an awful director.<br/><br/>As you already know, Twilight is about a girl named Bella and a vampire named Edward. Bella is essentially a cardboard cut-out of a teenage girl- although, I suppose that teenage girls are supposed to be able to relate to her, so I guess I can't really complain. Edward is a vampire that is 108 years old, despite looking like he's 17. If he could be the same age his whole life, why wouldn't he be older? I don't know, maybe he should be 21, so he can drink and drive. Anyways, this already brings up a lot of questions, like why is he in grade 11? Actually, Bella asked him this question in the second half of the film, to which Edward replies- ""it's an in joke""... I don't get it either. The filmmakers probably did this since there is no plausible answer that could possibly explain him falling for a teenager. I mean, they could of made Bella 19 and out of school- but then that would kill the 8 ‚Äì 14 year old demographic. <br/><br/>Anyways, Bella is almost killed in an accident when Edward saves her by stopping an incoming truck with one hand- and he puts a big dent in it too. Yep, and it only takes Bella another 45 minutes to figure out that he's not normal. Anyways, he ends up stalking her because ""he likes the smell of her perfume"" and they end up in a forest where they profess their undying (and undeveloped) love. After it, we just get more filler about her smelling good and them being in love.<br/><br/>Next comes the scene where Edward introduces Bella to his family- eight or so un-related vampires that all live in the same house. They also don't drink human blood- only animal blood. After that, they all play Vampire Baseball (this looks just as stupid as it sounds). While playing the choice sport of the undead, three vampires (that have been seen killing people throughout the movie) come forward and ask to play. One of them, however, just wants to eat Bella. Fortunately, our eight vampires hero's decide to back off, rather than kill the three vampires that oppose them. Now, the Cullens need to hide Bella, since this vampire guy wants to kill her. Why, you may ask? I don't know- the movie doesn't even tell us if it's an ""in joke"" or not, so there is officially no reason. In the next scene, one of the evil vampires comes forth and tells the Cullens he doesn't care for the other two (so for the record, the odds were actually 9 ‚Äì 2). <br/><br/>Anyways, the vampire blackmails Bella into meeting him in a gym or something, and tortures her while shooting her with a camera. Why torture her and film it? I'll let you guess- do you think it's because of her perfume, or do you think it's an ""in joke""? Predictably enough, Edward breaks through a window and fights the bad guy. Fortunately, there are a bunch of mirrors in the room they get to break while fighting- but trust me, it still looks stupid. Edward predictably wins and the other vampires, who arrive JUST after he won, dispose of the body in a fire (that magically appeared in the corner). <br/><br/>However, Bella was bit- And Edward has to drink the venom out of her blood without being tempted to drink it all. Fortunately, he succeeds and stops her from becoming a vampire. Why? Well... I really don't know why. I mean, even SHE wanted to become a vampire. And guess what happens when she asks him this question question at the end of the movie... the credits roll (It must have been another in-joke). <br/><br/>And that's pretty much it. Now, I know I'm never going to read the book, so I can't say whether the incompetence of the director was at fault here or just the source material. However, I do have some suggestions to give to Stephanie Meyer- give Bella some metaphorical balls. She just acts so desperate. It just doesn't seem realistic how dominating Edward is in the relationship. Now, after all is said and done, I still barely know what happened, so if anyone can answer the questions below, that'd help...<br/><br/>-Who was the officer who got killed in the middle of the movie? -Whydoes Edward act so socially challenged (He's had a hundred years to polish up his social skills) -What is the ""in joke""? -Why can nobody else tell there is something wrong with Edward? -Why does Edward mention ""the wolf descended"" upon seeing Taylor Lautner? Does he already know he's a werewolf? -Who are the three vampires that killed random people? -Why did the black vampire hang out with the other two despite not liking them? -Do these vampires hate garlic? What about crosses and stakes?<br/><br/>AND THE BIGGEST QUESTION<br/><br/>-What's the glowing thing that happens to Edward? Is it a super power?"

A lot of people have been comparing the twilight franchise to Harry Potter, well in my opinion the Twilight cast are so much better that the Potter lot! I think Catherine Hardwick has done an amazing job by trying to stay true to the wonderful works of Stephanie Myer! The Twilight characters have been casted well with excellent talent such as Jackson Rathbone, Peter Facinelli, Ashley Greene and Billy Burke. I was also extremely impressed with the likes of Kellan Lutz, Taylor Launtner, Robert Pattinson and Nicki Reed! <br/><br/>The start of the film initially is getting to know Bella (Stewart) and seeing her through her big move from hot Pheonix to dreary Forx, Washington. Bella then starts school and bumps into the beautiful Cullen clan, where she falls madly in love with the only single Cullen, Edward (Pattinson).<br/><br/>You see the loved-up couple go through their ups and downs (mainly Bella finding out Edward is a vampire and getting caught up with a trio of evil vamps), but in the end the happy couple are together in the end - that is, until next time....<br/><br/>If you like romance, a little bit of action, good acting and beautiful people (like the gorgeous Jackson Rathbone) then watch this film!

However, after a few viewings, when you look past these flaws, the movie doesn't do too bad, I've seen worse.<br/><br/>They have all the right ingredients, a decent story, an excellent score, two lead actors who do gel, lovely backdrops, but it just isn't mixed together as good as it could have been. But as I said, it is what it is and this movie is for Vampire Flicks, what Harry Potter is for WIzard/Fantasy genre's. It's a fad.<br/><br/>One of the things that kind of makes this movie bad is that it feels rushed, it really does, some of the lines, some of the acting and some of the cinematography. I feel that if they had taken their time on this movie, gone with their 2nd, 3rd or maybe 4th choices, the overall feel to the movie could have been polished.<br/><br/>If you are a bonafide Vampire buff like me, don't expect much, expect a teenage faddy spin on a generic genre.<br/><br/>God Bless."

The anticipation or this was one of the most heart wrenching periods of my life and if anything, I think they casted Kristen Stewart perfectly for Bella. She is exactly what I pictured in my mind when reading the saga.<br/><br/>I know what it's like to just not feel like you have a place in the world.

"geniuskentyk-1","8","0","2","9 July 2010"," Twilight definitely caught me off-guard!
","I was very skeptical about Twilight even before it was released. The first time I saw the trailer for it, I thought the film looked too boring, the color and scenery of it too dull, and the vampires too pale. While I watched the movie, I got used to the dullness of the background (the skies and stuff looked unusually boring¬Ö), and I got used to the Vampires' paleness, cuz I guess it made sense; it's one of the things that define them. While I was watching the film, I started to like it more and more (the beginning I thought the movie deserved a 6, then half way I felt it was a 7, then finally an 8). I like how the director made the film and how stylized everything was. The baseball scene was pretty cool in my opinion. I was confused about some things in the movie, such as how the sunlight makes the vampires look different. How do they go to school without changing in the sunlight? Maybe they explained this and I wasn't paying attention¬Ö Also, a lot of people told me that Kristen Stewert (who plays the main character, Bella) was a terrible actor in this movie. Yes, at some points in the movie her acting is weird, but not terrible; I think she just ""overacts"", like at the part in the hospital. Other than those few bad acting parts, I felt Kristen Stewert was a fine actress in this movie. Was there chemistry between the two leads? Again, most people said no. I personally felt there was chemistry. The chemistry wasn't clearly there, and sometimes the leads looked uncomfortable around each other, but that's how they're supposed to act. The characters ARE uncomfortable! I watched the movie just to see one of the most hated movies of 2008, but I'm shocked to find myself to its liking. A lot of people are going to think I'm crazy for giving the movie an 8 out of 10, but it's my opinion; I really like this movie! I can't wait till the sequel, which is coming out exactly one year from the last movie. Too bad they replaced the director, and also I feel like they're rushing to make this movie. We'll just have to see¬Ö."
"btzarevski","5","0","2","8 July 2010"," Very average with a few below average parts
","Firstly, I feel I should mention I'm a 19 year old guy and so having absolutely no interest in Robert Pattinson I can give an unbiased review (I haven't read the books either). <br/><br/>Ooh OK, where to start? The story. For those of you who don't know it's about a girl who moves to some small town and then falls in love with a bloke. Unbeknownst to anyone the bloke happens to be a vampire...although wait for it...he doesn't drink human blood. Nor affected by garlic. Nor affected by daylight, crosses etc. I suppose that's actually a plus for me because most vampires movies simply regurgitate what Dracula did but just add CGI, anyway, it is an interesting and different view. There is not much substance to the story, no twists, not much gripping; it's just another teen love issue.<br/><br/>The acting is horrid. Absolutely terrible! And |I blame the direction of Hardwicke for that as much as the actors themselves. There is no engagement with the already quality limited material but their lack of emotion and ability simply compounded matters. Standouts? Billy Burke did well as did Peter Facinelli. Actually thy did very good and the only scenes I genuinely enjoyed were ones with those two in them.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that at the end of the movie I felt as if there was no real aim of it. Was it just something that pre-teen girls could scream at? Probably because it didn't have good actors, a good story or good directing. It was just bland and the camera work was atrocious! I'm actually getting angry and irritated now because I am thinking back to it and realising just how bad the bloody thing was! <br/><br/>In summary, the acting is awful. Really, really, really awful (apart from the aforementioned standouts). The story is clich√©d and has no meat and the directing and camera is garbage. However, there is something, for lack of a better word, gripping about it. It's a nothing sort of movie but I did watch the whole thing and actually enjoyed a few scenes it. You wouldn't waste your time watching it but there are hundreds of other movies I would have rather watched.

","**Warning - small spoiler alert**<br/><br/>Last week, I finally sat down to watch the first two Twilight movies - to find out what all the craze has been about. <br/><br/>I've never read the books, so it's possible that there's much more to be gained from the films if you have some background reading to work with. <br/><br/>But as one that came into the Twilight series cold, my impressions were...well...unimpressed. Twilight IMHO, comes off as a run-of-the-mill teen angst film (done a million times before), just with a few rather uninspired Gothic characters.<br/><br/>Honestly, vampires and werewolves have been done a million times before - in Underworld, and recently in True Blood to name just two.<br/><br/>And the romance? Absolutely no charisma there at all, especially with Edward. (Okay, Jacob has great abs - that was probably the best part of both the films.) But as an adult, I find it practically funny that *both* characters (in their own ways) vow eternal love to Belle...without even getting to second base...! In other words, this is a great, platonic teenage romance for 13 year old girls into brooding. So I guess if you're the parent of one, you'll end up having to watch the whole series.<br/><br/>As for the rest of us - it's pretty much a waste of two hours."

","We all have grown up listening to vampire stories that how they only come at night and they live in coffins during daytime and the best way to keep them away is wearing a cross.So it became a tradition to depict vampires as blood thirsty an evil so when i heard from my book guy that a new book has come out it is a love story between a girl and a vampire i was surprised and wanted to try the book once just out of curiosity.\ Back at my place with this book i was simply hooked and finished the book in not my normal time and loved the book at the same time as the book did try to break many of the recorded traditions of the vampire world the concept of vegetarian vampires and superhuman powers was quite riveting.<br/><br/>Cut to a few months after the book came out summit entertainment came out with the movie version.Though not better than the book the movie is tightly shot and packaged.But undoubtedly the best thing is the background music which is haunting even after the movie is finished.All the book adaptations always suffer from the length of the book as compared to the length of the movie so mostly many parts of the book are edited to suite the running time of the movie.The direction is nice as the story mainly focuses on the relationship between the two main characters.Robert Pattinson portrays the dreamy eyed hero of the tale and Kirsten Stewart plays the ""human"".<br/><br/>All in All Twilight does make a good weekend watch and if you are really into the book adaptations do watch this for a original take on the vampire saga"

","I have read all the Twilight books and as I read them I couldn't help thinking that the prose within them is beautifully written with the complex language but the whole idea of a 'vegetarian vampire' and a girl being in love with it is kind of ridiculous.<br/><br/>Twilight the film is the same, the dialogue is perfect, it has some of the best cinematography I have seen and the use of colour all the way through astounded me, the green of the forest actually had my jaw drop as yes it is probably one of the most beautiful films I have seen in a way thats really hard to describe. However much like the book I couldn't feel any sort of emotion towards the characters, throughout Kristen Stewart's 'Bella' comes across as a total bitch and I just couldn't see round it. Robert Pattinson as 'Edward' is a character who is too emotional, I just think you know if you're a vampire whose been alive (well technically dead) for 100 years killing people and seeing suffering then you wouldn't get so upset over some high school girl.<br/><br/>I know thats there's supposed to be some sort of connection between the two characters I just didn't get that and it all seemed a bit drained, at some points I literally just sat there admiring the camera-work as that is by far the best part of this film.<br/><br/>Thoroughly disappointed <br/><br/>6/10"

I think I like this one, Twilight, the most because it is much about high-school and Bella not knowing Edward is a vampire. Of course the movie isn't all the same as in the book. There are more details and in that way it feels like you're Bella but I think the movie did great!

"MovieProductions","5","0","2","30 June 2010"," Disenchanting and uninteresting. Hey, at least it's entertaining.
","** out of (***)<br/><br/>""Twilight"" has received mostly negative feedback from men and I can relate. The characters are one dimensional, the execution is bland and incoherent, and the script is just laughably bad. However, I can't say I wasn't entertained. The pacing is pretty consistent for the most part and I thought the cinematography looked pretty good. Albeit, the special effects are abysmal and they are very blatant to say the least. You may think I absolutely loathe ""Twilight"", but I don't. It's just that it's nowhere near the terms ""romantic"", ""engaging"", or even ""good"". Out of curiosity, not out of interest, I read the first book and surprisingly, I was somewhat pleased with what I read. A great book? No. A pretty fair one? Yes. This review is not about the comparisons between book and film but I just want to point out that even the book isn't that great, so it's a shame that the director kind of made the material worse. <br/><br/>""Twilight"" revolves around Bella (Stewart) who goes to live with her father and attends her new school. Although, Bella is gradually developing a crush on Edward (Pattison), although he has a secret: he's a vampire. <br/><br/>That was basically ""Twilight"" in a nutshell; not going through specifics. I'm going to start with the positives. First off, this movie is at least entertaining. No hater can tell me that this movie was tedious. This movie had a very smooth flow and scenes were timed pretty well. Also, I thought the cinematography looked pretty slick. Not the best of its kind, but not the worst. Furthermore, I thought that this movie did have some cool moments. They weren't enough to make me see the film again, but the impact was still decent.<br/><br/>Now, I'm going into negatives. First off, this movie has got to be a contender for worst acting. I'm not joking, the relationship comes off as so forced, so scripted, and so rehearsed, that anyone with a brain cell would not buy into this love triangle. The performances are beyond atrocious. Second of all, the execution was lousy. The movie's script was simply awful and I can't really explain it one way or another. It was just awful. To add to that, I thought that the special effects were some of the worst I've seen of this century. They were so terrible that I had to do a double take to make sure I wasn't on something before seeing this movie. Yes folks. It's that bad.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are looking for a movie that suits the terms ""endearing"", ""captivating"", and ""breathtaking"", you should look somewhere else. While I admit, ""Twilight"" is not the worst movie you'll ever see, it is leagues away from being a good movie. Had the performances and script been improved, this movie might be a slight recommendation, but no matter what director, this movie will never be the holy grail, just plain and simple. ""Twilight"" is about as dry and energy-drained as your grandfather's ""pull-my-finger"" gag."

","For the past two years, I have avoided this movie like the plague. It just looked ridiculous, and melodramatic because of sparkly vampires. There was a double feature tonight, and I finally decided to cave in. It wasn't as bad as I wanted it to be, but I'll still make fun of it. In case you don't know the story, I'll give you a quick version; Bella Swan is forced to move to Forks, Washington where it's always cloudy and raining. She soon meets Edward Cullen, who just happens to be a vampire...that sparkles. When Edward saves her from almost being hit by a van, she slowly begins to fall suicidally in love with him.

","I read the book series and fell in love, as most do who are not frightened by the possibility of over 300-400 pages of voluntary reading. The author of them was fantastic in a way you wouldn't really think could have been fantastic, and I was so looking forward to a continuation of any kind after I finished reading all four books in less than a week. When I found out there was a film that would be out in theaters within days, I was so supremely excited there were no words. I'd completely forgotten the fact that I'd actually seen the preview for the movie before I read the books, dismissing it as, 'Oh Author, not another trashy vampire movie' and moving on through the TV channels.<br/><br/>I didn't remember again until halfway through the movie, and I made sure to interrupt my chanting of 'The horror, the horror' over and over again in my brain to slam my head into the seat in front of me. Elements of the story I'd thought of as cute and creative before were transformed into ridiculous fancies by the overpowering low-budget feel to the whole thing. I have no idea how it could have been made better, but it would have been hard to make it worse."

","I am first and for most a fan of the books! I followed twilight through its conception. I have to say Catherine Hardwicke did an excellent job with what she had to work with. I recently purchased a LED TV and started to watch Twilight and then New Moon on blue-ray. Twilight is visually more spectacular by far!!! The changes to the movie versus the books were inevitable. With the budget constraints that were imposed she did a tremendous job! If it was completely horrible we would not be looking at the hysteria that has manifested from not only fans of the books! I like to look at things as a whole, Stephanie Meyer approved the changes so they were not totally against the grain of the books. The only thing that I didn't like in the changes was the portrayal of Edward as a weaker character than he is in the books!"
"emmalaver92","8","0","3","14 June 2010"," Contrary to what i expected, twas true to the book,
","*Continuous SPOILERS and book references*<br/><br/>I only read the book 'Twilight' a few weeks before the film came out, but i was quite pleased with the film and how it fitted with the book.<br/><br/>Casting Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson as Bella and Edward, respectively, was a good choice in my opinion. Stewart portrays the ordinary, clumsy newbie to Forks high School, while Pattinson's good looks stand out from the crowd, but are not dramatically exaggerated. In some scenes, you can really feel the sexual tension between them, which is, after all, what the whole book is about.<br/><br/>The only omitted plot i would have liked to have seen in the movie, is the biology class one, where Bella faints.That was a point in the book where their relationship really developed and blossomed. <br/><br/>The casting of Victoria and Laurant were, i thought, perfect, as the wild vampires they meet during the baseball game. In fact, all casting was great except for one... Rosalie. Nikki Reed has the right attitude towards being Rosalie, and her hatred towards Bella, but the in the book, Bella describes her as being 'The most beautiful person I've ever seen', which (sorry Nikki) i don't think Reed lives up to. I could think of better actresses to have played her.<br/><br/>Overall, a great romance thriller, great for any teenager. I've watched it hundreds of times already, mainly just to see Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson. :D"

","A girl named Bella moves to a new place with her dad after her mom runs off with a baseball player. This girl goes to a new school and doesn't really fit in because she is a loner and not normal like all the other girls. She soon learns of the mysterious Cullen family, extremely beautiful, all stick to themselves and very intriguing. She gets the hots for one of the boys, Edward, but he doesn't seem to like her and in fact seems to hate her. Soon he saves her from an accident and reveals he has super speed and super human strength and his secret is out to her. They begin to talk and she questions these things and he claims to know nothing, but the truth finally comes out and they admit to each other they are in love. He reveals that he is in fact over a hundred years old and is a vampire, and she is the least bit scared of him. His family isn't too happy about her knowledge because they are all vampires that don't kill humans and she is very tasty to them. They fear they aren't safe but soon most of them accept her. Meanwhile, a group of bad vampires are killing people and it's making the Cullens get scared as they know the wolves (yes there's werewolf shapshifting Native Americans here too, but we'll get to them in the sequel) will think its them. The bad vamps soon find out about Bella and they want her bad. The Cullens then must fight to protect themselves and Bella and Edward soon finds that the only way she will be truly safe is if he no longer has anything to do with her. She, on the other hand, knows the only way she will be happy is if Edward turns her and gives her what she wants..a future of forever with him.<br/><br/>OK so the first time I watched this I hated it with passion. I thought this is no vampire movie, there is no blood, no fangs, no horror and it just sucks horribly. Vampires don't sparkle gold in the sun, thats stupid. I still agree with all of my first impressions, but my second time watching it I watched it as a love story and it made me see it in a new light (no pun intended).<br/><br/>The movie did good with making them mysterious, yet making them try to blend in to some degree. At the same time I think, if you're going to go to school and be ""normal"" then why not blend in and make friends and be normal for real.<br/><br/>I didn't like stupid things like how Bella seemed to freak out because Edward could run a whole of like 20 feet in super fast time, yet she didn't seem at all amused of how he stopped a car with his bare hands.<br/><br/>Direction was really good, so was cinematography and editing. There was beautiful shots in this film and especially the use with lighting. The bright yet pale color of the sky to symbolize daylight with no sunlight. The use of makeup to make the Cullens so pale too. Acting was good here I thought Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattison worked well together. I am not a huge worshiper of the movies like many but I will say these kids did a good job, Roberts accent and all and his acting period is good, and its not fair to put him down simply because you hate the movie. Billy Burke did a good job and normally I am not a fan of his. I think Peter Facinelli, Taylor Lauher, Jackson Rathborne and Cam Gigandet were great too. I don't know her real or character name, but the girl playing the red headed bad vampire was great too..too bad she was replaced later.<br/><br/>This movie gained tons of hype because of pretty boys and good rock soundtracks and horror thats vanilla, which made little girls everywhere, as well as gay boys go crazy over this. It spawned a whole new breed of bubble gum movie fans and had many people trying to swear this movie was perfect. This movie is a fad movie and in 20 years if not sooner will be forgotten about. It is okay and it's a nice way to kill a couple hours, it IS NOT horror in anyway and is 100 percent drama mostly aimed at young girls. The music is modern and cool and I give it 5 out of 10 stars."

","I had never heard of Twilight books, hadn't seen the movie trailers either. I know...""what planet do you live on""? The planet of being a 28 year old mother of 2 kids! One day, bored, husband out of town and dying to see a movie I brought my kids to the local theater and looked for something we could all enjoy....maybe. My kids were 5 and 10 (girl and boy) and I couldn't find anything that wasn't either waaaay too young for me or waaaay too old for them. We saw Twilight listed and I asked the ticket-lady what it was about, was it scary, etc. My kids loved Interview with a Vampire and any other vamp movie or scary movie (to a point). The ticket people said it would be a good fit for both of them...if not, I could always walk out. We went in, I had NO expectations, but was currently watching the TrueBlood HBO series and love vamp stuff. It was painfully slow, but not in the ""get on with it"" kind of way. In a time-lapse love story kind of way. I loved all of the characters, the twist of the glittery vamp vs. the dust or hellfire in the sunlight. I adored the music, the cinematography. The piano solo over the treetop scene still gives me spinal tingles. (I have a few songs from the soundtrack I listen to often) The baseball scene was a favorite of mine, unlike others who are critical, its a first in any vampire series where they do something other than simply brood and feed. I liked for the first time seeing a girl start a new school and make friends...which is more like real life. Almost all movies involving a high school is so unbelievably over-dramatic with the stereotypes (seperation between geeks/jocks/popular, etc), this high school depiction was refreshing and realistic. My overall experience when leaving this movie was that we had spent our money very well, it was worth my butt going numb and that I would love to see the next one. My only gripe is Bella, not Kristen Stewart, but BELLA! Stop twitching like a crack head, speak in full sentences! Its really annoying to watch her talk. I like the character other than the twitching. I'm irritated now after reading on here that the author is Mormon, which explains why no love scenes...but I guess that is why it was age appropriate and adored by my kids. I am a serious novel reader...anything I can get my hands on I will read. But I also know that a book turned movie will always disappoint. IF I have read the book, I will NOT see the movie and vise-versa. So I still refuse to read the book, as I will be irritated one way or another. My son went back (despite my warnings) and read the books, he now agrees with me and will never do it again. As we saw New Moon and he couldn't help but point out ""Thats not in the book!""...so to all of you who have read the book, forget the movie. To those who have seen the movie, forget the books, lol. You will dislike one or the other....unless you're just a total Twilight-obsessed groupie, in which case, seek help."
"panther0482","6","0","2","20 April 2010"," So much promise
","So I was rather skeptical approaching the idea of ever reading this series, let alone seeing the films. Yet here I sit putting my thoughts down about such things. In any case, what I have been reaffirmed of is that that movies barely distill the essence of the story that the book gives you. <br/><br/>First off, I would have to agree that casting was pretty spot on. Robert Pattinson fits the role perfectly in both appearance and substance; he is not overly muscular and suited for this role (call me odd but a buff vampire just seems unbecoming since it is unnecessary given the arsenal of weapons and skills they already have).<br/><br/>Where my criticism, and more so disappointment, comes in is the lack of depth the movie provides. There are just too many nuances to rate it high. Character establishment was very good and accurate to the novel, but the development of them characters, especially to each other, was rushed and very superficial. The movie makes you assume a lot and imply connections based on one . The arguments between Bella and Edwaard provide so much clarity and connect them. Some of the story lines were shortened, passed over, or out of ordered.<br/><br/>All in all, there was a lot of promise for this movie, but it fell through. The plot was followed well, but could have been better, the characters were introduced well but not developed. Even though it is a 2hour movie, it needed to be another hour long to adequately encompass the depth of story created by Meyer. So you'll like the movie, just less if you've read the books first."

","I didn't watch this film in the cinema, i waited till my sister got the DVD. Why? well i was an 18 year old when it was released, and i had no friends who wanted to go and see it. The thought of watching a film about a vampire falling in love with a human, really didn't appeal to them. But me being a huge fan of Buffy the vampire slayer and Angel, i was looking forward to another vampire franchise.<br/><br/>This is no Buffy the vampire slayer or Angel!!not even close.<br/><br/>The Story is about a girl called Bella (kirsten Swanson)who moves to her dads house in attempt to start a new life. At school she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Patterson) and soon falls in love with him, only to discover that he is a vampire. But he explains that his family is different, as they only feed on animals and not humans.<br/><br/>Well the story was just what i expected, but the way the vampires are portrayed is not! Firstly They don't burn in direct sunlight like vampires should do, they kind of glow or sparkle and become glittery. i am not fu*king joking! We see that the vampires are extremely fast which makes them harder to escape, especially Edward who is very fast at running. Some of the Cullens(Edwards family) have special powers- one can see into the future!<br/><br/>This film seriously lacks action. All through the film it is just talking and talking and talking, which isn't neccassarily bad in a film, but in a film involving vampires, you want action, fighting and death. The only fight is at the end, but it looks like a deleted scene from an Episode of Buffy. seriously. the first fight we see through the whole film and it lasts about 20 seconds.........OMG!!<br/><br/>I think the 1 thing i really likes was Kirsten Stewart. She really carried the film on her own as far as im concerned. Robert Patterson does a pretty good vampire( apart from the sparkly sh*t)<br/><br/>I was really expecting something with a lot of action mixed with romance and a touch of horror, but it was soooooo boring, the sequel is even worse in my eyes! If you are a fan of vampires then give this a watch. It isn't to bad, but don't expect loads of action and witty diologue like in Buffy and Angel<br/><br/>By Scott Dewhurst"

","Another movie watched to appease my wife, though it wasn't as torturous as it might have been had it not been about vampires and featured Kristen Stewart, who I felt gave a satisfactory performance as Joan Jett in THE RUNAWAYS. This movie was just what I expected ... a teenage romance for the ladies, not bad but not necessarily good either. Stewart plays Bella, a high school student who becomes smitten (if not bitten) by an attractive male classmate named Edward Cullen who happens to be a modern-day vampire. She's drawn to him and quickly falls in love but must face extraordinary challenges when he reveals to her exactly what he is. Does Edward love this human female enough to restrain his urges to feast on her blood? And can Bella be accepted by Edward's offbeat family (who are also non-human vampires, albeit the friendly kind)? Once you abandon any ideas of Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, or traditional vampires who sported fangs and capes in general, this is tolerable for what it sets out to be. Of course, you also must be prepared to accept the idea that Edward's family of bloodsuckers enjoys passing their time by playing baseball together during lightning storms. Kristen is only adequate as Bella, but Robert Pattinson seems well chosen for his part as the alluring Edward. **1/2 out of ****"

I haven't seen the movie up to now, and I've never read the books so the only thing I'm reviewing is the actual movie by itself.<br/><br/>TWILIGHT opens with a well-shot action sequence that shows already two main reasons to watch this movie - cinematography (also the blue, cold filter through most of the movie was a great idea!) and score by Carter Burwell (most of Coen Brothers' movies) who did a great job. His ""Bella's Lullaby"" is simply beautiful and the rest of the score includes some great, suspenseful music with the use of both drums and the guitar. The film also features some popular songs, which work well with the movie.<br/><br/>As the story goes - it's not a horror. Not in a bit. It's a teen-romance with vampires in it. The story is nothing amazing but enjoyable as it is something new, I have to say.<br/><br/>The acting. Robert Pattison is really BAD. I heard he's a better actor than it looks here, well, I'll have to see it myself, but most of Twilight (with maybe the exception of the last, dancing scene) he's terrible.<br/><br/>Kirsten Stweart had better roles before Twilight (Into The Wild) but here she's not that bad either.<br/><br/>The screenplay is pretty stupid at times and definitely shortened from the book, some poor direction and funny scenes that weren't supposed to be funny, but still it is an enjoyable watch!<br/><br/>For those two, main reasons.."

The latter was true which just confirmed my first thought after watching it. And my thought was my summary line. That could have been the pitch ... or should have been! <br/><br/>While I don't see entirely the attraction on Robert Pattinson (and/or his character), he is quite different, than ... let's say other characters. It's amazing what you will read about the movie, which can spoil quite a bit. There is another major character here, who only plays a small role in this one. But if you watch the movie, you know pretty much, what this character is going to evolve to (literally) in the future installments of the series.<br/><br/>While the adults bring some nice flavor to the whole thing, you could wonder why there are only beautiful people on screen. But that wouldn't do this movie justice. It is targeted at teen girls (well girls/women in general) and fully achieves it's goal(s).

","First of all, yes, I am a fan of the Twilight Saga and I enjoyed this movie as well as the second and would recommend them to anyone who is a fan of normal stories with slight twists (in this case, vampires). <br/><br/>This aside, the movie does have a lot of flaws, such as fairly poorly executed fight scenes and supporting actors who possess very little talent. I understand how a lot of people have come to hate it though I primarily blame the hate on the massive, over-exaggerating fan base who persist to lower the entire saga's reputation by obsessing over it.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is a romantic story that builds up, from a simple start of a girl moving towns, to discovering the dark truth behind Edward Cullens behaviour and actions, to a climactic fight between Edward and James (well acted by Sam Gigandet) though, in my eyes, that scene could have be executed much better. The connection between Bella and Edward is established equally as well in the book, this drew me into the movie immediately and so did the colour scheme that the movie seemed to bear - I felt everyone in the movie was surrounded by greys and dark blues which added to the atmosphere and juxtaposed with the light- hearted feeling of love that this movie gets across, thus making it a much heavier type of love.<br/><br/>Having read the books, I can say that a lot was changed, missed out and added but it didn't pull away from the point of the story which was to make you believe that Edward and Bella (both with spot on acting by Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson) are indescribably in love. My only problem with the movie is that the director (Catherine Hardwicke) has, without a doubt, very little experience with fight scenes so they were poorly executed and the atmosphere tended to suffer as a result.<br/><br/>Overall Twilight is a movie you will love if you are meant to or hate to the core if you don't and the fan base annoys you, however certain characters are underused and motivations may be questionable at certain points.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9/10 out of personal ranking and 7/10 for review ranking."

","If you have complete adulation for the series novels that you can memorize every line, scene and characters and their traits, then I would advise you to stay way from this movie. However, if you have neglected to watch, the trailers, clippings and being flippant towards those cynical naysayers or idol panderers, then this movie might not be your meal ticket. And to those who wish to go to the theaters thinking it's okay to randomly condemn the movie because it's cool, maybe then you should do something else. And finally, if you were expecting a mindless vampire flick with blood, blood and more blood, I suggest you go home and rent a ""Blade"" movie instead. <br/><br/>But if you're just out for an unforgettable evening, and sit back and watch the latest novel-to movie adaptation forgetting about your troubles, then this is the movie for you. Let those crazed kids scream for their celluloid idols all they want, but as long as your mind is fresh and expect what you've come to expect, you're going to enjoy ""Twilight"". <br/><br/>You might want to take in consideration that it's not the actors that carried the film, but the lengths that were taken in making the movie is what makes this movie special. The low budget it took should mean something. At under $40 million to create something very riveting show quality will always beat quantity. Other trial and tribulations was that it was filmed in a new studio, behind schedule and horrid working conditions. The makers never expected this movie was going to be cult film, they assumed that they were making an independent novel adaptation. <br/><br/>For those who are taking notes and drawing comparisons to the novel, be warned, the crew had to make changes to characters and scenes may have been added or shrunk or even left out just to cram it into making a two hour film. They may have given more air time for the evil vampires to show their stuff. There was some humorous moments (some more than others), but doesn't entirely try to take itself too seriously. The direction is hit or missed in some areas, but still remained very nuanced. Some editing could have been better, like the meadow scenes that seemed to go on for too long.<br/><br/>Overall the performances were pretty good Robert Pattinson turned in a very good performance as the sensitive vampire Edward Cullen. Kristin Stewart had a believable role as Bella Swan, but at times her character can be a bit too stoic for my tastes. Peter Facinelli was wonderful as the good doctor there to cured all ills and at the same time show his patronage to the Cullens. Some of the other Cullens could have had more air time, however, Nikki Reed was impressive in her supporting role and Ashley Greene was both cute and scary as Alice. Billy Burke as the over-protective father had a humor factor that any teenager could identify with. Taylor Lautner was the best choice to cast him as Jacob, who has potential to grow in future sequels. <br/><br/>Rachelle LeFavre and Cam Gigandet excelled as the evil vampires, sadly Edi Gathegi was a little over-the-top but he was underused so he didn't ruin the movie that much. I hope LeFevre can be seen in the next sequel because she was extremely fun to watch. <br/><br/>The lesson to be learned about this movie folks is that great movies are not from the wallet, but from the heart. The lengths it took to make this movie stands on its on merits. Sure it wasn't perfect, but it was a good watch. Though it's not for everyone, it still deserves a bit of praise. Give it chance, you might change your mind about this film a second or third time around."

","Leaving comparisons with HBO's True Blood aside, I will state, for the record, that I liked Twilight as an entertaining flick. Yet, there were so many plot holes that it was difficult to follow this movie the first time around, hence, the second viewing. Twilight experts have assured me that the reason for this ‚Äì as so often happens when a script is made from a novel ‚Äì is because the movie left out many salient points. (Ok, the book is still on my list of To Do's!) As everyone knows, Twilight's tale brings 120 year-old vampire, Edward Cullen, together with Bella Swan, a 17 year-old teen, in a torrid teen romance. (Creaking old guy with a teenager...ugh!) Bella moves to cloudy and dreary Washington from sunny Arizona to live with her estranged father, Charlie Swan. Edward and his family of fellow blood-suckers attempt to exist among the living. One touching scene with the Cullen ""family"" shows them attempting to welcome Bella by preparing an Italian dinner that they won't even eat.<br/><br/>The vampire film, a popular sub-category of the horror genre, routinely goes through a Hollywood retread every decade or so. The film is clearly geared for the youth market, all awash with silent longing and simple dialog. In the 90s, we had ""Interview with the Vampire"" and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula""; two well-made films, although the former pitted misogyny against homo-eroticism and the latter pounded us with the Woman + Sexy VampGuy=True Love syndrome. Yawn.<br/><br/>The captivating point in the vampire sagas is when the story is told from the woman's perspective, as in Twilight. This was also a strong point in the 1979 version, starring Frank Langella and Kate Nelligan. This Dracula encouraged Lucy's empowerment and the film juxtaposed it against her friend, Mina's Victorian victim, making this the truly definitive vampire movie to enjoy.<br/><br/>It will be fascinating to see how the second installment of the Twilight series, New Moon, is handled under the direction of Chris Weitz, instead of with a woman's touch."

","Twilight is so cool. I could watch it one million times!! In Twilight Edward saves Bella from getting hit by a van!!! Edward's a vampire and that's the best part of the movie. Bella was a good actress when she played like she was having a seizure. Always remember that Twilight rocks on. <br/><br/>Out of all the movies I've seen I think this is the best one. I wish vampires were real because then if they were real I would wish I could be one. I wish I was a vampire because then I could read minds and be sexy. All in all, Twilight is the best movie ever. I really like the part where they had to escape from James, the evil vampire. I think the director did a good job writing the script. I like how in the middle of the film Bella and Edward got together. I really appreciated the magnificent and fresh photography. The filming all came together in a rather smooth, stunning way giving this movie some beautiful, razzle-dazzle sequences. Truly, I think Twilight is the best movie on earth! Rock on Twilight."
"dee.reid","5","0","2","29 January 2010"," Not a new fan... sorry, folks
","I'm a 24-year-old male.<br/><br/>""Twilight"" is a very strange movie. The notion of vampires falling in love with humans is nothing new; just think of Bram Stoker's timeless classic ""Dracula."" But ""Twilight"" is nowhere near the Gothic horror and romance of ye old ""Dracula""; it's just cheesy pop romance for hormonally charged teens and young adults who think that all vampires have to look like they just stepped out of ""GQ.""<br/><br/>""Twilight"" is still a very strange movie to me, and I'm not a new fan of the films or the books by Stephenie Meyer that inspired them. Now usually, I'm a sucker for romance stuff, even though I primarily like to watch action, sci-fi, and horror movies. (For the record, I like all movies, but those three are my primary interests.) So why did I find it so hard to even find an iota of any positive qualities to really like in this movie?<br/><br/>For the most part, I just thought the whole thing was pretty cheesy, but what can you expect from a series of young adult novels? The story involves two loner/weirdos coming together and falling in love. I was a bit of a loner/weirdo in high school, so I should have gravitated straight toward this movie, but alas that didn't happen. (My computer-nerd friends also hate these movies.) ""Twilight"" involves the social transplant of the socially awkward Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) to a Pacific Northwest town that is perpetually swamped in clouds of darkness.<br/><br/>At her new school, she meets the hunkish, Emo-ish, pale-skinned would-be ""GQ"" model Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). He isn't all that welcoming toward her, but since they sit next to each other in biology class, they have to work together if they want to make the grade. Their relationship continues to grow and eventually blossoms into a tentative romance. In case the ""big twist"" has somehow escaped you (how is that even possible with this movie?), the reason Edward was initially so distant toward Bella is because he's a vampire.<br/><br/>But he's not just any vampire. He comes from a family of vampires who are ""vampiric vegetarians,"" meaning that they have sworn off human blood in favor of the local wildlife. You see, even though he's sworn off meat, he's still fighting with every inch of his being to not make Bella his next meal. Pretty soon the two are parading around school, holding hands and showing off how much they're in love with each other. Meanwhile, Bella's cop father (Billy Burke) is investigating several vicious animal attacks that have been plaguing the area recently. Of course, there's no ""big twist"" or mystery here either; a trio of rebellious young bloodsuckers have turned the woods in and around town into their own personal hunting ground and when they get wind that human Bella is being protected by Edward and his family, their leader James (Cam Gigandet) makes it his personal mission to sink his teeth into Bella's neck at any cost.<br/><br/>Regardless of how cheesy I think this movie is, it looks fantastic, like an actual Gothic horror movie (everything is drenched in an icy-blue hue), and is competently directed by Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen""). A lot of the dialogue is pretty hokey, and doesn't really extend beyond the type of stuff you'd probably read about in any run-of-the-mill teen romance novel. The young cast including the strangely attractive Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson perfectly fit their roles, even though they are by no means great actors here. Still, they're just so pretty! Everyone in this cast looks so young and pretty - everything a hormonally charged youth could ever look for in a movie like this.<br/><br/>The main problem that I have with ""Twilight"" and other vampire movies/shows that present sexy-looking vampires is that they seem to trample on the legacy put forth by previous vampire movies. They all think vampires need to look like ""GQ"" models. In other words, they're no longer something to fear; they're something for young girls to swoon over - hence, all the female attention aimed at Robert Pattinson and his face on the cover of EVERY teen magazine you could think of. That's why my favorite of the old-school horror movie monsters were always werewolves. They were always the most grungy and sympathetic of all the old-school movie monsters. (For the record, I'm not looking forward to ""The Wolfman"" in a few weeks. Give me ""The Wolf Man"" or ""An American Werewolf in London"" any day, preferably my all-time favorite werewolf movie ""An American Werewolf in London."")<br/><br/>I'm also not a fan of how ""Twilight"" tramples all over ancient vampire mythology. Of course I'm talking about vampires that can go out in the daylight, vampires that sparkle & glisten when the sun shines on them, vampires that can run like the wind through the woods, vampires that can climb trees like Spider-Man, and vampires that HAVE (""have"" is italicized) a reflection in the mirror. I can buy the vampires not drinking human blood, fine, but all the other stuff - no way - it's just way too much trampling all over well-established vampire lore, and, remember, vampires aren't my favorite of the old-school movie monsters.<br/><br/>I'm not a new fan of ""Twilight."" (My friends aren't either.) I am glad that I finally got to see what all the hoopla was about. It's really nothing to get all hyped up over.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>P.S.: The greatest vampire movie of 2008 was the Swedish import ""Let the Right One In."""
"BloodyHellSunday","6","0","2","29 January 2010"," Nice implementation of the book...but bad actors
","First of all: I did read the book first, so I knew what the movie is about and what is going to happen. I love the book, because the story is really full of love and some lines made me shiver. So I really looked forward to see all I ever imagined on the big screen! <br/><br/>What I got was half/half... first of all, the location, the look of the actors, the flow of the story, all this was very good and impressed me, because it really reflects the book. BUT: The acting of the main characters (Bella and Edward) is really, really bad. That ruined the whole movie for me! Kirsten Steward (Bella) has absolutely NO talent in expressing the feelings of her character on screen. You don't buy her, that she is depressed, confused, in love, whatever. That was really a shame. Robert Pattinson (Edward) is a better actor, but I always had the feeling, that he don't really likes his role and plays half-hearted. So, especially the love scenes, from which the whole story lives, are just awful, and the actors look bored. I'm really asking myself what brought the casting crew to the decision, to take Kristen as main character...I don't understand this, really.<br/><br/>But I have to say, that the story really followed clearly the book (even though they left out a bit), the location was wonderful, and many of the side characters (especially Peter Faccinelli and Peter Burke) did a great job and brought life into the movie. So I give this movie a 6 star rating."

","TWILIGHT is an audience-directed film: the popularity of the ongoing teenager vampire/werewolf series of novels by Stephanie Meyer will most assuredly pull in all the readers to see what these characters look like. And that is what we get with TWILIGHT - a movie created by screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg from Meyer's novel and directed by Catherine Hardwick that stays pretty much in the 'twilight' tones of the Washington state overcast atmosphere. The actors are for the most part young newcomers (with the exception of some like Billy Burke as the father of the teenage star) and since they are given little to say or do other than wander around the school or blend into the shadows of the woods it is difficult to ascertain the quality of acting. <br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is the monotoned Bella, confused yet lusting after the 'don't come out in the daylight' vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) who is equally attracted to but fearful of revealing his true identity to Bella. There are of course, in addition to the usual fellow students concentrating on the Prom, two vampire groups (one eats animal flesh, the other the more traditional human blood) and then there are the 'native American Indians who have secrets of ancestry of their own. We do get to meet the very young lead for the next episode - Taylor Lautner as an interesting variation on the werewolf type, and there are some interesting minor roles for Peter Facinelli and Elizabeth Reaser of TV fame. This is not a bad film at all and for those who are avoiding it because of all the money spent on PR hoopla, it is an entertaining diversion. Keep expectations low and you'll probably be surprised. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"LexisLynx","8","0","2","15 January 2010"," A fair argument?
","I admit (rather proudly), I was a fan of Twilight before the movies were made. The story, although unrealistic, has got many things many girls wish for: the perfect relationship with the perfect guy. Okay, so there are a couple of twists here and there but it's basically Romeo and Juliet with vampires.<br/><br/>I had no trouble accepting this concept, because it had already been done a million times with other people (just few done with vampires) and when I heard that it was being made into a film, I read through it again. Now, we all have different views of Edward, Bella and the rest of the clan (and in my opinion I didn't think they were the best people for the job) but those actors did try to make it work. Not forgetting they were under huge amounts of pressure, from a very wide fan base ready to kill for the movie of their beloved book. If I had been any one of them, then I would have been hiding away until months after the premiere, in case people didn't like it.<br/><br/>The fact that they were transforming a book into a movie was a project itself. Most of twilight (and the rest of the saga) is Bella's thoughts. If they had had that all in the film then Bella would have been staring at nothing most of them, with the weird narration, and it would have been very visually boring. Also, with this 400 page strong book, there had to be cutbacks because it would have been very unappealing to those who haven't ever (or wanted to) read the books. They were trying to please the fans yet appeal to the rest of the audience, a very hard act.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I did see the flaws that the movie had compared to the book and I did come out slightly disappointed but I still felt the thrill when I saw the characters from the book come onto the film screen and, after seeing New Moon, the actors seem to be developing their characters better. I believe that this film was relying more on the fan base than the grand visual effects of the film but it still had many good features that often go unnoticed, besides in this mystical world where vampires sparkle in the sun, how would this have ever been easy?<br/><br/>After seeing the DVD extras, you do see how much hard work went into this film. I know many people do detest twilight, mainly due to the wide (and often hysterical) fan base, but as Stephenie Meyer said, she had only wrote this book for an audience of one, the fact that there are many people who love it, surprise her. And now, this and the rest of the twilight saga are number one bestsellers, and the movies so far have proved extremely popular. Say what you wish about the effects not being completely up to scratch and the idea being overused, so many people love it, and in this case, maybe the awards have to speak from themselves."
"kylet38","5","0","2","10 January 2010"," Uh... A OK Movie.
","I could not know this movie was not the greatest of all. But, I don't know if this was good. But this was just a OK movie, this was based by the 2005 book, Twilight, and, it is distributed by Summit Entertainment, I don't care for Summit's films that much but some of their films maybe a classic. It goes by basic plot of the story.<br/><br/>There is a girl and there is a vampire name ""Edward Cullen"" and Cullen's family drink animal blood instead of human blood just like myths.<br/><br/>The acting is OK, and slightly overall, was OK, but I know that they lived in Forks, and I do live in Kitsap County, Washington. Forks is located in Washington, farther from Port Angeles. And, maybe, Aberdeen? And there is Kitsap County police cops in Forks, WA, and I did not know that because I never ever been to Forks. And Forks was filled with tourist attractions, and some of them have the Twilight sign. And, the plot maybe follow the story, so it can be good/OK. So, that's why I give it a 5. And people, what place did I watch it? At home, and I do got the DVD release. And Twilight: New Moon, the sequel maybe better than this movie."

","I had never read any of the books but had heard about it. What can I say I actually really enjoyed it apart from a few things (btw I have a 29 year old son so I'm no teen).<br/><br/>My favourite characters were Edward played by Robert Pattison I can definitely see why the teenage girls lust after him.<br/><br/>Jasper he never looked 'constipated' at all to me as said in other reviews but kinda haunted and probably the most believable out of all the Cullins, although he did kinda remind me of a young Harpo Marx.<br/><br/>Charlie Swan because his acting was very believable.<br/><br/>I have watched and enjoyed vampire movies since I was young and they were NOT vampires! <br/><br/>1. They looked as though they had more of a skin disorder than anything else, Michael Jackson was paler and he was no vampire.<br/><br/>2. Spiderman and Superman had similar powers etc speed, strength, being able to leap tall buildings and they were no vampires.<br/><br/>3. Drinking blood of animals well I have friends who like their steak rare and I can tell you there ain't much difference and they're not vampires.<br/><br/>I can put up with all of the above but NOT the sparkly body thing it was horrendous and a blasphemy to vampires everywhere!!!!!I know the audience is mainly made up from teens but if your gonna make out the Cullins are vampires you gotta keep at least some of the lore plzzzz. My skin burns more in the sun than Edwards did and Im no vampire either.<br/><br/>The Cullins are a squeaky clean family that most communities would be proud to have, I've heard some horrendous stories about neighbours from hell, the Cullins keep themselves to themselves never bother anyone and are immaculate in appearance.<br/><br/>Everyday we are faced with paedos, rapists, murderers and terrorists and Edward says he's the 'monster' who should be scared of who here. He is the kinda boyfriend most mothers would love to see their daughter dating.<br/><br/>Vampires are supposed to be at least a little scary!! <br/><br/>Kirsten Stewarts acting, maybe she was told to act like that but it drove me mad she certainly showed little or no emotion as you would expect from other girls her age.<br/><br/>But on saying that I really enjoyed it and will look forward to seeing New Moon although I shall wait till there are no screaming swooning teens around."

","When I first watch this movie at the theater with a big screen and great speakers, I fell in love with the movie.

When I bought the movie and watched, it disappointed me greatly. I mean, I finally saw the flaws the movie had. Kristen Stewart as Bella was horrible. She kept flipping her hair, and she kept scoffing through every line being said by someone else. It makes you think she's always irritated. Besides her, the movie was okay. They did take out some of the scenes from the book such as the blood typing scene where Bella fainted."

","I've read some of the reviews that people have written about the movie Twilight and how it was the god-awful movie, with bad acting and stupid lines in it. And how the movie was so different than the novel. First of all what movie isn't the same as the novel? Personally, I wish they would just make a movie based on the book from beginning to end, instead of moving things around from here to there, etc; if the book was a bestseller to begin with, then why wouldn't the movie be as well, the way the author intended to be. But that's just me.<br/><br/>Get back to the movie. The movie was not god awful and bad acting as most suggested. Apparently, there are a lot of closed minded people that watch the movies that Hollywood produces. Which there are a lot of them that, is a lot terrible than the Twilight movie. Why is it too hard to believe that a vampire, or a man, for that matter, to have been waiting for a girl to come along, one he can fall in love with and spend eternity with? According to movies, true love always exist. As far as Bella goes, she was a lonely girl, who happens to fall in love with a boy, who turns out to be a vampire. Who Knew? LOL. Why is so hard for people to have this concept between true love and crushes. Which is true love between the two leads of the movie and the book series for those who read the series and know how it ends. True love conquerers all?<br/><br/>A vampire sparkling in the sunlight? Hmm, interesting in own right, but I was not so closed minded when I first seen the movie-which I saw first, before reading the book-to say WTF? What Stephanie had in mind when she wrote it, well, that is her decision and all. Do we have to stick to the fork-lore of the movies? And if the real vampires do exist, who are we to say what they can do or can't do in the sunlight. Keep an open mind people.<br/><br/>The movie is well written and well acted by all members of the cast. As far as Charlie goes, why wasn't he more interested in Bella than they had you believe? When the scene with Bella first arrived in Forks, they got to her room and she said ""One thing about Charlie, he doesn't hover."" That was true as it could be.. Charlie acted like he loved Bella, but didn't care about what she did? As a father, I would care who my teenage daughter was hanging out with...That was the only part I didn't understand in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was a lot better than most of you gave it. As to the directors and authors, keep the movie the same as the novel. would be a interesting notion indeed. There are a lot worse movies than this one thats for sure.."
"ridiculonius","6","0","2","22 December 2009"," Excellent adaption, So-so movie
","Before I start actually talking about the film, I would just like to say that even though I have read the first book and did enjoy it (despite it's flaws), I am NOT a crazy Twilight fan. I read the book primarily because I was going to go see the film with my English class (of all things) and wanted to have my background info; and let me say, this is probably one of the best book-to-movie adaptions I have ever seen. Not because it's a good *movie*, but because it follows the book to the letter and brings almost everything from the novel onto the screen and into the script.<br/><br/>That being said, I found the book to be, while no doubt enjoyable and sweet, written with a mediocre hand and riddled with unfortunate clich√©s, and original ideas that come across as nothing more than simplistic sketchy plot devices. For a debut, it's undoubtedly passable, but it's really the story and the romance that made it so popular, not the quality. The same goes for the movie.<br/><br/>The story, as most people on this Earth now know, is about an awkward teenager, Isabella ""Bella"" Swan, who moves from sunny Phoenix, Arizona to the wet, depressing North-West town of Forks, in an effort to give her mom and her boyfriend some space. Although she quickly captures the attention (and hearts) of what seems to be half the male adolescent population of Forks, Bella only has eyes for Edward, the handsome, pale-skinned, and mysterious boy who seems to despise her very presence. However, eventually they begin a friendship that turns into something much, much more squeal-worthy. And therein lies the conflict; Edward cannot allow himself to get too close to the introverted Miss Swan. Why? Bella's pasty Adonis is not only super-strong and super-fast, but super-immortal; he's a vampire, and he ""vants to sauck her bluud"".<br/><br/>The movie's dialogue is poor and clich√©d, even more so than in the novel - the cast, which I honestly love, did the best they could (for the most part) with a barely acceptable screenplay, but that in itself was enough to bring the film down in my eyes. The same can be said for the awful special effects, which were laughable at best. As several people have already said, in the scene where Edward reveals the reason that he cannot go out in the sunlight (he gets sparkly *rolls eyes*), if I had not already known what was supposed to be happening to him, I wouldn't have noticed the sparkles - and even being prepared, I almost missed the poor effects entirely.<br/><br/>However, as I said before, I do love the cast - though not entirely for their performances in this movie, which, while enough to *just* carry the bad dialogue, aren't as good as they could be. Robert Pattinson isn't, to be honest, as attractive as I'd imagined Edward to be (he isn't bad looking, just not good looking ENOUGH), but he has personality, and that, while not revealed through his words or even his actions, comes across nonetheless. He makes Edward way more likable than he is in the book, I think. Kirsten Stewart is wonderful too - I love her and think she is an incredible actress. She manages to create a Bella that you can sympathize with; monotone and introverted, yet still vulnerable, sweet, and in possession of an inner fire that doesn't show itself often, but is obviously there. She and Pattinson have an incredible chemistry - and while the script has nothing but long, lingering looks between them to show that they are falling in love, the romantic/sexual tension they create so naturally manages to take that crappy ""You don't have to say anything for me to know you're perfect"" ideology and make it believable.<br/><br/>So, all in all, Twilight was an incredible adaption of a mediocre book, sacrificing quality dialogue for lusty glances, turning what could've been a thousand times better into an only passable film that was carried solely by the actors and their chemistry."
"tinker12485","10","0","5","15 December 2009"," It was OK not as good as the book!
","I liked the movie very much for the money they had they did a good job. Yes it could have been a little better. They could have used less money on the wires and harnesses and added another scene or two. But other than that I was satisfied. I actually saw the movie before reading the book and I do prefer the book over the movie. But I still like the movie because it brought the book alive in a few ways. We got to see the connection between Edward and Bella more vividly. I did not like that in the scene with Bella and James they did not put in the part about Alice and her past. To me I thought it should have been put in it would not have taken but a few minutes to put the facts about Alice's past in there so she would know. I also liked it because it gave me a face to put with all the characters while I read the book and that made it just come alive while I read it."
"agenerette","6","0","2","13 December 2009"," I have only one complaint:
","Language.<br/><br/>Edward is supposed to be close to 100 yrs old, Carlisle's older. We should hear at least a few antique words, every now and then, from them, no matter how they might be trying to fit in. Stephenie Meyer used a few in her books, like ""sanguine""... that one works. If you read a book like Will Self's ""My Idea of Fun"", you'll find that this is one of the things that really cranks up the creep factor with (in that book) The Fat Controller.<br/><br/>Anyway, I read the 1st three Twilight books last year and didn't want the story to end, so I put off reading the last one 'till now. I'm a Romantic. 'No apologies. After seeing the film, I couldn't stand it any longer: I had to dive into the dusty copy of ""Breaking Dawn"" that's been sitting on my night table stand for months now.<br/><br/>I was all prepared to not like this movie. I was even telling myself I didn't like it very much as I was watching it... then I realized, a day later, that I'd watched it three times.<br/><br/>Part of what drew me in, initially (with the books 1st, then the movie), was the setting: anyone who's been there knows that most of the movie was obviously filmed in and around Portland, OR. (Cannon Beach, the Three Capes, Multnomah Falls), but the entire Northwest is hauntingly beautiful. Just the thing for this kind of story. A few words more words on this: ""Twin Peaks""... Neko Case.<br/><br/>Kristen and Robert are perfect as Bella and Edward. Period. I can't believe the folks responsible for it actually managed to find them. I also like Taylor as Jacob, but I'm with Charlie on Alice: Damn! Ashley Greene is a little more than perfect in this part. We're talking Gloria-Graham-level HOT, HOT, HOT! <br/><br/>But, back to the language thing: did I miss it or did Kristen/Bella not say ""Holy Crow!"" once in this movie? Jeeze, I know it might have been tough for the oh, so serious actress, but you gotta just let go and give in to your inner geek every now and then! Ya know?"
"lopcar1993","5","0","2","8 December 2009"," It had good qualities, but bad acting and terrible scripting held it back from being better than what it is...
","While Twilight has an amazing premise and a great story to back it up, it can't help but fall prey to the terrible script and bad acting from the leads. Stephine Meyers' Twilight has a morbid energy level that resonates with a tale of forbidden love, and the story is highly interesting but it is extremely let down by a bad script, under direction and bad acting from the entire cast. What could have been an amazing Gothic, fantasy romance instead turns out to be nothing more than another teeny bopper romance film.<br/><br/>Twilight is dark, complex and at sometimes it has it's moment where it really dazzles and amazes. But it falls short on an illogical script, unbelievable events and a story at times that defies all reason. But for the most part Twilight is an interesting film that does manage, in some strange way, to hold your attention for the first two acts of the film but it losses it momentum and strength in the third act and turns into a bad chase thriller. But all in all Twilight is a good idea and story muddled by everything imaginable in a film, but still is quite enjoyable even if it is preposterous and illogical.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart for the first act of the film(Before the entrance of Edward.) delivers a good performances, the second act she kind of starts to lag a little and in the third act her acting abilities are completely gone and she acts like an escape mental patient. Robert Pattinson is terrible in this film from his introduction to the end, he can't hold up the dramatic part he is assigned and really brings down the film causing Stewart to really try hard to keep it afloat , but sadly Pattinson brings Stewart down with him and the film fails to please except for it's dark style and the source material. But none the less the cast tries but fails to elevate this film above average and is just an average teen romance.<br/><br/>Twilight is stylish and fresh but it wears out it's welcome by the third act and it becomes quite irritating and contrived. But all in all it's just another example of a good story and idea gone bad. Twilight is passing entertainment."
"freemantle_uk","6","0","2","6 December 2009"," An honest review by an non-fan
","The Twilight series have polarised opinion, with people either loving it or hating: so much so that their is a big divide between fangirls who rate the Twilight films 10/10 whilst haters give them 1/10 before even seeing it. The Twilight series is also extremely popular but I didn't know anything about it until the first film came out. I realized how popular it was with Radio One presenters Fern Cotton and Jo Whiley talking about how much they were looking forward to New Moon, and seeing the very long quote to the cinema on Orange Wednesday when I went to see Paranormal Activity. I decided to record the film on my Sky Box for two reasons, to give my honest opinion, and to see what the fuss is all about.<br/><br/>Twilight tells the story of Bella Swan (Kirsten Stewart), a 17-year-old girl from Arizona. Her mum and step-dad decide to go on a roadtrip so Bella decides to live with her dad (Billy Burke) in Forks, Washington: one of the wettest places in the USA. Bella makes some friends in a fairly normal high school, but she is quite a moody teenager. She takes an interest in the Cullen family, a strange family of foster children who like to keep to themselves. She takes a particular interest in Edward (Robert Pattinson); but he seems very rule to her. But one day in the parklot at her high school Edward saves Bella's live and their soon bond; despite Edward's best effort to avoid her. Edward seems to have a nack for saving Bella, so Bella discovers his secret: he's a vampire! The two form a romance but Edward has to resist the urge to bite Bella. The Cullens themselves are the vampire version of vegetarians; feeling on animals, not people. They try and live in human society as best there can but do have to move every few years. In Forks a few people are killed by a strange creature, it's obvious what it is, which threatens their existence in the town.<br/><br/>I admit I am not the target market and I such Twilight fans and teenage girls love this film. I got a New Moon poster with my Empire magazine and I offered it to my 14-year-old half-niece who happily accepted it. I personally don't understand the hate for it though by so sector: I take this view if you don't like it don't watch it, and you can only have a real opinion if you do watch it. It tells a romantic story, not a horror or action story. I would have prefer to see the action/horror story more, but that's my taste.<br/><br/>There are good and bad points to this film. I will start with the good. Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson are both very good young actor and do play their roles with conviction. They are both a little too moody, but somehow you are compelled by them. They do play the role like a more realistic young couple, despite the fact one of them is a vampire. There is also a decent supporting cast, like Ashley Greene, Nikki Reed (who is very easy on the eye in this film), Taylor Lautner and Billy Burke. I admit I had low expectations but watching the film I think most of the actors did well. The film also had a very good indie director, Catherine Hardwicke, to direct. She is very good at directing dark themed subject, I personally recommend Thirteen. She films a very darkly lite, moody film. There are some good shots in the film. She plays to her strengths as a director. Other elements I liked was that the high school was simply a normal school; there were no real groups like geeks, jocks, arty types, etc..., nor are all the students thinking about sex or being played as stereotypes. The vampires are not traditional, they can stand in daylight, they can live in normal society without being noticed and be normal characters, and they have a range of abilities as well as traditional things like super strength. The soundtrack is also not bad.<br/><br/>But there are problems with the film. It has some slow pacing and some elements, like the high school stuff plays out for too long. The story does focus on the romance, but there should also show the threat from the other vampires attacking the town. They could still have been a romantic story at it's heart, but they should be some sort of adventure to make the story a little more exciting. It just needed a little more action. With a bit of action it would have kept the female audience but also appeal to the male audience as well. The film was also made on a low budget for a film then required special effects and it makes the film suffer. Some elements like Edward climbing the tree, or jumping effort did look cheap and not well done.<br/><br/>Some people have complained that the film tells a story of abstinence. So what? It's better then a message telling young girls to give it away easily. Isn't it better to wait for when someone is ready for a relationship? Also the theme of resisting your urges in nothing new in vampire stories. The Blade series is a very good example of them, or the Park Chan-wook film Thirst.<br/><br/>Overall, an okay film. It had potential, but could have done more with it. 3 out of 5."
"ippongirl1982","4","0","2","4 December 2009"," Like the book I thought only the last quarter was any good
","I'm not a huge fan of the books, I ended up picking up the first one to complete a 3 for 2 offer when buying Christmas presents. The book was OK, but I think directed at younger girls than me, I'm 26. Although enjoyable enough I thought it only got interesting after the baseball game.<br/><br/>I think the film is pretty much the same. Both leads are quite wooden but then again the characters in the book were kind of the same, so they're actually pretty accurate. I actually liked the whole sparkling thing, in my head when reading the book it had looked really garish but I think the film handled it well. Being a 12 rating in the UK I knew it wouldn't be violent in the final fight and it didn't need to be. The film looked good and I liked that the other kids in the school were normal looking, not all model pretty people like Gossip Girl. I assume this was to make the vampires look more attractive and it worked, but I still thought it was a nice touch. The acting wasn't great but I've seen worse. The only one I thought looked wrong was Carlisle. The others were pale but to me his look was obviously lots of makeup so it just looked strange.<br/><br/>My main problem with it is that even though the three ""bad"" vampires were introduced far earlier it didn't create any suspense so I didn't think it was necessary. And then in the final showdown, the only bit of the book i would have considered remotely like action, it seemed slow and stagnant with again no build up of tension. The initial meet on the baseball field was done really well and the escape was pretty good but there was no tension built up before the fight. Even if they added in the scene from the book where Bella decides to slip away from the others it would have helped but there was nothing.<br/><br/>All in all not the worst film I've ever seen but certainly not the best. I didn't get an emo vibe from it but it was definitely aimed at teenage and pre teen girls. I would have given it 2 but because I'm not its target audience I bumped it up a bit."
"etudiantemo","7","0","3","25 November 2009"," beautiful shot
","I've not read the book and nearly one year after its release date, I decided to go cinema to watch it. Almost everyone around me has seen this movie and given positive comments on it, so I am a little bit confused when seeing the score on IMDb is only 5.9. As far as I am concerned, the plot seems simple: A vampire and a human being fall in love with each other, and for the plot's sake, the heroine unconditionally offers full trust on his lover and even his family though it sounds dangerous. Anyway, all the shots were beautifully made and all the acts impeccably choreographed. The protagonists must have been with thick make-up, but it doesn't matter at all. The vampire shall be solitary due to immortal youth, but staying young forever is engrossing. From aesthetic perspective, love between a vampire and a human being can be more intriguing than fairy tale. Since the story happens to a group of teenagers, I am not young enough to enjoy it too much."
"sedativchunk","6","0","2","23 November 2009"," Why all the hype?
","In the past few years, I've really gotten into the modern vampire scene on television. From CBS's Moonlight to HBO's awesome True Blood, I thought I would check out Twilight being a fan of vampire TV shows. Not to mention, I am also a big fan of movies and write a lot of reviews for them.<br/><br/>Twilight is an interesting vampire movie and it grabs your attention only to let go in the middle of the movie. The movie is about a high school girl that moves to a new town and attends a new school with various mixed social groups. She discovers a group of weird kids who like to keep to themselves. Coincidentally, she takes an ecology class with one of the weird kids, and the story takes off from there. This is where the story and movie was actually good. The build up of the girl finding out about this strange kid she met. He saves her life on multiple occasions and eventually she finds out he is a vampire. <br/><br/>Now where the story goes downhill. The build up of finding out the guy was a vampire was good, but then the execution of things afterward, everything starts to slip. The movie gets very silly and the story line has many loop holes. She visits the vampires house and family, and most of them are already willing to accept here as a member of their family. Let me say that again... most of them were willing to accept her as a member of her family! Are you kidding me? Hundred year old vampires and they just are totally cool with this other vampire taking in a girl he met in school a few weeks ago? Okay, but lets roll with it from there. As the movie continues, it just gets worse and worse. Eventually, they meet an enemy group of vampires and it just gets even worse from there.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the end of the movie, so I will just say this; Twilight Sucks. It seems to me like too many unnecessary things were in the movie and the movie was executed in a way where parts of the movie are executed well and then other parts were rushed. I think the hype over this movie was just from young girls being obsessed with the main vampire in the movie. Overall, Twilight is worth a watch, but don't expect to be blown away. Beyond the story, the camera, lighting, and technical features of the movie were very nice, however, one thing was missing; where are the vampire's fangs?! We see some biting in the movie, but I missed the fangs. Music wise, some parts nice, some parts annoying. Artistically, this is a nice movie, but the story just sucks too much for me."
"esorenson-2","9","0","4","22 November 2009"," Beautiful (but a bit long)
","The music, cinematography, acting, and dialog were wonderful. I enjoyed a complete lack of ""Hollywood banality"". It was all believable. It pulled you in. However, I found the movie to be a bit long. I think it was really two movies. The first movie was her finding out what he was and them working it out. The second movie was a standard good cop vs. bad cop action movie, with vampires instead of cops. The first movie was done differently from anything I had ever seen before and was very exciting. The second movie was standard fare and therefore less exciting. I have not read the books. Perhaps when you start making a series of movies from a book series, the movies tend to be long. The Lord of the Rings movies were. In summary, a bit long, but beautifully done, in fact a work of art."
"joemovies-2","5","0","2","27 October 2009"," Like a straight board
","All i can say about this movie is that it is like a board, in other words its like someone telling you a story but keeping at the same pace all the way through. No excitement or any parts that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I haven't read the book yet but i believe if this was directed by someone with better potential the movie will be more than just a chick's flick. I don't know if either the director was fired or not but its a good they changed it to Paul Weitz (American Pie, Golden Compass). I believe he'll most probably will do a better job. However i'm looking forward to the third movie directed by David Slade (30 days of night). That is what a vampire movie should be. 30 days of night was a simple but entertaining flick. <br/><br/>Also the actors especially the main actress i'm looking forward to the day she wins an Oscar (if she ever will even get close to any nominations). All the way through the movie its like she's repeating the same actions over & over. They should just get her to act one scene then reuse that scene all the way through the movie.<br/><br/>For me i don't really care much about the acting or the actors in a movie as long as they suit their characters (dont' expect them to be Oscar winners) because the actors/actresses only have about 10% impact on the movie. Most important is getting the RIGHT DIRECTOR telling the story in a way that keeps the audience coming out pleased."
"pearl_4","10","0","5","15 October 2009"," A great movie that IS NOT just for teens
","Right, I've read quite a few comments before I have decided to add mine. I watched the movie last night and OMG I really enjoyed it. Everything about it was great. I think the main leads were fantastic, supporting actors were well chosen and the main thing.... it made me feel like a 16-year-old girl again. Well, I am not 17 for a start. I am in my late twenties and maybe that's why I managed to enjoy it - I still remember what it's like to have a head full of dreams. Common' people, most of the sarcastic comments are really unnecessary and undeserved. It is a very touching and beautiful love story. It sounds like some people are giving negative reviews for the sake of being different, same people were shouting ""Dull! Boring! No spark!"" watching ""Romeo and Juliet"" back in the Shakespearian time. I've never read the book and I most definitely will do now: if the film was so great then I can only imagine what the book is going to be like! I didn't know until this morning that the film made such a fuss in America and it seems to be a common opinion that it is mainly because of sexy and vamp (!) Edward. Not so sure though it's out of question - he is VERY GOOD-LOOKING. Well, don't know how others feel but to me the secret of the success lies in the quality of the relationships between main characters. It is at least refreshing to see a male figure that IS NOT weak/self-obsessed/sex- obsessed/unintelligent. He is protective of his woman and it is the straightest way to a woman's heart. He is a gentleman and a good role model. I don't think this movie should be taken too seriously - it wasn't made to be compared to ""Save Private Ryan"". It is a great entertainment and I would recommend it to all my friends."
"dust-7","Null","0","2","11 October 2009"," Book pages omitted - but, gosh - this is a MOVIE!
","Lots of reviews here and elsewhere lament the missing pages, or changed plot. Well, if this were Lord of the Rings, they might have a point. But Signs, or Twilight? Maybe even the Time-Travelers Wife (or life? or whatever). There are some well-reviewed novels that make it to film. But . . Twilight? So for films like this I say - the book, who cares about the book? The missing pages . . nobody ever read them to begin with. The changed plot . . what plot, except that one sees on screen. I think that's being more than fair. THERE IS NO BOOK! never was - least not for this kind of book.<br/><br/>Then to take the film for what it is, for what's on screen, I DO agree with many reviews posting here. These aren't vampires. They are something with super-hero strength and the ability to leap (which I thought was the werewolf thing, or the wire-fu thing), who don't age (like Dorian Gray), but who aren't affected by sunlight and who don't really get evil vampire Nosferatu faces or really big teeth. But they do suck necks.<br/><br/>The plot is about a young-leading-effeminate man o the 21st century, I suppose, who is a super-hero vampire and has some school chums and others who are, as well. He saves the life of a girl at school - with his super-hero skills. She's surprised, wants to know more, and . . well, she's just so purty that the fact she's a bimbo and airhead, otherwise, is of apparently no concern.<br/><br/>So they all go play baseball in the middle of nowhere, at dusk. And out of the trees off in the distance comes this trio of growed-up vampires. One is a real freak who sniffs out the airhead and says - hey, that's a snack. Me wants! But the 21st-century man says, she's mine, and this is ours, and you gots to go. So the freak chases him and airhead as they try to escape in their pickup or SUV, I forget.<br/><br/>That is, 21st and airhead decide to make a run. But first thing freak does is go to Mom's house. He picks up on airhead's cell after she had been talking to Mom. We naturally assume Mom is dead. Next up would be Dad. But apparently freak vampire never makes it that far. He tells airhead, get away from doze guys and meet me in an abandoned school you attended as a kid. Mom lives if you do. She says basically, oh thank you Mr. Psycho vampire killer for being so honest and oh, heck yeahs, I'll meet you in an abandoned building at night just as quick as I can, just you betcha.<br/><br/>So she gets beat up, and as freak is about to do her in then 21st century come crashing in and picks a fight. Some of the others of his gang show up. Airhead is all bloodied and near death - or 'the turn' - so much so that one of the girl 'vampires' can barely contain her 'hunger'. Needlesstosay, they take out freak, burn up his corpse in a corner, and airhead is next seen in the hospital.<br/><br/>They conclude this - movie - by 21st and airhead going to the prom. And the final scene has an ally of freak in an upstairs window looking down on the happy couple - just you wait (for the sequel?).<br/><br/>This film was apparently a big hit with the 'tweens'. A sad commentary on adolescent tastes heading toward 2010. It's not even so much the idea of 'good vampirism', which is frightening enough. Even Mr. 21st-century has to refer to himself as a 'monster' at the very end, just to remind the audience what part he's supposed to be playing. What's worse is just the stupidity of the heroine. She IS the girl who falls on the path as the villain is giving chase. She IS the one to walk alone upstairs and slowly turns the knob on the closed door. She's the one making the long-winded speech out in the open with the killer monsters closing in. And so on. And in those films, you tend to root against that stupidity. And that's the catch. It brings that out, intentionally, in the audience - rooting for a character to be brutally murdered. And it's not a good thing."

","I am a huge fan of the twilight saga books and I was looking forward to see the film. I was disappointed, especially with Kristen Stewart's acting, she was so dull and boring, she had no personality at all, in the books she had quite a dry sense of humour but in the movie she was more like a zombie, I expected so much more from the leading actress. I thought all the other characters were good and were close to how I imagined they would be.<br/><br/>I think too many things were missed out of the movie, you couldn't see how besotted they were with each other, in the book they couldn't be apart because it would hurt too much, but you couldn't see this in the movie, they looked like regular everyday dating teenagers, when they were supposed to be so much more.<br/><br/>The movie was okay but it had the potential to be brilliant and it wasn't.

"klara_933","7","0","5","1 October 2009"," It's not that bad!!!!!!
","Can everyone please stop saying that it's like the worst movie ever made!! It's sort of hurting my feelings to read all of your comments....It's not the best movie ever either, but the thing about it is that it feels real. It's like the only love story (that I've seen so far) except Titanic that feels that way to me. I think that many of the haters are fans that thought the movie would be exactly like the book and then became very disappointed. But it's probably also people that are really annoyed by us fans and our devotion to the books, movie and so on. The ones that actually thought that it was a really bad movie might be those who don't like that they're not classic vampires and stuff like that. It's not a fantasy movie, it's a romance movie. But you can't really appreciate it if you don't know the characters because that's what makes the whole story. You might have to read the books and watch the movie several times before you can like it, it was like that for me. Kristen Stewart is not an awful actress. Her body language is really good and her voice is also great. Sometimes it feels though as her facial expression is not the best. But I do think that she did a wonderful job in the ballet studio scene. Twilight has changed me to a much better person than I was before. Characters like Carlisle and Edward have made me think. I'm a lot more honest than before for an example, I was almost like a dead person too. I didn't like anything and all I ever thought about was school and that's not a happy person. And please stop calling Edward a pedophile, because he's not. Think about let the right one in. It's sort of the same situation in that movie/book, only that it is the other way around. She's an old vampire trapped in a young body and he is like 12, but no one seems to think that about them.<br/><br/>Apologies for my bad English:D"
"scottslittlerookie","7","0","3","23 September 2009"," Pretty Good
","I've read a lot of negative reviews about this movie. Was the acting a bit cheesy, yes. Was the action over the top, yes. However, I watched the movie before I read the books. I was bored one night so I rented it and watched it. It was pretty good, in my opinion. When I finished the books, I went back and re-watched it just to see what I'd think of it now. This kind of story have never really fancied my tastes, even though I love vampire novels. But I was surprised at the fact that this did pique my interest.<br/><br/>First off, I don't see what all the complaining is about. It's a teenage drama/romance, so we can't expect Oscar gold with it. It is what it is, which is a decent love story that teens (and maybe even adults) can enjoy. So I think all the complaining needs to stop on that front. Of course it's kind of cheesy, but who cares, that's the fun of it.<br/><br/>There were some crucial scenes from the book that I would have liked to have seen put to screen. For instance, in the book, we see Edward and Bella in a meadow where she they're having the ""lion and lamb"" conversation. As they're preparing to leave, Edward tosses her on his back and inhales her scent from her wrist. Then before running off, he says something about it getting easier to deal with the thirst. The kiss, I think should have stayed in the meadow where it belonged. I didn't see any reason to put in Bella's bedroom.<br/><br/>I really think there should have been a distinction between the prom and the girls choice dance (which is totally left out in the movie). I know they couldn't put everything in and despite my few complaints about the movie, all in all it wasn't as bad as I'd thought.<br/><br/>The cinematography isn't quite to my taste, too many close ups, but still for what it was I did like it.<br/><br/>Though there were somethings that were left out of the movie, I think fans of the books should go see this anyway, with an open mind of course. The main points of the book are covered in the movie, which in the end is what won me over after I'd read them. The meadow scene is a short scene in the movie, in the books it lasts pretty much all day. But it's there and all of Edwards famous lines from the book are there. Including the ""world perfect predator"" and the ""lion and lamb"". James and his hunt for Bella are there as well. The things that were left out weren't too much of a disappointment to me. The essence of the story is still there.""Human girl falls in love with vampire"". They captured the main scenes from the book and made sure that the underlying story is pretty much the same. If you have a Blu-Ray player, I highly suggest getting the movie that way. You'll get some deleted and extended scenes. I would prefer to see a Director's Cut that has everything they've removed put back in.<br/><br/>All in all, I gave it a 7 due to the few complaints that I did have. It's not a perfect 10, but what can you expect? Like I said, I'll continue to go see the movies and buy them when they come out. Pretty good and I'm happy to have experienced the story."

","Ah, the much debated vampire movie based on that ever popular book series. Now, I'll be up front and totally honest with you: I had no desire to see this movie. Based on the previews, the plot and the, let's be honest here, overall demographic of fans (insane preteen/teen girls) of this series, I didn't think it was for me.<br/><br/>But there's this guy I was working with at the time who assured me it wasn't nearly as girly as it was made out to be and I should give it a shot. So I did and, frankly, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Do I still get all the hoopla? Not really. I understand the Harry Potter craze (and still easily prefer the boy wizard over this stuff), but I just don't get the craziness surrounding this.<br/><br/>The movie was entertaining and and well done for the most part, but if I were so inclined, I could probably rip it to shreds. But I found myself drawn into the story and the acting was decent enough, so it didn't bore me to tears for two hours.<br/><br/>My main problem was actually that there didn't seem to be much conflict until the end when it was as if the movie decided ""Hey, we're making a movie about vampires here, we better have some bad guys fight some good guys"", and seemed a bit rushed. Of course, this is just part one of a larger story, so I'm sure that plays into it, but I was just viewing it as one movie, not a part of a larger whole.<br/><br/>Anyways, the movie was enjoyable enough that I'll probably check out the sequel but not mind blowingly awesome that I'll check it out the moment it hits theaters."

","The first time I saw this movie I was brand new to everything Twilight. I had not read the books and really didn't know much about them or the movie. I remember leaving the theatre intrigued, entertained and wanting more, but felt like they could have stepped it up a bit especially in relation to the special effects. Since that first screening, I have now read the books and seen the movie at least 5 more times. I, like so many others, devoured the books and have definitely grown to love the movie as well. You can't watch a movie repeatedly if it is crap. I absolutely adore the music and the story and although it can't completely capture the tension and yearning of such a moving love story that the books are easily able to convey, I think that it does do a great justice to it. I feel that the director and actors did a wonderful job and I believe in each of them. This picture is lovely and moved me as well as making me laugh and enjoy myself, and as I said previously, it is a continuing pleasure to watch."

","OK so not a great film to some, but to others a good vampire love film. A good cast, and storyline and for those who are big fans of the books you will know it does stick to the original book closely. Robert Pattinson from Harry Potter 4 shows he can act and do a good American accent. Kristen Stewart is on top form in this film, she and Pattinson are on their way to the top of movies and cinema alike.<br/><br/>Great action, and of course to me a superb soundtrack including Paramore and even Pattinson's own music which I must admit is great. I'm a guy so I did not expect much from a romantic teen movie, but I was immediately drawn to this and could not tear my eyes from the cinema screen when I went to see it. Do I recommend it to almost any movie goer, maybe not but at least give it a try for the fare of renting it from a video store or indeed on cable go for it, if you don't like it you don't lose much.

","What is it with vampires?! ‚Äì now that the empire has declined and fallen it seems we have this universal need to crowd all that we don't understand, all that we desire but fear, into a comprehensible whole ‚Äì vampires: the Other made flesh - feared and beautiful, like a religion, or a nation. Then this plastic mould can be fitted to anything at all ‚Äì so why not a lightweight teenage high school romance? ‚Äì as long as it knows what it is and doesn't have pretensions beyond its abilities, of course.<br/><br/>Now I've learned there's a whole cultish book series behind this film, some things make sense that didn't when I'd just seen it. It wasn't that I found the story confusing ‚Äì it's not that deep! ‚Äì but that I couldn't understand why some characters were in it, why they were being shown to me. They seemed to have no purpose. But other things bug me more.<br/><br/>In some ways they got it so right ‚Äì the way Bella looks at Edward, with a mixture of awe, fear and the kind of lust that belongs exclusively to teenagers; the misty Washington setting; the casual high school chatter; the inclusion of Jacob and his Quileute family for a bit of mystical interest ‚Äì but in others they got it so, so wrong. Edward is very beautiful indeed ‚Äì but he's too beautiful, he doesn't appear to have any imperfections at all (unless his love for ‚Äì and lust for ‚Äì a human could be said to be his fatal flaw). He's the boy girls draw on their notebooks if they can draw, and dream about if they can't. So I don't buy that he's waited all this time for Bella to come along; that he's, in effect, Sleeping Beauty to Bella's Prince. I don't buy that, if he's so hot and desirable, all the high school girls don't hate Bella for being the one girl ‚Äì the first ‚Äì to go where they couldn't. I felt that for all the idea was cute, the film would have benefited from a bit more visual style, some directing flair, which would have perhaps made it easier to 'buy' all the unbelievable bits.<br/><br/>That said I thoroughly enjoyed watching it for the lightweight entertainment it is, and will definitely be watching the inevitable sequel. But next time I'd be happy with some sharper dialogue, and can we please have some serious competition for Saint Edward? Can someone tell me why I'm supposed to like any of Edward's 'family'? Can something interesting happen to the characters that seem to drift purposelessly through this film ‚Äì such as Bella's lonely dad and Jacob, out in the cold on the rez?"

I like the fact that they kept a lot of the scenes! But I think one of the problems is all the talk about Robert Pattinson, like hes so hot and blah blah blah... He makes a good Edward, but I noticed that a lot of people only like the movie because of him. That's not that good. Anyway, i really like the cast, and most of the characters is just like I imagined.

","I prefer Harry Potter in every way over Twilight. Twilight was like watching Days of our Lives but with awful special effects and vampires. I don't know how people could be obsessed with this. I liked the book, but the film was a mediocre attempt. I know the sequel New Moon, directed by Chris or Paul Weitz, will be better. The Plot: Bella is a teenager moving from Arizona. She moves to Forks, Washington, a dark, cold , wet place. While there, she meets Edward and his family. The Cullen family are all vampires. She is soon attracted to Edward and his dangerousness. Until she is brought to danger. Twilight is a film with many flaws. It has bad special effects, un cared about characters, and poor dialogue. I will give it some credit tough. I like Kirsten Stewart and Billy Burke. That's the only reason why I give it five stars. If I saw it again, I would think of more reasons why I like it. I also liked the last half hour of the film, because it got intense. Those are the only reason why I give it five stars. I also don't like Robert Pattinson. If Rob Pattinson and Daniel Radcliffe got in a fight, I would cheer for Daniel Radcliffe. I like Daniel Radcliffe more and he's a better actor. I'm not recommending Twilight. But if you are at a rental store and are sent to find a film and there is nothing there, then I suppose you could rent Twilight. But try to skip it if you can."
"Flyer78","6","0","2","27 July 2009"," Enjoyable film, but nothing you would go out of your way to see.
","Twilight is infamous for being infested by mindless fangirls, and for being a saga without a decent plot. I was one of the people that had a tendency to talk down on the ultra-popular phenomenon. But then I decided I would give the film adaptation a chance, and I wasn't disappointed. I was underwhelmed, to be more accurate. But to be fair, it's very easy to be underwhelmed by a film of this nature because it received loads of hype. So when you sit down and actually watch it, your expectations are very high. This film, as predicted, did not reach those expectations.<br/><br/>My first gripe about Twilight was that it seemed too long. Telling the story of how an adolescent girl finds out that an adolescent boy is a vampire, then falling in love with him should not take over 2 hours. But then again, it's understandable because the book is fairly long, and there would be lots of complaints if certain scenes did not go into the movie adaptation. But still, somewhere around 115 minutes would have been better.<br/><br/>The acting surely isn't the best you will ever see, but I've seen lots worse as well. The film had a good cast of young actors, and Robert Pattinson was the film's standout. I think if he stays focused and keeps his head on straight, Pattinson might just be one of the acting elite in the future. Kristen Stewart's acting was nothing more than okay, and left a lot to be desired in my opinion. Everyone else did a pretty good job.<br/><br/>This film also had some pretty cool action scenes, but nothing in the league of The Matrix, Kill Bill, or anything like that.<br/><br/>Twilight has its flaws, but on the plus side of things, it's entertaining and original.<br/><br/>6/10"

The way that the movie was filmed was really very unique, for example when they would show footage of Bella it was generally brighter, but when they showed footage of the vampires is was generally darker. 2. One reason why i did not like this movie was that the action was so fake that it literally made me want to hurl. 3. The only thing in my opinion that kept(me as the viewer) wanting to keep watching was the my strong hope that the movie would eventually get better(it didn't). 4.

","I'm a fan of the books. But I wasn't as excited to see the movie like the other million girls where. I didn't see it in theaters because almost EVERY single girl in my town between the ages of 10-16 couldn't wait to see it. I rented it, and to admit, I was slightly disappointed. Some scenes were great, like the final action scene. But they were only great. Other times I wondered what the heck are they doing. <br/><br/>Robert Pattinson CAN be a little pretty, but only with loads of make-up and computer editing. Taylor Lautner (Excuse me if I've misspelled) was surely the best character match anyone could have gotten. All the extras were better than the main characters.<br/><br/>People think Kristen Stewart is a bad actor. Well, I disagree. She's acted along side Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster and many other big-name stars. She does great.<br/><br/>Something I hated more than anything--WHERE'S THE ROMANCE?! This is supposed to be about LOVE! The whole time I was thinking 'Okay, so, does she like him?' It looks like they're making their own movie, not by the book. And Stephanie was there the whole time, helping the with the movie. She was IN the movie!<br/><br/>Catherine Hardwicke was a shame to Stephanie's books. Chris Weitz --Have I spelled it right?

","Why did I watch this film you might ask. I never read the books and it's not my style. If I know I won't like a film, I at least give it a chance, it could have some redeeming factors. If it's well made I note it, well acted, so on etc. I watched this with a buddy of mine. We had a good laugh.<br/><br/>The film is pretty bad. Let's start off with the cast.<br/><br/>Stewart is alright, she plays a wooden character who falls in love with this guy, played by Pattinson, who is a vampire. You know he's a vampire because when he hits the sunlight....he glitters. I'm not lying.<br/><br/>This love connection, if you can call it that, is not believable at all. These two have no chemistry and the dialogue between the two is laughable. I don't see the sex appeal of this guy. He looks incredibly goofy here and his so called acting will turn you off. The whole story relies on the audience believing that these two are in love. This film doesn't pull that off and pushes it too quickly. They tell each other they love the other within a week, at least that's what I got out of it.<br/><br/>The special effects are horrendous. Something that a blind guy can pull off in his basement. The ""speed"" of the vampire is cringe-worthy. Should I mention the lack of fangs? Or how about how bad the fight sequences are choreographed. It looked like they were dancing instead of trying to kill each other. Speaking of the fight sequence, it involves the so called 'bad-guy', another Vampire called James. He literally comes out of nowhere no development, no sense of who he is and the risks for the characters are no longer there.<br/><br/>The story is interesting, yet done before. The entire film is a teenage melodrama with vampires added in. I like the back story the have going, which isn't explored, but most likely will be in the sequels. The Cullens (vampire family) was interesting and I liked how they looked out for each other. The film doesn't get the least bit interesting until the other vampires show up to a baseball game. Yup, the most interesting scene in the film is a baseball game.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the horrible music.<br/><br/>I will say this though, I'll watch the next one in the hopes they get interesting and go somewhere. But if it's as bad and laughable as this trash, consider me done with it."

But, I'm an avid reader and have been spoiled by the greats and expect nothing less if its been published. If you're into a good read, then skip the books and just wait for the movies. I give it an 8 out of 10 just because the poor director and producer had to decipher all her terrible writing to make this into a decent movie. Good job~"

"brooklynelle","6","0","3","15 July 2009"," For a book with so much film potential...
","Twilight was an engaging book. The entire series captivated hundreds of thousands of people, all of the books climbing on the best seller list. Why then, when the book was transformed to the big screen, was the film given such a small, inadequate budget? The movie, I felt, lost all of the qualities that made the book so great (it was no literary masterpiece, don't get me wrong, just entertaining). The characters were poorly developed I thought, but this is often a complication that arises when translating written words to spoken. The book was captivating, for people that it attracted, it was impossible to put down. Having been a fan of the books, I expected the same from the movie: something that I would have trouble tearing my eyes away from. I was confronted with the exact opposite, the movie almost boring, despite the action in a few scenes and the goo goo eyes between Kristen Stewart (Bella) and Robert Pattinson (Edward).<br/><br/>Perhaps the best advice I can give viewers who have yet to see the film and were fans of the book is, look at it as a completely different entity. This movie may have the same basic plot and storyline as the book you loved and adored, but it lacks all that makes the book great. The acting is sub par, and Kristen Stewart seems to have the same facial expression throughout the entire book whereas the Bella we expected may not have been as three dimensional as one could hope, she certainly had more than a scowl on her face.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie had poor special effects because of the small budget. I look towards the sequel with higher hopes, but I don't expect to be satisfied. Expect letdowns and disappointment when watching this movie, if you've read the books. If you haven't, watch it expecting nothing, and you might escape unscathed."

The movie is a different sort of romance movie as it concerns a human-vampire relationship. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart display the right amount of on-screen chemistry as Edward Cullen and Bella Swan respectively to be an effective on-screen duo; in other words,their roles were well cast.Other cast members such as Taylor Lautner, Cam Gigandet,Peter Facinelli,Nikki Reed and Billy Burke among others performed well in the supporting cast."

"griffinfinity","5","0","3","5 July 2009"," Interesting take on the genre, but definitely not horror based...
","Many elements of 'Twilight' have been explored in other vampire movies. One might gather that this film has little to offer. Not so. There are also several old rules that get tossed out the window here, and that makes for an interesting film. The objective is not fright and blood. It is certainly not ritual (unless you include baseball). And the only relation to 'Lost Boys' is found in the 'new kid on the block' story line. So on to the good and the bad (no ugly in 'Twilight'). It is definitely a film with Barbie, Ken and their teenage daughters in mind. But fans of the genre might just be entertained.<br/><br/>Since it was based on a novel, there was plenty of obligatory set-up work to be handled. Director Catherine Hardwicke does so while maintaining a smart pace. She is able to move onto, well, just the potatoes I'm afraid, without dragging her feet. The story is set mainly in the Pacific Northwest. This allows for a nice compromise between the old day/night conflicts of most vampire adventures.<br/><br/>Some of what is found in 'Twilight' is a cross between a series on the WB and 'The Bold and the Beautiful'. The vampires contained within 'Twilight' are for the most part quite affable. And as odd as it may seem, the notion of a vampire maintaining a strictly vegetarian diet is not a new one. But it does tend to water things down. And while there is a side order of hearty munchers included, it doesn't quench one's thirst for, well, vampirism.<br/><br/>In as much as vampire movies go, 'Twilight' is aiming for a radical departure from the norm. Given that, and as a fan of the genre, my interest was maintained. I enjoyed the setting of the film, as well as the 'new' elements as to what vampires can and cannot do. Let's see what the next chapter brings."

","The movie definitely had potential. Some of the major shortfalls were do to the screen writing and directing. The movie should have followed the storyline better. Nothing is more disappointing to the reader than the anticipation of seeing a movie of a book they found fascinating just to be disappointed because the story was changed and condensed.<br/><br/>The movie was too condensed and deserved a longer run time. There were too many elements missing and made the viewer feeling ""hungry"" for more.<br/><br/>One important flaw was the characters were not developed enough. I would have given a better score if it had not been poor character development. There again a longer run time could have provided the opportunity for a more through character definition. Overall, the casting, in my opinion, was excellent, especially Edward and Alice.<br/><br/>In the book, the character Edward is impossibly charming and I'm sure Robert Pattinson is capable of demonstrating if he had been giving the chance. (I really wanted to see more of the alluring ""crooked smiles"".) In regards to the music, well, it was a little slow and dragging. (Yawn!) A more energetic sound track along along with better slower pieces would be fantastic.<br/><br/>There were also scenes of unintentionally awkward silences in the movie which was too painful to watch.<br/><br/>There were some highlights to movie I found enjoyable and that was the scene with the baseball game. The music was exciting, fast, and radiating. The music definitely enhanced the exciting and ""electrifying"" game. (No pun intended. Well, maybe a little.)

","Ever since I saw the film clip with Edward saying something along the lines of ""better hang on, Spider Monkey,"" I knew this film would be a fail. However, I was happily surprised by a few aspects, though most of the time the film just confirmed my disappointment.<br/><br/>Firstly, Robert Pattinson is almost EXACTLY how I thought Edward should be in the books. The moment I read about Edward in Twilight I imagined Robert Pattinson. Besides that, he did a wonderful job portraying Edward, I thought. He fell a little flat every once in a while, but for a vampire who never got close to a human, I say he fleshed that out pretty well.<br/><br/>As for the other lead, I can't say the same, even if I was forced at gunpoint. Kristen Stewart fits Bella when it comes to physical aspects, and that's about it. Only a wooden plank wouldn't cringe at her performance. If it was a problem of facial expression, one would only need to close his or her eyes whenever she was on screen, but she spoke lines like they well, were lines. The scene where they come upon the police station after going to the restaurant jumps to mind, when Kristen performed the Award-Winning ""What is going on?"" <br/><br/>Apart from acting, Hardwicke does have an eye for beautiful imagery, but much of her camera angling doesn't really help. Many times you see the copious amounts of make up stand out, and the ballet room scene screams of cables holding the actors up. The effect of Edward running up a mountain was quite cheesy to me.<br/><br/>Hopefully for the next movie, Taylor Lautner will be able to shine as Jacob Black, as well as the rest of the werewolves. Other than that, I hope the new director at least tried to get Kristen to look alive."

A perfect, handsome, loving and maybe a bit more than expected gentleman vampire. <br/><br/>The first time I watched the movie, I was definitely not dazzled by the character portrayed by Robert Pattinson. He seemed to be reluctant and hesitant. His voice was slurry and it definitely didn't have the charm which Edward was supposed to have. At least five times I felt the urge of shutting down my laptop, watching the poor portrayal of Edward. <br/><br/>I found Kristen play the perfect Bella (9/10 at least). The remaining characters were also fairly well cast (except for Carlisle who didn't look better than Edward as supposed to). Kristen played her part quite well. Her voice had good modulations. Though her eyes weren't always quite expressive, I didn't mind it because Bella's character is never portrayed as one who shows what she feels. <br/><br/>I had to watch the movie a second time - this time with no prejudices or expectations - so that I could form unbiased opinions. Bella again seemed perfect. I had to look beyond Edward to praise Robert. Suddenly I found that Robert did look good - I know he does look good but I had some out of the world expectations for the character of Edward. His expressions did speak. He did seem genuinely in love with Bella but again, his voice betrayed him. It wasn't a perfect tone that sounded like a melody, rather it seemed to be broken into pieces and patched together. His voice didn't dazzle me. Edward was supposed to be muscular. Robert was no where near to the term muscular. I was waiting for the meadow scene where I could catch a glimpse of his perfect glittering musculature. What I get to see is a body with excess of glitter powder rubbed on it and no muscles! Utter Disappointment! I also watched the trailer of New Moon and I feel that Edward's voice is probably sounding better. Jake looks good with all that muscles on him. I wonder why can't Robert take better control on his voice and work out a little. It would add a lot of character to Edward's role and no doubt, Robert would look even hotter than he is now!<br/><br/>The movie deviated a lot from the original story line, but I guess it was necessary for the film. However, some parts just didn't seem necessary. The part I utterly disliked was changing the last scene such that Carlisle asks Edward to stop drinking Bella's blood. In the book Edward stops as soon as he senses that Bella's blood is clean. He then states that He MUST REALLY LOVE HER because he actually could stop. This emotion is totally lost when the movie shows Carlisle making Edward's statements.<br/><br/>Please Robert, you could do us a little more justice by playing the character with a little more heart. I know that Robert was chosen over 3000 actors, but he is yet no where close to Edward.<br/><br/>A genuine request to the crew - please don't deviate from the book unless absolutely necessary. There were so many emotions which were lost in the making of a film. Though it is good, it still does not portray the emotions and the love and the intensity as it really should."
"sangeetha132001","5","0","2","22 June 2009"," the book and the movie
","I think this movie was not as good as the book. The beginning was good. But some things scenes have been put in a different way, which made it a bit boring. But then the baseball scene was just too good with lots of effects to add to it. The blue tint used in the movie gave a feeling that something's lurking around, and it was perfect for a vampire movie to give chills and the sound effects were good enough to make the viewers expect something to happen. But then for a romance, I feel that it doesn't suit that well. Some of the scenes- well I think the actors could've done better than that. It was obvious at some places, that they were acting. And like usual, this is a movie based on a novel so many parts of the story/novel has been deleted... An then there was less idealization of the main vampire in the movie and therefore, not like the book. The ending was just too perfect and make the first-time viewers especially the ones who haven't read the book, think that danger is still lurking and has not come to an end."

(baseball scene, bella meeting them for the first time, etc) oh and as for Rosalie i thought she was going to be so much prettier the book made her out to be gorgeous and in the movie she was just all right.. oh and they left out jaspers ""power"" they have to use that in the third book ! i hope the second book is better with a new director and all"

","If you can forgive the MTV production, and its High School Musical tit-bits you may just enjoy and be surprised by Twilight although the romance be a little too overpowering.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good on the whole but at times both Pattinson and Stewart are rather deadpan. The story does not really help with its love at first sight, I don't care your a vampire! But what else did I really expect? The story may be undeniably overly romantic but it has its moments of good contrast between light and dark moods, with its vampire aspect bringing obvious interest to proceedings. <br/><br/>The special effects are well-worked and the music is well crafted into the film. Hardwicke does well as a director and their is one scene where Bella leaves her father for fear of being attacked by a hunter vampire, and has to lie to him to make good her escape, which was managed and acted quite nicely. Having said that Hardwicke fails to give the film a more serious and engaging tone that I would have liked to have seen. <br/><br/>For all Twilight's wrongs it does have an allure. How will this Romeo-Juliet romance ever blossom considering their predicament? The most appealing aspect of Twilight for me is the world of the vampire and how it functions. Hopefully the sequel 'New Moon' can become a touch more grounded and provide more depth, but I sense that the youth to which it is marketed will not be prevented from their heavy dose of romance."

","Spoiler Alert The movie is similar to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode of ""Angel"" from the first season. We have the good vampire and the evil vampire that kills in the town. The good vampire is suspected of the killings and the good vampires helps the female lead when the evil vampire is trying to kill her. All these concepts are in that Buffy story and retold in this one. Some differences, Edward Cullen is faster than Angel, has skin like diamonds, has a family of Vampires and, of course, Buffy is much different than Bella. I though Pattinson was made to look like the Joker, without green hair. I have been little interested in watching more of Kristen Stewart who plays Bella since I saw this. But her unenthused, monotone delivery is quite distracting, so I didn't bother.<br/><br/>What the movie has is a good Director, Catherine Hardwick and a good cinematographer, Elliot Davis. The scenes for Bella's Lullaby are visually stunning. The scene where Bella first sees Edward sitting in the class and then walks in front of a fan, is also a little stunning, especially because of the sinister music that plays in it. The fight scene near the end, they managed to make Edward look kind of intimidating while he was struggling with the other vampire (if you can imagine a 130 pound or so guy as intimidating). If you have some spare time it is worth a view for camera work and directing."
"p-stepien","6","0","3","9 June 2009"," Entertainingly underwhelming
","Teen romance with a touch of vampirism definitely has potential and at times in this movie it actually worked nicely. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is a self-indulgent self-flagellating closed teenager, who moves to her father Charlie Swan (Billy Burke) mid-term, while her mother indulges into her second youth with her second husband. Bella might be dull, negative and basically no fun whatsoever, but school kids for some totally unknown reason flock to her.<br/><br/>Bella, the epicentre of teen-boy fantasies for reasons incomprehensible to the ordinary viewer, falls for the school weirdo and outsider Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Who of course is a 'veggie' vampire. Romance with corny scenes to boot commence with a not too suspenseful finale, where Edward tries to save Bella from one of his own.<br/><br/>I must admit the chemistry between Bella and Edward seems to work and for the most part the movie does entertain and actually does a good job at building up the love relationship with one quite enticing kissing scene, even though we have some really over-the-top corny scenes like hair being blown by the wind or the two teen lovers lying in a field looking at each other.<br/><br/>The place where the movie really loses it is in the final third, when man-sucking vampires appear. It is a welcome addition to keep the story flowing, but it is handled so awkwardly and felt so rushed, that by the end credits I was vastly underwhelmed."
"ennieday09","1","0","2","4 June 2009"," Good for lovers of the book, everyone else...not so much
","A movie like Twilight which of course is based on the highly acclaimed series of books by Stephanie Meyer, is a type of movie that will have a see-saw of different opinions. This movie had to be one of the most anticipated movies ever based on a series of books since the Harry Potter franchise. Teenage girls absolutely drooling over the fictional vampire hero Edward Cullen is a small taste of this pop-culture phenomenon. But enough about about the history lesson, the movie it self was mediocre. For those of you who say its a good movie JUST because you read the book and said it was amazing, then you have absolutely no say in a review about it. That is the biggest problem with this movie is that everyone is comparing it to the book when many who have seen the movie never heard of the series. For those who have read the book, including myself, i think its a great cast with the actors portraying the characters just as i had imagined them. I thought Kristen Stewart playing Bella was the best casting role they could have put in but of course, the acting was sub-par. One scene in particular i recall when Bella walks in front of the fan blowing her scent in front of Edward and then him covering his mouth pretty much summed up the acting quality of this movie. But all in all the movie followed the story of the book well and many of the other actors portrayed their character well. If you read the books, love the story i suggest you go see it. But if you have not or haven't even heard of the books by Stephanie Meyer, you'll probably get a feeling of what was the director of this movie thinking making this?? Average film at best."

","I'm sure that this film is a touchy subject for some... to the super-fans, to the avid book fans, and to both the fans and haters of strictly the movie. Of course it is not really fair to the film to compare the book and the movie because obviously there is only so much you can cram into 2 hours, and this is the movie we are talking about - not the book! 'Twilight' is enjoyable but is unfortunately watered down and doesn't really make a strong impact that lives up to the hype. Even though the film, like the book, is aimed for a teenage audience the PG-13 rating hurts the film and forces the film to stray away from building a strong relationship between Edward & Bella and also revealing the true beastly nature of the vampires. Of course, the rating doesn't make the film, but when it is used to water the film down for mass consumption it fails the truth of the story. Everything feels rushed, and it shouldn't be, after all this is meant to be a trilogy so there is plenty of time to paint the full picture. 'Twilight' could have really made an impression on cinema by giving us a film that would last through the years, but instead we are given a adequate adaptation that is obviously meant to give us just enough to come back for more and keep throwing out our money. Don't expect epic film making, because that is not what you are going to get."

","I watched this film after hearing how wonderful it was from all my friends - but I don't understand what was so amazing about it. Yes, it's a good film (from a 15 year old's perspective anyway) and I enjoyed it, but I've watched better ones. My favourite scene was the one where they all play baseball during the thunderstorm. I loved it. I really liked Carlisle, and Edward was quite good, but Bella just seems really ... strange - stranger than the vampires. After watching this film, I decided I should read the books. I finished the first two, and I think they are amazing, so much better than the film - I couldn't put them down. So if you've already read the books, try to forget them for awhile and watch the film without expecting it to equal the books. If you haven't read the books yet, watch the film first then read, to avoid disappointment."

","There was little doubt that Twilight was going to make millions at the box office. The books literally have become a phenomenon, with girls of all ages (and even some boys) delighting in their passionate, twisted love story. The inclusion of a vampire as the male lead was simply the extra dose of daydream fantasy that set the story on fire.<br/><br/>You probably know the plot. A young independent girl moves to a new town, meets and falls 'irrevocably' in love with a vampire, a member of a clan of strictly animal eaters. The fact that her blood is the most attractive blood said vampire has ever smelled (What a coincidence!) only heightens the passion.<br/><br/>Yet despite the steamy, sappy premise, the film somehow manages to make the relationship between the two leads truly captivating, much to the credit of the talented actors, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. The chemistry is positively electrifying between the two, and it's hard not to get excited about this complicated love affair. Despite more that their fair share of terrible lines ('You're like my own personal brand of heroin'), these two pull the whole thing off remarkably well.<br/><br/>The film certainly has its moments of pure silliness, and when the bad vampires come on screen (as they must) it really gets a little dumb. Despite the admittedly interesting inclusion of vampires, the movie has little gritty feel to it, which is unfortunate. Of course, it never has much hopes of moving beyond its harlequin premises, a fact reinforced by the inclusion of indie rock songs and the final scene being set at the high school prom. Ick. The movie never has aspirations beyond its pop culture material. However, the high school love affair themes are what made teenage girls lap it up.<br/><br/>Don't dismiss it immediately, though; Twilight isn't terrible. It has its high moments (and its lows), and the overall effect is satisfying. The emotion of the characters doesn't seem forced, and the human side of the story plays itself out pretty well. It never really seems like a real movie, but rather a somewhat cheaply-made book adaptation; which I guess is what it actually is. Honestly, though, the two leads truly recommend themselves, creating an utterly watchable romance. Their newly-discovered superstar status feels somehow deserved after this admirable effort. 5/10 stars...<br/><br/>Jay Addison"

I had my laughs around the movie from some of the jokes and from how the characters messed around at school and i think that it was cool to see how there's ""another side"" to the ""animal in the vampire"" Not the ""Biggest plot of the century"", but still, it holds up to some standards of this genre. What i really liked about it was how it was shot, the foggy effects of the town and the cloudy weather seemed all-round to fit the plot and the scenery pretty good. This i would say would be a good movie to watch with your girlfriend or on a rainy day with nothing else to do, specially the girlfriend part, she would like it."

"b1le","8","0","3","29 April 2009"," 3 Reasons why I consider ""Twilight"" (2008) to be better than ""Dracula"" (1992)
","Since both movies explore similar idea, I've decided to perform comparative analysis. So, I watched them one after the other and before I list the final results, I want to mention several notes:<br/><br/>1. I am fully aware that there is considerable time-interval between these movies, so I am not going to argue upon the technical aspects of the movies. Whatsmore, I consider ""Dracula"" to be visual and auditory masterpiece full with innovative solutions (such as the Dracula's shadow) and interesting effects (such as the hissing voices in the background) that are successful in stunning the audience even in 2009 (such as I e.g. the first_time_watcher). 2. I am also aware that although they are fantasies, they ought to be classified in two different genres with ""Dracula"" belonging to drama-horror department and ""Twilight"" to romance/thriller. That's why I'm going to dwell upon the similarities. 3. Finally, I am not going to reflect upon the authenticity with the original story since I consider it to be basically a myth that has been changed over the course of history and individual preferences of storytellers.<br/><br/>And even though most would say that I dare comparing two incomparable pieces, the results are the following:<br/><br/>1. ""Twilight"" has almost scientific explanations of Vampire's nature. The characteristics of these creatures as ones of the fittest predators (pheromone-stimulated, adrenaline-derived) and their successful coexistence with humans as a result of their adaptation to the surroundings gives Darwinian flavor to the movie. This is somewhat manipulative approach since it is convincing in creating strong illusion about something really important going on. The viewer can be easily attached to this movie because of this. In this aspect ""Twilight"" takes one classical (and maybe over-used) scenario and brings freshness, which is very difficult with stories famous as these. On the other hand, there is no such element in ""Dracula"". 2. The main character in ""Dracula"" is also unconvincing for formal reasons (inconsistent actions, such as enslaving your beloved with your bite in spite of setting her free), but mostly for emotional reasons. Namely, I never felt for Dracula. Neither sympathy for his ill fortune and lost love, nor understanding of the motives behind his actions when he finally found his love again. There was no internal struggle in the character in the moral sense which left me passive as viewer, perceiving him as totally alienated, non-human and therefore non-understandable creature. (BTW, I know that maybe this was intentional, but I didn't liked it) 3. In ""Dracula"" the characters that submit to their wild youthful nature filled with attraction and passion (such as Lucy and Dracula) are somewhat condemned as turning their back on God (e.g. faith), which in some perspective gives sense of false moral. On the other hand, ""Twilight"" sometimes seems to glorify those strong youthful feelings of passion and attraction as prerequisites for pure love and as essentials for winning over every moral dilemma. In that way ""Twilight"" deals with these issues in more human and forgiving manner, not forgetting to mention along the lines that to control one's passion is probably the hardest thing in the world and to confirm ""Dracula's"" message that it's nevertheless important to regulate it."

","I am a huge Twilighter! I can't get enough!! I am counting down the days till the release of New Moon, and I check daily for any updates!! I really hope, however, that they do a better job on New Moon than they did on Twilight!!! I had read all the books, and all of the extra stuff on Stephenie Meyer's website, before I had watched the movie. I knew to not expect the movie to be like the book, because I am not silly, I know that it would be impossible to make it exactly the same. I went into the movie cinema's excited and with an open mind, and I left there extremely disappointed! I found it to be all in point form, and out of sequence. vital points and information were missed and I don't know how they will correct that in upcoming sequels. not enough kissing or the tension that goes with it, and Bella cooks!! (bet you didn't know that)<br/><br/>The make up artist should be forever blacklisted and not be allowed to do any more make up on any one else ever again... not even herself! In the biology scene, when Edward returns, his neck colour doesn't blend into his face... talk about unnatural makeup. Edwards, Jasper and Carlisle's makeup was the worst. And how bad were the wigs! I mean you could tell that they were wigs! it's like special effects lost 30 years in this movie! I mean really, did they even edit the movie? the visual effects and the camera angles, seriously, I think they skipped all of that all together. pre-schoolers could of done a better job!! (no offence) and what was with the scene with Bella and Charlie in the kitchen? what a waste of film!!! There are so many mistakes in the movie that it is hard to watch the movie and not be distracted by them all! I'll admit, the basic drift of it was there, but it felt wrong. Anyone who hasn't read the book wouldn't even realise that when Edward is playing the piano that that is a song that he wrote and composed for Bella, inspired by Bella!!! AAAHHHH!!! (scream) wrong!! wrong!! wrong!! yet how can you not fall in love with it! Stephenie Meyer is a genius writer, not even Catherine Hardwicke or Mellisa Rosenberg (screenplay writer) could stuff up the plot that badly! wellllll? you tell me? in summary, I am biased because I love the books/ the saga so much, that in some unbalanced way i like the movie enough to watch it again and again and again! sad, I know!"

I realize that they did not have all the money in the world to make it perfect, but at the same time even i could have done a better job. they left out a lot of information including jaspers ability and the blood typing scene which was one of my favorite scene in the book. the camera seemed kinda shaky too i must add. it just kept moving up and down and way too much shaking. the acting on the other hand was pretty good. rob pattinson did a really good job i think, he wasn't exactly how i pictured edward to be but still did a good acting job. kristen did an okay job i think. she looked the part but to be honest i thought twilight was just not her film, she sounded like she was bored throughout the movie, and she had a lot of bad acting moments. i have seen her in a lot of films and shes actually a pretty good actress, i especially loved her in speak and panic room, but i really don't think this was her film at all. i personally imagined bellas character way different then how kristen performed it. Ashley Greene did an awesome job! i loved her as Alice, but i think she needs to be a little more bubbly. kallen lutz did an amazing job and was totally how i pictured Emmet. Nikki reeds job of Rosalie was perfect except for her looks, I'm not trying to be rude or anything she did an amazing acting job, she just doesn't look like a Rosalie to me. i really liked who they picked for jasper, his face throughout the movie was priceless, but he only had like 3 lines. the guy who played carlisle, who's name escapes me, wasn't really how i pictured carisle at all. he is hot but i pictured carlisle more serious looking. Esme's character was pretty awesome. the girl who played Jessica was fabulous, i think she was the best actress, and Ashley Greene, throughout the film! her acting job was amazing, a total Jessica to me! but Angela's character i have to say and i am sorry was the worst actor throughout the film, she was no where near how Jessica was supposed to be like. if i keep going on this will take up all of the page, so everyone one ells did a really good job! the movie on the other hand was OK, it wasn't how i pictured it in my head, but it was still pretty good for what they have, and i hope new moon will be even better."

"johnsda71","7","0","2","14 April 2009"," Why was Twilight so disappointing?
","My teenage daughter raved about this book. We both saw the movie‚ÄîI enjoyed the film, whereas my daughter was disappointed. She encouraged me to read the book but I hadn't read any novel in fifteen or so years. After watching the movie twice, I decided to read the book.<br/><br/>The book explains many of the small details the movie failed to leave out, and these were important details. In the beginning of the novel Bella is very unhappy in Forks, the movie failed to portray this. She pretended to like Forks while she hated everything about it. Bella had many male admirers at school. Bella did not like Edward but was fascinated by him. Edward didn't come to school that entire week and when he returned he chose to skip class, which was an important part. In class they were blood-typing and this is where Bella had became very ill at the smell of blood. The movie failed to show the gradual affection growing for each other; the movie just threw them together.<br/><br/>The beach scene happened quite early in the novel. This is where Jacob told Bella in great detail about the Quileutes legend and she walks away knowing Edward is a vampire. When she questions him he admits the legend is true. In the movie, she comes to her own conclusion of what he is then asks him about it in the nearby woods. The scene wasn't right.<br/><br/>The forest scene is where the two of them began to have feelings for each other. The movie didn't quite show the depth of their chemistry in this scene for they confessed their love to each other. In the novel, the two hiked early in the morning for hours to get to Edward's favorite spot. They spent the entire day talking and experimenting with touching each other slowly. When dusk came, Edward showed her how he sometimes traveled‚Äîhe ran through the trees with her on his back. It's a real shame this entire scene was not included in the movie because it was the turning point in their relationship. This is when I fell in love with the idea of Bella and Edward. You could see the feelings they had for each other whereas in the movie it was just a scene of him showing her his favorite site.<br/><br/>The movie scene where Edward brings Bella home should have been left as it was in the book. In the novel, he took her to his home where she saw a piano and discovered Edward played. He wrote a musical piece, which Bella had inspired him‚Äîit was the same song he hummed her to sleep the night before. During the visit they talked about music and asked each other questions about mortality and immortality. It was during this time (in the novel) that you could see the personality of both of them. They were playful and both wanted to be in control. The movie portrays Bella as an assertive fragile girl but on the contrary she is quite feisty.<br/><br/>At the near ending of the movie, the baseball scene, the black vampire who appears first leads you to believe that he is the leader of that clan. The book tells us it is the white male (tracker) who is the leader. Once he smells the scent of Bella's blood he wants her and thats comes clearly across in the movie, however the movie makes us believe he thirsts for her blood. This is far from the truth--when the tracker meets the Cullens he recognizes Alice who was once his victim but Carlisle had taken her away. He wanted Bella since he couldn't have Alice‚Äîtrade one for another and he wanted Edward to avenge Bella's death. None of these details were included in the movie which is very disappointing. It would have explained the trackers motive.<br/><br/>The movie was good but not great. The novel was fantastic. If the movie had all of the small details that were in the novel, the movie would have been outstanding. The director should have anticipated a 3-4 hour movie instead of the normal 2 hours. I do believe if the movie had been longer, the entire movie would have been able to fit in those small but important details. The actors were phenomenal with the material they had to work with. Unfortunately, Bella and Edward were thrown together so fast in the movie they couldn't develop that on-screen portrayal of romance."

","Would you like to see a romance movie where every character gives a similar reading to Ben Stein? Is a vampire movie about vampires who play baseball and eat deer to survive interesting? Now how about mixing Ben Stein-like characters in a boring romance, with the vampire addition. Sounds boring? It is.<br/><br/>Bella (Kristen Stewart) is new to a boring Washington town. She goes to school and eventually makes friends with a guy who initially seemed to be repulsed by her, Edward (Robert Pattinson). He eventually reveals that he and his friends are vampires, so Bella joins Edward and his vampire buddies in their mundane chores, and along the way forms a romance.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is really the style of acting. Every character acts as though they have gone through some terrible tragedy, and none of them show any emotion except for a sad depression. The conversations here are unrealistic, and the characters all feel flat. They are given traits, given to them through conversation about them, but never show any personality. Watching cardboard boxes is more exciting than watching these guys act.<br/><br/>Despite an uninteresting script, this movie is stylishly directed. It looks pretty good, and the dark, grey look it has throughout sets a tone that the actors only made boring. One scene that goes overboard with the glitz is a baseball game between the vampires, and this scene is just dumb. The film is sped up and slowed down at random, and it feels like a bad music video. But other than that, this is a good looking film.<br/><br/>""Twilight"" is a well made film for the money that went into it. But just because something is well made, doesn't make it good, and the script is just not very interesting, and the actors only make it worse. Hopefully the sequel film will introduce us to these characters, because this only introduced us to clich√©d cardboard characters.<br/><br/>My rating: ** out of ****. 121 mins. PG-13 for violence."

","I am not a person who is usually sucked in by movies or books that are the latest craze but I found myself being lost in this story (both on paper and in the movie) The actors were truly remarkable in portraying the deep emotion that it takes to make this story come to life and Stephenie Meyer gave them an intriguing story to work with. It keeps you guessing. Every time you think things are going to relax they come up against another obstacle in this heart breakingly beautiful love story. The music is amazing and I was captivated by Rob P's soulful melodies. I can not wait for New Moon and the rest of the series to come out."

","this is the best movie i have seen in my entire life. way way way better then harry potter. i saw it 3 times in theaters nd bought the DVD first day it came out. i read the book and it is amazing. Twilight is a great movie about a romance and the problem they face. its funny, romantic, exciting, and just breathtaking. its my all time favorite movie. i suggest everyone go see it! i took people that weren't interested and when it was over they couldn't stop talking about how great it was! when your done watching this movie it will be all you can think about. you will want to see photos, interviews, behind the scenes, the making of, and more!

"little_woman86","5","0","2","9 April 2009"," Disappointed
","You cannot compare the book to the film, that is for sure. However, that doesn't make it any better or worse. Having read the book and found it overwhelmingly emotional and full of a power to keep me glued to the pages, I was curious to see how the film would match up to the brilliance. On a good note I thought the casting of Patterson a good choice and he was convincing, however, even his superb acting could not save the disappointment i felt once again, that such a fantastic piece of writing could be completely destroyed by film (a similar disappointment i had felt with Harry Potter too)Some scenes were choppy, the art of portraying how time went by failed because it let the emotion fade and it seemed that the film was only really focusing on the 'wow' factor. The film may have been 2 and half hours, but it seemed to buzz by so quickly that i felt i had only been sitting there for 20 minutes, and not in a good way. I will give credit to the scene in Bella's bedroom where Bella and Edward kiss and he throws her off. This scene was the first glimps of emotion that i had got from the book, but it was the only scene that seemed to reflect it..and again over so quickly. I know you cannot go through scene by scene of the book, but something was lost in the film making. I did like the unconventional though, of the vampire's and the settings, i was worried it would look more like Buffy, and surprisingly they kept the stereotype down to a very subtle idea. A terrific book, and a very lost film."

I think that Robert Pattinson is convincing as a sensitive Vampire who really loves his woman, and somehow Kristen Stewart is convincing in her role when she is with him. I like seeing them together, such passionate lovers.I also felt thrilled by the action and the chasing scene in the latter half of the story.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that the movie is without flaw. The make-up and some special effects are bad. Some parts of the script are cheesy and awkward. But I enjoyed watching it to the end.

","Twilight altogether is not as bad of a film as it looks. it really is hard to animate any of Meyer's books. her imagination is so great and vivid that i believe that the director of this film did as best as she could with it. no comparison the actors were great, the story line still intact and the scenery just as the book. i may see why many might not like this movie since most people haven't even heard of the book before the movie. I do agree with some critics on how this movie should have been more detailed and brought to life for the audience to understand the love Bella and Edward had for each other. But all in all Twilight was a good movie and should be getting some type of credit for it. not anyone can cram up a great book in to and hour and half movie."

He is putty paste white complete with eye-liner and lipstick. He is either a rock star, very effeminate...or a...vampire. Yes, he is of the undead persuasion and never sleeps.

"lanhchiyen","4","0","2","2 April 2009"," Kristin Stewart -Bella was the biggest mistake for destroying Twilight
","I won't point out a lot of ""things"" that made this movie caused a lot of disappointed reaction of Twilight novel's fans because there were a lot of comments here said that . Also I don't think Rob Pattinson was the main reason because to me, he acted good enough to express how mysterious, lust and ""burning love"" is Edward through acting of his face,his voice especially his eyes. Don't complaint too much about his a little bit English accent, I think it is very good for an English actor already. I like this Edward and almost satisfied with Rob's acting, only one exception that was the sense in the Biology Lab where Bella and Edward met in the first time...Rob was not really good, he seem tried so hard but still could'n not be express successfully that hard emotion. I think we also know this is one of the hardest/most difficult emotion for acting depending on what we read in the book about Edward's expression at that time, right? The character Alice did good, too. I like her performance and her face. Charlie, Jessica,Victoria,Caliste also did well. They was fit in their characters. Only Kristin Stewart made me so disappointed with Bella. Her performance was horrible with icy cold & less emotional face's expression. Her voice also was lack of emotion and her body was not fit for a pretty and fragile Bella It was so different from Bella in the novel with A LOT of LOVE, LOVE and PASSIONATE in every her looks, her thoughts to Edwars. Kristin Stewart also doesn't has the look of fragile, curious, sweet cute and smart like ""real"" Bella. Kristin Stewart's look to her vampire did not have A LOT OF PASSIONATE in it, just simple empty, cold...sometimes I think Kristin Stewart did not know what she was doing or came to the acting days without preparation and emotion. I am so disappointed about this because the Bella's sweet big love for Edward (also Edward for Bella) is all what the novel talking about. To me, Kristin Stewart was a worst wrong choice ever and that was a big mistake which led to the bad result. Afterall, hope that my English is not so bad although I know it is bad already...he...he . Love twilight anyways!!! Everyone !!! Just enjoy the novels and watch the movies for more entertainment."
"elizabeth_marquez","5","0","2","1 April 2009"," My Twilight Movie review
","Okay. So, I have in my possession the remaining 3 Twilight books and the movie, which I watched this morning. My official opinion is: okay.<br/><br/>They FLEW threw the whole first half of the story. As I had heard from friends, they also did skip a lot of important stuff. It was like the reader's digest version. The filmmakers didn't give you any time, or any reason, to care about the characters. They didn't explain the WHYs of why they felt the way they did. It just felt very rushed. I think Pattinson is a good Edward, but he was only working with the dialogue they gave him. It didn't always work; sometimes it sounded stale. As far as Bella, I agree with some other online reviews that I read in that she isn't vulnerable enough, isn't shy enough. Her facial expressions/body language were good, but she was too tough. The chemistry between them is very good in most scenes...but I guess the imagination is ALWAYS better! Casting wise, I was disappointed in the 3 male rivals and their portrayal. Jessica was great, but Angela wasn't what I pictured at all. Rosalie either. The rest were pretty close.<br/><br/>I read that the author Stephenie Meyer said that she had always imagined the story as a movie taking place. I don't believe this movie was written for fans of the books. They just skipped too much, were in too much of a hurry to really tell the love story between them (Edward & Bella), the hows and whys of them falling in love. Not to mention anything about the rest of Edward's family. I would have preferred a longer version that took the time to REALLY tell the story. Sure, some things always have to be cut out for it to work as a movie. But I would have liked a more ""Lord of the Rings"" style- detailed, full. A long movie is okay- so long as you get to tell the story. (When I saw those, 3 hours in a theater flew by because I was so engrossed!) It was so hard for me to care about Bella enough for Edward to save her, but since I read the book, I KNEW how they truly felt about each other. The movie just doesn't make it real enough.<br/><br/>Final word: I don't think I like the movie as a whole; the way it flows. I prefer individual scenes, the conversations they have. The scenes that are more true to the book. I don't regret watching the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it at ALL if I didn't already know what was going on, simply because they don't explain it. Director change for the sequel (which, from what I've heard, is a slow book and I haven't started it yet), so hopefully the next movie will take more time to develop the characters the way they deserve to be developed. So, there you go!"
"crying-scarlet-tears","7","0","3","1 April 2009"," Totally unfinished
","I read the first book when it was first published....I was totally pulled into it and couldn't put it down. The film took out so many things in the book and it ended not even half way through the book! It was totally cut short- which was annoying. The film was good,but missed out all the good bits!! The Characters were roughly how I imagined them to be. Alice I imagined to look quite young- but I do like who they've got for Alice. They've definitely got the right person for Bella and her dad Charlie. Edward I imagined to be more handsome and the same for Jacob. The film was quite beautiful in some scenes but it definitely could do being longer to have more of the book in it. Some films have been 5 hours long- so I don't understand why they couldn't have made this film longer."
"happynhopeful2000","10","0","5","31 March 2009"," Twilight was AWESOME! Immortal BUT.... Worried about New Moon
","I have read all of the twilight books and can honestly say that I was obsessed from book one and then the movie just shot than into overdrive! BUT, after reading the books, I am extremely concerned that New Moon might shatter that obsession. I thought the first book played out perfectly and the movie couldn't have been better. From the innocence of Bella & Edward's flirty climax into a perfect teenage love to the intense action & danger of the hunt and fearful loss was awesome! The movie did the book justice & then some!!! I was a won over instantly and find myself hurting for New Moon on the big screen!!! Hopefully though they will sway away from the book a bit on some issues.<br/><br/>The book, New Moon, was good, but would have been better if they had found a way to interlace Edward into the fold more since he and Bella are mostly the main characters. I hope the movie picks up on this point. If not, this may end many fans twilight movie obsession. I mean don't get me wrong, I love Jacob, but twilight is not twilight without Edward & Bella! It would have made for a more interesting story if the voices in Bella's head had really been Edward watching out for her invisible from the shadows. Through the entire book, I was thinking this was the case. That Edward loved her so much that he just couldn't stay away so he came back and only hid in the shadows to watch over her, never revealing himself physically. The way it turned out made Bella seem more like a true crazy nut as opposed to the love lorn teenage girl which to me, took away more of her appeal as the subject of both Edward & Jacob's heart. Like she just was too unstable or just too nuts to ever be with such fascinating characters. Hopefully they will wake up & sway away from the book on this issue.<br/><br/>Eclipse was good and covered what was expected BUT......<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn, I can't even begin to explain how wrong this book was! Not only was it disappointing, it was on the verge of sickening! First off, let me address the softer problems with the story. Throughout all three previous stories, Edward & Bella are heated in the moment of innocent passion. Building slowly at every turn. Being described slowly and passionately through every touch kiss etc. Never was it out of hand but just enough to keep readers asking for more! Then, when the point finally comes for it to reach the next level, it burns out like a candle. When Edward & Bella are on their honeymoon and finally reach the point where they are morally, legally & rightfully able to go to the next level, they do however it is like a blow to he gut. It describes nothing. She dresses in a bathing suit, walks into the water where he is and without any passionate description at all leading up to it, ""he pulled us gently into deeper water."" BOOM! That was it! I mean I didn't expect some perverted, sick, step by step detail of the act itself with this being a YA book, but was it so much to expect at least a passionate prelude to the moment as each kiss, touch etc had been in the other books. Of all of these moments, I would have expected more passion in this one more than any. I mean, if you are basically insinuating sex anyway, which was obvious to all ages, you could have at least led up to it with a tasteful passionate description of the touching moments leading up to it. It was a sad end to my twilight obsession. As if this wasn't bad enough, Bella's sickening pregnancy, blood riddled birth (and of course these events described in sick detail none the less) left much to be desired. Then the sick thought of Jacob imprinting with the child was just plain creepy, sickening, disgusting and at the very least perverse. On the edge of pedophilia in my opinion. I was just sadly disappointed. I pray the movie (hopefully nothing like the book on these points) redeems my twilight obsession because the book just killed it!"
"siayra_16","10","0","4","31 March 2009"," This was a great movie
","Overall this was a pretty good movie. Just because it's a chick flick doesn't mean that its a phony movie. So what if young teenage girls like the movie. Its not like Stephanie Meyer intended on this series to be for all ages. Whatever age it attracted is what she was trying to get to. Not everybody likes boring movies or those horror movies. If you didn't like the movie then why waste your time on commenting on something that you didn't enjoy. Obviously if you wasted your time on commenting on a stupid chick flick then you must seem to have a slight bit of interest in the movie. Anyways Twilight was a great movie and it was a good one for teenagers. It shows that not all vampires are bad and it shows what true love for a family is."

"simo_imola","5","0","2","30 March 2009"," It was just impossible
","OK, I'm a 33 years old Italian scientist (yeah). Rational. Down-to-earth. And I've read the four books - in English - in less than four days. Catchy, aren't they? It was unexpected to me, I didn't know anything about the saga. They might not be the Divina Commedia, but I think that labeling them as ""B-literature"" is damn wrong. <br/><br/>The movie, to me, was just disappointing. Even if I try to forget the absolute lack of quality in the make-up and visual effects, and the poor directing - not that it's an easy task - and if I liked most of the performances, the experience was somehow physically painful. I found the plot to be so... EMPTY. Where has all the introspection gone? You cannot really understand why the two main characters fall in love, and there is almost no trace of the complex reasons and thoughts which are behind them and their story. Not to mention the changes in the plot. Don't try to fool me: it's not just a matter of book-to-screen adaptation. This was a plain CRIME, the plot was robbed of so much depth! The twist in the meadow scene alone was so awful that I wanted my money back. But then, after the initial, burning disappointment, I had to face the awful truth. Turning the book into a movie was just an impossible dream. You don't have enough time to develop the characters, to let them grow and be fully exposed. I think that a more appropriate solution could have been a TV series, spanning through all the four books. OK, you'd still face difficulties in rendering a story which is full of unspoken thoughts and points of view, and you'd need to cut and adjust here and there, but... at least it would be possible not to throw away the best which is in the book. <br/><br/>Coming to the actors... I have mixed feelings. Pattinson is quite good in this role, but matching the mental image every reader has built of the godlike, perfect, stunning Edward is very tough. I found his voice inadequate - wasn't it supposed to be like a melody? He has very beautiful and magnetic eyes, indeed. Stewart was well chosen, however she sometimes looks a little bit too cold and inexpressive - but again: I guess the blame is to be put on the lack of dialogs and introspection wrt the book. <br/><br/>After all, I will surely end up watching the sequels. I was so obsessed with the books that I cannot stop. Shame on me. I hope in a better directing and a higher budget, but I've already read that the screenwriter is the same. Too bad. <br/><br/>P.S. A nice surprise was the actor playing Chief Swan. Hey, the man is HOT! (Remember, I'm 33 ^_^ )"
"blue_shirt_dude","7","0","3","29 March 2009"," ""He looks at you like you're something to eat...""
","To have not heard about the ""Twilight"" series, you'd have to live under a rock. And even then it would be unlikely, as the Twilight super-fans would hunt you down, pull you out from under the rock, and brigail you with every minute reason that Twilight is the greatest series ever written. There's no denying it - Twilight is a pop-culture phenomenon.<br/><br/>And so, it is inevitable that a movie would accompany the wildly successful books. But is it any good? Honestly, it's hard to say. Though debatable, it is pretty much accepted as fact that a movie rarely - if ever - lives up to the book. As someone who has read (and loved) the entire series, ""Twilight"" obviously can't live up to the book completely. But overall, I found the movie to be a very enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know, Twilight is about seventeen-year-old Isabella Swann (Kristen Stewart), who - because of her mother and stepfather being constantly on the road - moves to a small town in Washington called Forks to live with her father (Billy Burke). Once there, she is drawn into the world of the mysterious Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Though he keeps her at arm's length at first, she eventually discovers his secret - he is a vampire. And, of course, she falls in love with him.<br/><br/>The director did her job fairly well. She stuck close enough to the story - not majorly altering any plot points (though die-hards would probably punch me in the face for saying that when it comes to the scene in the meadow). But again, this is a movie, every detail couldn't have possibly been squeezed in.<br/><br/>The acting. Kristen Stewart manages to capture the look of Bella Swann perfectly, though her acting was a bit below par here and there. You notice it, but overall it doesn't detract from the movie. Robert Pattinson...oh boy. How can I say this without sounding like a nit-picky, obsessive die-hard? I'll put it like this: if you haven't read the book, his performance will seem fine. Those of you have are likely to thing he was wrong for the part. And you'd be partly right. Pattinson does not capture the cool, confident demeanor that Edward exuded. Truth be told, Edward's character in the movie feels more than a tad awkward in places.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, Billy Burke is wonderful as Charlie. He expertly captures the charmingly gruff disposition of Bella's dad. He is humorous, but can also be dramatic. Casting him was a stroke of genius. Taylor Lautner is excellent as Jacob Black, and Gil Birmingham was did well as Jacob's father, Billy. Edward's ""family"" were all great. They look and act almost exactly as you'd expect them too. And it would be a shame not to add that Anna Kendrick, who plays Bella's shallow but well-meaning friend Jessica, brings an utterly realistic portrayal. She is a normal teenage girl, and her performance is not at all contrived. It's as if no one told her it was a movie - she seemed totally herself.<br/><br/>The villains were portrayed rather well, all things considered - Cam Gigandet being the obvious standout as James. In fact, he was probably the most convincing actor in the entire movie, when it came to actually capturing the feel of a vampire. He was psychopathic, but not too over-the-top. Great, great bad guy.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of this film was amazing. The grays, blues and greens were all used to magnificent effect in literally bringing Forks to life. The special effects - honestly - are give or take. They are superb in spots, and lackluster in others.<br/><br/>Also, be warned - though there is a fair amount of action, it is mostly in the film's climax (which is awesome, by the way). This film is a love story first, so if you're not the chick-flick type and are just looking for some spectacular, bloody vampire action, Underworld would be a better choice. But for a love story with a dangerous twist and an exciting, action-packed conclusion, you may have found what you were looking for.<br/><br/>Sure, the acting screams ""teen movie"" in places, but this IS a teen movie. Yeah, the script has a few awkward moments - but again, teen movie. Some of you will love this film, hailing it as a masterpiece and a perfectly acceptable representation of your undoubtedly favorite novel. Some of you will hate it, claiming it is a piece of garbage with poor acting that was insult to the book you love and adore. But my personal opinion on this movie? I liked it. It was neither perfect, nor awful. It is a good movie - more of a tribute than actually living up to the incredibly high standard that the book set. But that's okay. It's a good movie, and I recommend it - even if you've never read the book."

I don't get why the reason to say that Bella was going to Jacksonville instead of Seattle. I think that was worthless. I admit Rob Pattinson's acting was kind of boring and emotionless, and Kristen so moody and tired, but great actors such Billy Burke and Peter Facinelly saved the movie from being a total mistake of all time. I bought the DVD, but it was just for my English classes. Students react so well when I show it to them.

I was worried I was going to be sitting in a theater surrounded by teenage girls (isn't that the fan base?). I wasn't wrong. But the nature of the movie is that it's romantic and thrilling, so it very cleverly manages to cater to everyone in the audience.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is pretty good as Bella Swan, a teenage girl who moves to the rainy little town of Forks, Washington to live with her dad. She becomes drawn to a mysterious boy named Edward Cullen who she later finds out is, surprise, surprise - a vampire.<br/><br/>They fall in love and she joins in with the Vampire war that's going on in the town. It's a bit unsatisfying that they can't have sex - they want to but whenever they get too close he has to stop the urge to bite her. Very convenient for the PG-13 rating! You can fill in the rest.<br/><br/>The movie is successful because it appeals to a lot of things people wish they had in their lives: someone to love and protect them unconditionally, love, with a superhuman, and some mystery and intrigue. <br/><br/>I'm kind of looking forward to the next one but still not tempted to read the books."

","We watched this on Blu Ray in high def. Only one person in the room has read the book(s?). I'm not sure why this was tagged a black and white film, and I'm not colour blind. Why do the books have a dedicated following? Unknown. Guys in the room decided early on that it must be a chick flick. A woman in the room disagreed. The storyline was kind of sluggish and it took awhile to be drawn into it. The actors are also basically no names to me, even though they're getting regular media coverage here in B.C. while filming the next installment. I don't think they're the next big thing, but I do think they'll be around for the long haul as character actors in movies to come. Overall, the movie was okay, not a waste of rental money, and we all ended up agreeing that yeah, it was okay. Was the acting good? I'm kind of up in the air about that. Followers of the book(s) seem to think they did a good job. As the rest of us still don't know much about the books, it was agreed that we didn't really have to read up on it to get what was going on. I can't say I've seen a lot of vampire movies. I do know the ones I have seen are fairly generic, and interchangeable. Save for the Anne Rice movie, Vampire Chronicles. I get the feeling that vampire movies are Supposed to be generic. There is always a main foible involved in haunting-style movies, and it's predictable as pigeon turd. But this movie like I said, is alright. There are few turns on vampires vs ordinary human story lines, though this movie has some interesting angles to offer. I liked that the time line was not jumping all over the place like most vampire movies. It's worth renting, but you have to be in the right mode to be watching it. Maybe if I had read the books, I would give it a different rating. As it stands, this is what I give it for just watching it for what it appears to be - without the books to tell me what I should think."

","I didn't really know what to expect of this movie. I never read the books, but knew most people liked them, so thought it might be worth checking it out. I simply loved it. It's not one of those regular Hollywood-feel-good-movies. But the landscapes are incredibly beautiful and the pain and desire of both Bella and Edward stay even after the film stops. The cast is brilliant: both in play and in appearance. The Cullens are great, Alice being my personal favorite. If you like fast movies, with a lot of action and stuff, you'll probably be disappointed. But for those who love great views and great play: you should definitely see this one."
"alecwest","10","0","4","26 March 2009"," OK, I'm hooked.
","First, let me say that I'm a 58 year-old guy. Secondly, because of eyestrain issues, I got and listened to all four books via Audible.com audio-books. And, I like to think of myself as being extremely fair when it comes to comparing books to their film versions. So, what did a guy my age like about the film?<br/><br/>I don't know why but I've always liked vampire films. This is especially true if the screenwriter or novelist (or both) re-invents the vampire myth. To me, these re-inventions add spice to the lore. Imagine - vampires without fangs, vampires whose reflections can be seen in mirrors (remember James in the ballet studio), vampires who can move about in the daylight (with certain skin issues), etc., etc. That's the main reason I liked the film. The lore re-inventions were refreshing.<br/><br/>I also lusted after Alice Cullen (grin). This doesn't make me a dirty old man, though. Notice that I said ""Alice Cullen"" and not ""Ashley Greene."" I figured that, as a vampire, Alice was likely older than me ... making her a cradle-robber if she had mutual feelings (grin). Basically, I loved the grace with which she moved. And I liked the way she voluntarily became her ""brother's keeper"" ... doting on Jasper and helping him through his difficult time as a new vegetarian.<br/><br/>Another positive note for me was the musical score. I think it was well considered due to the mood of the film. And though I'd never heard of them prior to seeing the film, and even though their music was confined to the very last song as the credits rolled, I'm probably going to become a new fan (possibly the oldest fan) of Paramore.<br/><br/>Of course, being a person who lives in the Pacific Northwest, I always welcome films that feature the natural beauty of the area. And this movie was chock full of ""scenery"" in that regard.<br/><br/>I was also very impressed with the Carlisle character. His quiet strength made him a great father figure for his ""family."" And his profession showed an unmistakable respect for human life ... uncommon in many other vampire stories and films. One thing puzzled me, though, after I'd seen the film and had time to think about it. Carlisle is the oldest vampire of the family and a physician who has all the time in the world. It probably wouldn't have taken him too long to complete coursework required to qualify him in a sub-specialty - hematology. As a hematologist, especially if he called himself a ""research"" hematologist, he could easily (and legally) acquire all the human blood he and his family could handle from blood banks/labs ... claiming he was doing research into various blood-borne diseases. And (ahem), who'd be the wiser?<br/><br/>Overall, the film was a good variation of the book ... which was, in essence, a romance novel with vampire lore tossed into the mix. And for me, each part of the film contributed to the whole in a very plausible way. I even went to a local DVD release party and bought the two-DVD set. I've watched it several times already, am still not tired of it, and am looking forward to the film versions of ""New Moon,"" ""Eclipse,"" and (I hope) ""Breaking Dawn."""

","I actually saw the Twilight movie before I read any of the books. When I saw it, I was totally addicted, so I read the books. I wish I had read the books first, because it would have made it easier to judge the movie. As I have re-read the books and watched the movie again, i have realized a few things. First... Edward is not that good-looking. Actually he was almost a let down. Of course, it is probably impossible to play Edward, as perfect as he is, but still I think they could have done better. Bella as a matter of fact, I did not like very much either. My mother, who watched this movie an mocked every bit of it, thought she was spastic and quirky. She was, but that was what I liked about her. I was disappointed at how little they showed the clumsiness. It was like 1 part, and then they didn't mention it again. That was my favorite part about Bella, so that was disappointing. As to the other characters, for the most part, they were very good. Alice was very good, but not perfect, but of course its Alice, so who can compare? Jasper was great, but I wish he was in the movie more. Emmett was amazing, and so was Rosalie. Carlisle was great, just how I picture him, and Esme's personality was perfect. I have always pictured her with blonde hair, not red, but thats OK. The kissing scene: I thought this was kind of long and awkward, and I was also surprised to see a family with three children under the age of 9 years old in the the theater, and apparently that was acceptable to their parents. I know that some parts of the books are a little sketchy, especially the fourth one, but I hope there's nothing too visual. Edwards accent I think was awful. He probably could have done better, and I was disappointed that he didn't. The baseball scene was definitely my favorite, and I think the special effects were very good. Another good scene was the final fight scene. I thought that was great, and all though people think that the effects were awful, I actually thought they were very good. Stephenie Meyer is an amazing author, so it is almost impossible to compare the movie to the books. There was obviously a lot of hard work put into this movie, although some things could have been done better. <br/><br/>Things I loved: ALICE!! Just how I imagine her. Pepper spray/Charlie- He was hilarious, and was perfect for the part. I especially loved the pepper spray scenes. Scene where Edward comes out wearing sunglasses- AMAZING! Part where Bella tells Edward that, ""It's over!"" and then he is in her room.I thought this was great. Baseball scene- Jasper is amazing in this scene. Bella's acting when she's in pain. She is very good, and the venom is supposed to hurt very badly, and she did a very good job of portraying it. Angela- She was so sweet!! Just how I picture her! Such a great actress!<br/><br/>Things I hated:THE MEADOW SCENE! I seriously did not even know it was the meadow scene until about two days ago. It was awful! This was one of my favorite scenes in the book, and it didn't even look right! This was a total disappointment. The La Push scene- The boy who says, ""The Cullens don't come here..."" Yea, he's SAM ULEY!!! WHAT IS UP WITH THAT??? AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE HECK THAT OTHER KID IS!! But i have to say, Sam is pretty good-looking in my opinion... And finally... EDWARD! Robert was really a very bad person for the part, especially since I am a Harry Potter fan. Other than that, this movie is GREAT! I love watching it, and I can't wait until NEW MOON, even though I hate Jacob. SORRY TAYLOR!!! :)"

","i am one of the few people who haven't read the book before seeing the movie apparently, and so i guess that makes my perspective under-represented a bit. i liked the movie a lot, nd think both actors did a great job. the movie might not have corresponded as well to the book as the readers might have hoped, but thats how movie translations are. i really want to read the book now, so a transition from movie-to-book must work better<br/><br/>i think all the actors did a good job. i thought Kristen Stewart did a really good job at first, but from her interview with movie phone with rob and Stephanie, she seemed really snobbish and seemed not to be in to the movie at all. the first half of the movie i've watched about 20 times because i thought the tension between the two characters really exciting. but again, referring to the interview on youtube, after making the movie Kristen admits she knows nothing about rob. and thats where the second half of the movie gets sooo boring. <br/><br/>they're supposed to be in love with each other, yet there is absolutely no chemistry. Bella acts so distant from Edward when they are supposed to be together, and it is really so frustrating.<br/><br/>p.s. Edward make girlfriends reevaluate their relationships (jk). he's the perfect boyfriend!!! :) he's really charming in the movie"

","I read the Twilight book and thought that it was great, I love any book that creates a picture as you read. Then I saw the movie and it was like I was reading the book again. The scene when Bella goes into the classroom and Edwards gets a whiff of her scent was great, I had to rewind this part to watch over. It was just like I pictured in the book. I give praise for the team behind this movie for keeping the movie and book so close. I hope they continue this throughout the series. I also hope that the entire series is made, I will be crushed if there are not Four movies. Loved the movie, I am counting down the days to New Moon. Plus I was on Summit Entertainments web site and saw that there is already a release date for Eclipse. I am soooo excited I could pee. I also wanted to add that the actors where a great choice. Keep up the good work, I am so excited for what will be next."
"solidgameboy12-1","7","0","2","23 March 2009"," Twilight: A Review
","A major surprise from me: I review a movie based off a book I refuse to read. Perhaps that isn't quite the right thing to say before a review, but you know what? It was going to come out anyway, might as well be now. My sister asked me to watch it, and being the nice older brother I am, I decided to watch it.<br/><br/>Stephanie Meyer's book ""Twilight"", based off the popular book series for young adults follows Bella, a young girl who moves from Arizona to Washington to live with her birth father after her mother and her boyfriend try to find a new house to live in. Bella is enrolled in School ""During the middle of March"" (I'm sure the distributing company thought carefully about releasing the movie on DVD on a Saturday, during the middle of March) Where she is oddly enough, gaining friends fast. The one group of kids she notices are the Cullens, a group of pale foster kids who all share a secret, and major plot point: they are vampires. The, uh, Good looking one of them all is Edward. At first, the two show very little feelings for each other, but that is not until they fall deeply and madly in love with each other. However, the two come from different worlds, so how can they make it work? Now, like I mentioned earlier, I have NOT read the book series (and I will live just fine without reading it, thank you very much). The movie, however, is something else.<br/><br/>There is a lot a person who doesn't like the book series (Like Myself, based on ignorance of actually trying to read it) could say about this movie, but oddly enough, the movie is for the most part, quite solid. The Teens (according to my sister, who has read the books) look a lot like their counterparts from the books, although for me, I was a little annoyed with the gray white faces, since almost everyone in the movie (Save for The Cullen family and Bella) has some melanin and even vitamin D, which, at one point, a kid addresses she did live in Arizona, so why does she look the way she does, but for crying out loud, must she look like the vampires she so desperately has the hots for? My major problem with the movie is Bella and Edward's acting abilities. Bella and Edward are on camera for most of the movie, so I suppose asking for a little variety in inflection would be kind of nice, but the two talk in an almost uninterested, continuous monotone that only adjusts in about the last hour of the movie. I would understand if Bella maybe sounded interested in discovering Edward was a Vampire, but she sounds as interested as learning that dogs have tails and the sun goes down everyday; It's annoying.<br/><br/>Edward too is a character who is at fault because of this monotone acting ability. I understand he's a vampire and all, but come on, can't you seem a little like you are in love with this girl? Another thing that frustrated me of this movie, again, bringing up acting is the annoying narration. I feel like at some point, the director felt we needed her to narrate what was going on on camera in order to understand Edward didn't show up in a parking lot, or what we were confirming about Bella's feelings toward Edward were true, when it's on camera, or having been shown just one scene earlier, when in reality, you could have filled those moments with the movie score or something.<br/><br/>The character's acting does get better, again, in the last hour, so for one hour, you have no real connection between this vampire and this mortal girl, then it actually gets a little better, introducing this whole idea of abstinence and a villain we really don't care about, even after the villain shows up in the last 45 minutes, I really didn't care about this guy, not even enough to care for why he was a villain to begin with.<br/><br/>The movie, even with all those negatives listed above, is still okay, I guess. The special effects on the Vampires (If you've read the book, you'll know) are interesting, and some of the set designs are exceptionally gorgeous, I'm referring to the forests and shots of the mountains, with the amazing clouds swirling around in the sky. Excluding Edward and Bella, the acting is okay, and the characters don't come off cheesy, which in comparison to the vampires in other movies of recent years, have become very much so.<br/><br/>Overall, fans of the book will be pleased (My sister was) and will be awaiting the sequel (My sister is) to see how can the whole story continue. As for me, judging the movie, the acting is only okay, the romance story annoys the hell out of me (but I'm a different kind of romantic) and if I plan to watch a sequel with my sister, I truly hope the two kids on screen can take some acting lessons, Please."
"daisysaturn","Null","0","2","22 March 2009"," Growing on me...
","I first saw Twilight on opening night in Calgary while visiting a like minded fan of Vampire movies. (The giggling teens almost ruined it right off the get go, laughing like morons in all the wrong places..) I knew the hype was bigger than what could possibly be delivered. That being said, hyper-hype and a popular book is often the giant blur between a great book and of personal experience and the pictures we form in our minds (and huge marketing). Although I enjoyed the movie, it was also not what I had visually imagined or immersed myself so voraciously with the characters while reading. Some of the acting was quite stiff. Bella is supposed to be shy and introverted, and whether by design or of her skills or not, she brings an element of perpetual awkwardness. Edward is not disappointing, smoldering where necessary, hot. Alice is not what I pictured but passable and cuter the more i watch. Jasper looks like he had his eyelids plastered open in a bad acting shell-shocked zombieness. Carlisle looks too clich√©; he should not be that blonde nor that cakey pasty made-up. Jake - um sorry, No. I hope he proves his detractors wrong in New Moon. Stephanie Meyer portrays Victoria in the book as having very red flaming hair, not strawberry. - If I sound too critical it is because I expect adapted screen plays to be 100% true to the novel in how the characters are conveyed. There can be a bit of room to widdle, waggel and fiddle, but the heroes... to the VERY rabid fans,I hope the sequels hold more true to the readers love of the characters who they know intimately and whom we expect to properly be given their personal justice on a deep level that transcends any shallow attempt to cut corners... We want it raw, deep and real, riveted to our fascination of Vampires.. with heart, romance and of tortured souls¬Ö."
"crimsonpain","6","0","2","19 March 2009"," If you liked the book (or books), you'll be slightly disappointed.
","I gotta start by saying that if you didn't enjoyed the books, or even heard of them, this movie is not for you, of course you should give it a shot, but you have been warned. This is NOT Interview with the vampire, it's not epic, and it will most certainly NOT going to be a revelation within the vampire universe. Well, at least not this one, but as far as the story goes, up till the end, I wouldn't bet on it.<br/><br/>However, if you read the books, or at least Twilight (though I think it goes without saying that if you enjoyed Twilight, you read the others too), but you're not blindly obsessed with them up to the point when you can't think rationally, you'll be a bit disappointed. I sure was.<br/><br/>And I'm not talking about acting. Rob did a decent job at portraying the troubled young vampire, though some scenes looked overly awkward, when they were not supposed to. Kristen, well if you've seen any previous movies of her, you'll notice that she has a pattern, which contains few basic facial expressions (mostly sad-wise, she's known for drama), which luckily for her, it's a good thing here, because Bella it's not the 'happy go wild' type. The others were pretty good too, I especially liked how Ashley gave life to her character, Alice, couldn't possibly imagine her otherwise. Locations were pretty accurate too, Catherine did a good job at both choosing them and directing, though she definitely works too much, she looks tired all the time. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, my one and most complaint would be that they left out some key elements from the book, or in some cases, even worse, they changed them. That's the biggest problem with books becoming movies, though of course, for the young mindless fans out there, it didn't matter that much or not at all.<br/><br/>So what I can say is that this movie is more of a reference point. If you haven't read the books, but through some miracle you enjoyed the movie even a bit, you should read them, it's far more easily now that you have a face for everyone and glimpses of the way characters would act, and the books are far better, well at least Twilight for now."
"petarpeychinov","9","0","3","18 March 2009"," So the lion fell in love with a lamb...
","That's my first comment, so you're allowed to show some mercy. I first saw the movie, then read the books. Also, I tend to watch a movie with a ""clean slate"" and afterwards take away points for the stuff that I didn't like. So, Twilight. (here there be spoilers) It's a movie based on a 500+ page book. A book about a clumsy teenage girl that falls in love with a 106-year-old, 17 years-of-age, vampire. A book told from the girl's point of view. But the vampires of Twilight are different than the ones of the Blade/Queen of the damned/Interview with vampire franchise. They don't die from sunlight, don't have longer canine teeth like a rottweiler, are impervious to silver, garlic, wooden stakes and holy water. And they also can love. Take away the fancy vampire stuff and you have a story about love. Passionate, chaste, overwhelming, restrained, irreversible, binding, unconditional and irrevocable love. Love so strong as to turn a small cold, rainy and foggy town in a garden of Eden, where a lion and a lamb can love each other. Acting was very good for my layman's eyes. Robert Pattinson was great as the dead gorgeous Edward Cullen with his inner conflict between his thirst and his love for the fragile Isabella ""Bella"" Swan, played by Kristen Stewart. Maybe a bit more subtlety on his part would have made this film even better. The rest of the cast are very well picked, with the smallest personal reservation on the part of Keelan Lutz(You'd expect Emmet Cullen to be much more muscular and bear-like); a bull's eye for picking Ashley Greene as tiny elf-like Alice Cullen. Directing - I liked the combining of characters, the interpretation of the book, while still staying true to it. The music was great, the visual effects not extreme. The makeup is mildly irritating initially, but afterwards you forget about it, once you're immersed in the story.<br/><br/>As for those who complain about the lack of character, please remember: It's always difficult to adapt a book with a 1st person narration, rich in thoughts and feelings, to a movie seen from third person. Other than that, the movie can grab you, especially if you are allowed to actually see it without being disturbed by hormone-frenzied teenager girls gasping and sighing every time the young handsome males from the cast enter the screen. <br/><br/>And a few words for those other reviewers whining about something they did not understand. Baseball - vampires play it during thunderstorms, because it's the only time the noise of the game cannot reach the ears of the unsuspecting humans. James bites Bella's arm right where the veins are located(and sucking of the blood is easy)<br/><br/>Conclusion - Don't try to compare the book to the movie. Keep your prejudices at pole's length and turn deaf years to the throngs of girls and young women and you can feel the magic and the love of the Twilight."
"kendotec-1","6","0","3","10 March 2009"," Worth watching, despite some painful scenes
","I'm not too familiar with Gothic and emo movies in general, but suppose you can count this as one of them. <br/><br/>I liked the slightly dark atmosphere and the thought on death and life. Also i liked the visual style of the pictures, like short before a thunderstorm is coming up, but nearly through the whole movie. Perhaps a little like in ""Sleepy Hollow"". There were some hard to watch sequences, where all there is is shallow acting and it's all about 'look how cute our protagonist is!', which was a little unnerving for me as a guy, but: There was a line that was not quite crossed, if you get my drift. <br/><br/>So all in all an entertaining movie, if you just want action you probably should see something else. <br/><br/>6/10"

","Although I'm 46, I wanted to see this film and find out what all the hype was about. I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially Robert Pattinson's role as Edward Cullen. Kirsten Stewart I found rather flat, but she did have great chemistry with Pattinson.<br/><br/>What I didn't know, though, is how it really only picks the bones of a much deeper book, a book that it would really be impossible to religiously transfer to screen. After seeing the film I sat down and read all 4 books in about 3 days, thoroughly enjoying the much fuller detail and characterisation, which made me realise how little of the story could be put onto the screen, the books being so much inside the characters heads instead of spoken (especially Twilight).<br/><br/>So, it's an enjoyable film and a nice interpretation, but if by some chance you haven't read the books, do so as they are much more meaty and satisfying."
"ead123","4","0","2","29 January 2009"," Overall, I would say that the movie was one that I would see once, perhaps twice, if a friend wanted me to go again, but it wasn't a favorite.
","I first heard about the Twilight series last year, around Christmas, from my friends who were absolutely in love with it. I asked for the books for Christmas, read them all within two days, and then discarded them. I thought they were alright, but they weren't fantastic, in my opinion; I only read the books to get a feel for what my friends had been raving about. It seemed like overnight the series became a hit, and I couldn't go anywhere without seeing a book or hearing 'Cullen' mentioned.<br/><br/>When I heard that they were making a movie, I was excited to see how they were going to adapt such a unique storyline. While I might not have loved the series as much as everyone else, it certainly was something that could have the potential to be a great film. My expectations lowered dramatically as I heard who had been cast for Edward - Robert Pattinson. I feel that he's alright for parts where he's not a main character (As when he was Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), plus his accent was going to be hard to disguise, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I was right. He's definitely no Hugh Laurie, and his accent is obvious throughout the film - I felt as though he were trying to channel a bad boy, with the constant mumbling and low voice. I was reminded of Jess Mariano from Gilmore Girls whenever he spoke, although Milo Ventimiglia pulled off the entire thing better than Robert Pattinson could. I cringed whenever he was on screen, being one of the few girls in the world who isn't constantly drooling over him. I felt as though all of the shots were used to showcase just how handsome he is, when all I could focus on was how much make-up he was wearing (Was it just me, or was he wearing more lipstick than Kristin Stewart?).<br/><br/>Kristin Stewart was likable for me. I'd never thought of Bella as this fragile little girl who constantly needed saving by her hero, Edward. My impression of her was that she was a strong, confident young woman who knew what was going on. While Stewart's delivery might have been a bit awkward at times, such as during the hospital scene, I overall thought she hit the mark on what Bella should have been portrayed as.<br/><br/>The other actors were spot-on for me. Kellan Lutz as Emmett made the entire movie for me; the only thing that bothered me was that his scene that was portrayed in almost all of the ads for Twilight (""She's not one of us, Edward!"") was cut. Nikki Reed as Rosalie was perfect casting, in my opinion, since she can really pull off the vibe that was felt throughout the books towards Bella and Edward's general situation. I felt that Ashley Greene could have been a bit more perkier in portraying Alice, but she wasn't terrible. I did laugh at Jackson Rathbone's facial expressions whenever he was on screen as Jasper, but overall, he made me like the character, one which I had always been a bit leery of. Peter Facinelli and Elizabeth Reaser were perfect as Carlise and Esme; I had no problems there.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast was okay for me. I had a few problems, such as how they weren't as described in the books (Mike was too tall and athletic and handsome, there was no Ben Cheney, just a combination of him and Eric Yorkie, and Angela was hardly five foot five, let alone over six feet). The 'bad guy,' James, portrayed by Cam Gigadent, wasn't my favorite. I had thought that perhaps he would be as scary as in the books, given my fondness for Cam Gigadent, but he was a disappointment. Rachel Lefevre as Victoria utterly thrilled me, and Edi Gathegi as Laurent was an interesting addition. Billy Burke as Charlie made me smile, although the mustache was possibly one of the most hideous and distracting things in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I thought Taylor Lautner was the perfect person to play Jacob Black. The wig was a bit much, but Taylor Lautner pulled Bella's other love interest off perfectly, and it made me love Jacob just a little bit more. I give him kudos for being so dedicated to the role that he's bulked up since Twilight wrapped.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes were choppy and irritating to the eye, and I and my friends found ourselves laughing more than once at the expressions on Robert Pattinson's face.The scene were he was supposed to be glittering in the meadow was absolutely terrible, and looked so cheap and gaudy that it was like someone had thrown a bucket of glitter on him. The shots of the forest in Forks were done artfully, and I liked those, but the close-ups to people's faces and other things were too much for me. Catherine Hardwicke tried in this movie, but she ultimately failed, since this was one of the few movies where I've had a desire to walk out in the middle of it.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that the movie was one that I would see once, perhaps twice, if a friend wanted me to go again, but it wasn't a favorite. The thing that was most bothersome was Robert Pattinson, and I feel that if someone else had been cast in Edward's position, the movie would have been a lot more watchable."
"amunetpallaton","4","0","2","26 January 2009"," The movie was OK....
","This is an opinion coming from someone who hasn't read the books and has no desire to.<br/><br/>I just watched the movie, and it wasn't bad, but there's definitely something lacking with it. It's interesting to have a different take on vampires. Ones that can go out in to daylight, ones that are trying to be as normal as possible, etc etc. And I liked that the vampires actually acted like normal people for the most part.<br/><br/>With that being said though, the heroine of the movie Bella has got to be the most uninteresting, BORING character ever. Absolutely nothing about her makes me interested in anything she says. I dunno if that's how the character is supposed to be in the books, or if it was just the lack of the actor's abilities to pull off the character... maybe a combination of both. Speaking of the actor, she was AWFUL. She had 2 expressions throughout the entire movie. A half grin, and that blank stare she had throughout most of the movie.<br/><br/>I hope Bella isn't that way in the books b/c it's very disappointing that so many girls out there have such a boring WEAK female character to relate to. Making her normal is OK, but normal does not mean she has to be some painfully dull person. I also didn't understand how someone so uninteresting could become so popular and well liked so quickly. Those must've been some very understanding kids in that HS b/c I just can't see how a character like Bella could be brought in to any kind of group where the kids are fun.<br/><br/>Anyway, any kind of enjoyment I could've had for this movie was sucked out by the main character. Her total lack of personality just ruined it honestly. I can forgive the cheeseball, baseball scene, or the glittering, or any of the other things, but the heroine being the way she is is unforgivable imo."
"chronoclane_cf","5","0","2","14 January 2009"," Twilight is more like a teen-flick to me...
","At first I go to theater to see this movie my expectation was that this film would be cool, full of special fx, good plot n not a type of drama movie. But I was wrong, this is the lame vampire movie I've ever watched it my life (it's a way far beyond Underworld), but in spite of that this movie is better than Bloodrayne (it's totally a crap movie) This movie in some scenes made vampires looked ridicule (They are accepted by humans, works with humans), n what makes me feel disappointed was no special fx at all, as far as i've seen there were so little scenes involving special fx. This movie focused more on the drama (relationship between Edward n Bella) n try to get the emotion from the viewers based on that.<br/><br/>Thus the plot isn't too good for me, but I like the chemistry created between Edward n Bella, the film succeed to connect the emotion n love between them. I think it works for some audiences. Kristen is so perfect portraying as Bella (snce she is well known as character in many horror movies) n so do Robert as Edward (many of my friends likes him, they think he's cool as Edward but not as Robert...=p). One thing that missing is that this movie was lack with character introduction such as where the Cullens from, their history, Bela's past, the villains history, etc.<br/><br/>I heard there will be the sequel according to the next novel ""New Moon"". I hope it will be better. Twilight would've been a box office if there were proper proportion of special fx, deep character introduction n good plot. The film is not bad at all but it could do more I thought..."
"Elbundo","6","0","6","9 January 2009"," Not the best thing
","Unfortunately this is another of those badly made films that has only been released to make profit off of teenage girls, such as myself. I went into this film not expecting a lot and thats what i was given, a badly made film that did little to impress me. The bad script and directing gave the actors nothing to work with which meant their performances weren't as good as iv seen in other films e.g. Kristen Stewart in Into The Wild. I would not recommend this film if you have a low concentration level as you will lose interest within the first 10 minutes. The only thing that i can say was worth the money that i paid to watch this film is Robert Pattinson. As typical as it is that a teenage girl would like him, it is irresistible to agree with the fans out there that think he is 'hot' because he really is."
"dolphin7890","5","0","2","29 December 2008"," well... truthfully
","Well i personally LOVE the series and everything but truthfully i was a little let down by the movie. The relationship between Edward and Bella was a little off sorry but i have to say i didn't see that much connection between them sorry. Just i found the acting could have been better and i was expecting way more of this movie. And also they took away too many scenes from the book that would have made the movie very good. And i would have liked to see a little more of the Cullen family if they are going to change it that much they could put some of the important people more in the movie.So ya that's all i had to say no offense to any Twilight fans i love twilight too bad i was not very impressed from the movie. But hey they have a new director and we will just have to wait and see how New moon will be :)"
"Deispring","7","0","5","27 December 2008"," How to enjoy this movie.
","The answer is simple. Watch 1 or 2 episodes of Buffy for about a week, then watch this movie.<br/><br/>Why is this helpful? Simple. Each episode of Buffy, minus the opening and closing credits, is about 40 minutes long. Multiply by 3, and you have a 2 hour movie. This, in essence, is Twilight.<br/><br/>Granted the stories are a bit dis-similar, and the cast here needs to grow a bit, but then, the same is true for most TV Shows. Twilight is quite the same. From the low-end graphics to the under-done acting, it has all the makings of a teen drama. If you've read the books, you'll know they were quite the same.<br/><br/>So does this make it a bad movie? Not at all. Will it win any Academy Awards? Nope. But many enjoyable movies never get nominated, but that doesn't mean they weren't entertaining. The same is true here. And it does follow the book quite well, really, and though ""Edward"" was not as convincing as I would have liked, Kristen Stewart was Bella dead on.<br/><br/>I have seen some call her boring and whiny. To those critics I say, Read the 1st book again. Bella WAS whining quite a lot in the 1st book. She is that shy girl who was always by herself in the back of class, never having too many friends, never too adventurous, and never quite outgoing. We all knew her, and she never jumped out in a crowd. Kristen doesn't either, in this movie, and that's what makes her perfect for this role. And for those who have read the book, as this movie's producer obviously had, you can Google Kristen to find that she will fit the bill for Bella in book 4 as well as she did here.<br/><br/>Yes, the action was a bit dry, and much of the story seemed to drag on at times, but I felt the same way with the 1st book. But just as I was going to put the book away, something would happen that made me pick it up again, and the same is true with the movie. Just when you're ready to walk away, you get pulled back in.<br/><br/>For those who feel skeptical about spending $10.00 to watch this movie, DON'T. Wait for the DVD, Rent it, and you won't be disappointed. If you've read the books, Just remember that this movie was made on a ""TV Show"" budget and you wont' be disappointed.<br/><br/>Accept the movie for what it is, and you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
"mimbaxter","7","0","5","23 December 2008"," Teen angst, co dependant, bad boy flick, what's not to like
","This is a bit like 'Twin Peaks' and when the Dwarf starts to dance, it's time to leave the cinema. But we are not there yet.<br/><br/>It is well written, and gives itself the time to develop. This is not a new story, most of the twists are fairly obvious. I do not known the books, and there are times when the audience reacted and I had no idea what had just happened. This is a starter film, of a series I assume, to lay the ground work and establish characters, with signals of intent.<br/><br/>The locations and actors are good looking and well shot, and worth seeing for themselves. I felt that the pale look was over done, but then I am old enough to remember 'The Cure' the first time.<br/><br/>The wire work needs to be improved.<br/><br/>There is one thing, that deeply shocks me, even on the day following. The main 'hero' of the film, is supposed to be deeply cool and attractive. Yet he drives a VOLVO. That's wrong, deeply, culturally wrong, Volvo's are not teen fashion cars. End of rant, before I get started.<br/><br/>Ahem, so a good enough start to a series of films, which should have some interesting stories to tell."
"towards-the-within","8","0","4","22 December 2008"," A beautiful movie
","Greetings all.<br/><br/>Before posting a comment on the movie I took the time to read on what other people thought of/about it and even though it was a film that I really looked forward to watching I got intimidated by the generally average/bad reviews it received. To my eyes the reviews spoke of a cheesy film, made for 15 year old girls which has no point whatsoever etc etc. Yet since I've taken time to watch some of the worst films of all history (Manos, hands of fate being the top one) I decided to go and watch it nonetheless setting my expectations to ground zero just in case. For the reviewer's record, I am a 29 year old guy whose favorite films list is populated by movies like schindler's list, the man with no name trilogy (fistful of dollars, fistful of dollars more, good bad ugly), rocky 1, gone with the wind, the green mile and of course the dark knight ! Not exactly a 15 year old girl's or boy's preferences :).<br/><br/>The movie was far from cheesy to begin with. It was a story told before, for sure, but the way it was portrayed and displayed was very elegant. <br/><br/>Main Actors. The chemistry between the two main stars is incredible; I am strongly considering watching the film again just to see them both play together. Easily to become one of the most loved couples of our times on the screen. Edward suffers from his predatory hunger for Bella's blood yet loves her very strongly at the same time. The pain and torn heart of his displays on his features in almost every bit of the way. The way he looks at her is truly both inhuman and deeply mortal in some manners truly capturing the idea of how an Immortal could love a mortal (at least in the way my mind perceives it). As for Bella, she is a very beautiful woman yet a quiet one. Not one to show off. Her face doesn't give away pride or arrogance. She ignores most of the world or the happenings around her and yet lets Edward inside. I think the two are brought together through their search of something different to the rest of the world. Or, in this case, their worlds. They really blend as one and all the scenes that the two participate in are beautiful and emotionally strong; it's the love we've all dreamed of from times to times yet few movies came close to doing honor to the book pages that stimulated our fantasy. This is one of the movies that pulls through.<br/><br/>Secondary crew.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they come across as insignificant. Save for Bella's father who played his part nicely and lively, I don't remember a single high school person's name. It's a bit sad really because it feels like viewing two characters' deeply evolve and unravel their inner being and yet be surrounded by one-dimensional, shallow support crews. Bella's dad was good, the vampire family were...well didn't really have much to do. The high school gang was as if out of a teen-horror movie show; And jacob who supposedly plays a very strong part in the following books came across as hardly even a potential love interest to Bella. If I could improve something about this movie, it would be the surrounding characters' evolution and involvement in the story. Even the bad vampire was...Well, you knew he was there to get his ass kicked to be honest. He never felt like a threat or not really portrayed his motivations long or believably enough. Haven't read the book but I surely hope it's not like this !<br/><br/>Directing <br/><br/>Seriously, give the director a break. The way most of the reviews come across about how 'cheesy' it is to see Bella's hair fly at the fan, or to see Edward sparkle, or this or that. Made me feel like I was going to watch a comedy. But having the fan blow her hair and as such her blood's scent for him to take in and feel uncomfortable was a great moment while also introducing some well received humor in the intensity of the moment. We are talking about teen-love after all, do not forget !And disregarding the fact that vampires usually explode in sunlight, it was nice and...new. Keep an open mind to things and you won't be so disappointed in them. The scenery was great, the camera shots were beautiful. Even the small town seemed inviting and felt 'real' enough. Everything was absolutely stunning direction and screen writing-wise, I couldn't have asked for more or less on that regard really. <br/><br/>Plot <br/><br/>Nothing new and that's not necessarily bad. It's a love story, an unusual love story. Usually love stories' success depend on the chemistry of the two parts and in my opinion as I've already stated, that was perfect. Vulnerability meets Immortality into a beautifully made story that keeps the romantic at heart captivated. <br/><br/>Overall....<br/><br/>A GREAT movie to see with an open mind. Walk in the theater, don't expect anything and erase all of that you imagine you do or do not know about vampires and love stories. Give this movie ground to seed and grow upon without being affected by past films/books you might've read.<br/><br/>Twilight is a great film and I will definitely watch it again.<br/><br/>8/10 mostly due to the side-crew's parts being so trivial and not noticeable."

","I think this movie should end here. Let them alone to decide, it's not sane for audience to make the third book.The girl should live. I don't like the colours of the movie. I think that the third book could have had a very different ending,but what can you expect from such. This world is a great place but there are many ways to be immortal. Why should young girls should celebrate this one?She was so young she didn't know what she was doing. While about him it helped that he looked intelligent,alive.And trying to be a good person.Actually he was pitiful,exulted pity somehow, and this was the two actors's good thing. From the book you didn't get that. The two of them shared some sort of a strange love,but inspite that in the book third she joins him,it seems to luck action I mean good action. Can you imagine them remaining thinking like 17-18 for 200 years?It's like in Neverland. I think it's unrealistic. I like more Brigadoon if it's have to be two people falling in love and get together in a Everlastingland. They were insufficient to each other, that's why they were teens, they needed thir extended family a guide of some sort. Even when they were together in the book they needed his family but the actors bring life and they looked pretty in love at the dance, I liked the dance. You can see the force of a new couple, some energy there."
"sophie_barnes333","8","0","3","17 December 2008"," Pleasant surprise with spot-on casting
","Let's be honest - it was never going to be a dramatic masterpiece. The best thing about the books is the erotic frisson between Bella and Edward and the wry i-can't-believe-he's-not-human humour. They manage to capture this perfectly in the film.<br/><br/>I have read the books and despite how very bad the writing is I thoroughly enjoyed them. I went to see the movie with a very guy-guy who hasn't gone near the books and he really enjoyed it! He thought that the tension between Bella and Edward was very real and convincing and he laughed in all the right places. I think it's true that it's actually meant to be quite funny - there's a deliberate kitsch kind of element to their love and Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson really nail it.<br/><br/>Altogether a very worthwhile viewing experience, if only to watch Robert Pattinson wearing a variety of very nice jackets. Any red-blooded woman would be seriously hard-pressed not to gasp when he walks into the cafeteria..."
"nescientprole","7","0","3","17 December 2008"," A little amateurish, but a good promo for the books
","I went to see Twilight as someone who had enjoyed most of the last 20years' pop culture vampire creations in cinema, television and print but who has not yet read the Twilight series. My opinion for others in my position is that you should probably read the books first to get more out of the movie.<br/><br/>To me it seemed a little amateurish. I don't know if there was a failure of execution or if Catherine Hardwicke's choices, successfully executed, simply don't suit my tastes; but for me a lot of the scenes felt a little too heavy handed. <br/><br/>HERE is an intense moment (facial closeup featuring intense gazes). HERE is another one. HERE is a romantic moment (cue music, pan skyward).<br/><br/>Indeed quite a lot of the Bella/Edward scenes involved minimal or no dialog, just intense stares, which I think resulted in character development being a bit simplistic.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't bad, I just didn't find it very subtle or complex.<br/><br/>What it did successfully do is make me interested in the characters and make me want to read the books for more story and character depth. As a standalone film I'd have to say I think it was mediocre, as a cross-media promotion for the story's primary medium, the books, I think it works well :)"

"moviemaniac008","3","0","3","14 December 2008"," Excellent movie but has a slow beginning.
","The title of my review says it all: Twilight, while being a good movie, has a slow beginning. For a two hour movie, it felt as if the first hour or so was very unnecessary (well maybe half of it is). The first hour was almost only talking and talking and talking. The worst part of it is that half, if not 3/4 of the talking is unnecessary. And truth to be told, I have not read the books. A few parts should have been kept, like when Edward talks a bit about himself and how being a vampire affects his personal life, but besides that and the first 15-20 minutes, the rest could have been cut off. The movie would be perfect if it was 'bout 1 hour 30 to 40 minutes long.<br/><br/>Story: Bella (Kristen Stewart) is a young beautiful teenage girl who goes to live with her dad for a few weeks. When she arrives, she falls in love with a young vampire teen named Edward (Robert Pattinson). Their unlikely relationship will give them many adventures, and that's about how the story goes. Robert Pattinson is pretty good, but Kristen Stewart is the best. Not only is she extremely beautiful, she could actually portray Bella's lack of balance (she is very unbalanced, meaning that she trips all the time). All in all, Twilight is an excellent movie. If you're reading this review, I thank you and best wishes during the holidays."
"tennis_ace102","10","0","4","13 December 2008"," Amazingly more than i expected.
","I loved this movie so so so much. It was everything that i wanted it to be and more. All the characters suited their roles perfectly. Edward was beautiful! Bella was beautiful. The Cullen family suited so perfectly. Nikki Reed i didn't think would suit as the gorgeous Rosalie because Rosalie is meant to be extremely beautiful but Nikki is extremely attractive and suited the movie extremely well. Also the casting of Alice was fantastic, she was extremely cute and suits the movie too a tee. Same with Esme. I hope what i'm reading is false about them not having Taylor Lautner in the second movie. You cant cast someone as a main character and then exchange him for someone else, it will ruin the movies. Also i am sad to hear that Catherine wont be directing or producing the second movie since she did such a great job on the first one. I was so... happy and so ecstatic with how good this movie was. its one of the best movies i have ever seen. It was adapted so well to the big screen and there were a few surprise techniques in there that made the movie even better. I LOVE THE MOVIE I LOVE THE BOOKS"
"FredKrueger10","8","0","4","13 December 2008"," Very good. However.
","Twilight was one of the films I have been waiting to see for over eight months and it was worth twelve dollars however even if its interesting, it did in some parts feel hollow.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson plays Edward Cullen, an 108 year-old vampire who only eats on animal blood instead of humans. Robert took awhile to get into Edward's shoes but eventually he got in and showed his side of Edward. Kirsten Stewart was magnificent as Bella Swan, she showed a isolated side not shown before and it makes you feel as though you are her. In some parts.<br/><br/>The special effects were so bad that it looks as though, the film was sped up to make the vampires look faster. And especially when they were running, it looks as though they were on a running platform. It looked so silly.<br/><br/>The landscape and location were so beautiful. I was awe-d by them and they were such a delight, showing a light side but also a dark side. The soundtrack was a delight too, it fitted too well into the movie, I rushed out and brought the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The film felt more of a comedy at times than an action romance. Especially when Bella hit Jacob with the door or when Edward nearly barfed when he first sensed Bella. It was enjoyable though, had some laughs. An action, comedy, romance, thriller.<br/><br/>Twilight is an enjoyable popcorn film. It has plot holes and lost big chunks from the book but it still delivered what I expected and it was worth it. So i would watch it for both hard-core fans or people just wanting to see a film.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I had never read any of the books before seeing this film and the only thing I knew about it in advance was how low-budget it was. I thought it was going to be cheesy and sappy but I was sadly mistaken. I am definitely a movie fanatic but I'm not one for romance movies; however, I thought this one was perfect. I honestly don't understand why guys don't generally like it because it has VAMPIRES for crying out loud! Anyway, I had no trouble following the storyline, though I thought I would since people say that the movie was made for the fans of the book. I don't agree. I think it was made for everyone.<br/><br/>I've already seen this movie three times. I've read all the books since the first time I saw it and I still think they did a very good job keeping true to the story. Of course, it isn't exactly the same but who would read the book if it was? I think the casting was excellent and that the effects were amazing considering the budget. I loved how they interpreted many parts of the book onto the screen. I was very impressed with this movie and I recommend everyone see it first then read the books! My friend has read the series many times over and she told me she didn't enjoy it nearly as much until she saw the movie....something for you guys to mull over. I've heard from many people that that is the best way and I am one of them."
"oliojoe_12","6","0","3","13 December 2008"," Twilight was enjoyable, a good interpretation of an otherwise average novel, but had no character development which was a major part of the original story.
","I saw Twilight on the day of it's release in Australia. My hopes were high for this film which was already under much scrutiny, which had me worried. I went into the cinema with an open mind and I think that caused me to not be so utterly disappointed. Twilight was an overall enjoyable film and I think that Catherine Hardwicke did well with the material she had. I think that major downfall, lack of character development, would most likely have been caused by the screen writer Melissa Rosenberg. Characters that had seemed important in the novel became lost in the action dominated plot. I think this is where the film really fell. Also, unlike Catherine Hardwicke's other films, such as Thirteen, there was very little dialogue in Twilight, again this would have been caused by the screenwriter. This was the major cause of the poor character development. This major flaw in the film caused the many of the events in the film to be completely unbelievable. In the novel, readers were made to believe that vampires really existed and that the love that occurred between the two main characters Edward and Bella could actually happen. I think that the actors did a good job with the material that they had, Robert Pattinson was a perfect choice for the character of Edward, his performance was the most enjoyable in the film, along with Kellan Lutz as Emmet, who made his role extremely humorous as it had been in the novel. Overall Twilight was enjoyable but not the perfect adaption of the original novel by Stephenie Meyer."

But, my goodness, Robert Pattinson and Ashley Greene are some beautiful individuals!<br/><br/>Now that that is out of the way... Good movie, I wish that Edward and Bellas relationship could have been focused on a little bit more. (Ex. In the book, you really get an idea that they've formed a friendship before he comes speeding around the corner in his silver Volvo to save her from some jerks.) <br/><br/>But, for the run time...I guess it was explained enough.

Since the sparkling plays a prominent role towards the end of New Moon, I sincerely hope the makeup artists come up with a better method by the next film.<br/><br/>That said, the chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson was riveting. These two have so much on-screen sizzle factor together that people everywhere are convinced they really are an item. I can't wait to see how it develops in the coming films. If the newly hired director for New Moon will improve the makeup and special effects while leaving Stewart and Pattinson alone to do their thing, the next movie could be a real block buster. Also along with that is the hope that the time without Edward will be shortened to give this couple more screen time together. Let's face it, Edward is the big draw here. Rob has the brooding James Dean/Marlon Brando thing down to an art. As a 49-year-old mom I can tell you, he made hearts from 11 years old to 50+ skip a beat in that darkened theater.

You know that vampire movies are supposed to be scary but this was not. That's okay. If you go into this movie think you will be scared, like I did, then boy will you be surprised. I was!! But it is a good movie though. I hold many discussions with my friends on what is the best vampire movie. SOme say Lost Boys. That's me, I say Lost Boys. Some say Interview with the Vampire. Some say 30 days of night. Boy that one scared me! Imagine how good this movie Twilight would be if the vampires looked like they did in 30 Days of Night. The girl wouldn't be so hotsy totsy then.

","I'm a HUGE fan of the Twilight books. I've picked them apart so much I know them like the back of my hand and when I was going to see the movie, I knew that it would not be very good in relation to the book, but I was surprised at how well it was put together! First, I would like to say that the casting was EXCELLENT, perfect, in my opinion. Kristen keeps us in love with Bella but still makes us feel like we are experiencing it from her side (just like the books, for those who haven't read it). And Rob Pattinson is my perfect choice for Edward, and I have to say Congrats on being able to pull of an American accent with little training.<br/><br/>The writing was great as well, satisfying us Twilighters as well as keeping other non-fans interested and up with the story. There were a few little goofy quips from characters that relieved sexual and awkward tension but wouldn't ruin the moment. Also, watch for Stephanie Meyer's cameo. :) Also, the cinematography was stunning! Absolutely amazing, and is one of the reasons why I chose to see the movie again.<br/><br/>I'm one of those people who like to read the ""goofs"" here on IMDb, and as I was reading the ones for Twilight, yes, there were a few noticeable scenes in the movie that I could agree with but you really wouldn't notice them too much if you are not looking for them.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book, don't fret because this movie still makes sense without reading it. I've had a few people come ask me if they should read the book then see the movie, and I said no, see the movie first or you're going to be like me on opening day and waiting to see specific parts of the book placed in the movie.<br/><br/>OK, back to the movie. To make a long story even longer, Twilight is definitely worth watching, young or old, girl or boy. It's worth the ticket and popcorn price at the theaters"
"bloodymonday","7","0","3","5 December 2008"," Review: Twilight
","As soon as the credit rolled, I completely understand what made girls around the globe went crazy for this book series, because Edward is the kind of guy who doesn't exist in real life. He's moody, secretive and utterly handsome young man (who happened to be vampire). For girls, he's an absolute dream guy. And Bella, a naive young girl who fall for his charm, is a character that every women on this planet wish to be in her position.<br/><br/>Well, I adore the concept of ""Love Conquer Everything"" in cinema. I love every moment happened in Baz Luhrmann's body of work. His masterpiece Moulin Rouge!, for me, is an ultimate love story that will take you for an epic journey of passion. As well as his directorial debut Strictly Ballroom, the movie that didn't really mind for any cause, reason, motive or whatever that will make it at least believable. And yet it worked out just fine and made me root for our heroes every second on-screen.<br/><br/>But that's just me. I know these kinds of films often fall into the category of ""cheesy"" or ""clich√©"" or ""melodrama"". So what's wrong? Maybe people confused between good kinds of melodrama and bad one. But what is good or bad anyway? Well, as far as I know, there is no qualification for it. And I think that's great thing about this genre, it's entirely based on your feeling, whether you hate or love them. It's not like an action movie when crappy stunts tend to make you know that it's poorly done.<br/><br/>OK, I haven't said anything about Twilight yet (and it's already three paragraphs). Well, let's just say that I ""feel"" love for this film. There's a lot of passionate feeling floating around the town of Forks. Everybody in this film seems to know what they should do on-screen. I think what the director, Catharine Hardwicke, achieved was she knows what to offer (and what's not). Every unmentioned gestures, every character's tendencies, made me realize how determined she was.<br/><br/>You simply can't avoid using corny dialogs when you turn this kind of book into film. But with the situation on-screen and their determination, it kinds of made me moved. I didn't fall head over heel like some girls in theater. But considering that those lines are guaranteed cringe-inducing for most heterosexual male, I think they accomplished for whatever they did.<br/><br/>I'm glad to say that two leads are surprisingly effective, Rob Pattinson does not only have the look, but he also embodied the titular character so perfectly. Edward is not real person, and he understands it. His ethereal manners will indeed make most of the girl swoon. His counterpart, Kristen Stewart is also believable. Her narration wasn't deadpan like I expected. Many people complain about why she madly in love with the hunk so easily. Well, if you felt this way, maybe this story is not really for you afterall.<br/><br/>Wait¬Öaccording to my review so far, you guys must think that I will bestow it as best film of 2008, right? Well, no. Because even though I have a good feeling about it, I don't really think that it is an exceptional great movie. Important scenes like meadow scene was astonishingly bad (poorly edited and that ""diamond skin"" effect made me feel depressed). And Baseball scene was not as spectacular as it was described by everybody (Have I told you that I haven't read a book?).<br/><br/>And the most important of all, a missing ingredient that made this film fails to be placed with other classic melodrama, is CHEMISTRY. Pattinson and Stewart are looking great individually. But together, they gave some audience (like me) a hollow feeling. It's not like they've a zero chemistry going on between them. But they're just left me want for something more. Anyway, since this thing can be fixed (Sequel is ensured by 70m opening), so I'm eager to see what they will do in the next film.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, maybe it's not quite good (and everybody seemed to know), but this is the film that will shot through your heart (if you're into this kind of thing). For me, the quality of this film will make no different. People will either absolutely love it or loath it. As for me, well, I'll let my review do the talking."
"wkkl13","6","0","3","5 December 2008"," A great romance but a long-whinded one.
","Twilight did not effectively appeal to me because the film was TOO lengthy. Each scene seemed to have taken ages just to make a point. I mean, the movie cannot be too fast-paced or too tortoise-speeding. This sort of movie has to have a reasonable beat in terms of length. And the action scenes were too overwhelmed by the romance of the leading characters.<br/><br/>However, the film was great in terms of romance and love. It had this forbidden love thing, something like in Charmed, which I thought was great. The actors and the supporting cast were just right as well.<br/><br/>The pros and cons of this movie seemed to have balanced themselves out in this film. So I would say my reviews are mixed to generally favourable. A 5.5/10 for the film, but since this vote doesn't exist, I give it a 6 :P"

","I have seen Twilight twice now and the first time I saw it, all I did was criticized it. Did not enjoy it one bit and thought it should have stayed true to the story. However when my friends dragged me along to see it again, I enjoyed it this time. Go into the cinema with an open mind is my advice. Don't think it will be anything like the book. Films are meant to be quick. Harry Potter is not true to the book however everyone enjoyed it. The same needs to be seen with Twilight. The only thing that annoyed me the most about Twilight was the directing and camera directing. Many of the close ups were not needed, yes this was a romantic film but there is a line to be drawn. Catherine Hardwicke I believe is not a great director and someone else should have directed the film to make the characters stronger. I felt they were missing something on screen. If you have read the book and did not like it the first time because you expected much more, go see it again. I'm glad I did. I accepted it for what it was much more the second time."

It is disrespectful to Stephenie Meyer to talk so badly about a movie this brilliant. Anyways, *tangent, sorry*, if you didn't read the books, you'd have no idea what was going on until you watched half of the movie. That's stupid. I think there are a lot of insane people passing judgment and they need to stop. You know what? Read the book, then see it again. You will LOVE it. If you still don't, you have TERRIBLE taste in movies, because this is a good one. And true Twilight fans love it. I'm disgusted with these reviews. And maybe that's because I am a teenager.

","I thought that the movie adaptation of twilight was great. This is coming from a 'hardcore fan'. My best friend and I both loved it. I myself have read each book at least 10 times. Stewart and Pattinson did a good job, though I would have never pictured Pattinson as Edward. His performance was shaky to begin with but got better and better as the movie went along. And Stewart I thought captured Bella better than any other actor did their character save for the actress who played Alice. And though they did have to cut a ton of stuff out they kept very close to the plot on the rest save for a few things. The action was fantastic. All in all Great movie and I for one cannot wait for New Moon."

","Through the first hour of the movie all I could do was laugh at the craziness that I was seeing on the screen. As with most books-turned-movies I had a TOTALLY different picture in my mind of just about every scene as it occurred. The next 45 minutes was outstanding. I really began to feel like it was a real, professionally made movie. I am still a little disappointed in some of the acting talents that were chosen, but could I ever compare? Who knows? The last time I tried to act was 11 years ago in an elementary school play. I am hoping, however, that as the series continues to be made into films that the talents increase. It's the first movie I'm sure it was difficult to really grasp the entire character as a whole. Having finished the entire series in 5 days before I went to see the movie I already knew the ending and knew what I wanted to expect.<br/><br/>When I left the theater I was still a little confused but throughout today I have really begun to enjoy what I saw last night.

","I do have an interest in the occult as I said that many, many times. And also vampires (the key monster in this film) are starting now one of my favorite monsters. Based on the first novel of the best-selling series by Stephenie Meyer, the film has essence of another supernatural star-cross romance ""Blood and Chocolate."" <br/><br/>In the film, seventeen-year-old Bella Swan moves to the small town of Forks, Washington after her mother and her boyfriend move to Jacksonville, to live with her police-chief father, Charlie. There, she finds herself drawn to a mysterious classmate Edward Cullen, who is really a 108-year-old vampire but is physically seventeen years old. Although Edward discourages the romance at first, they soon fall deeply in love. When the arrival of three nomadic vampires, James, Victoria, and Laurent, puts Bella's life in danger, Edward and his family Alice, Carlisle, Esm√©, Jasper, Emmett and Rosalie, put their lives at stake to save her.<br/><br/>I had read the series, and now I had seen this film, I love both the book series and the film.

","Personally, I loved the movie. I loved the actors. I loved the music. I loved the chemistry between Robert and Kristen and especially ""the kiss"".<br/><br/>My only complaints are cakey makeup on Carlisle and Jasper, a few overly jerky camera scenes (deer scene), and better transitions between scenes (i.e. the end of the meadow scene to the next scene).<br/><br/>The only thing other thing that concerned me was that the movie seemed a little choppy. I kept thinking about the scenes that were missing or altered from the book. And, I wondered if anyone who hadn't read the books before would get it. I rewatched it a second time and, I have to say, it was MUCH smoother the second time. And, I loved it even more! I knew the film was low budget so the basic special effects didn't bother me.<br/><br/>The casting was really good except for maybe Solomon Trimble as Sam. He looks the part but needs a few more lessons on saying his lines.<br/><br/>I'm very much looking forward to New Moon especially with the increased budget, the Italy scenes, more chemistry between Robert and Kristen, a little more Jacob, and the introduction of the werewolves."

","I read the books 2 years ago and loved them, and I was extremely happy to see this made into a movie. After hearing mixed reviews--mostly bad, though--I was expecting to see some cheap movie with second-rate acting. While the acting and effects could have been better, I loved it. I thought the Cullens were portrayed perfectly, and, while I was not crazy about Kristen Stewart, she pulled off Bella. Billy Burke as Charlie had great one-liners, and even Taylor Lautner did well in his small role as Jacob. If you see this movie, take it for what it is--a teenage love film. If you go to see it and expect an Oscar-worthy, 100% spot-on adaptation of the book, well, you'll be disappointed."

All I am saying is that it was a lot better than some books that turn into movies The acting was a bit off, definitely not academy award worthy but it was still alright, nothing too bad. Have you seen some of these movies on the Hallmark channel or LMN, terrible stuff, twilight has better acting than that.<br/><br/>I felt the same mood as the book as I was watching this, yeah I'm a fan of the books, and to be honest I loved the fourth installment of the series; as a apposed to all the other people that hated it. It had the same exact vibe, and the Cullens were a great depiction of the book.<br/><br/>Most importantly ya'll, it is a teen romance; it's gonna have sappy dialogue and unrealistic aspects. I mean give it a chance for what it is. At first I didn't like it either, I really did hate, but I thought about it for a bit and I really did enjoy the movie, could they of made it better, of course. Should they make the second one differently, most definitely. But I'm not going to wine and complain and bash on the movie just because it wasn't exactly what I wanted.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie yet go see it, get your own opinion on the movie.

","Not since I saw Frank Langella as Dracula (on Broadway, not in the movie made subsequently) have I seen such an intense, sexy vampire. Rob Pattinson hit exactly the right notes as the Byronic Edward. Kristen Stewart is a fabulous Bella. The chemistry between them is what gives this movie its power. I find it laudable that Stephanie Meyer, Catherine Hardwicke, and Summit have crafted a film aimed at a young audience that has no sex, very little violence, and no foul language - and it's a hit! Bravo. Summit, take note you should plan to shoot the other 3 books as quickly as you can before the cast (ALL exceptional) grows up - the fans would not stand for anyone else in these roles. Note: I am the 55 year old mother of an 18 year old daughter, who I gladly took to see this film over the holiday weekend - twice!!!

","I fell upon the series by accident. I was wondering Walmart in July with someone I work for and I saw New Moon. I was drawn to it and read it in 2 days, and I was hooked. I was so hooked I started talking about it to my coworkers, and most of them have borrowed the books from me, and one even went with me the day the movie acme out. When I was reading New Moon I thought it would be a great movie, then I found out it was coming out! Im 23, I know it was ""intended"" for younger readers but the magic of Bella and Edwards Love Story is amazing. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't show more of them falling in love in the movie, but you have to remember, in the book it was more Bella expressing her feelings over it, which is hard to do in a movie. And Im sure that if they did extend that part people would be mad that they had so much of them talking and they would want more story! I think it was adapted well to the screen, and some parts just gave me chills bc I could remember it from the book, and even if they didn't show it all the way in the movie I could understand from reading the book. Does that make sense? For example, the hospital scene (the 2nd one) I had tears in my eyes and chills, bc even if they didn't say it all in the movie, I remember everything in the book, of how she felt and all that. I think the actors did a great job portraying the characters, bc they don't just have a description of a character like in other types of movies, its not just ""Edward: Hes a vampire who falls in love with a human"" hes Edward, who we've seen in our minds over 4 books, you cant just interpret what the character is, I can see how its harder bc all his little quirks are already in our heads. I think that's why some people are disappointed, everyone pictures them a little different in their minds while they read the stories. So, Kudos! I absolutely positively most definitely LOVED the movie, and Im anxiously awaiting the rest!"

","Make mine Vampire! As a young adult librarian, it was my God sworn duty to view the movie that is causing teen girls all over the universe to roll over, clutching their hearts and suffering from increased heart palpitations: Twilight. I am going to try to review this as the movie alone.<br/><br/>The acting was okay. Of course, not much acting was required. To be cast in this movie, you had to be sexy hot and make cool poses. It's similar to 300 in that sense. Robert Pattinson is convincing as Edward. He takes the acting up a step by hiding his accent and giving lots of smoldering glances. Kristen Stewart as Bella-- hmmm, I could go either way. Yes, her performance was a little bland, but let's face it, the character of Bella is bland. She has no life outside of Edward. She refuses to have any sort of meaningful relationship with her parents or any of her friends.<br/><br/>The supporting vampires were acceptable. Like I said, not much was required except to look attractive and make cool poses like you are about ready to pounce on someone.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Bella and Edward was off balance. Edward was sparking on her, but I didn't see it from Stewart.<br/><br/>I will tell you what worked: Vampire baseball. Awesome! And the soundtrack was great. I think unless you have read the books and/or are under the age of 18, there is really no draw here.<br/><br/>I liked it, but then I have read the books and am sort of invested in the story. I love the character of Jacob and am interested to see if Taylor Lautner can muster the cajones to play this conflicted character. I am sure the casting directors are hoping he will grow in height and breadth in the next couple years to be able to appear as mountainous as Jacob is supposed to be. Either that or they are going to have to CGI the life out of him.<br/><br/>Can we make a movie tie-in about nothing but the history of vampire baseball and watch attractive vampires playing the game? I'm in."

From what I read, they were on a small budget too so seriously, that explains some of the cheesiness doesn't it? I will defend the writing also by saying that the writers had to stick to the book with certain things to not upset hardcore fans of the books. Some of those lines are decent in the context of a novel but are relatively cheesy when put on screen. That's not their fault. Can we also remember that this movie is based of a book that was written for teen readers?! No one should go into it expecting to see this year's Oscar winner.

But I also couldn't help but love the choices in actors.<br/><br/>Due to several different groups of students wanting to see the movie at different times I had to see it three times in one day.

"KateB819","8","0","5","30 November 2008"," Not a teen chick-flick, surprisingly enough!
","Okay, so to give you guys a little bit of perspective here, I am a 15 year old girl that loves the vampire genre, anywhere from Underworld to Buffy to True Blood to the Amelia Atwater- Rhodes vampire series. But I was not one of those ""Oh, Edward Cullen is so hot"" girls, and I dismissed Twilight as an overrated teen chick-flick, and in spite of what anyone told me, I was against seeing it.<br/><br/>Yet curiosity got the best of me, and I saw the movie. And boy, was I wrong. <br/><br/>Strongest point? Bella! She's played wonderfully by Kristen Stewart as well as not hard on the eyes (keep in mind I'm Kate Beckinsale's biggest fan, and am also fans of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Anne Paquin¬Ö sensing a pattern here?), and she pulls off the role pretty well. Her reactions are pretty realistic (as realistic as a movie about vampires can be), and she behaves like most normal girls would.<br/><br/>Weakest point? The chemistry. Sorry girls, but Edward Cullen & Bella did not cut it for me. Not that his looks or acting was particularly horrendous, but it's just that the chemistry between Edward and Bella didn't kick in until about halfway through the movie, when the action begins and overshadows the relationship anyway. All the time spent into building up the relationship was, in my opinion, wasted.<br/><br/>Plot¬Ö Definitely a strong one. It's kind of an old one by now ¬ñ human falls for vampire, vampire falls for human, and chaos ensues. The story seems pretty similar to the Underworld movies, and some elements from the True Blood series are mixed in as well. (And, for the record, the Sookie Stackhouse stories were published a full four years before that of Twilight) It is pretty original, however, in that Edward quickly shows his human side, instead of the way it was in Underworld (which took a full movie) and True Blood (Bill shows a short glimpse at the end of the second novel), and this proves to be rather refreshing. Without giving away too much, there is definitely a point to the story, which was what I was afraid this movie would be lacking. <br/><br/>So where's the personal touch in this review? I came into this movie thinking, ""Oh my God, this will be a monumental waste of 122 minutes of my life that I will never get back."" Then again, I thought the same thing about Hancock and was pleasantly surprised there, too. Same here.<br/><br/>The movie is in no way a bland teen movie, and definitely not a chick-flick. There is enough action and storyline to go around, and some romance if that's what you're looking for. I have not read the books yet, but I am certainly looking forward to reading them now.<br/><br/>So in the end, the equation is (if every element is 2 points): Vampires + plot + characters + kept my attention for 122 minutes + makes me want to see it again ¬ñ chemistry = 8.0/10.0 ---- FINAL VERDICT ---- Definitely worth checking out!!"

The movie I thought was good, but it had a potential to be excellent. I thought that all of the characters were time casted to perfection...However, the movie was too short and it showed scenes that were not even in the book. Why add to a book that has such great detail already and so much going on? If they followed the book as is, the movie would have been a lot better and at least, 3 hrs. In addition, the ending was just not that good. If a watcher has not read any of the other books, then then ending would leave them saying ""huh...the book didn't end that way...and why are they showing her at such a random moment and at the end?"" Didn't make sense!!<br/><br/>I really hope for the next movie, ""NEW MOON,"" that they follow the book as is and truly hope that an over 500 page book is turned into more then 2 hrs.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, though...the parts that did follow the book were wonderful and the actors were great...But, I just didn't like how I was thinking the whole time...""Did this happen in the book?""

Stephenie Meyer had indeed the speed and genuine fashion to shape a mythical subject into a new enthralling flick. Talking about the movie, the cast was brilliant, they indeed portrayed the characters as they are, the atmosphere and mood of the story was well defined, and however the flaw of the movies was about the story itself. I've heard that the script was too distorted compared to the book, and as I observed the movie the flow of the plot was rather ""jumpy"" I couldn't tell exactly where the story goes, especially when you slip a moment of talking to your friends and suddenly you find the movie in a different phase already. I could tell this that most watchers would find it hard to cling to the story's (most especially when you're not a reader of the book) character, I could even catch people around the cinema muttering ""Who's Victoria?"", ""Did she became a Vampire already?"" realizing this things around I doubt that the movie was a total hit.

","While the casting and acting are good, I found the movie to seriously lack elements from the book that needed to be there. The movie moves entirely too fast. Within the first few minutes, Bella is already on Edward's case, trying to figure him out, when in the book it takes her much, much longer to understand him. There's a lot of passion missing from the movie that was in the book (lots of their little playing and talking is missing). The way Jacob is presented and his whole tribe are seriously lacking. There was basically no development of the Cullen family's characters. The whole storyline with James was so shortened that it barely became suspenseful. While Edward is speaking the lines from the book that he can't live without her and she's saying the same things, I don't feel that they really showed you that intensity for the film. Everything was done on fast-forward with very little depth. Even her relationship with Charlie was too little. I do hope that the second film shows more story and considering the bulk of the second story is with Jacob, hopefully he'll be more in depth."

","I was a little generous when I rated Twilight, I'll be the first to admit that, but it isn't fair how low people are rating this movie. OK, the movie wasn't the best, but it wasn't for a lack of trying. The movie only had 37 million to work with and even though that isn't an excuse, you still need to take that into consideration. Twilight kept everything that was essential to the story, even when re-writing the script or changing location or overlooking certain details would've saved them lots of time and money. Which is more then I can say for recent film adaptations of books, Eragon*cough,cough*.They did the best they could with what they had. And as for people calling it cheesy, well read the books, they're a little cheesy too, but in a great way. Now lets talk about the elephant in the room, the acting. Was it the best? No. Could it get better? Possibly. Would I recast Kristin Stewart? Maybe. Rob (Pattinson) WAS Edward Cullen, he did an amazing job with his character. Kristin, however, probably should have read the book. You heard me, she did not read Twilight. And it showed, she was dead on screen and not in the sexy vampire way either. She was monotone, unresponsive and had ZERO emotional depth. I was so disappointed, I was expecting great things from her, heck, I would have even settled for mediocre. Kristin got by in this film by the skin of her teeth, but if she doesn't figure her life out by this March for the filming of the sequel, it won't matter if New Moon has a bigger budget or not, the main character won't be strong enough to keep the movie together."

Rob and Kris have amazing chemistry but other then that it was sometimes hard to comprehend why they would fall had over heels for each other. other times it was hard to see the love at all. they were barely touching. there were no sweet gestures to show us how important the other one is, thing the book is basically built on. this is even sadder given the fact that the few really couple-y scene they had were beyond awesome.<br/><br/>it seems that Im only complaining but there was another part that I liked and that was the music. it was very well chosen especially the two songs by Rob and also Linking Park.<br/><br/>it was just like watching HP again. the casting was great, the visual was breathtaking but the emphasis was on the wrong things. at least for me. but I liked it still. I was just expecting a little more of a love story."

","There is no possible way this movie could live up to the hype, and most of the bad reviews I have read have came from either people who have just read the book or haven't read it at all. Here's the deal, no actors would have been good enough to play Bella or Edward, all the girls pictured themselves as Bella and some sort of God as Edward.<br/><br/>Since there is an obvious time limit they had to cut a lot of things out from the book; and the only place where you get real character development is with Bella and Edward. You must remember though the majority of the original is in Bella's head and it is virtually impossible to include thought in a movie, and in my opinion Twilight did a better job doing this than the first Harry Potter did.<br/><br/>So if you are a Twilight fan don't over analyze the movie; just sit back and enjoy an epic romance from another point of view and let it wash over you. If you never read the books, I suggest you do; remember the book is ALWAYS better then the movie."

","The movie industry has never perfectly portrayed a book, so why have extremely high expectations? However, I was very impressed with the movie adaptation of Twilight.<br/><br/>I fell in love with the characters all over again with this movie. I am a teenager and it was geared towards people in that certain demographic. So what if it's not Oscar material, it was a really enjoyable movie to sit through and that is enough for me.<br/><br/>With it's young, fresh cast and less creepy take on vampires this movie is spreading the joy of the books through motion picture and inspiring young people to get out and actually read the books so they can get the full story. I, personally, don't see a problem with that."

","I read the article about Summit in the NY Times, and went to see the movie out of curiosity. I'd never read the books, or even seen a preview, so I went in as a completely blank slate.<br/><br/>To be honest, I was stunned. There are no surprises beyond moving vampires further down the monster-to-sex-symbol spectrum than ever before. But this predictability is one of the best parts in my opinion. It gives you exactly what you want. Good guys win, bad guys lose, and love conquers all. Filmmakers have latched so strongly onto the fad of unnecessary twists, turns and sudden deaths that this story feels like coming back to a bar of pure dark chocolate. Sometimes that simple, sensual experience is all you crave.<br/><br/>My first impressions through the introduction of Bella, her family, and her new friends were highly positive. I did not expect the characters to be so believable. The kids were excellently cast and did a very good job of portraying the social dynamics of high school without clinging to overblown clich√©s. Bella's father was one of the best cast and best acted characters in the whole film.<br/><br/>Then come the Cullens. I'm a college-age female, so the men of the family had the predictable effect on my heart rate. But, again, I think they did a good job. Carlisle radiated kindness and authority, Emmet was just fun, Alice was the perfect combination of vampire and pixie, and Jasper's intensity worked because he layered a kind of self-awareness under it that allowed it to be funny. I was thrilled with the casting of Rosalie because she is exactly what I consider spectacularly beautiful, though her kind of looks have gone out of fashion.<br/><br/>The two leads were excellent. I've never seen a young actress mix so many elements into portraying individual moments. In the first conversation in Biology, she manages to communicate confusion, attraction, shyness, and defiance without seeming to plan any of it. Edward's best moments were when the character was the most self-aware. He had to show the depth, patience, and experience of an old man underneath a seventeen year old in the throes of first love. But he was always at his best when he had that slightly self-mocking smirk as he struggled to reconcile his existence up to this point with the very human feeling of adolescent passion.<br/><br/>Of course, some of their more melodramatic scenes were iffy. So far, it seems to depend on the audience. If the crowd is quiet, you can absorb their intensity and make of it what you will. But if your theater is infested with less considerate gigglers, it's impossible to take seriously. I think a lot of what they said could have been more acceptable if more time was spent building up to it. Or if they had kept up the the characters' attempts to be offhand when expressing emotions that meant a great deal to them.<br/><br/>As far as the more technical aspects of the film go, the cinematography was breathtaking while the special effects were mediocre at best. They took full advantage of the spectacular setting in the Pacific Northwest. The visual effects really weren't very good though. I didn't mind the streaked-running effect except when Edward was carrying Bella, and the diamond-skin dazzle was passable and mercifully short. Outside of the baseball game, however, the wire work was awful. You could see from the motion of the actor's bodies that their center of gravity was at the harness, rather than where it would have been if they had actually jumped from the ground. The fight scene was cringe-worthy. If it weren't for Bella's convincing performance of the pain she was in, the whole ballet studio sequence would be a good time to go to the water fountain.<br/><br/>I think this film's reception thus far has suffered due to the nature of its strengths and weaknesses. Most of the film is spent exploring the casual lives of the characters, and the understated character development is very very well done. It is the more intense scenes (""my personal brand of heroin"" and the final fight) that feel a little too overdone. Unfortunately, this is what stands out in people's memories.<br/><br/>In the end, I loved the movie. I'm glad I watched it before reading the books because I would have done some things differently in retrospect, but I think they did a very good job overall. If dreams come true, Midnight Sun will be published and made into a movie along with the rest of the books. They will be able to go back to this story, tweak the few weak spots, and bring this very good film into full flower."
"Courier_New","7","0","6","29 November 2008"," I like it!
","Let's get basic; I enjoyed the movie. I didn't have many expectations for ""Twilight,"" good or bad. I have never read the books and I had looked up minimal information about this flick online, so I was going in with a clean slate.<br/><br/>I had seen the trailer just a couple days ago. Mother had told me that it was like Romeo and Juliet with Vampires. Otherwise, I entered knowing nothing.<br/><br/>For the negative, special effect-wise, this was awful. It was like a bad TV movie. The story didn't revolve much around flashy CGI, though (a positive relief in itself), so that really didn't matter in the long run.<br/><br/>The plot was really well done, but I guess I can ""blame"" that on the book. It took a number of clich√©'s and gave them rather delightful spins.<br/><br/>For example, it starts out with a girl (Bella Swan, played by Kristen Stewart) going to a new school in a remote area. Rather than the students usual of her being the hated outcast, however, they all over-love her. This was the first newbie they had met in years. As one student said, ""This is like second grade and you're our shiny new toy'.<br/><br/>In any case, the tale continues on with Bella having some tensions with an overly-pale guy (Edward Cullen, played by Robert Pattison) that sits next to her in biology class. When Edward stops a car from smashing her using his bare hands, she discovers that he's a vampire and becomes a romantic sucker for the blood-sucker.<br/><br/>The tale was character-driven to the max. Everything fit in. Everything had a reason. It was almost perfect in that respect.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, although I believe that the makers of this movie had too much confidence in this, judging by the excessive use of close ups, especially on mundane things such as glares and raised eyebrows.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'll give this one a 7.6/10 stars, a thumb and a half up, a B+ grade. This is a film wherein the pros highly outweigh the cons."
"threeeyedcat","6","0","4","29 November 2008"," Not really good or bad
","As someone who read the book and is not a big fan, I went into this movie thinking it was going to be horribly cheesy and unintentionally hilarious. It certainly was cheesy in some parts, however, overall it wasn't as bad as I expected. Yes, a lot of the dialouge is atrocious (""This is the skin of a killer!"") and there are some odd editing choices (extreme close-ups of people's eyeballs, choppy editing, sepia toning flashbacks to make them seem 'old-fashioned'), but this could have been A LOT worse. I think credit can be given to the director for handling certain scenes very well, like the make-out scene between Edward and Bella. She made it pretty hot by not overlaying it with generic background music or weird close-up panning shots of their lips and/or hands caressing one another.<br/><br/>My only complaint (other than the dialouge) was the pacing. It was very slow at the beginning, setting up the story and introducing all the characters (there are far too many by the way, I feel like I know that one girl that tries to be Bella's friend better than any of the Cullens, other than Edward). Then, in the last 30 minutes of the film, the 'bad' vampires come in and create a problem which is resolved too quickly to make any kind of impact on the audience.<br/><br/>I give this a 6 for being better than I expected, but still not really good."

","Okay, so the adaptation from the novel wasn't very good, and the special effects were terrible, but for someone who doesn't get crazy when a movie does not follow a book exactly, then I think Twilight delivers. The big box office draw and the millions of dollars this movie brought in WILL make the next three better because they can spend more on effects, writers, and other things that made Twilight lack luster. Those who have read the book seem to be the ones making the most fuss about the movie. Nearly every person I talked to who was completely unaware of the story-line before entering theaters has told me they enjoyed the film. The sets, make-up, and overall cinematography are all nicely done and the ensemble cast of unknowns can actually act, which was a pleasant surprise. Rob Pattinson did an amazing job portraying the sadness, angst, and awkwardness of a Vampire who hates himself and has been devoid of real love for over a century. He did a marvelous job and if for nothing else, I would see this movie for his performance. So there it is. Twilight is not the best movie I have seen all year, but it is certainly not the worst. It left something to be desired, but expect the next installments to be big box office worthy."
"bulletproofclod","2","0","4","28 November 2008"," Too Loyal of an Adaptation that Suffers from Corny Dialogue
","Let me start off with a basic disclaimer, though it almost seems silly because most people judge a review by the rating and subheading. I am a fan of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series. The books, and even the movie, is a fun form of escapism for people of all ages...though primarily the target audience seems to be adolescent girls with stars in their eyes over the fictional Edward Cullen.<br/><br/>The movie is made quite well, though some of the casting is suspect (the choice of Carlisle leaves much to be desired) and whether you are a die-hard fan of the books or not, one must acknowledge the corniness that is Twilight. Admittedly it's different when you're reading two teenagers profess their undying love and swear an eternal commitment, but when you see it on film it is undeniably cheesy, and there is nothing Catherine Hardwick, Robert Pattinson or Kristen Stewart can do about it.<br/><br/>The high school awkwardness is endearing and rings true as opposed to what Hollywood typically portrays adolescence to be (re American Pie, Gossip Girl, almost any teen movie of the nineties) it's easy to identify with Bella Swan, fish out of water and chock full of clumsiness.<br/><br/>The script simply reflects the novel, and it suffers accordingly. Some of the hackneyed lines could have been removed without detriment, and some of the cringe worthy scenes even evoke laughter from the crowd. The meadow scene, a fan favorite, is disappointing and almost silly, evoking awkward giggles when the bad CGI kicks in. <br/><br/>It's an entertaining movie that followed the popular book, but a less loyal adaptation would have been better."

","I took my wife to see this movie tonight, and I have to say that it was much, much better that I expected. I read the first book with her as well, and although I liked the book, I thought it was a bit wordy at times when Bella would gush over Edwards appearance. This occurred every 5-10 pages or so. Anyway, I thought the movie did a good job of bypassing all of that, but still showing the strong connection between the two characters. This is finally a teen movie that anyone can go see and enjoy. It is not just a tinny bopper movie. Also, the cinematography and music was great. I really enjoyed the film, and I will probably see it again on the big screen."

","I'm sorry there's many fans who are disappointed with this movie but I found that it was done pretty well. When I heard there was going to be a movie made of Twilight I was naturally excited like all the fans were, but then I saw the trailers...and then the movie posters and became less excited as the release date drew closer. However, I forced myself to go see the movie opening night and it was awesome. Sure, Robert Patterson wasn't my interpretation of Edward, but it's kind of impossible to find an actor (or human being) alive that resembles all of the qualities that make Edward, ""Edward."" Robert did a wonderful job portraying the one of the more complex characters in the books. I was also happy with Kristin's (forgot her last name) job as Bella. I was mostly worried, since everyone had something they didn't like (she doesn't look like Bella, she's too forceful for Bella, she can't change her expression to save her life etc...)but despite some minor annoyances and picky things about her portrayal of Bella she did great as well. As for the other characters, they all did phenomenal and I was pretty much drooling every time the Cullen family came on the screen. When my friend saw the Cullen's house she whispered to me ""it's perfect"" and indeed it was. On the downside however, there wasn't Bella's Lulabye anywhere in the movie...and Edward's sunglasses bothered me a lot lol. And yes, the movie didn't follow the storyline completely, but they added some things that I found amusing...Charlie meeting Edward while cleaning the shotgun...so deliciously clich√©. So, don't go into the movie expecting it to be exactly like the book. The book and the movie are separate things and should be looked upon as such for the ultimate viewing pleasure."

I am a fan of the series, I've read Twilight more than once...and I honestly loved every second of the movie. I understand a lot of people feel like the movie did not do the book justice, but come on people...the writers had to condense a long novel into a 2 hour film. I personally think they did an excellent job.<br/><br/>Sure, there were some quotes from the book that I wish were said in the movie...but other than that, I have no huge complaints. I thought there was just enough romance, intense but playful like it is in the book. And there was a lot of comic relief that brought the serious subject of forbidden love down a few notches.<br/><br/>The acting was by no means Oscar-worthy...but it wasn't unwatchable either. Robert Pattinson was unfailingly charming and beautiful....and I thought Kristen pulled off a clumsy, shy Bella well. I loved it. I plan on seeing it again. And I hope that New Moon and Eclipse are made in the near future. I would give the film 7 or 8 out of 10. Don't believe anything you hear until you see it for yourself.

","I just saw Twilight last night and I have to say...I loved it! From the trailers that I had seen leading up to the movie, I was expecting a very poorly done film that was very loosely based on the book and, frankly, poor acting. But I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they stayed true to the novel - some of the script was direct dialog of the book. I also loved the humour throughout that made the movie that much more interesting. I thought almost all of the characters were portrayed exactly as I pictured them. The Cullens looked better than I thought they would, Victoria, James and Laurent were so amazing, the school cast was awesome too (Mike Newton was my favourite!), Charlie, Billy, Jacob Black (he's just like I pictured him) were all great and Kristen Stewart makes a good Bella. I must admit I am not a Robert Pattinson fan at all, so it was a little bit difficult to like him as Edward...some of his scenes were a little cheesy and poorly acted. But, I guess it is hard to portray a vampire without looking to dramatic anyway, lol. Overall, I thought it was a great movie and I think any Twilight fan would enjoy it! The acting of the whole cast overall was really good, in my opinion, and it was entertaining from the first minute to the credits.

","WARNING SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!<br/><br/>So I went yesterday on a whim, my expectations being extremely low, knowing there was no way my vision of twilight could be brought forth in a movie adaption, and i was left totally beaten . It was incredible, from when the Cullens first glided in the cafeteria, and looked at the camera to the last embrace Edward and Bella held at the prom i was in tears. <br/><br/>It was so emotional to see the characters i have praised for the past years come to light, and what a beautiful light it was. It was truly something amazing. <br/><br/>The characters were not only spot on, the vision the director brought to the screen was absolutely and perfectly depicted. The music enhanced her vision so much than everything else, just because she saw twilight as this teenage rock melodramatic love story which i found very amazing. <br/><br/>Stewart was excellent, she took Bella and just forced her into her soul, I never had any doubts about Kirsten though because first i saw her in Speak and I read twilight and I thought she was perfect and second SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HER!<br/><br/>Robert was exceptional OMG although the voice threw me Little I saw Edward as a stronger character in his voice, but Robert must of seen it differently considering the fact that he was much more fragile than Edward appeared to Stephanie. But he took his statement as Edward and went with it and it was BEAUTIFUL i cried so much because it was so real and i really admire a young actor who can do that with his character these days because it is quite rare. <br/><br/>ALICE was PERFECT she was able to do it perfectly. Every move, every look was Alice , Alice was the actress it was great! <br/><br/>Rosalie was a bitch and it was great I loved when she smashed the salad bowl with her hands, it was great. <br/><br/>OK i couldn't really focus on Emmett. considering the fact that i have raging hormones and the man was sex on a stick and i just wanted to lick it off! HE WAS SO HOT and yet such a guy, which is what Emmett is so good job. <br/><br/>Jasper, looked scared all the time, i thought he was supposed to be... calm... you know...but its OK because Jasper will get better in time, he didn't really say much anyways he was good, i loved his face ha-ha. <br/><br/>ESME AND CARLISLE were perfect, ESME was so warm And Carlisle you could really tell he was the rock in the family who protected everyone.<br/><br/>Charlie was a heart breaker, he was great i cried when she had to leave him, just because he was so vulnerable and only wanted Bella to be safe, and it was great, and i honestly don't remember myself ever crying in the book when i read that goodbye seen. <br/><br/>Basically the movie just took you into Forks and never let go of you until the very end I enjoyed it very very very much. <br/><br/>Yes i am a twilighter and yes I approve of twilight the movie."

In truth it is not intended for everyone especially most teenagers because it's not flashy or for whatever other reason teenagers watch. I believe this movie can only really be appreciated by a mature audience. This movie got you up close and personal to the people in the film it focused more on intensity and being up close and personal. I like how they didn't protraye the characters in the movie to be underdeveloped and stupid and I enjoyed the movie a lot more than I did the book and I actually didn't like the book and thought most of the characters to be boring but in the movie they really brought it top life I rather not have read the book but watched the movie.

","I'm 64 years old and read Twilight at my 23-year-old daughter's recommendation, and ended up enjoying it enough to read all three books in the series. The movie, it seems to me, was exactly what one should have expected -- expected that is, if you hoped it would mirror the book with some accuracy, which, to me at least, it certainly did. It was, to be sure, a teen vampire movie that was neither deeper or more complex than the book, but neither was it shallower, and the primary actors were, I think, praiseworthy to the extent that the personalities that came through in the movie reflrected quite well what I got from the book.<br/><br/>After reading several reviews here, I expected to hear Edward squeak when he first opened his mouth, but ""Surprise, surprise!"" -- he sounded pretty normal. If you were expecting to hear Hugh Jackman, then yeah - you were in for disappointment but honestly, when they make New Moon, I hope they use the same cast as much as possible - as long as they can make Jacob a bit more macho-looking once he, um-m-m ..., matures, shall we say.<br/><br/>I never noticed the movie drag and was truly surprised, when it ended, that nearly 2 hours had passed.

","This review is from someone who has read all of the books. I was extremely excited for the movie, but tried to watch it with an understanding that only so much of the book could translate to the big screen.<br/><br/>So first, the positives: Kristen Stewart did a great job as Bella. Maybe could have used a smidgen more vulnerability. Great scene where Edward takes Bella to meet his family. I thought casting overall was great... Angela was a bit off... I pictured her quieter and with no ""Oh my God!"" statements. Rob as Edward was okay.. I think his prosthetic teeth made his speech a bit off, along with his expression.. I'd rather they hadn't done the prosthetics at all. His acting was great in parts, but okay in others. I personally found the first biology scene off. Meyers clearly describes Edward glaring at Bella, leaning far away from her, not covering his mouth an nose like he is going to be sick. I would've liked a longer or more emotional meadow scene and a longer scene with Jacob when Bella learns that Edward is a vampire. Also, the waitress at the Port Angeles restaurant was meant to be about 21 and hot, not weird... In short, I wanted more meaningful exchanges and glances between Edward and Bella, and I wanted a scene of Bella sleeping with her muttering ""Edward"". Overall, storyline much preserved, but I was not as emotionally invested as the book... mainly because the book relies on internal dialog and it doesn't translate to big screen."
"PrincessConsuelaBananahammock","9","0","6","24 November 2008"," Better than the book
","I might be in the minority when I say this, but I think that the movie adaptation of Twilight is better than the book. The special effects were pretty good and much more satisfying to watch than simply reading about, especially with regards to the baseball scene. I liked that there was very little of Bella's internal dialogue which got very repetitive in the books and the way that the Nomad vampires James, Laurent and Victoria were briefly introduced early on in the movie and kept popping up throughout it rather than just first appearing in the baseball scene as in the book. Changing their introduction brought on a feeling of impending menace and injected a bit more action. Having said that, I think it definitely helps to have read the book as the movie doesn't explain certain things as clearly as the book if such things are explained at all. The music is pretty good, but perhaps some of the pacing could have been tightened up a bit."

","Reading the book,Twilight,by Stepganie Meyer, made it nearly impossible to envision such a beautiful figure as Edward Cullen. At first I was partial to the book. I held onto the impossible fantasy of Edward. I couldn't stand the movie posters. They didn't do Edward any justice. His bronze hair and ever changing eyes, paired with his stunningly pale skin made for an impossible match; that is until I saw the Twilight Movie. At first I was lukewarm to the movie. Then I found Rob Pattinson (Edward!) to be only kind of attractive. The more he spoke to Bella (Kristen Stewart) the deeper I fell. Then in one line, it was over. He'd stolen my heart. ""You're like a drug to me... you're my personal brand of heroin."" By the end of the movie I was breathless and begging for more. The screen went black and I LITERALLY threw a fit in the theater. My friends laughed hysterically. The following day I went and bought the soundtrack AND one of the posters; so I can hear Bella's Lullaby and stare at his gorgeous face as much as I so choose. Cudos to Stephanie Meyer she brought Edward Cullen to the world and kudos to Summit Entertainment for bringing him to life! He's the one vampire that can bite me any day. Rob Pattinson's Edward has stolen my heart and I NEVER want it back."

","If you go to the movie expecting an exact replica of the book you will be disappointed. As a movie it is very good, everyone was extremely talented and did a great job. As a movie I LOVE it!!! The movie does a great job presenting what was important in the book. If this was absolutely exact to the book, there would be a lot of narration and it would be 5 hours long. If that is what you were expecting you're not being fair to the movie. At first it was a little funny for me to see something on screen that before had only ever been in my head as I read it, but it is fantastic to finally be able to enjoy both the book and the movie. Not too mention to finally hear some of my favorite lines said out loud! I can't wait to see it again!!!"
"momomomomo","8","0","6","24 November 2008"," never read the series.. cast was perfect!
","I never have actually read the twilight series and had never even heard of them until this movie came out so going into this movie I really had no idea what to expect. I dragged my boyfriend to it with me promising him it was supposed to be really good even though I had read bad reviews on this site about the movie so I was nervous it would turn out awful and corny and really hard to sit through and be never allowed to choose the movie to go see again. <br/><br/>I was actually really surprised by how much I actually enjoyed seeing this movie. It won't be up for an Oscar or anything but I feel like it was perfectly cast. If the casting wasn't so good this movie could have turned out awful. Even Bella and her dad looked alike and made a believable pair. I even fell in love with Bella's friends who portrayed that teenage awkwardness and sometimes immaturity perfectly and were very funny. It was a good contrast to the much more mature, serious relationship with Edward that Bella had. Kristin Stewart who played Bella seemed pretty distant in the film but I think that was just how her character was supposed to be and I thought she did excellent, Her and Robert Pattinson (Edward) made a potentially very corny relationship into something real and something desired to have. Pattinson was also the perfect cast in this film. He carried out his part well and at times when I was waiting for something he'd say to make me cringe, I never actually did, he was very charming and even the little funny parts that got snuck in were funny. If they weren't supposed to be funny then I don't really care because I still enjoyed it and feel like I was laughing with the movie and not at it... most of the time. Unfortunately me and my boyfriend watched the Southpark episode that poked fun at the movie beforehand, so a lot of the time I would hear my boyfriend bust out laughing because he said all he could picture was Butters as a ""vampire kid."" I also had some flashbacks to the South Park episode but it didn't ruin the movie at all. In the end he thanked me for taking him to the movie because he actually thought it was good!<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good decently light fun movie to see (i was afraid it would get really deep and overly dramatic but I don't think it did) and I loved that it wasn't entirely serious. I will definitely be seeing it again. I think I'll even try to read the series now. Maybe the editing or special effects were bad as a lot of people commented on, but I didn't notice, I wasn't out to look for mistakes either though. Just enjoy it!"
"bkworm_ran","8","0","6","22 November 2008"," It's a Movie, Not a Book
","Leave your book at home and go to the movie. When you do that, you will totally enjoy the movie and appreciate what they have accomplished. The cinematography puts you there. They did an awesome job giving the movie a feel of cold, gloomy days. Rob did a great job portraying Edward's conflicted feelings. Kristen's Bella was perfectly lost in a new school with strange students. The Cullen family was perfect. The fact that I hated Rosalie and loved Alice (as I did in the book) is terrific. Poor Jasper! Having to go through that first installment with that ""deer in the headlight"" look! It was great. Granted I could have used another hour and would have gladly sat through it. Over all it was a job well done.<br/><br/>The only character miscast for me was Laurent. He was a very dominant, suave personality in the book. You are supposed to believe he was the leader of this pack (even though it is James) and James and Victoria are just his naughty brood. I could barely believe this character was even a vampire.<br/><br/>I will go see this again and will wait patiently, re-reading the books, for the next movie."
"nats0901","6","0","6","22 November 2008"," Well.
","I'm not gonna lie, I expected this movie to be horrible. When I walked in, at 3:00, to see Twilight, it was filled with little teens. I thought, ""Great."" Once the movie started, I kept hearing girly screams. When the Cullens walked into the cafeteria, the people behind me almost popped my ear drums. So, I couldn't watch or hear the movie from that point on. I saw it later that night when all the girls went to sleep or something. Well, I thought it was cute. It could've been way better. Edward and Bella's relationship seemed... too... rushed. They could've made it a little longer to build up their relationship. For one, they could've eaten lunch together. Go through the ""blood type"" chapter. And so much more. I thought Jasper was perfect. Bella was perfect. But, Edward needed some work. I just couldn't believe what he was saying.<br/><br/>The lion and lamb part, was just... cheesy. Edward just blurts it out, making it sound... unmeaningful. I honest to God think it could've been made much much better.<br/><br/>All in all, It was... okay and cute. So, if you want to see a cute short movie, with a good plot, with alright acting, go and see twilight.<br/><br/>Read the book first."
"englerk1","7","0","6","22 November 2008"," Decent! =)
","I have read all 4 of the books and LOVED them. I think Catherine did an okay job as a director, but I'd rather have someone a little more...experienced? I'm not sure. I don't know if I care for her style much.<br/><br/>Edward= He is delicious. His facial expressions when he met Bella for the first time were odd, but then he got into it and was great.<br/><br/>Bella= pretty good...she has an annoying eyebrow and I can't figure out if it was her doing that on purpose or if she just got a bad wax. She grew on me quite a bit, actually, toward the end. I still don't think that any female is going to care for her character much based on the fact that she gets to swap spit with Edward.<br/><br/>Overall= Some acting was a biiiit woody here and there (Tyler. Poor poor Tyler. It's called acting, buddy. I think I could have done better than you),some of the effects were massively cheesy (see the running. *headshake* Come on, guys. You had a decent budget.), there were a few cut scenes that were weird (Olde-tyme Bella laying out on a couch with Olde-tyme Edward biting her neck in SEPIA?!? WTF?), and I wish the other characters (Alice, Jasper, Emmett) got more speaking time. But I came out with a BIG smile and the need to see it over and over again, and the thought of going however many months without it being on DVD makes me a little sad.<br/><br/>Oh, but on a kind of negative note--I hate when people whine about when a movie's not exactly like the book. Oh, granted, there were a few things where i was like ""What?! That doesn't happen here!! This doesn't even happen!!"", but I'm gonna go with at least 95% of it was in the book, and the 5% that wasn't in it, probably didn't NEED to be in there, but it was fine; it made sense and it kept the story progressing. And of course the characters aren't going to look exactly how they do in your head--but I'm sure that Stephanie Meyer probably got pretty decent influence on the casting and maybe the script? I read that she was happy with how it turned out--I do feel bad that some people were upset with it. That sucks; I went in with a ""hopefully it'll be awesome but if it's not...well...the books are still good."" thought process.<br/><br/>I think people get too sucked into the thought that it's a ""BOOK TURNED INTO A MOVIE"" thing. But I totally understand when you get kind of disappointed in a movie because it's not how you thought it would be--but there's no need to be cruel or anything about it. I wasn't fond of the few things I noted above, and Jasper's facial expressions were HILARIOUS when they probably shouldn't have been, and when Edward first saw Bella was proooobably the weirdest look I've seen in a while on screen, but if you just watch the movie and don't focus on the book connection, it's definitely worthwhile."
"xx-o-xx","6","0","5","22 November 2008"," Unevenly paced, but enjoyable
","I have read every single Twilight book, and the book I've read the most is, of course, Twilight itself. I went with a friend- I went into the movie with expectations, and my friend went in with no expectations. Maybe that's why I notice the problems more than she does.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with this movie is the pacing. There was no buildup to ""So the lion fell in love with the lamb"", and I seriously couldn't believe it when it happened. No chemistry up until that point.<br/><br/>However, after you realized they were a couple, it became easier to handle. The scene following the confession of love (Edward wearing sunglasses) is sweet. I love when Edward is in a good mood, but his melodrama through the movie was hard to handle (however, that is not the movie's fault, but the book's).<br/><br/>The ending was very confusing. That's all there is to say about that.<br/><br/>The best part about Twilight, by FAR, was the astounding soundtrack. I probably will buy it."
