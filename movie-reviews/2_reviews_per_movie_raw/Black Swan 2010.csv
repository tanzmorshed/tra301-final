","There are not enough words in the English language to describe the praise Darren Aronofsky deserves for Black Swan. It was one of the most talked about and sought after films at this year's Toronto International Film Festival (which I managed to snag a ticket for), and for good reason – it is a masterpiece that is just as much beautiful as it is nightmarish.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) has toiled for years within a New York ballet company, always pushing herself. The company has fallen under hard times, and director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) makes the swift decision to put on a new rendition of the classic Swan Lake. With the company's go-to lead pushed into retirement, Nina is quickly selected to be the lead in the new ballet. With competition arriving in the form of new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina begins a journey into dark uncharted territory.<br/><br/>Black Swan is an enthralling and visceral experience from beginning to end. Aronofsky has used what he has learned from making the raw and unflinching The Wrestler and the cerebral horror and incredibly disturbing Requiem for a Dream, and has crafted a film that you will simply not be able to take your eyes off of. He builds up rather slow, but right after that first moment of off-the-rails insanity, he delivers one hell of an incredible piece of cinema. One that is not easily able to be classified to any one genre.<br/><br/>While you may have read suggestions that Black Swan and The Wrestler are two halves of the same film, make no mistake at looking at it any further beyond the comparison of being about two people toiling within two very different forms of art. Black Swan is never a low budget character piece. It is a film that navigates between being thrilling and horrific at the same time. While the horror elements start to take more prominence in the second half (specifically the rather squeamish elements of body horror, done in a way that would make David Cronenberg proud), the film never lets one completely overtake the other. It manages to maintain this sense of dread, darkness and rather graphic wound/injury infliction throughout.<br/><br/>The visuals and editing are the drive of what helps make the film so well done. Contrasting blacks and whites so frequently give the obvious hints of good and evil, innocence and darkness. But Aronofsky likes to throw in hints of ambiguity at every turn, changing the colours for each character depending on the scene, and depending on what they may or may not be doing. Even the scenery and set design is in plain black and whites, always making the audience guess the true motivations and intentions of both character and creator. Adding in the element of reflection, both in others and the self (mostly through mirrors), only helps compound these feelings of ambiguity and confusion. It will consistently keep audiences thinking about what is being shown and what is actually going on. The subtle visual effects and astoundingly well done score only help add to the greatness.<br/><br/>Aronofsky also deserves recognition for the film's lean running time. When so many films are often far too long and dragged out, this film maintains a sense of momentum that never gets lost at any point. The film's slow points are never dragged out, merely well padded out for the shift from Nina being innocent to adrenaline soaked horror as she descends into the realm of darkness. Rather gracefully, Aronofsky manages to balance the goal of Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin's script to blend Nina's tale with the story of Swan Lake itself, and never loses sight or direction at any instance. This is bravado style filmmaking at its finest, and more than suggests that the brilliant direction in Requiem for a Dream was not a fluke.<br/><br/>Portman, who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer, delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina. At once you can see the innocent, sexually repressed little girl who just wants to please her mother, and the sexually depraved fallen angel, inching closer towards independence and adulthood. She is very clearly not ""well"" in the beginning of the film, and as the film progresses, you can practically chart her 180-degree reversal in character. She is downright terrifying in many instances, and more than proves her worth as an actress. When she finally dons makeup late in the film, her transformation from a once promising talent to a full blown powerhouse talent becomes simply marvelous to watch.<br/><br/>The supporting cast only helps to further complement Portman's extraordinary performance. Cassel is amazing as always as the slimy and twisted Thomas. We never really get more than hints at his true intentions, but Cassel makes every moment on-screen simply amazing. Kunis delivers a level of depth I never thought was possible for her. She commands the screen with every new scene, and this performance will easily act as a starmaking role for her. Hershey is even better; practically stealing the screen away from Portman's magnetizing performance. She makes Erica into that monster of a character everyone loves to hate, and brings a level of intensity to every mere moment she appears in. If anyone is even nearly close to equaling Portman's performance, it would be her. Despite only appearing for a few minutes, Winona Ryder is amazing in her role as the former lead ballerina Beth. I just wish she could have chewed up more scenery.<br/><br/>Black Swan is an incredible film from beginning to end, and will not easily leave you. It is a masterpiece of unheralded success, and is easily the best film I saw at TIFF. Watch out for it at Oscar time – it just may steal the show.<br/><br/>10/10."

","Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" makes ballet cool—and if that isn't a Herculean feat in itself, I don't know what is. It also happens to be one of the best films of the year, featuring one of the best performances of the year. Natalie Portman will be nominated for her devastating portrayal of petite perfectionist Nina the ballerina or I'll pull a Werner Herzog and eat my shoe.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is cut from the same cloth as Aronofsky's 2008 film ""The Wrestler,"" if at the opposite end. Interestingly, before either project was realized, the director was reportedly mulling a drama about the relationship between a professional wrestler and a ballerina. Somewhere along the way, however, that concept was split down the middle—and thank God. ""Black Swan"" is brilliant, but it wouldn't necessarily play well with others.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, the film examines a physically demanding and widely unappreciated art, and though thematically similar, the two complement each other via mutually exclusive cinematic vernaculars. ""The Wrestler"" is ultimately a safer film. Its emotional experience is directly conveyed via plot and dialogue. What Aronofsky attempts with ""Black Swan"" is riskier: he plays genre Frankenstein, taking established themes and transplanting them into that which feels initially least appropriate—horror.<br/><br/>Yet despite certain unmistakable cues, I'd hesitate to call ""Black Swan"" a horror film. Visually, maybe, but John Carpenter insists ""The Thing"" is a Western, and likewise there is more to ""Black Swan"" than is aesthetically obvious. It probably best fits the psychological thriller mold, but as Aronofsky suggests through his manipulation of mirrors, it is not a film that ever casts a clear reflection. For me, that dichotomy is what makes it so fascinating and rewarding.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" strikes an immediate haunting note that seems to grow louder with reverberation rather than quieter. In the first half, the director lays track work; in the second, he runs right off it. Nina begins her journey receiving the coveted role of the Swan Queen in a modernist production of Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake."" Her practiced technique makes her ideal for the role of the goodly White Swan, but her lascivious director (Vincent Cassel) has reservations about her ability to portray her evil twin, the titular Black Swan—a character that embodies impulse and lust. Nina's process of unlearning takes her to increasingly dark, surreal depths.<br/><br/>The final act of the film comprises the most riveting 40 minutes I've seen on screen all year, though ""Black Swan"" is never the mindf**k some have improperly labeled it. Aronofsky deliberately builds atmosphere and anticipation toward a Kubrickian climax that is at once obvious and stunning. Tchaikovsky's score falls like an aerial assault, and that inherent theatricality collides with Aronofsky's narrative as they come to a dual boil.<br/><br/>Perhaps best of all, however, is that for all the audacity on display, the director knows when to dial it back as well. The casting of Mila Kunis (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" ""That 70's Show"") was idyllic. She plays a comic relief of sorts, with a comely, down-to-earth veneer but viperous eyes. Her performance is fantastically calculated—she provides derisive, but much needed perspective on Nina's deteriorating sense of reality.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is a wholly effective work born from the shadowy underside of the mind, anchored by a career-defining turn by Portman. It is a quick, impulsive piece, but it explains artistic devotion and the consuming nature of obsession as well or better than any film I've ever seen. In hindsight, it feels more characteristic of the filmmaker responsible for ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" than ""The Wrestler,"" though the parallels between it and ""Black Swan"" run deep.<br/><br/>They may be cut from the same cloth, but the difference between the two is as stark as black and white. Hail Aronofsky, the Swan King."
"dpoll390","10","644","943","5 December 2010"," ""Perfect""
","I had the opportunity to see Black Swan in one of the 18 theaters that it opened up on this weekend, although I generally do not do so, I was compelled to write a review of the film.<br/><br/>From top to bottom, this film is at the height of what it means to be true art in cinema. The various elements of the film, the mise-en-scene, was so incredibly structured by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky that one need only sit back and admire at the fluidity of his camera movement, or the marvelous hue of colors amidst a film which has it's color scheme largely dedicated to the symbolism of black and white.<br/><br/>The performances where spot on, Vincent Cassel was terrific as the suspicious teacher, whose brilliance and lust for the dancers in his show are both quite reputable, one often beating out the other. And Mila Kunis truly shines in this one, bringing out a side of her many probably didn't know was possible. She is absolutely beautiful and aptly portrays the black contradiction to Natalie Portmans white, a terrific contrast of good and evil. Kunis, however, as many may assume, is not meant to be there to spark a general conflict of good vs evil, but to emphasize the side of Portman that we have not yet seen. A side that will drive her to the brink of insanity to obtain.<br/><br/>And therein lies the true theme of the film, obsession and physical strain over all else. Much like ""The Wrestler"" we have the main character dedicated to an unappreciated form of physical art. Here, it is Portman's obsession with becoming the lead of the ballet Swan Lake which drives her into madness. You enter her mind as her teacher pushes her to become perfect, pushing her to let go of her fragile White Swan and become the loose and destructive Black Swan. As you follow her through the stages of her audition leading towards a booming finale she becomes less and less aware of what around her is distortion and what is reality. As she loses grip, Aronofsky's ability to depict psychological deterioration shines through.<br/><br/>And make no mistake, this film belongs to Aronofsky and Portman. As stated, Aronofsky captures everything beautifully in frame, his movement of the camera is almost as fluent and beautiful as the very dancers on the screen. His use of behind the head vantage shots has been a bit of a trademark of his, allowing as to see what the character is. And his use of lighting is nothing short of extraordinary. But now comes the true star: Natalie Portman. She blew me away, from start to finish, she displayed her transformation for the sweet girl to the physically and psychologically obsessed, all the way through attempting to embody the white and black swan when necessary, literally trying to become them in her mind, driving her towards insanity in the pursuit of perfection. Words cannot describe Portman's performance here, to say it is Oscar worthy would be a vast understatement, as the depth of her character goes so deep it would nearly be worthy of playing two separate roles. So fragile at time that you fear for her life, and so corrupted at others that you hate her. Acting at it's finest, Portman deserves an Oscar.<br/><br/>All things considered the film is nearly perfect, one of the best dramas I've ever seen, and one that is as iconic and intense as it is horrifying at times. Just to mention a few other things, Winona Ryder, in the small amount of screen time she had, was spectacular, and truly terrifying during particular scenes. And as always, when Aronofsky and Clint Mansell team up, the score is both epic and eerie, somehow simultaneously. The overcasting score of a distorted and intense version of Swan Lake itself brilliantly compliments the atmosphere throughout the film as these two artist have done before. It could nearly work as a silent film, that's how brilliant it is. If you get the opportunity once this film undoubtedly expands to other theaters see it, it's harrowing and at times difficult to watch, but that combination of beauty and horror makes it impossible to turn away."
"moviemanMA","9","302","446","5 December 2010"," The price of perfection
","Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is an examination of obsession. Obsession for beauty, fame, and above all, perfection. We are shown glimpses of its splendor, only to be consumed by the ugliness and harsh reality that is the world of professional ballet.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers, played by the talented Natalie Portman, is placed in the precarious situation of replacing the company's former star (Winona Ryder), the shining pupil of director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), in the production of Swan Lake. The role is a dual role, in which she must play both the sweet, innocent White Swan as well as her evil twin sister, the Black Swan. Though Nina is best suited for the White Swan, she must find a way to evoke her inner Black Swan.<br/><br/>Though all of the ballerinas in the company would kill for her role, the least jealous one, Lily, played by Mila Kunis in a breakthrough performance, has become Nina's biggest rival, catching the eye of Thomas. Still, Nina is set on perfecting the role.<br/><br/>It is Nina's obsession for perfection, a constant theme through the film, that is the root of her troubles. This obsession is passed down from her mother, played brilliantly by Barbara Hershey. She too was a ballerina but gave up her career to support Nina, living vicariously through her daughter. Her obsession for dance is shared by all dancers, really, but Nina takes it a step further, causing it to physically and mentally affect her.<br/><br/>The pain and suffering that Nina's goes through takes its toll early on in the film. She sees herself on the faces of strangers, the scratching and itching she inflicts on her back, yet we never see, and the scrapes and cuts that appear out of thin air, as if something inside of her is ready to burst out. As the film goes on, it becomes more clear that her thoughts and hallucinations are blending with her reality to the point where she can't distinguish the two from one another.<br/><br/>Here's where Aronofsky's obsession/passion for filmmaking takes over. He too seeks perfection in his work, finding the right camera angles, the right tempo, and the right composition. This film has some of his best camera work to date, thanks to the cinematography of Matthew Libatique, whose fluid camera movements are the glue that hold the film together.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is a director who tries to make his shots look as beautiful as they can be, while not blowing you away with CGI and special effects. The Fountain, though not a perfect movie by any means, had some truly outstanding photography (also partnered with Libatique) that wasn't heavy on the artificial special effects. Here he makes a similar attempt to create an incredibly realistic picture. It helps that both Portman and Kunis dedicated months and months of training and dieting to get the appropriate look for the film. That hard work paid off for sure.<br/><br/>Without those two ladies the film would be lost. Having seen the film I can't see another actress in either role. They were perfectly cast. Portman, though not afraid to show some skin for the camera in a film like Closer (and even Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones), acts and appears so fragile and innocent in many of her roles. Kunis on the other hand, hearkening back to her days on ""That 70s Show"" has always been the pretty girl with a bit of attitude. Her eyes are almost hypnotic. These two women play perfectly off of each other, contrasting like the two swans in the ballet. I'm sure the talk of the movie will be the scene in Nina's bedroom (see it for yourself), but I enjoyed their night on the town leading up to the bedroom scene more. We see Lilly's influence and persuasiveness affect Nina tremendously.<br/><br/>Their performances are backed by a tight story. It's takes us places that we least expect to go, showing us beautiful and disturbing images that you would not expect from a movie about ballerinas, making Black Swan one of the more original psychological thrillers in the past decade. Like every good thriller, there needs to be good music, too. Enter Clint Mansell, whose score for Aronofsky's second film Requiem for a Dream has become one of the more beloved scores of all time. I am particularly fond of his work for Moon, but Requiem is just as good if not better. Here we have a great blend of classical and original pieces.<br/><br/>These pieces come together to create a portrait of a dancer whose demeanor gets in the way of her heart's yearning for success. When her dreams start slipping, her mind does the same. Passion leads to obsession. Obsession leads to transformation. The White Swan becomes the Black Swan, and she must pay the price."
"hypercube","10","328","496","21 December 2010"," Remarkable.. Aronofsky holds nothing back
","Yeah, it must be Darren Aronofsky, at it again. I'm certain I've just seen a brilliant piece of filmmaking, but at the same time I feel like I've just been run over by a convoy of trucks. It will be a while before I calm down enough to sleep, so here I am.<br/><br/>Not everyone is as big as of an Aronofsky's style as I am, but one thing that can't be denied is that he is great at working with actors. Ellen Burstyn, Mickey Rourke, and now Natalie Portman are all very accomplished actors who have found a new level and delivered transcendent performances under Aronofsky. In Black Swan, Natalie Portman's turn as Nina Sayers is, hands down, the best acting performance of 2010-- male or female. If you'll forgive the cliché, I completely forgot Nina was Natalie Portman about five minutes into the movie. As Nina goes deeper and deeper into her role as the Swan Queen, Portman only becomes more and more captivating. The entire cast is excellent, but Portman alone makes this movie a must-see.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is at his boldest heading up Black Swan. His depiction of Nina's struggles as she succumbs to growing pressures from her director, her mother, her rivals, her physical ailments, her personal need for a perfect performance.. it is intense, thrilling, exhausting, and truly gripping throughout. Part of what makes it work is that we are completely along for the ride with Nina. We see what she sees, we experience what she experiences, and sometimes it is truly distressing stuff.<br/><br/>As great as the first 60-70 minutes are, man oh man, nothing can prepare you for the final 30. This finale takes you to places I can't even describe. I dare say it's on par with Requiem for a Dream's devastating third act. It's a masterfully crafted climax that only Aronofsky could deliver.<br/><br/>I am glad Aronofsky is able to do what he does. His brutal and uncompromising style is definitely not for everyone, and it's not box office gold, but for those viewers who connect with what he's doing, the experience is truly something special."
"mikelepost","5","569","911","11 January 2011"," Mediocre and immature
","Based on the commercials for Black Swan, I walked into the theater expecting to see a film about a career ballerina who is forced to access her repressed dark side in preparation for her role as the swan queen and cracks under the pressure. Instead, the film I saw was about a meek young woman who's possibly schizophrenic and certainly on the verge of a nervous breakdown from the opening reel. There's no real drama because Nina is already broken. All that's left is for the viewer is to watch her become increasingly unhinged.<br/><br/>Black Swan has a lot of flaws: The conception of Nina (Natalie Portman) is a major problem. No woman this childish and meek would ever last in an elite dance company, so it's highly improbable that the company director (Vincent Cassel) would single her out for the prima ballerina role. We keep hearing about how Nina is technically perfect but clinical and restrained, but we never see any evidence of this fact because Portman is filmed mostly in tight facial close-ups during these scenes, probably to disguise the fact that her dancing isn't so spectacular.<br/><br/>The film is utterly predictable in that Nina becomes increasingly unhinged to the point that we, the viewer, no longer know whether what we're watching is ""real"" of one of her hallucinations, which greatly resemble horror movie clichés: she's stalked by her doppelganger, her reflection moves with a mind of its own, she imagines mutilating herself, etc. None of these images are particularly inspired and they spell out the theme of the story in the most obvious way.<br/><br/>Black Swan was utterly derivative of other, better movies. I haven't seen The Red Shoes but so much of Nina's relationship with her mother was cribbed directly from The Piano Teacher that Michael Haneke could probably sue Aronofsky for plagiarism. Likewise, the whole angle of Nina's repressed sexuality leading to her breakdown was done better by Polanski in Repulsion, and that was almost 50 years ago. Black Swan is mostly a hodge-podge of better films.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is every bit as Manichean as its title, with only two poles for its characters: perfectly pure and virginal white or the sensual black whore. Nina has a few drinks, masturbates and tells her oppressive mother off, and we're supposed to take this as some sort of exploration of her ""dark side."" Her rival ballerina Lily (Mila Kunis) literally has black wings tattooed on her back. Could you get any more obvious? I'd suggest that Black Swan works best as high camp and there were some unintended laughs in my theater, but the film is so self-serious and artistically restrained that it's not even gonzo enough to be funny. Mostly it's misery porn that wallows in Nina's suffering without giving the viewer a credible rationale for watching.<br/><br/>Look, the film is well-directed, it looks great, the actors generally deliver good performances despite under-written roles. I've seen many worse films than Black Swan. But in this case the hype is so wildly overblown that I'm tempted to rate the movie even lower than it deserves. Truthfully, this is a 6 out of 10 picture and only slightly better than average."
"DirkesDiggler","10","434","699","28 October 2010"," Absolutely amazing.
","I was lucky enough to see this at the Austin Film Festival and was absolutely blow away.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is, in many ways, like Nick Cave. You know going in that you are going to get something gritty, raw, and real. You know that, even if it's good, it's going to be hard to process. But when he gets a hold of something, really gets a hold of it, you won't be able to look away, no matter how hard it is to watch. He is a singular filmmaker in the regard that he can create something that is both visceral and cerebral at the same time. Others can do this, but few as well. What he does is never hollow, shallow, or empty, it is always dense, deep, and rich with everything that makes film great.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is no exception. In many ways this is the most Aronofsky of his films. His style is spot on and works exquisitely with the world he is presenting. It's surprising because he normally shows the dirty, gritty, and ugly places, where as everything in this film is clean and polished. But don't let that fool you, he saved the dirt and grit for the characters. It's remarkable that the man who was able to show the sensitive, and vulnerable side of a wrestler is also able to show the brutal and hard side of a ballerina? For starters, this film looks amazing. The production design, specifically the use of black and white in contrast (don't spend time looking for this, it's everywhere and you will miss something if you do) does it's job without feeling invasive. The lighting is brilliant, as is the staging of the dance scenes. I'm still stunned that the same eye that brought the grainy subway bathroom of ""Pi"" to life is the same eye that brings all this rich and beautiful color so clearly to the screen.<br/><br/>He also does a brilliant job of creating the world that these characters inhabit. This film reminded me of all the terrible parts of my theater days. The backstabbing, the trash talking, and the two faced nature of that world is portrayed with a deft and brilliant touch. There is a constant fear that you are one mistake away from losing not only your part, but your future parts as well. You feel like you are a part of this world, that he pressure of it is part of your world.<br/><br/>The camera work is great, if a little typical of Aronofsky at times (we see the backs of heads quite a bit, it works, but you see it a lot), but it is very affective. The somewhat jittery, close hand-held shots are perfect and pull you deeper into this world than may be comfortable.<br/><br/>Then there are the name performances. Of the name actors you mostly get what you expect. Portman, Cassel, Hershey, and Rider are outstanding. The only real shock, for me anyway, is Mila Kunis. I know her as Jackie from ""That 70's Show,"" and nothing else. She damned near steals the show. That's right, in a move where she shares screen with Natalie Portman, AND Vincent Cassel she is able to not only hold her own, but walk away with some scenes. The interplay between her wild, unrestrained Lilly, and Portman's frightened, tightly wound Nina creates a brilliant external tension to match, and at times overpower, the internal tension that lies at the very core of Nina.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of Aronofsky's work since I saw ""Pi"" on it's original theatrical run ( I think I was the only person in the theater for that midnight show), and he has yet to disappoint. He has a definite point of view and a thematic core that runs through his work. Thematically, this is in keeping with most of Aronofsky's work. It's about control and the loss of that control. What happens when a perfectionist control freak is in a position where she HAS to let go of that control? What takes over when she does let go? In typical fashion, Aronofsky shows us that sometimes in striving to get what we want, we risk losing a part of us that we may never be able to get back, and don't realize how desperately we need.<br/><br/>Read more from me at www.thefilmthugs.com"
"bob the moo","Null","33","48","31 January 2011"," Engaging psychological horror despite not being as ""high-brow"" as the ballet frame suggests
","Esteemed IMDb writer Theo Robertson messaged me the other day about this film and, while I skimmed it for fear of having him influence me in terms of his opinion, I did read that several older people had walked out of this film, seemingly having expected some sort of high-brow film with its roots in ballet. One can understand why because with all the award buzz and the superficial subject matter (ballet) combined with the actress and of course the previous work of the director, this must surely be an intelligent piece to be ""appreciated"" and ""considered"". What one wouldn't expect would be a film that, with a bit more gore, could easily be just another trashy horror/thriller that is released on video and has plenty of sex, violence and jump scares to it.<br/><br/>Well, got news for you, this is what Black Swan is – albeit a superior example of the genre. Essentially our lead character struggles to get in touch with her dark side when she wins the lead in Swan Lake, gradually losing touch with reality and/or being hunted by those around her who wish her harm. This manifests itself through some painful scenes of self-harm, imagined doppelgangers, intense sexual discovery, shadowy figures and a domineering mother who keeps her controlling menace under a veil of vulnerability that only falls here or there. It is trashy stuff in a way but it is done very well so that it produces this genre material but does so in a way that feels slightly classy while also engaging more than it would thanks to a brilliant turn by Portman.<br/><br/>And she is brilliant. I understand the mother because of how well Portman plays – this is not a character she has worked on for a few months, this feels like a product of years under the influence of this mother. She is nervous to her core, frustrated by her own inability to be this ""thing"" that she has spent her life not being – wild, loose, imperfect. Portman nails it and while I don't think it is a brilliant film, her performance is little less than brilliant. In support Hersey is equally as good with less time to do it. The flickers across her face say so much and I was impressed that with so little I was able to understand roughly what had happened in the previous 20 years. Cassel is simplistic but effective in his predatory director turn. Kunis is unbelievably sexual and again she helps the lead role by showing us everything that Nina struggles to find in herself. Ryder is solid in a smaller role. Aronofsky's direction is strong but particularly impressive is the cinematography – the camera flows so well around the scenes (and yet appears in no mirrors). I think he knows he is making a horror movie so, although he embraces the ballet, he doesn't avoid the shock or the build of the horror.<br/><br/>Some have embraced this film as art and a thing of beauty – while others have come away disappointed because that is what they expected it to be but didn't find it. However Black Swan is an effective psychological horror movie that just happens to be set in the world of ballet. As such it is very much a genre movie even if the director etc lift it to feel like more. In particular Portman makes the film – I cannot think I have seen her better and her Oscar (can there be doubt?) will be deserved."
"Samiam3","8","182","302","3 December 2010"," An epic and nightmarish delight
","Natalie Portman lives a dream and a nightmare when she gets a chance to dance Swan Lake in Darren Aronofsky's new film<br/><br/>Black Swan is a very bi polarized film. Portman dances as the white swan flawlessly, but her 'brilliant' choreographer has doubts about her as the black swan. She needs to 'live a little' and be less mannered, but the closer she gets to that point, the more the walls start to close in all around her.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky, though he comes close to being heavy handed, has delivered a project which is fiery, spectacular and clever. He sells us ballet as something dark and off putting, starting from his decision to reveal what dancing does to peoples bodies. One mistake and you can crack a toe nail under your body weight, but I don't wanna oversell it. To look at Black Swan in another way, it is an operatic horror film, It has incredible style, but uses it not so much to dazzle but to confuse and intimidate. The paradox of Black swan is that it creepiness is kind of seductive, because it draws you in (much like the way vampires are supposedly romantic)<br/><br/>But style is only half the picture (not even). The rest is in the cast, and mostly in Natalie Portman. She is slow to get started, but she grows quickly and the result is arguably her best performance yet. I've never loved her that much. She's always struck me as more of a girl than a woman, but I guess all she needs is to get a little blood on her hands, and you have an award worthy performance. Vincent Cassel, though he gets some questionable lines, is also at his best. I would have almost liked to see more of him, because you get the sense that his role has a bit more room to grow.<br/><br/>Black Swan does quite a bit, but it's not for everyone. Do not go into this expecting to be emotionally enriched. From the beginning, it is staged to be a mind-twirl, delighting in playing tricks on the audience. Some might call it cheating, but that would be the wrong way to look at Black Swan. It's quite epic, and with year coming to an end, I think it's fair to say that it is among the best of 2010."
"gapodaca1","1","448","786","11 January 2011"," Is it just me? We get it, it's a competitive dance world and it can drive you mad.
","Thumbs down. I've compared this movie to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, that is if Mr. Hyde went M.I.A. It was self-indulgent, over-rated and for my money, a waste of time. Sure, Natalie Portman deserves credit for losing 20 pounds and learning some dance moves, but, her acting was flat. Most of the film she played Nina as the Naive, frustrated woman the role required. However, where was the redemptive aggression of the Black Swan? That would have been an action challenge! It was reduced to a few scenes at the end. Wasn't that the whole point of the film? It felt like, ""OK, we're almost out of money so let's wrap this up."" And don't try to label the movie sophisticated or artsy. Please!!!! There's no more sophistication here than a skin-flick on Cinemax. Just because Nina grows wings on stage and her eyes turn red does not make an art-house masterpiece. And the tired lesbian scene is so gratuitous and, frankly, offensive. Yep, another gay predator trying to take the good straight girl to the dark side. I believe this story could have been told beautifully. And not all of it is bad. The music was good and some of the dance scenes were believable. I also liked the camera-work. But, somehow - let's blame the screenwriter and the director - it all turns into a boring cliché': resentful mother pushing her daughter to the brink, lesbian sex-scene, the older man/younger women love triangle, etc. Can anyone tell an original story anymore? Boring! As for Portman, she will win the Oscar for ""Black Swan,"" however, she should have won it for ""Closer."""

","Well, I lost track. Seriously. I am still astonished at the high rating it had here at IMDb (which rarely lets me down) as that is what encouraged me to go.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, whether the white swan or black swan, is an expressionless member of the chorus selected by the choreographer to play the lead in Swan Lake. Inexplicably, I might add, when there are far more talented dancers around her.<br/><br/>She is a one-note swan. Her facial expression never varies from sad, purse-mouthed and leaky eyed. I got so tired of looking at her face and it is shown just about all the time. To top it off, I felt absolutely no connection with any other character as the movie wound excruciatingly along on its hopeless execrable way to nowhere.<br/><br/>The lack of script is a serious flaw: but the graphic detail of what she does do is laid out: she vomits, she slashes herself, she lives with her mother, she has lesbian sex - sorta, but she has no background, no character, apart from mommy's girl, no friends, no interactions with others apart from the briefest of convos about ballet. The mother is completely cardboard - with matching dialogue - ""I gave up my career for you, poor me"".<br/><br/>This comes across as a horror movie with an unnecessary disgust factor aiming for the roof. I covered my eyes many times. Not in fear but in a kind of shame that a movie could be this bad. It is not even a good ballet movie, the dance sequences are choppy compounded by the uneven hand of the director everywhere.<br/><br/>When the audience started to laugh about 1/3 of the way through, I knew it was all hopeless. I joined in, that's how appallingly bad it all was. In the final scene, the laugh meter topped out. It is that unbelievable and unintentionally comedic.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 from me as minuses are not allowed.<br/><br/>Avoid."

","I was very lucky to snag tickets to see Black Swan at the the Toronto International Film Festival. <br/><br/>THE GOOD: Natalie Portman's acting was perfection - definitely an Oscar worthy performance. Mila Kunis's performance was surprising in a good way, it is clear that she stepped out of her comfort zone. The film's musical score was superb. Of course, much of it was taken from 'Swan Lake', but I loved that they were able to incorporate that music throughout the entire film and not just in the ballet scenes. Of course, it was beautifully shot and the plot was riveting - I was drawn in from beginning to end. The audience saw a new side of ballet/ theatre that is not often shown in popular films - the struggle the performer faces in committing to and perfecting a role. The struggle between 'good' vs. 'evil' was presented in a methodical and intriguing way. <br/><br/>THE BAD: Many parts of this film felt like it belonged in the horror Genre. Some parts definitely made me jump or cringe (which I was not expecting). The film was also an emotional roller-coaster, which was fine at first, but This 'emotional roller-coaster' sort of dragged on to the point that it almost felt like it was too much. I just feel that it could have been tuned down a notch. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought that most of the film was wonderful, and I highly recommend it."

","By Linda Winsh-Bolard I don't know why I do this to myself. It is not as if my expectations were high, or hardly any. I was not paid to see it. But I did. It was a dismal experience.<br/><br/>A young, ambitious, starved in all meanings of the word dancer gets chosen for the part of Odette/Odille, here called the Queen Swan and the demands of the performance further the unraveling of her psyche.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is Nina, the insecure dancer with controlling mother (Barbara Hershey) and desire for limelight. Mila Kunis is Lily, the equally starved, fun, drug, sex and alcohol loving newcomer. Nina feels threatened by the incomprehensible Lily having just witnessed how brutally the artistic director (Vincent Cassel)dealt with the former company's star, Beth.<br/><br/>Nina begins to have odd experience and visions, everything seems suspicious to her. She is getting paranoid. All that while she trains to dance the double part that is, in this film, presented as virginal innocence versus evil seducer.<br/><br/>From the beginning the premise is off kilter. Ballet companies contract number of prima ballerinas and premier danseurs. These are the dancers who will perform the title roles. They do not audition for each part; nor would anyone dare to call a prima ballerina ""girl"".<br/><br/>Each significant role in any ballet has at least three dancers performing it. This is necessary because there could be more than one performance a day which would pose a real strain on dancer's body. Hence there is never just one ""name"" posted or adulated. Premier dances in USA usually perform and train together- think of Gelsey Kirkland and Misha Baryshnikov. And the Odette/Odille part is traditionally danced by two different dancers. In one staging, the Black swan was danced by black prima ballerina while the White Swan by a white one.<br/><br/>I have never even heard of am artistic director who would pick a dancer form the corps de ballet and elevated her to primadona. I assume such action would cost dearly in law suits.<br/><br/>As per the constant sexual innuendo, the film is about 30 year late for that.<br/><br/>Ditto for those starved, little girl bodies that Balanchine so adored and abused. That has been over for a bit now as well as most of the sexual harassment. Not all, but most.<br/><br/>Nina would not be the first woman who, while perpetually undernourished, under extreme stress of unnatural expectations (no dancer is as good as the computer image), exposed to alcohol, drugs and power manipulation would crack.<br/><br/>But to present this as succumbing to the role is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Dancers train to dance. The ballet mistress/mister is rarely concerned with the story beyond its barest gist. Their effort is for exact movement, timing, high jumps and effortless look. Anyone in dance company will hear the word ""heels"" (as to land on your heels and jump from your knees) far more often than ""seduction"".<br/><br/>The presented milieu is a throw into the past, those stories read and heard on the fringes.<br/><br/>Only when I realized that the entire production was run by men, it began to make sense.<br/><br/>This is one of those stories where males present feeble female mind. Females are only capable of submission to male will, they desire to do so and sexually starved virgins go mad. Females cannot live without males; it is unnatural. Ambitions is unseemly in a female whose psyche is best suited to nurturing of a child and making home for her man. Nina goes mad because she is a warped female, as is the former star ballet, Beth (Winona RyderWinona Ryder).<br/><br/>As a statement of Christian teaching cliché, the film does a good job. As a presentation of male ego and the nearly absolute lack of understanding of women by those men of certain age and education, it does an excellent job.<br/><br/>As dancer and dancer's world picture is worthless.<br/><br/>As a portrait of a prima ballerina it is a bad joke.<br/><br/>As for dancing, there is very little of it. The memorable moment comes as Odette, i remarkable costume and mask, finishes her solo; Nina's arms grow black make-up and change into beautiful black wings. It is a very compelling image possible only in film.<br/><br/>So, I went to take a class. Adult ballet dancer have to this every day. I did not dream about becoming Odette. I always hated those 16 turns on each leg- the film does not show them either.<br/><br/>Fox Searchlight, directed by Darren Aronofsky, written by Mark Heyman, Andrew Heinz and John McLaughlinJohn McLaughlin."

","When a movie is being hyped to a substantial degree, there is always a risk that this is not exactly due to its merit, but rather part of an aggressive marketing campaign. Rarely has such a phenomena been so obvious as prior to the release of 'Black Swan': the media have been up and running about Portman's real-life romance sparked during its filming, plus pondering the chances of 'Black Swan' establishing ballet as a fashion trend. Still, having been partnered with a dancer for a number of years, I couldn't resist the temptation - as a result of which I have to side with those reviewers here who regard it as an utterly pointless affair.<br/><br/>What bothered me slightly were the abundant factual errors in depicting a dance company, although that's where most of the action takes place. Even overlooking the myth of the all-powerful choreographer who can choose his lead at random and at any given time: to have the lead's antagonist being chosen as her substitute almost at the end of the film is a quite unnecessary blunder. Even the friend I was watching the film with asked me if such an important matter were not decided earlier on. Other incoherences were Winona Ryder's character - a lead isn't likely to be fired like that - and Vincent Cassel's character - a choreographer engaging in such rampant displays of sexual harassment wouldn't be likely to make creative director. Add the stereotypical career mom of Portman's stereotypically fretting artiste, plus the stereotypically venomous scheming antagonist, and voilà, there's your assembly of paper-thin characters in a papier-mâché world.<br/><br/>What bothered me more about 'Black Swan' was the excessive use of special effects to drive its already not-quite-so-hard-to-understand message home: feathers growing out of scratches, talking photos and the much-used eye-liner-enhanced demonic expression of the transformed 'Black Swan' made me wish to metaphorically grab Aronofsky by the collar and scream: Enough of this already! I-GOT-THE-PICTURE!!! Stop goofing off and go ahead with the story, g-dd-mm-t! The problem with this being that, had the plot been as straight forward as in Aronofsky's much better 'Wrestler', the runtime would have hardly exceeded 30 minutes.<br/><br/>However, what bothers me most about 'Black Swan' is its complete lack of respect for its subject matter. Hitherto all dance films have somehow attempted to grasp the particular mix of hard work and inspiration this art form demands and presents like no other. Yet although this issue is pretty much the crux of Black Swan's story, it fails to feature a full dance scene; instead, there are snippets of real and imaginary dance-inflicted wounds, and a steady-cam rotating around its star, thereby consciously ignoring the essence of ballet per se: its effect as an ensemble piece. Anybody who has ever seen 'Swan Lake' or any other ballet piece, for that matter, will probably concur that the interaction between dancers is at least as important as their individual talent. 'Black Swan' makes it almost seem as if a lead dancer is something like the star of a Las Vegas show. The only thing missing is Portman smattering a catchy tune out of her shiny black lips.<br/><br/>One may argue that accuracy is not what the film is about, that it is a psychological thriller. But why make use of the black swan/ white swan metaphor of the piece, and then detach the whole story from the piece and the art that inspires it? Even those who liked the film should ask themselves: does this movie really address ballet in any way but that very metaphor? And isn't the whole story revolving around such an obvious analogy completely pointless? Another sign of disrespect to me is the investment of 'Swan Lake', which as a mainstay of classical ballet can be said to be a part of an unquestionable cultural heritage, with a highly cliché and passé Freudian repressed-sexuality-slash-schizophrenia gimmick. Not only is such an approach rather pompous and shallow, but it is also inadvertently funny; the means by which the lead character attempts to relieve herself earned quite a few snickers in the audience I was in. Imagine a 90-minute-film about the sexual symbolism of 'Hansel & Gretel', and you'll get an idea what to intellectually expect, and a conclusion which - I have to concur with a number of other reviews - is painfully easy to figure out.<br/><br/>In short: the most over-hyped and annoying film I've seen in a long time. Definitely not for dance enthusiasts. If you're looking for a psychological thriller in the world of entertainment, try the anime 'Perfect Blue', which judging from Black Swan's style seems to be familiar to Aronofsky. And better dance films? Just pick any of them, from 'The Red Shoes' to 'Billy Elliot' - they all have more to say about the art of and devotion to dance than this one."

","My biggest gripe about this movie is the fact the Portman character has all the presence and self-confidence of a puddle. In real life, no production company would allow someone with so little confidence to assume the top role. Millions of dollars are at stake and investors would need to be confident that the lead could handle the more difficult"" Black Swan"" role, upfront. No one would allow weeks of crying and hallucinations, right up till opening night (and even late for that) to prove that they can actually do the job. Also, the big flub in the first act would have likely caused the second to take her place. Obviously, someone with the low self-esteem (demonstrated by the Portman character) could never hope to gain even a minor role with a ballet company, and certainly not the lead. The competition is just too stiff. Also, Portman does not have the correct body type and is a little short at only 5'3"". The boiled chicken and fresh-plucked look was also a big turn-off. In real life, someone so mechanical and fearful would never make it to the top ranks. A second-string ""Rockette"" has more stones than the Portman character."

","I really don't understand what so many reviewers saw in this movie. I don't want to overreact and say it is terrible, but there is nothing in it that inspires or makes one think. It is a well made film. The directing is good, the performance by Natalie Portman is very believable. However, the problem with the movie is that Nina - the main character is flat and uninteresting. Right from the beginning of the movie the viewer is lead to believe that Nina is good, but all I saw is a confused and obsessed individual. She does not love anyone, she has no friends, she does not care about anyone... The only bright spot is her dream to become a leading ballerina in a Swan Lake production, however the movie never really explains why this dream is important to her, and for this reason it is hard to see this dream as anything but another of Nina's obsessions. In short, I just didn't find anything in this movie worth watching. And while I can't say I regret watching it, I would not recommend it either."

","Darren Aronofsky proves once again that he is an absolute genius in the modern world of cinema and he can work in any genre and make it look beautiful, real, visceral, and always keeping with his specific visual style, proving himself to be an absolute auteur. Black Swan is Aronofsky's fifth feature film, and it shows how his directing ability is somehow getting better. The movie is about a ballet dancer, Nina (Natalie Portman), who is dealing with the pressures of playing The Swan Queen in her companies production of Swan Lake. The pressures brought about by this demanding role cause her to begin to slowly crack under pressure, especially when she has to worry about a rival dancer possibly taking her spot. My synopsis doesn't do the film any justice though, and the result of this story is a disturbing and breath taking thriller that combines beauty with visceral intensity, and keeps you on the edge of your seat and your eyes glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's directing style is incredibly sophisticated and mature in this film. It is grand and beautiful. The ballet scenes are all very delicate and soft, yet there's always an underlying tension. This tension eventually breaks through as the film at times switches to a much darker and more disturbing mood. We are lulled into a false sense of security in many aspects of the film, as it builds and builds to the shocking and chilling climax. The movie flows so beautifully and it delicately weaves in and out of its multitude of moods that keeps us watching and waiting, as the film only grows darker and darker. As the moods of the film change, the style does as well in a very minuscule range, but it is always fitting wherever the film moves. Black Swan is sensual, seductive, lustful, and intense, and Aronofsky's direction captures it all perfectly.<br/><br/>With a style as complex and masterful as Aronofsky's, it is hard for any aspect of the film to look bad, but this wasn't a problem because I felt that every aspect of this film was nearly flawless. One such aspect was the brilliant acting from the small yet very important cast that really helped a movie that needed no help at all. Natalie Portman as Nina was incredible. Her transformation through the movie is disturbing and very intense, and Portman handles it incredibly well. She plays a very flawed character, making the role even tougher. Nina is not the greatest ballet dancer in the world by any stretch of the imagination. She has all the technique and is in fact a master at it, yet it is her emotion that she has the problem with. Portman almost had to act her character poorly to capture the multiple layers correctly. The unfitting facial expressions and awkward movements are part of the character of Nina, and Portman somehow makes it all work to a great advantage that makes the film even more fascinating.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is incredible as well. Mila Kunis takes on a much more serious and more complex role than she is used to. Her character has very many layers, and doesn't fit into one specific archetype, mainly for reasons that would spoil the movie. Vincent Cassel is the sleazy and inappropriate director of this ballet production. He is the driving force behind much of the tragedy of the film, and he is a character you love to hate. Then perhaps one of the most disturbing characters is Barbara Hershey as Erica, Nina's mother. Erica lives vicariously through her daughter and is constantly pushing her to better while also sheltering her from the world and everything that is out there past ballet. She is the reason for Nina's rigid structure in her life that is a constant pressure to do better. The introduction of Erica's true motivation is one of the most stunning and tragic elements of the movie. We are shown only a facade of the mother at the beginning of the film, being tricked into believing that Nina and her mother live a happy and beautiful life together as a loving mother and daughter. But further down the road as the film grows darker we realize just how skewed and disturbed their relationship is. It is a great bit of character development that has a very important role in the films overall progression.<br/><br/>If I could use one word to describe Black Swan it would be seductive. The movie is ripe with sexual tension, and it drags you in whether you want to be or not. It grabs ahold of your attention, as well as your emotions. The film is so beautiful, yet so tense and so powerful. It fascinates and hypnotizes, and you want nothing more than to know what is going to happen to these people in this disturbed story. It is a film that wraps itself around your brain, rendering you speechless for its entire length. There is just something so unique and so incredible about this film that it almost felt awkward stepping back into reality when it was all over. Black Swan is a masterpiece, and definitely one of the best of 2010."

","This is a film I've been meaning to watch for years, so naturally I built up some pretty high expectations over time. I went into 'Black Swan' expecting nothing but greatness I mean, how could I not? Almost everything about it sounds great: an intriguing female protagonist, a plot centred around the themes of pressure and sanity, set within an intimidating theatrical environment, and on top of that, starring Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel. There is so much potential in all of this for a masterful art house tour de force, but unfortunately only a small portion of that potential is actually utilised.<br/><br/>'Black Swan', although rich in clever symbolism and captivating performances, feels like a complete and utter mess in terms of tone and style. In regards to genre, this film is classified as a ""thriller/drama""... but it feels like a ""melodrama"" more than anything, and surprisingly, not due to the performances, but due to its obnoxiously bizarre editing choices. There are countless scenes throughout the film which would have worked so much better if they weren't presented in such an over-the-top manner; scenes that feature raw emotion and truly praise-worthy work from the incredibly talented Natalie Portman - which unfortunately can't be fully appreciated due to the distracting soundtrack being constantly used out of place, as well as abrupt cuts which only seem to be there in an attempt to make the given scene feel more ""energetic"". It really is frustrating, as all the ""energy"" that is required is fully provided by the actors themselves; the technical additions just feel forced and eventually become irritating. Almost all of the editing and tonal choices are constructed so poorly and even worse, they just felt so damn unnecessary.<br/><br/>The tone even shifts into the territory of ""horror"", and I don't mean cleverly constructed tension or even some of that Lynchian mastery, what I mean is terrible jump ""scares"" that fail to fulfil their basic purpose - I'm talking about the type of jump scares you'd expect in the lowest tier of juvenile ""horror"" films. Jump scares, despite sounding cheap, can be done well - David Lynch certainly proved this in his films but that's definitely not what we receive here, what we receive here is some obnoxious editing that feels like it was slapped together by an edgy teenager because of how corny it feels. This is just one of the few aspects that felt awkwardly out of place, it's as if one of the purposes of this film is to try and distract you from the truly wonderful performances provided by the entire cast, which is truly unfortunate, especially concerning Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel - these two in particular were perfectly cast and kept me glued to the screen throughout the entire run-time of the film, despite its annoying distractions. The acting and the script are the only aspects that made me give this film an ""above average"" rating, they are also the only aspects which made this film worth watching, just about everything else brings it down and ultimately makes it a frustrating viewing experience.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Black Swan' just feels like wasted potential - it feels like a masterpiece trapped within a mediocre execution. Despite my harsh words, it is a film I would recommend watching at least once for the performances alone; Natalie Portman gives one of the best performances of her career and truly captivates from start to finish. There's even some clever symbolism based on the themes implemented throughout, but just like with the acting, it's difficult to appreciate with all the distracting nonsense thrown on top of it. I'm giving 'Black Swan' a mild 6,4/10 - there is definitely a great film within, so it really is quite a shame that it had to be executed this way."

","Perfection is a state of completeness and flawlessness. How many of you have known a perfectionist or you yourself feel the need to be perfect at all times? To the point where it almost drives you or the person insane? But to be honest, I think we've all had those moments of wanting to be perfect. Praised as one of the best films of the year, Darren Aronofsky takes us into the psyche of another character, I would say that this is my favorite film by him. At a young age he has come so far in creating some of cinema's most fascinating characters and stories, he's given us such amazing films. His vision brings out one of the year's best films and one of my new favorites, he and Natalie Portman were meant to work together. I absolutely adore Natalie Portman, but I have been waiting for her to have a role as challenging as Black Swan, her intelligence, grace, beauty and talent shine and I hope she is not only nominated but wins the Oscar for this film. The supporting cast is incredible as well, Mila Kunis, I am just falling in love with her. Proving more and more that she's not just a pretty face but can take on a role that can be dangerous and makes it her own and makes it relatable to the audience. Vincent Cassel is becoming one of my favorite actors, he's so strong and passionate and clearly gave so much into this role as the seductive dance teacher who in a sense is his dancer's prince from Swan Lake.<br/><br/>A New York City ballet company is preparing for the production of Swan Lake, which tells the story of an innocent, fragile White Swan who falls in love with a Prince. The ballet company has chosen to cast a newcomer to the dual role of both the White and Black Swan, casting out their top ballerina Beth MacIntyre. Dancer Nina Sayers, extremely dedicated to achieving technical perfection, competes for the part alongside several other young dancers, including Lily. Nina lives with her overbearing and controlling mother, Erica, who was herself a former dancer and is determined to keep Nina's career from getting derailed, as hers did when she got pregnant with Nina. The director, Thomas, is casts Nina. But he claims that she is the perfect White Swan, fragile and innocent, but he simply doesn't believe she has the ability to transform herself into the darkly sensual Black Swan. Nina begins suffering bizarre, and often grisly, hallucinations often involving injuries to herself. However, as soon as the injury appears it will disappear, leaving Nina disoriented and frightened. Nina also begins to feel Lily, a fellow dancer who was cast in a minor role in the production, is determined to take the role from her. Lily is wild, sensual and unruly - ideal casting for the Black Swan. Leroy is becoming increasingly frustrated with Nina, desiring passion and guile from her, and receiving only control and innocence. Tensions are also heating with Nina's mother, who believes the role is too much for Nina. What Nina doesn't realize is that the only thing that is holding her back form being perfect is herself and her lack of making one mistake.<br/><br/>Though I found the film predictable at times, I loved the study of Nina's character. Is she crazy and how she became that way is just so tragic. The way her mother behaves around her, almost an incestuous relationship is just horrific, not giving her daughter a chance to grow up and become a woman. Nina is trying so hard to be perfect that she forgets that it's OK to let loose and make a mistake. Her dance is so beyond beautiful, Natalie is one heck of a dancer and you can only imagine some of the pain she endured for this movie. Her dancing tells a story as well, her body language, you can tell she thinks too hard about things. Lily is exactly what Nina always wanted to be but couldn't because of her mother. Lily and Nina's love scene is so beyond intense, you just find yourself loosing your mind with Nina.<br/><br/>Black Swan is not only one of the best movies of the year, but one of my favorite films. I can't stop thinking about it and cannot wait until I get the DVD so I can watch it more and study it. It's a darker version of the play Swan Lake and is just so hauntingly beautiful. I'm sure there are flaws, I can think of a couple, however, the film did satisfy me greatly and I can't wait to see it again. Darren has once again given the world another film that is just incredible and will be discussed for years.<br/><br/>10/10"

","The worst thing about the very bad 'Swan' is that, somehow, people think it's a brilliant film. The best thing is that it makes you wish somebody would really center a great film in the fascinating world of ballet. This...ain't it. I read this script was developed over ten years. Really? Ten years in which to create a cartoon, horny, bombastic company director, spouting clichés about 'passion' and 'letting go'? Ten years, and no one notices that Nina has no character at all? Ten years, and it seemed plausible that a blatantly frightened, whiny dancer should get the lead in 'Swan Lake'? Quite honestly, I kept waiting for this film to actually begin; only when the absurd death-drive ending was tacked on did I realize it was over. Utterly bad, all the way, and mostly because we get no sense of Portman's identity WHATSOEVER. More exactly, there is no foundation upon which to build either the dark side's emergence from her, OR her horror of it. Other reviews here rightly point out the idiocies, as in a star ballerina being 'fired' and in drunken shock over it, or an alternate lead selected so late in the game, or a director engaging in conduct that would get any artistic director out on his ass in a heartbeat, no matter the artsy milieu. All of that would have been bearable, had there been any notion even hinted at of what and who Nina is. Nothing. So weird stuff happens to this non-character, there's a ridiculously gratuitous lesbian fantasy, you early on don't freak over the blood because, after five minutes, you know it's in her head, and then she achieves perfection in death. And you don't care at all. PS How bad? I kept longing to see Barbra Streisand take the stage in a tutu, saying, 'You vanna kill a swvan? Dese lovelies?'"

Not much really, because under normal circumstances there is nothing going on in this type of environment, unless one is interested in underweight, monomaniac girls with inflated egos whose main objective in life consists of perfecting the vacuosity of dancing... <br/><br/>On top of that, TBS is a film whose characters (without exception) are despicable.

Nina's friend (if we may call her that...)is a dancer who smokes(a clear sign of the presence of the tobacco lobby in action) and do drugs, the choreographer, of course, is a sex addict that preys on the vulnerability of his young dancers, and the rest of the them, which are the other dancers, seem to be poised to stab each and everyone in the back so that they can get the most coveted part in the production. They are all very inspiring, I guess.<br/><br/>The end of TBS, of course, is very cliché (as is the whole film...) because, as expected, what matters in the end is the performance, the perfection of execution and all that stupid bla-bla-bla about winning and succeeding at any cost.<br/><br/>To spike the interest in and keep the attention of the male audience watching this ""masterpiece"" , the producers resorted to an old trick and introduced two gratuitous sex scenes (one of them depicting lesbian sex) in the film. <br/><br/>So, in the end we have a film with unpleasant characters, a weak script, and a story which could have been told in 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Well, it seems ""Black Swan"" is the perfect Oscar contender..."

","I had a lot of fun watching the gorgeous Natalie Portman go through her pirouettes. A film that runs the gamut from ""The Red Shoes"" to ""Repulsion"" without reaching the heights of those masterpieces it manages to be an original opus from one of the most interesting directors of late. Darren Aronofsky's confidence is overwhelming. I regret I'll be dead and buried by the time Natalie Portman is 50 but I would give anything to see what this wonderful actress will be by that age. Here, she goes through the motions without avoiding any of the enormous difficulties her character requires. Vincent Cassel plays the French choreographer with a touch of Dhiagelev and oodles of sex appeal. Winona Ryder gives the film its campy touches, which makes the whole enterprise much more accessible than it seems at first.

","I'm just back from watching a preview of Black Swan. Natalie Portman and Milla Kunis as ballerinas in an unnamed American ballet company, Vincent Cassel (well-known and rather good French actor) as the director of a new production of Swan Lake, Barbara Hershey as Natalie Portman's mother. Film directed by Darren Aronofsky (responsible for The Wrestler).<br/><br/>Verdict: Complete load of garbage (that's the polite word for it).<br/><br/>There's the germ of a good idea in there. Ballerina driven to succeed by domineering mother; duality of Black Swan/White Swan personality; jealousy and back-biting within the ballet company. Unfortunately, whatever might have been made of it was thrown out the window by the writers and Mr Aronofsky, and the result is a ludicrous succession of increasingly less believable and more ridiculous set pieces, propelled by cliché-ridden psychobabble dialogue and grotesque CGI horror effects (blood, tearing skin, etc). Oh, and of course, a camera that is stationed perpetually looking over the shoulder of the principal character and can't stay still for a single damn second.<br/><br/>There's one user review on IMDb that says that the result is a feast of so-bad-it's-almost- funny high camp, and that just about nails it. There were two points at which I (and most of the audience) laughed out loud at some piece of surpassing crassness. There's a lesbian scene that is so gross, crude and unerotic that I couldn't watch it. (Watch The Hunger (Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon) or Mulholland Drive (Naomi Watts and Laura Herring) to see well it can be done.)<br/><br/>The director tries everything he knows to make the film intense and compelling, but fails more completely with every new trick. At no point does the film engage any emotion other than amazement at how inept the whole thing is. The really sad thing is that it's been nominated for a swag of awards, and almost all the critics' reviews and user reviews on IMDb say that it's great, a masterpiece, tour de force, etc, etc. For those who think it's high art, here's the latest news: the emperor has no clothes.<br/><br/>I gave it a score of 1 out of 10 because that was the lowest available."

","This film would have you believe that it is a high-minded meditation on art, the ego, and mental illness. However, if you polish a turd, it's still a turd. Same goes for this movie. It might look nice and deal with some important topics and seem quite serious, but to me, this was high-minded schlock.<br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman) is a repressed, reserved ballet dancer. She wants the chance to perform in ""Swan Lake"" and the troupe director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel) tells her that he can't see her playing both the black and the white swan. She takes extraordinary measures to convince him to cast her. She can't seem to embody the darker side of the role, however, and ultimately her drive to convincingly tap into her darker side drives her over the edge. On the way she rivals Lily and it seems her mother (Barbara Hershey)'s intense drive for her to succeed comes from the fact that she sacrificed her own career when she gave birth to Nina. Nina and her mother clash as Nina comes out of her shell in trying to capture the nature of the Black Swan. Nina also has a love-hate relationship with her alternate Lily who may have it out for Nina.<br/><br/>There is an awful lot of C-grade melodrama in this and while there certainly is some rivalry and dysfunction in the arts, the depiction of the ballet world seems very stereotypical and grounded in the broadest stereotypes about the arts. Aronofsky seems to wallow in the notion of the cattiest rivalries, the shrillest stage mother, the most fragile of divas, and the douchiest of directors. I could see Nina's fate from a mile away and it really is a shame that this movie had to be so sensationalistic. Aronofsky made a fantastic film in ""Reqiuem for a Dream"" but here he indulges the lowest of beliefs about the art world. Depicting artists as mentally fragile and grasping is a low-end way of depicting this world and it's a shame because Aronofsky is a talented filmmaker.<br/><br/>I thought Mila Kunis was very good in this film. She very much fit the part created for her. She seemed very at east in it. I thought Portman's character was rather one note and while Portman was not bad (she's incapable of being bad) I didn't think this was one of her more noteworthy performances. I enjoyed the music but this was truly a very self-indulgent picture made by Aronofsky and for my money, extremely overrated."
"mikerlz","1","25","41","5 September 2012"," Black Swan is an embarrassment to Darren Aronofsky's career.
","I am so disappointed in Darren Aronofsky for making this trash. I am a HUGE fan of the rest of his work. I have not had a chance to see The Wrestler yet, but I absolutely loved Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Fountain. I consider him the best director out there in modern filmmaking, but I have no idea how he could come up with such a worthless piece of garbage as Black Swan.<br/><br/>This movie tries to portray itself as profound, shocking, and original. Well it's definitely shocking. Shockingly bad! I'm not sure where to begin with this one. I guess my main gripe would have to be the way that Portman's character begins her downward spiral from situations that really are just not that huge of a deal. There is simply nothing that happens to her that even remotely could justify such a steep fall from grace.<br/><br/>This movie is also mind-numbingly boring. Not much ever really happens here at all, but Aronofsky still managed to drag it out to nearly 2 hours. The whole plot line could have been fully explored in literally 30 or 40 minutes. I hate to say it, but it seems to me that he is simply starting to run out of ideas. That said, every great director has both good and bad movies and I guess it was his time to make his first flop. Hopefully he's back to his usual talented self with his next project.<br/><br/>My next complaint would be that Portman's acting is painfully flat. If her performance was more convincing, the movie MIGHT have been a decent watch regardless of the other huge flaws. She has one expression on her face through the entire movie! The delivery of her lines is so quiet, and devoid of any conviction whatsoever. She isn't remotely believable as Nina Sayers.<br/><br/>The supporting cast (specifically Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, and Barbara Hershey) utterly and completely blew Natalie Portman away. Portman in the lead might be the worst casting choice that I have EVER seen.<br/><br/>Next, we've got the utterly pointless and unnecessary ""sex"" scenes. I love a good, well-done sex scene when called for in a film but the ones in Black Swan were the exact opposite of that description. They were bad, poorly done, and totally uncalled for. The out-of-place gory scenes were also ridiculously over-the-top and out of place here. I guess they are here to help keep a viewer's attention? There certainly isn't anything else interesting in this film.<br/><br/>Last, but certainly not least, we have the unapologetically blatant rip off of the good/evil schizophrenic duality in Nina from Fight Club. Kunis is Portman's hallucination of her own evil side, EXACTLY as Pitt's character was to Norton's. (and Cassel is basically the Marla Singer role) The difference is that Fight Club (which I didn't even really care much for) handled this aspect of the plot infinitely better than Black Swan did.<br/><br/>Basically, Black Swan is a pompous, trashy, derivative, and ultimately boring piece of cinematic fluff that takes itself far too seriously. You couldn't pay me to watch it again. Darren Aronofsky, what the hell happened?! How could you go from making such an utterly brilliant, innovative, deep and beautiful work of art as The Fountain to this pile of dung in Black Swan??<br/><br/>Please Darren, take a year or two off. Go on vacation somewhere for a while, then get back to your usual brilliant self. I'm amazed that you made such a terrible flick. I think I am going to go out later tonight to rent The Wrestler and hope it's better than this, simply because I would hate for Black Swan to leave such a bad taste in my mouth as the most recent Aronofsky movie I've watched. He is SO much better than this. I can't emphasize enough just how amazed I am that he would release Black Swan."

This film purports to be a descent into madness, but Nina (Natalie Portman in fine form) is clearly nuts right from the beginning, inherited from a mother (Barbara Hershey) who makes you think of the shower in the Bates Motel.<br/><br/>So the madness elevator has clearly hit the sub-basement sometime before the opening credits. And this is where the disbelief sets in: someone so clearly a pork pie short of a picnic simply would not get to play the prima donna role. Others have pointed out that any main role in Swan Lake will be danced by two or three dancers rather than one headlined figure, so the premise of competition driving Natalie nuts goes out of the window as well.<br/><br/>And the movie is, frankly, vulgar: everything is telegraphed in an obvious and clumsy way. No intellectual input is required from the audience - everything is spoonfed one morsel at a time. For example, Mia Kunis (who is the best thing in this) has black wings tattooed on her back - subtle? Maybe not. And when Nina finally gets in touch with her dark side, her eyes go yellow (like Michael Jackson in 'Thriller' - which featured more expressive dancing).<br/><br/>The sex scenes are unnecessary - they add nothing to the film because, although having an orgasm is supposed to give Nina a brilliance that has thus far eluded her in dancing the seductive Black Swan role, we do not see any difference.<br/><br/>There are horror elements which aren't scary because you know they aren't real (did I mention Nina is nuts from day one?), and visceral moments in the film that are just stomach-churningly unpleasant to anyone not raised on torture-porn.<br/><br/>The climax is so unlikely as to be laughable.<br/><br/>Overall a sad waste of talent."

Portman has only one facial expression which was magnified by the endless, tiring, and meaningless close-ups. 10 minutes into the film one is already sick of her shifty eyes and short breaths. <br/><br/>Then there's the very shallow plot and lousy dialogue. There's no character development. The few talking parts are inconsistent and one-dimensional. Most people are mere blurry passing shadows. The crucial night out was totally incoherent.

Ballet is brutally and shamefully dismissed. It's reduced down to no more than the wooden doll spinning on the toes. Such annihilation is a blasphemy. Why does the filmmaker pick a topic he has absolutely no interest in? Instead of the power of ballet itself the film opts for the CGI effect which adds neither visual pleasure nor emotional value. wtf?<br/><br/>Someone needs to wake up to the fact that female masturbation and lesbian sex don't make a film avant-garde.

"LadyLiberty","6","18","29","30 January 2011"," Black Swan Bleak on More Than One level
","Black Swan has garnered more than a few glowing reviews and has collected a list of awards nominations to match (among others, the Golden Globes will consider Natalie Portman as Best Actress, Mila Kunis as Best Supporting Actress, Darren Aronofsky as Best Director, and the film itself as Best Drama). I made it my mission in life to see it before the awards ceremonies started. It could be that my expectations were too high, but I was frankly not as impressed by Black Swan as many critics seem to be.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a reference to the white Swan Queen's opposite in the famous ballet, Swan Lake. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a technically brilliant dancer in a New York ballet company who desperately wants to snag the dual role. The problem? The dance company's director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) tells her she's the perfect Swan Queen, but that she lacks the passion and emotional abandon of her Black Swan twin.<br/><br/>The pressure on Nina to prove the director wrong is considerable. Her mother (Barbara Hershey)—a retired ballerina herself—exerts considerable control over her daughter in the guise of kindness and support. The company's aging prima ballerina (Winona Ryder) is volatile and dramatic, particularly when she learns she's soon to be giving her final performance before a retirement that isn't her idea. And a new dancer from San Francisco (Lily, played by Mila Kunis), quickly becomes both Nina's friend and bitter rival.<br/><br/>Lily, very much a free spirit, spreads her attitude wherever she goes and Nina needs it more than most. Thomas, meanwhile, is inclined to use any means necessary to inspire the performance he wants out of her. As Nina's life spins beyond her ability to control, her emotions and her sanity both begin to wear thin. But her focus on dance becomes ever more laser-like as she determines that nothing will stop her from being the perfect ballerina.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman reportedly lost some 20 pounds from her already tiny frame to more authentically portray a dedicated dancer. She and Kunis alike spent months studying ballet as well. Their efforts show. While a few more complicated maneuvers were performed by doubles, much of what you see on screen is really done by the actors themselves. Their acting, too, is superlative. Vincent Cassel is also good, but Barbara Hershey is brilliant as the overbearing mother whose demands for perfection set Nina on her course from childhood. Kudos, too, to Winona Ryder. Her role is small, but it's memorable.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky, perhaps best known for his previous award-winning film The Wrestler, does a credible job here. There are interesting edits and camera effects everywhere, and he does seem to know well how to elicit a stellar performance from his cast. I'm not a ballet fan, so I can't vouch for the authenticity of the dancing here, but it certainly looked lovely on screen and was a nice counterpoint to some of the seamier visions interspersed.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE Despite the obvious quality of the crafting of Black Swan, I didn't really like it all that much. That may be because there were so many moments where the sheer brilliance of the acting or some technical aspect in the making of the scene actually overshadowed the story itself. I found myself all too conscious of those things rather than paying attention to what was really going on. In many ways, Black Swan was the proverbial ""too much of a good thing."" I can't fault those who claim Black Swan is a well-made movie. I just can't pretend that I personally enjoyed it very much. The quality of filmmaking alone gave Black Swan its six stars. Whether or not my interest held up throughout garnered considerably less.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES None.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY Black Swan is rated R for ""strong sexual content, disturbing violent images, language and some drug use."" All of those cautions are entirely too real. Black Swan is not a movie for children, or even for young teens. An R rating is entirely appropriate, and movie-goers should take note. I'd add that, while I wasn't particularly happy with my movie-going experience, I can't deny that there are reasons to see Black Swan, not least among them some very strong performances indeed."

","Seeing that there's been so much hype around this movie, and it's got such a high rating on IMDb (currently 8.1), I finally decided to check it out.<br/><br/>Well, I honestly fail to understand what all the fuss is about. Nothing remotely impressive about this movie. It's not an awful film, but there's absolutely nothing praiseworthy, either. It's what I call ""background entertainment"" (the kind of movie that plays unnoticed in the background while you're doing something else).<br/><br/>Some scenes were downright disgusting. Not sure what the point of all the sadism in the movie is; it adds nothing to it. I'm not seeing any of this ""sophistication"" people speak of. It reeks of banality and is full of clichés. Quite predictable, too.<br/><br/>The idea behind it is fascinating, but the delivery ruins it all. The movie is BORING! The only feeling I experienced watching this, was indifference.<br/><br/>The characters were not only under-developed, but also rather unlikeable to boot -- all of them. Natalie Portman is generally a half-decent actress, but she wasn't very convincing this time.<br/><br/>I'm giving it 1 star only to counter the ridiculously high rating it currently has, which it really doesn't deserve. Otherwise I'd give it 5 or 6 stars (out of 10); don't think it's worth any more.<br/><br/>EXTREMELY overrated, but not at all impressive."

","the black swan is a weak uninspiring story It is very modern American in attitude and interaction, and misses the whole point of dance and performance.i found the lesbian inuendo and sex scenes overdone unessasary and seemed as though they were put there to try to liven up a very dull plot.i didn't find the film scary, i didn't feel anything as there was no anticipation or build up to a credible end. there was not nearly enough good dancing.i was irritated by the almost constant panting by natalie portman throughout the film. The only part of the film i liked watching was the main black swan sequence when the dancing was good and the cgi was imaginative and well done.This film could have been so much better with a decent story, more cohesion and a little higher thought. I was bored and turned off the whole thing was disappointing, unauthentic unbelievable and like the dancing, did not flow."

","I don't understand all the fuss about this movie.With danger of not being 'smart' or 'artistic' enough I have to say that I didn't like it.I've watched it tonight and I was bored mostly trough entire thing.It felt like it was a movie about psychotic girl whose obsessed mother isn't giving her enough intimate space to masturbate.Because all she apparently needs,for a perfect performance,is to touch herself or take ecstasy.I wanted to shout to the Director 'Why the hell don't you get another dancer for the Black Swan!'and 'Stop molesting that girl!'.Oh yeah,but then we won't have a movie.Like one review said it is a movie about a girl,who is from a start a nerve rack and the play is just an excuse to unleash her insanity.About a dancer,who is played by Mila Kunis I haven't got much to say because director until the end doesn't explain her character.Is she simple a friendly girl,evil backstabbing bitch or just a trigger for hallucinations.All I have to say about her is that she wears a really nice underwear and stockings.Also the constant pointing out between black and white really bothers my intelligence.I get it,without the constant white and black clothes and the tattoo of the black wings.I gave it a four only because of the costumes,make up,music and because I hope that this movie hasn't given me a trauma about swans and ballet :)"
"MovieProductions","10","86","172","3 December 2010"," ""I was perfect""
","**** out of (****)<br/><br/>For every moronic, trashy, and unoriginal Hollywood-esquire production (i.e. The A team), there exists a rather more clean, inventive, and memorable side (i.e. The Social Network). This year, I told my viewers that ""The Social Network"" dethroned every film this year and that it would be impossible for a movie to set the bar higher. With pitch-perfect performances and an Oscar-worthy script, no film could possibly top that one? Right? I am glad to say that 2010 has another winner on its hand and that winner is ""Black Swan"". Never has a film been more emotionally driven this year than that one. ""Black Swan"" will literally evoke every emotion. ""Black Swan"" is the reason why I go to see movies. It gets your adrenaline pumping and it's easily comparable to our everyday life. The messages in ""Black Swan"" go much more in-depth than one would expect and touches our souls while disturbing them. If that's not a complement, then I don't know what is. Unless there's another movie that will sweep ""Black Swan"" off its feet (pun intended), ""Black Swan"" is the best movie of this year and I have no problem believing it will be nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>Black Swan revolves around Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) who's a professional ballerina that has worked for Thomas (Vincent Cassel) for a mere four years and she gets the part of the Swan Queen. The Swan Queen is required to play both the White and Black Swan. This is no child-like, run-of-the-mill ballerina production. It's a psychological study. The White Swan is the innocent woman with a child-like innocence that has kept her gold, while the Black Swan is the looser, more sexually charged woman. Both Swans kind of mesh together. Nina is exceptional as the White Swan but she seems to struggle with her Black Swan. Things take a turn for the worst when the pressure gets to her including her uptight mother (Barbara Hershey), her instructor (Vincent Cassel), the retired ""princess"" (Winona Ryder), and her alternate (Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>What makes this film so extraordinary? While it excels in every aspect, its biggest strength is within its symbolism. Darren Aronofsky has a specific direction and it clearly shows (in a great way). The mesh of the swans is such a brilliant concept. Don't we both have an innocent and guilty side to us? Good and bad? In the end, we're both. For now, this seems like a cheesy lesson but when projected on screen, the execution is lovely. To top it off, every performance here is Oscar-worthy. Natalie Portman's performance, by far, is the best I have seen this year. Yes, Jessie Eisenberg and Christopher Nolan were exceptional this year, but Natalie Portman just blows those two out of the water. She can act through just about anything. I know sometimes her acting can be very amateur (ala ""Brothers""), but in this movie, she shines. Also, the script is just genius. The dialogue is great, the score is intoxicating, and when hell breaks loose, hell breaks loose. <br/><br/>How's the pacing? Nothing short of perfection. ""Black Swan"", while it looks like a trip to hell, most of its running time is used for character study, which in the end, is more effective. The first fifty minutes or so are just really odd, but in such a great way. There, we see some implied sexual tension between the instructor and Nina, Nina practices masturbation, and we learn about her uptight and controlling mother. After those fifty minutes, when the crap hits the fan, it hits hard. Hear we have stabbings, cuttings, bruises, bones braking, a two-minute lesbo make-out session, and fingernail clippings. I won't go into further detail.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Black Swan"" is easily, hands down, the best move I've seen this year. I understand this movie is only playing in a mere three theaters for each state, but if you find a theater at least an hour distance from your surrounding, please go see this movie. The chances of you finding a good film this year is a one-in-a-million shot. For every ""Inception"", there's a ""Clash of the Titans"". You owe it to yourself to see such an inventive movie. Perfect cinematography. Perfect performances. Perfect direction. Perfect script. Darren Aronofsky is simply a perfectionist. ""I was perfect"". No Black Swan. You weren't perfect. You ARE perfect."

","Black Swan is a complicated movie that has numerous issues that I believe can by psychologically damaging to many persons. I am a ""shrink"" who has worked with patients for over 20 years and have found that persons who are emotionally fragile can be re-traumatized from movie scenes like many in Black Swan. The graphic scenes of emotional and sexual abuse, eating disorders, delusions, attempted murder and self-mutilation are so disturbing I need to label them psychotic. Persons who have a tendency to disassociate and/or have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder should NOT see this movie. I know this movie is headed to the Oscars and has critical merit, however it has so many negative aspects to it, I URGE you NOT to see it. I fear many will have severe nightmares and a great deal of trauma, or much worse, if they see it. Please talk to your therapist before seeing Black Swan."
"Cujo108","Null","22","39","22 December 2010"," Black swan song
","Darren Aronofsky is a filmmaker who, over the course of five films, has thoroughly explored the various ways in which people can be consumed when their passions become self-destructive obsessions. It seems to be a bit of an obsession in and of itself for Aronofsky, and frankly, I've been with him every step of the way. The best cinema is the kind that makes you feel something, which Aronofsky's work does in spades. Taking up residence in the darkest recesses of the human psyche is no picnic.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers has toiled for years and years in Thomas Leroy's New York ballet company. Having fallen on hard times, Leroy exiles his lead dancer and hopes that a fresh face in the company's upcoming version of ""Swan Lake"" will renew interest and revenue. Nina believes that she has what it takes to tackle the role of Swan Queen, and while Thomas chooses her for the part, he is adamant about her being able to nail both the pure innocence of the White Swan and the dark, sultry essence of the Black Swan. He doesn't feel that she is yet capable of pulling off the latter, but he suspects that she has the ability bottled up inside. Nina, ever the perfectionist, just needs to let herself go and perhaps explore her sexuality. Unfortunately, she's had to deal with an overbearing mother who has sheltered her to the point of psychological damage. Experiencing what she needs to in order to embody the Black Swan, combined with the pressure of the role and the paranoia over new girl, Lily, possibly being after her spot, may just push Nina over the edge.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" has been cited as a companion piece to ""The Wrestler"", and in many ways, it is. They even share similar instances of a pseudo-documentary shooting style. However, whereas the latter utilized such a style to create a heightened sense of realism, ""Black Swan"" takes the approach and creates a claustrophobic hell akin to something like Polanski's ""The Tenant"". It's a disorienting portrait of the madness that infects many who possess the desire to create art. Nina's sanity is in question early on, and from there, we are kept on our toes in relation to what is hallucinated and what is real. Speaking of being kept on one's toes, we get an up close look at how hard ballet is on the human body. As if the psychological turmoil wasn't enough for poor Nina, the physical toll is just as prominent.<br/><br/>As the ballerina seeking the pinnacle of perfection, Natalie Portman achieves that which her character so desperately desires. Her performance is a milestone, not only in her career, but in acting, period. Every ounce of praise directed toward her is richly deserved. Nina goes through a ringer of emotional changes, be it the sweet, delicate girl she starts out as, the rebellious grown-up Lily unleashes in her or the manic frenzy she's reduced to when things really get out of hand. Portman never misses a beat. When I first heard that Mila Kunis had been cast as Lily, I wasn't exactly thrilled. I'm happy to say that I was wrong about her, as she is terrific here. She made me forget all about her role on ""That 70's Show"". Vincent Cassel is also fantastic as Thomas Leroy, and his relationship with Nina is one of the film's strongest aspects. He had serious doubts about her, but he believed in her all the same. Enough so that he put his doubts aside and took the biggest possible risk on her. Barbara Hershey is unnerving as Nina's overprotective mother, and Winona Ryder makes the most of her brief role as Beth, the aging star whom Nina replaces.<br/><br/>Matthew Libatique's cinematography is beautifully realized. Combining the raw grittiness of the pseudo-documentary material with the nightmarish imagery of Nina's hallucinations and the elegance of the ballet, the film is a joy to behold. Clint Mansell's music, complete with elements from ""Swan Lake"", is also amazing, just as much a character as any breathing person on screen. I was disappointed that Mansell didn't have more of a presence in ""The Wrestler"", so I was happy to have him back in full force with ""Black Swan"".<br/><br/>Aronofsky is my favorite director to come along in the last 20 years or so. ""Pi"" was a solid debut, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is an utter masterpiece (still my favorite film in general), ""The Fountain"" is an underrated gem and ""The Wrestler"" is a strong character study. I'm pleased, but not surprised, to say that ""Black Swan"" is another film that further solidifies his position as a master filmmaker. As for Portman, she doesn't need the ""Best Actress"" Oscar to solidify how great she is. Besides, after Sandra Bullock ""won"" last year, they'll obviously give that award to anybody."
"MartinHafer","9","14","23","12 March 2011"," I can't believe the work that Natalie Portman put into this film and it's easy to see why she received the Oscar.
","By now, Natalie Portman has already won the Oscar for Best Actress for this film. And, because my oldest daughter adored this film and strongly recommended I see it (WITHOUT her due to the content of the film!), I decide to see it and am glad that I did. Natalie Portman's commitment to this film is incredible. Seeing the weight that she lost, the ballet moves she worked on and the wonderful acting, it's very obvious why she got the award.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, I have got a STRONG warning! Before you consider watching the film think twice. The film is at times VERY adult--very adult. Even though there is no nudity per se, there sure is a lot of very graphic content and simulated sex--such that I could understand my daughter not wanting to see this movie with her dad!! Because there are so many other reviews at this point, I'll wrap it up quickly by saying that the film has a wonderful script for two main reasons. First, it's highly original--and I love originality. Second, from a psychological point of view, there are many possible interpretations and it's a great portrait of madness. At the very least, the leading lady is suffering from a SEVERE anxiety disorder as well as schizophrenia--a very, very bad combination to say the least! But I also love how, because the film is often shown from her point of view, you never are sure what is real and what is not--even when the film concludes. You are left wondering exactly what happened and what didn't--and that ambiguity might annoy some, but I appreciated this--mostly because most films explain EVERYTHING and assume the audience is too dumb to try to sort it out for themselves. An intelligently written, directed and brilliantly acted film. Exceptional."
"Eumenides_0","5","14","23","10 February 2011"," Derivative, Clichéd Psychodrama about Tortured Artist
","Repulsion. Suspiria. Shine. The Piano Teacher. These were four movies Black Swan made me think of without effort. Others have brought up Persona and Mulholland Drive. They work too. It doesn't really matter which movies people bring up in connection with Darren Aronofsky's movie, the bottom line is: they're all likely to be superior than this derivative mess. Imagine if Brion Gysin instead of cutting up newspapers to compose poems, cut up famous films to make a new one. We'd call it Brion Gysin's Black Swan.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Nina, a repressed ballet dancer with low self esteem who's dominated by her mother (Barbara Hershey), a former dancer who gave up her career to have Nina and who experiences glory through her daughter's success. And success arrives when Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), Nina's company director, offers her the roles of the White Swan/Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. But Nina, the meek, virginal damsel, will have to get in touch with her dark side in order to play the role of the sensual, dangerous Black Swan. Will she manage it or will the pressure drive her crazy? This is a rhetorical question, by the way. There's really no suspense here: Nina is a basket case from the start. As soon as the movie starts she's already lost in hallucinations.<br/><br/>There's also no explanation why Thomas, who's never seen Nina display a dark side, thinks she can play the dual role. It must be faith. Of course to help her he sort of sexually harasses her, taunts her in front of others and even suggests she masturbate to 'live a little.' Cassel, a provocative devil to the angelic Portman, is a delight to watch and delivers arguably the only good performance in the movie – sexy, bullying and arrogant; he'll destroy Nina's self if that will get a great performance out of her.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast isn't up to much: Hershey and Winona Ryder, who plays an aging dancer forced into retirement so Nina can have her role, deliver efficient performances considering the weak material they got. Portman, desperate to prove her thespian talents, oscillates between hysteria and mediocrity. Watching her I didn't have the impression I was watching a tour de force but a little girl pretending to be an excellent actress playing a poorly-written character who's supposed to be a complex and tormented ballet dancer.<br/><br/>The movie makes a big deal about how Nina's dancing style must change to suit the Black Swan. It's seductive, looser and more uncontrolled. We're supposed to think that when she finally plays the Black Swan it'll be a transcendental moment – somehow she will marvel us with the perfection of her performance, a perfection she achieves at a very hard price and with much sacrifice. But it's exactly the way Nina plays every time in the movie. The audience claps fiercely, Thomas congratulates her, but nothing has changed.<br/><br/>The cast, which isn't very remarkable, fails to salvage the script, which is awful. Is the movie at least technically good? I'm on the fence. The cinematography and editing are efficient. Aronofsky brings in interesting horror aesthetics too. I love all the tricks of the trade he employs to show Nina's madness: mirror reflections moving independently, her face projected on others, talking drawings. From David Lynch he lifts spooky sound effects that underscore tension and the fragmentation of reality.<br/><br/>When the movie focuses on Nina's madness it's quite good actually. Her sense of persecution is quite believable, especially when she suspects that Lily (Mila Kunis), is trying to steal the lead role from her. Kunis doesn't do much either, but it's fascinating that the perception of her as an antagonist is not supported by anything she does but only by what goes on in Nina's mind.<br/><br/>Sadly the movie also uses visual effects that cheesy B horror movies would only use at gunpoint. The scene of Nina turning into a black swan in the movie's climax looks distractingly fake in a way that a Cronenberg or Carpenter movie 30 years ago, with less money, wouldn't have.<br/><br/>Then there's the simplistic colour scheme – Nina wears white because she's good and innocent; Lily wears black and if that's not obvious enough she has black wings tattooed on her back. When Nina starts going dark, she starts wearing dark. Perhaps Aronofsky thought the hearing impaired in the audience couldn't get the colour/concept association right from the countless times the screenplay spelled it out loud, so here's some nice visual support.<br/><br/>Black Swan is as unbalanced as Nina's sanity – a poorly-written movie taking itself more seriously than its foundations on pop psychology, clichés about tormented geniuses and melodramas permit it. The result is over-the-top kitsch. Nothing stands out except Tchaikovsky's music, which, in comparison to the one by Clint Mansell, the fraud of frauds of film music, shows how low the standards in film music have fallen. A few composers could give Tchaikovsky a run for his money: Ennio Morricone, Georges Delerue, the recently deceased John Barry, but not Mansell. Here he seems satisfied with the tracks Angelo Badalamenti must have decided not to use in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. This is what the whole movie looks like: leftovers from other movies, half-good ideas, untapped potential. It aims at the magnificence of Swan Lake but it soars only to fall to its death like Icarus."

","There isn't a lot to be said about the story itself. Natalie Portman suffers a mental breakdown due to the pressure of her role in the ballet. That is about all there is to it really.<br/><br/>There is a one dimensional mother that has come straight from a cartoon (think Cruella de Ville watered down), a pretty best friend who portrays the 'dark side' and of course the boss who starts out as an interesting bad guy but quickly becomes as mundane as the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>Picture a 10 minute short cartoon made by an art student and then prolonged for 90 minutes and you just about have it. Everything about it was simplistic and predictable in the extreme.<br/><br/>Ms Portman did well to learn ballet for the role but would have better deserved an Oscar for 'closer'. The music score was pleasant and it was reasonably well filmed but otherwise I'd strongly recommend avoiding this movie."

","I give this film credit for showing what it's like backstage in Ballet or in any of the performing arts. For every hour of dazzling performance, there are hundreds of hours of work, sweat and tears. It takes a lot of effort to look effortless.<br/><br/>I will also congratulate the cinematographers - the camera work, especially the camera work showing balletic movement is terrific - you can almost feel what it's like to turn, jump and be lifted in space - bravo to them.<br/><br/>The story is the problem. A psychological thriller that's not particularly thrilling. You can predict the outcome about the third time you see the character Nina confront herself in the mirror - which is probably not ten minutes into the film.<br/><br/>Internal conflicts brought on by an overbearing mother, a demanding career, and facing the short lived career of a ballerina (few dancers dance professionally beyond their mid-30's), bring our heroine to a crisis that parallels her character as the Swan Queen.<br/><br/>We watch Nina spiraling out of control, but the story has all the surprise of high school physics experiment.<br/><br/>This ground has been covered many, many times (the 1978 movie ""Magic"", comes to mind). And it's been done better.<br/><br/>It's worth watching for the ballet fans out there - there aren't enough ballet movies. Otherwise, fly by the ""Black Swan"".<br/><br/>For an internal conflict, psychological thriller, I'd recommend ""Momento"", starring Guy Pierce."

They essentially knock you over the head with the fact that the main character, Nina, is losing her mind at every (predictable) twist and turn. Very gratuitous and clumsily done. It's extremely campy and, as for the ""scare factor"", I was left feeling nothing. And that's pretty much how I felt about this film as a whole - nothing.<br/><br/>For a much more subtle, well done portrayal of the theme of an ""inside view"" of mental illness, you need look no further than ""A Beautiful Mind.""

","Watching Black Swan was like having my head raped. At first I wondered why did so many people like this movie, but by the end I was convinced it must have been some sot of Stockholm Syndrome where they began to empathize with their cinematic captors. That and it seems that the movie going public will eat up just about anything, especially if they don't really get it because hey if it's confusing it must be brilliant right? There was nothing entertaining about Black Swan. The camera work was either sloppy hand held, or a closeup of Natalie Portman's face, which constituted the majority of the movie. The result is that it was work to watch and ended up giving me a headache. Since so much screen time was devoted to Natalie's face I feel that I should at least take a moment to discuss it. I like her face. Everyone likes her face. A portrait of Natalie Portman does not a movie make. While I agree she is a hottie, I really don't understand why she was cast in this role. I mean, it was probably a lot harder to teach her to dance poorly, than it would have been to teach one of the dancers in the movie to act. I mean get an actress that is also a dancer. Anyone could have carried that role. I think this whole movie was a ploy to get Mia and Natalie in bed together, which in theory is the sexiest thing in the universe, but even that was ruined by the poor camera work and overarching disturbed nature of Mr. Aronofsky's film. If ever i were to interview this man, my first order of business would be to hide behind something and then ask him about his mother, the man needs therapy and you all should stop encouraging him to abuse people. Movies like this make me not want to go to the theaters, or at least feel less bad about pirating, because hey, if the movie producing industry isn't going to respect me I am not going to respect them.

Her decision to confront or obey an ambiguous father figure, fight or flee a competitor all will play a key part but her ultimate fate will be decided by her choices about herself. Meanwhile, of course the show must go on.<br/><br/>From this springboard, you can either see a great horror film about isolation and despair or an entertaining Hollywood musical with a hint of the horror genre. It depends on whether you choose to see the original (1925) or most recent (2004) Phantom of the Opera.<br/><br/>Black Swan, with an identical baseline, will either give you a fit of the giggles or dry heaves. If you already saw it, I offer my condolences. If you liked it, do not read on because I am going to massacre it without one gram of mercy.<br/><br/>First, credit where credit is due: one artist worthy of the name contributed to this film. Pyotr Tchaikovsky composed some of the music. Despite the heavily-stacked odds, Ryder and Cassel come out with their acting credentials only slightly bruised.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky directs Black Swan with the empathy and subtlety of a traffic cop while using the camera as a machine gun. By the time he is done, and he takes his time, everyone is either wounded or dead.<br/><br/>One salient example: Mila Kunis, who plays the evil twin, has black wings tattooed on her back. Get it? Get it? As to Natalie Portman, she was given cue cards listing allowed facial expressions, numbered from one to five. Spoiler: expression number two (frowning, mouth open) is the one with the Academy Award.<br/><br/>Sex, or lack thereof, is central to the character's fate, both professionally and psychologically. Either she did it or not, will or will not, how and with whom, gay or straight will get her the role, make her complete, turn her to the Dark Side of the Force, or solve the paradoxes of quantum physics.<br/><br/>Aranofsky truly shines here. Portman masturbates in front of a roomful of pink stuffed bunnies (and her sleeping mummy); gets her crotch grabbed by her employer during an insightful lesson on the art of seduction; and dreams that Mila Kunis does sex to her.<br/><br/>I struggled a lot with the lesbian scene and finally settled for ""does sex to her"" as most fitting. Both actresses kiss as if they found each other's breath repulsive, underwear gets pulled, Kunis does sex to Portman. Enjoy.<br/><br/>For sensuality and passion, go to my original comparison and watch the seduction scene in The Phantom of the Opera (Joel Schumacher, 2004). There is practically no skin exposed, half of what there is urgently needs a dermatologist, but it is still infinitely more erotic. The difference, of course, is that Schumacher is a real director, Butler is competent, and Rossum a talented actress.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the central mystery of Black Swan: where does that Academy Award for best actress come from? Portman gives us the answer in her last line: ""I was perfect."" No you were not! In fact, you look more alive and engaging on the Miss Dior posters, despite the fact you do not move or speak. Or possibly because<br/><br/>Black Swan is sometimes promoted as a horror film. It is the only honest part of the hype: it is indeed horrible."

","Terrible movie. How did Natalie Portman (who is a good actress) win for this movie? She wore the same sad, forlorn expression through the entire film. And close ups of her face were all over the place. The story was boring. The overbearing mother who gave up her career for her daughter and then tries to run her life. Hmmmm, haven't we seen this, like, umpteen times? I agree with the other reviewer who said this character would never have been picked for this part as she lacked any confidence. And, if you're hoping to see some good dancing, forget it. There were very few moments of that on screen. Overall, this movie was dark, depressing and not worth the time."
"fullmetaljacket68","1","18","32","8 March 2011"," Cringe-worthy and intense... and little else
","This movie was hard to watch.<br/><br/>That, in and of itself, doesn't make it bad. However, the fact a movie makes you look away in disgust every few minutes doesn't make it interesting, and that's about all I found myself doing for two hours.<br/><br/>Even if you accept The Black Swan as a horror movie, which is about all I can understand it as, I thought the most cringe-worthy, intense moments were the (too frequent) close ups of bloody chunks of Natalie Portman's body falling off. This made the screen-filling shots of Portman finding new ways to simultaneously flex her neck muscles and tear glands lose power and relevance since the audience has already been numbed by all the gore... which renders beside-the-point her much hyped performance. (If all the movie does is make your stomach churn, and most of this is accomplished by the gross factor and not by method acting, what else are you left with?) To further the cheapening of the movie, the CGI goose bumps (swan bumps, to be more accurate) are pretty much totally unnecessary, though I guess they're almost (ALMOST) funny.<br/><br/>About the only good thing (which still wasn't particularly rewarding to watch) was the intense relationship between Nina (Portman) and her mother.<br/><br/>In short, everything about this movie is over the top. Perhaps this can be justified if you argue that the whole film is a sort of ""performance"" of Swan Lake, complete with costumes and exaggerated characters. This might explain unrealistic features like the presence of ""imprecise"" dancers with huge tattoos on their backs in important positions at a major metropolitan dance company. (I don't know anything about ballet, but ""imprecise"" and ""career"" seem like mutually exclusive concepts in a world I understand to be about as competitive as formula 1 auto racing... or becoming an astronaut.) But even if clichéd rebel dancers and virginal, pretty ones are ""characters"" in a ""performance,"" it doesn't make them interesting, and doesn't really justify their flatness.<br/><br/>All in all, this film succeeds in making viewers feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>However, I found myself feeling little more than that.<br/><br/>While I would actually have given the movie two or three stars out of 10, I gave it just one to compensate for all the gushing 10/10 reviews."
"elisnycander","1","17","30","13 March 2011"," I should have walked out of the theater
","This is undoubtedly the worst movie of all time. Every second in the theater was utter pain and agony. Its depiction of mental illness is void of all realism and highly offensive. It's nothing more than an extreme version of the psycho/schizophrenia cliché that has haunted movie-making for decades. <br/><br/>If it is well-made, well-acted, or whatever, I don't care, because the movie has nothing to tell or to motivate its existence. The only two remotely interesting characters, Ninas mother Erica and the director Thomas Leroy are obscured by the persistent mood of psychological terror radiating from every scene. How the movie will end is made clear before it has even begun, perhaps purposely by Aronofsky who wants to convey the inescapable fate of Nina who is suffering from schizophrenia or some other mental disease. Add some lesbian sex scenes, and you have a low-water mark that is hard to beat. Never again will I watch a movie by Darren Aronofsky."

","I went to see the Black Swan because I was drawn by the Oscar nominations and the favorable ratings at IMDb. I took my girlfriend and a couple of friends and our impressions were surprisingly coherent. Money bad spent and a loss of time.<br/><br/>I admit it: this movie is not boring. But it doesn't mean it's good. We spent about 5% of the movie laughing, 10% of the movie feeling disgusted and about 40% of the movie wondering whether to leave or not. The only advantage of us staying was the fact that now I can honestly write this review having seen the entire thing.<br/><br/>The movie tries to portray what people are capable of in order to achieve perfection. It revolves around the main character's obsessions, visions and serious psychological problems. But it's done in a way that suggests the creators of this movie weren't really sure about whether this was supposed to be a horror movie or not. Well, I guess it's easier to get the viewer's attention this way. It's much harder to write a good psychological drama than to tape up a bunch of visions, strong sexual scenes and bloody self-mutilations. But wait, it's got Tchaikovsky's music, so it's art, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>The music of course is excellent, but it's one of the film's rare artistic values. I was especially surprised to find out the Black Swan got an Oscar nomination for ""Best Achievement in Cinematography"". My surprise comes from the fact that most of the time the vision was just shaky and grainy. If this is art, then I guess I'm just not an artistic kind of type.<br/><br/>The few things I liked about this movie were the already mentioned music, Natalie Portman whom I like personally as an actress, and the interesting idea of her changing into an actual swan at the end. But still it's not worth it. The film is tiring for the sake of it, and if it is trying to convey a message, it is doing it in a cheap way.<br/><br/>Finishing words? Don't go. If you like gore, better rent a good horror movie. At least it's not pretending to be art. And it's not so disturbing."

Except, that is, for those people that will watch someone filming grass grow, with a gratuitous sex scene thrown in here and there, and then rush to IMDb to write a review telling the world how brilliant the film is! Isn't it amazing that the majority of people aren't interested in watching high end ballet, yet in this film, we are asked to watch someone ""pretend"" to be a ballerina for over an hour and more.<br/><br/>It's like getting Larry Parkes, in ""The Jolson Story"", singing himself instead of miming to Joslon, with most of the audience not liking Jolson's music anyway! That's what happens here.<br/><br/>The script is terrible, plodding along, slapping us in the face now and then with the bleeding obvious, and even endowing the protagonist with ESP - when she guesses that our Heroine had a ""wet dream"" about her. I laughed during the fight scene when I guessed I should have been upset, and ended up shaking my head a lot at the poor attempt at ""gritty"" camera work, which just made me motion sick.<br/><br/>The only reason I endured watching this film past ten minutes was because my daughter wanted to see it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have even rated it worth writing this review.<br/><br/>This movie belongs at the bottom of Swan Lake."

The tension is terse and kept at the same level from beginning to end and you just don't care about what happens to the characters. Everyone is a stereotype thinly sketched and seen countless times in a myriad of movies.

","Well, the rave reviews are primarily a symptom of the cultural illiteracy of film critics and the public today. I guess no one has seen Moira Shearer in ""The Red Shoes."" THERE's a movie with true depth and artistry, a true-to-life dramatic story for the ages, and real dancing to go with it, dancing that expresses the story, and camera-work that is to die for. Sorry, ""Black Swan"" is a titillating bit of over-the-top cheap thrills.<br/><br/>Nowadays, if we get bashed over the head with a white/black dichotomy, then people are so thrilled that they got it and think they saw something artsy. Please.<br/><br/>Nina is supposed to go through a transformation from uptight purity to free, dark, sexuality; however, we never see any transformation in Nina's dancing. Any change in her character was achieved through over-the-top special effects. Natalie Portmann makes certainly a respectable effort with the dancing, but if the director really had an eye, he would not have cast her. Would you have an amateur actor scratch out a violin concerto, or would you dub it in, instead? She really did not need to do much acting because of all the horror effects, so they may as well have cast a ballet dancer who could really dance the two parts. Then they could have shown some full ballet numbers where the contrast is fully expressed, and then there would have been true comprehension by the audience of what goes into achieving the ultimate as an artist . There was pretty much no choreography or real dancing in this film, to show audiences the glory and expressiveness of top-notch ballet. What a shame and lost opportunity.<br/><br/>Ballet struggles enough to survive in this age of zero cultural education in secondary schools. This was a chance to expose popular audiences to art that they rarely get to see. People came out of ""Amadeus"" having learned for the first time really to listen to classical music. They came out of ""Diva"" with the aria of ""Tosca"" burned into their brain. They come out of ""The Red Shoes"" having savored high art, which they can watch over and over again. They come out of ""Black Swan"" with little clue of how exquisite ballet can be. Well, hopefully, a few souls will have been intrigued enough to go check out a real ballet.<br/><br/>I rate it 4 for entertainment value as a horror flick, but that's all."

","Okay, to me this film was very average to be perfectly honest. It was so built up by the media and reviews that I was really disappointed when it didn't live up to the hype! It's really predictable to anyone that has an ounce of imagination or common sense. I watched this film with five guys and they couldn't even rouse themselves out of their boredom to enjoy the lesbian romp scene. Natalie's character speaks so little and holds the same facial expression for most of the movie that I find it hard to understand why there is such an Oscar buzz for her performance. I believe the writers probably intended her character to be likable and we are supposed to sympathize with her, but in fact she irritated and grated on me throughout the film so much that the tragic (and predictable) ending lead only to a feeling of relief."

","One thought occurred to me as this movie flailed and writhed out of control: the intellectual life of the United States is in deep, deep trouble. When this movie is the best that Hollywood has to offer anymore--and it IS head and shoulders above most movies coming out of Hollywood--then the world of (American) mainstream film is circling the drain in a very tight orbit, indeed.<br/><br/>This movie is the story of an anal-retentive dancer who has (under a lifetime of jealous pressure from her ex-dancer mother) become so obsessed with the idea of ""perfection"" that it has become intertwined with her quasi-lesbian sexuality. She displaces her resentment of her mother and her own flaws and repressed sexuality onto a lover/rival dancer and incorporates all of this psychological flotsam and jetsam into her upcoming role as the Black Swan in ""Swan Lake."" That all sounds very highbrow and interesting, I know, but I'm doing my very best to be diplomatic, here, and it really isn't.<br/><br/>The worst problem with this movie is the use of insultingly obvious special effects to explain to the dumb kids in the audience what is going on.<br/><br/>""Look! She's looking at HERSELF in another person!"" ""Look! Her legs are bending like a SWAN's! And she has WINGS!"" ""Look! Her rival is having sex with the Swan Prince!"" And so on.<br/><br/>I'm of two very different minds on this movie. On the one hand, it's well-made. The lighting and scene composition are really exquisite. The special effects are spectacular. Some of the acting is even passable, though Natalie Portman lurches around like a mental patient on Thorazine.<br/><br/>The problem is that the plot is dreadful. It's hypersexual, unrealistically nasty and full of embarrassing clichés. The ballet director--and I'm not making this up--is an oversexed Frenchman who calls ""his"" girls things like ""Little Princess."" It really reminded me of ""Showgirls"" a lot. Ooh! Right! I got it! If you want a summary of this movie, here it is: Imagine ""Showgirls."" Now imagine that ""Showgirls"" has completed 30 hours of master's work in cinema and just drank a pot of coffee and was in the mood to talk. Except, instead of strippers, imagine ballet dancers.

Director Aronofsky has assembled a group of talented actors, but saddled them with a script that's notable primarily for its slacker-mentality mediocrity. Since I'm not competent to judge the merits of the dancing on display here, I'll leave it to the balletomanes online to do so. But as a movie, ""Black Swan"" fails even to live up to the reasonable expectations that horror film buffs might have. There's nothing especially horrific, new, startling or shocking about the backstage bitchery the movie's characters indulge in, nor suspenseful about the end(s) to which they come. I suppose one could make a reasonable case for Portman having earned the Oscar for her role in this film... but, then again, what actress wouldn't pull out all the stops when handed a script that encourages her to chew the scenery, go mad, and carry on like Tallulah Bankhead on speed? The real mystery of this film, to me, is for exactly what audience Aronofsky intended it. Since it possesses neither wit, menace, suspense, sophistication or intelligence, ""Black Swan,"" I conclude, was designed to appeal primarily to underage drug addicts. May they have the joy of it."

The movie has little to offer. The story is slow and unclear. The characters are shallow and not one is the least bit likable, so even if it were possible to understand what is happening - which it isn't - why would anyone care?<br/><br/>The usually good Vincent Cassel presents us with a lifeless cliché of a character – little more than a cardboard cutout with movable lips. Same for Barbara Hersey. Mila Kunis gives a passable performance – a stand-out relative to the others. Natalie Portman recycles the same three facial expressions for the entire film. Is that all it takes to win an Oscar?<br/><br/>The viewer can't know if events in the film are real or imagined. That's not a problem if the events can be understood in terms of the characters' inner lives. That can't happen in Black Swan, so the events become arbitrary and meaningless nonsense. The feel of the whole thing is phony – slick, artsy, and without substance.<br/><br/>The film is badly paced and visually unattractive. The music is relentlessly bombastic and headache-inducing, and the dancing is terrible. The film is boring and lacks humor. With the exception of a very brief segment which depicts a drug-induced experience Black Swan is completely devoid of anything resembling art.<br/><br/>I never quit on a film.

","It's easy to see that Darren Aronofsky was influenced by the classic THE RED SHOES ('48), except that the '48 film did not telegraph its tragic ending which came as somewhat of an abrupt surprise. On the other hand, BLACK SWAN telegraphs its outcome from Scene One, the major fault of the film which ends on an extremely downbeat note.<br/><br/>The highlight of BLACK SWAN is the presentation of the ballet music and all of the behind-the-scenes tension brought on by the determination of ballet maestro VINCENT CASSEL to find a dancer who can be both The White Swan and The Black Swan with equal expertise. <br/><br/>He is impressed by NATALIE PORTMAN's skill as The White Swan but tells her she must experience life and love to the utmost in order to provide the proper passion for her darker side as the evil swan. What's hard to believe is that he doesn't spot the flaws in her personality that make her unable to come to grips with the demands of the ballet world. However, his performance is excellent, as is MILA KUNIS as her cunning rival.<br/><br/>Portman's mother (BARBARA HERSHEY) seems to be as neurotic as her unstable daughter in a Mommie Dearest sort of way. Their scenes together amp up what we know is bound to be a fatalistic end to an unhappy story. As the rival ballerina, MILA KUNIS provides plenty of jealousy for Portman, already unnerved by the demands that Cassel places on her emoting. Inevitably, Portman is pushed over the edge by all of her hallucinations and insecurities until she falls into a pit of darkness from which there is no escape.<br/><br/>Portman's skill as an actress is evident, overcoming any objections some might have to the heavy use of a body double for the difficult ballet moves. She gives her character dimension and pity, despite the unpleasant aspects of the character's irritating personality.<br/><br/>Worth a look for the performances alone, but beware that the dark side looms large in just about every scene which some might find too depressing for their taste and the sexual content is close to pornographic at times."

","This is a weird movie. Apparently their is something terribly wrong with the main character. First she is chosen to do the leading role in the ballet Swann Lake. Not much of the structure of this ballet is shown in the movie. No build up of essential moments in the performance of the ballet. No artistic theme to develop which would have made a nice ballet movie. No, the emphasis is laid upon the weird experiences of the girl who is to dance the leading role of Swann Lake. During the announcement that she will be dancing the leading role you can see her delicacy and understand why she was chosen. You seen inner beauty, a maturity, which couldn't in any possible way go together with a derangement and madness of the girl, which will later develop. Do her feelings of guilt of pushing the older ballerina out of her job make her see her fingertips bleeding and peeling the skin of them? OK she is dominated by her mother, but then the discrepancy of having to dance a mature role and possessing a lot of young girls doll's. She is certainly not a crazy adolescent. Is she getting crazier because her college put some drug in her drink? What are we made to believe? So is her delicacy and maturity which came with practicing ballet for years only a thin veneer? Not something she built up her own? This is the discrepancy in this movie. The movie could have a nice ballet movie, where difficulties were to overcome, with maybe an accompanying love story and all would end in a beautiful, artistic performance. Now we're made to believe that sticking a piece a glass in herself makes her perform excellently. ""Made it perfect"" as she said herself at the end heavily bleeding. We don't see so much of this perfection because there are only Incoherent fragments of the performance. Do you think she will perform again? I don't think so. She won't be asked again. A pity that a movie about weirdness and madness couldn't have been one about artistry and beauty."

It's stylish, it has the kind of ""scary"" effects that belong in a teen slasher movie, it is often gross, and it doesn't go anywhere. Which would be okay, if this were an actual teen slasher movie. But it isn't. The Black Swan is humorless and pretentious, and to make matters worse, it's intellectually dishonest. Only a very cynical director would use symptoms of auto-mutilation, anorexia and schizophrenia haphazardly as ""devices"" to freak out an audience. (Not to mention the mandatory lesbian sex scene!) <br/><br/>Portman, an actress I've always considered to be somewhat of a quality assurance, delivers her worst role here, looking flat and freaked out for 100 minutes. High-stakes ballet is a stressful environment, but every great performer loses that stress on stage. Not the Portman character. She gets the main role without any hint she can handle it. Or was it all supposed to be one big hallucination? <br/><br/>I guess I should draw my own conclusions: I'm not a fan of Aronofsky.

Instead this film which has a setting in a ballet company is an interesting combination of plot themes from A Double Life and All About Eve.<br/><br/>Company choreographer Victor Cassel chooses promising newcomer Natalie Portman to be the lead in his new production of Swan Lake to succeed his long time star Winona Ryder who is not taking her forced retirement easy. Portman has been Ryder's Eve Harrington, but Portman also has an Eve in her life as well, the younger and talented Mila Kunis. A lot of fine roles for women in this film.<br/><br/>Portman is no doubt talented, but she's dealing with a lot of issues of paranoia, a lot of it instilled by her mother Barbara Hershey. She starts losing herself in the dark complexities of the Black Swan as surely as Ronald Colman did with Othello in A Double Life. How it all works out for all the women you have to see Black Swan.<br/><br/>And you'll like what you see. It's hard to miss the elements in those classics that I've cited in Black Swan. But if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best. And since an Oscar came Ronald Colman's way and one of her 10 nominations came Bette Davis's way, Natalie Portman sure had a substantial role that she played beautifully.<br/><br/>The real surprise for most viewers I think will be Mila Kunis who played the vapid Jackie on That Seventies Show. Kunis provided one of the great lines from television in that show when she stated that no one would deter her from her career goal to be Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. She should have gotten some Oscar recognition herself for the Eve Harrington type role she plays here.<br/><br/>Black Swan is the best film about ballet since the Anne Bancroft/Shirley MacLane classic The Turning Point from the Seventies. Try to see this one by all means."

","CLEARLY! everyone who has made a review, has ignored the GIANT ELEPHANT! in the room. Although, Natalie Portman, did a decent job executing the role of the Swan Queen, she did it in a very round-about, promiscuous way, that I found COMPLETELY unnecessary. <br/><br/>This movie was completely pornographic, and quite frankly I lost count with how many sex scenes & sexual innuendos where plastered all throughout it's short duration. Apparently, most of the reviewers are okay with the highly vivid and offensive sexual content and for that, congratulations. I'm ecstatic that you enjoyed every repulsive moment of The Black Swan, but however; for some unforeseen reason, this movie got a rating of R, which it really deserved and X or NC17. Needless to say, I was EXTREMELY disappointed and disgusted by the movie was portrayed."

","What an over-hyped disappointment. Other than watching Natalie Portman act for a hundred minutes, this movie was extremely tedious since I didn't care a thing about any of the characters. None of the characters were engaging, the directing was disjointed and uninteresting, the sex was sophomoric and gratuitous, and I'm glad others had forewarned so I only wasted time and not money on this C- yawn. Reminds me of Basic Instinct with a wannabe baby Esterhaus director struggling for a manipulative plot to justify some sexual titillation and hopefully get buzz. The best thing about this movie was the actual ballet performances. Unfortunately they were few and what was in between didn't justify the wait. What a waste, save your time and money."

","I personally do not think this movie the best movie of 2010, I did prefer The King's Speech and The Social Network. But overall, Black Swan is a very, very good film.<br/><br/>Albeit one with cracks. While the film succeeds as a character study, with a compelling lead character, there are some occasional logic and originality lapses, not in the script though as the script is very original that still holds the level of intensity in the slower parts, and with exception of Nina and perhaps Lily some of the characters could have done with more depth.<br/><br/>Those flaws aside, I loved it. But I can understand why people mayn't like it, I especially have a good friend who found it ham-fisted and found it left a bad taste in her mouth, it is often very adult and graphic with some sexual content. Anyone expecting Swan Lake are better off finding a video production or buying a ticket to somewhere like the Royal Ballet, this is not Swan Lake but a melodramatic and psychological character study revolving around a ballerina and the production of that particular ballet.<br/><br/>I remember reading that Darcy Bussell(who I respect) criticised the movie for an inaccurate portrayal of ballerinas or somewhat. I am not saying she is wrong, but I think it depends on the ballerina.<br/><br/>Even with any problems the film has, it is beautiful, tragic, haunting and nightmarish not to mention somewhat thought-provoking. The camera work with its contrasting black and whites to create contrasting moods is great, complete with stunning costumes, scenery and sets. The choreography is good and you do feel the sweat that the performers exude when performing, but I would have liked more close-ups of it perhaps.<br/><br/>The music is haunting and melancholic and the snippets of the Tchaikovsky ballet that you hear throughout are a delight to hear, but again it could have been more, and the finale is dark and exhilarating. The acting is mostly very good. Vincent Cassel is appropriately slimy, Barbara Hershey is terrific as the controlling mother and Mila Kunis is surprisingly wonderful in her meatiest role yet. But what made Black Swan are Darren Aranofsky's bravura direction and the mesmerising titular performance of Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a very good film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

When I first heard about it, I was very excited to see it, since I usually like this sort of movies. But, was I in for a surprise with this one!<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is so boring, I actually played solitaire on my phone while I watched it. It's filled with silly images of a crazy girl, pulling her skin off. I mean, was the finger scene really necessary? And while I'm on the topic of necessary scenes, I think seeing Natalie performing oral sex on herself scared me for life. Only a man can come up with that one :)<br/><br/>Anyway, the acting was bad, there was absolutely no character development and Natalie Portman's face remained the same throughout the entire movie. Even, when she changed into the black swan, she seemed exactly the same, apart from the wings they computer generated onto her back. I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, or her performance. It must be the sheep factor :)"

","Black swan by Darran Aronofsky continues the director's body that will split audiences and critics to two extreme camps . . Certainly those who thought REQUIEM FOR A DREAM was an unsung masterpiece will probably have a higher opinion of it since SWAN shows Aronofsky's influences that are as diverse as Cronenberg's work from the 1970s and German expressionist cinema <br/><br/>This is not to say that SWAN is a horror film per se and this is the fundamental problem - the audience are continually being led up a Lovecraftian garden path by screenwriters Heinz , Hayman and McLaughlin where things seem metaphysical rather than psychological . Things happen that are never made clear as to why they're happening and this culminates in the final scene which does ruin the film to a large extent . It should also be remembered that REQUIEM was effectively a modern day expressionistic horror film where as this movie isn't . It's more in the vein of a sexual Heart Of Darkness set against the background of ballet <br/><br/>That said Aronofsky isn't too interested in destinations , he's concentrating on the journey and it 's a journey that is compelling for the most part . Portman is a certainty for Best Actress at the Oscars but Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel are both equally memorable in their supporting roles . Like Aronofsky's previous movies the technical aspects such as editing and cinematography are superb but you're left thinking that the more prestigious prize ceremonies will give out their awards to films that are more audience friendly . But this is isn't a criticism of Aronofsky who is just about the most interesting and original director working today and one hopes never to see him compromise his style for the mainstream"

","This has all the pieces of a special film but I can't help but think that it seriously missed the mark. I think it's trying too hard is what it comes down to. I enjoy subjectivity and feeling uneasy while watching something but there are too many lazy plot points to ignore. There are so many unnecessary little occurrences that are in the film for no other reason than to cause uneasiness. They don't move the story along and they don't add a tense layer to the movie, they simply make me not want to watch. The story, itself, is interesting but the movie is just unnecessarily unpleasant for too long. Portman and Kunis do well with their roles but Portman's character is far too annoying at times. I understand all of these visions she has are products of mental illness that is derived from her unusual home-life and uncompromising commitment to her work but a lot of the film just doesn't work for me. I'm a very big proponent of showing things instead of always saying them but Black Swan takes pieces of information that might have been better off implied and brazenly puts them on screen, often in a manner that comes off as cheap. I admire the idea behind the film but the execution leaves a lot to be desired."

The screenplay was overly basic, lacking any attempt at creating believable characters. The acting was elementary with no intention of fleshing out character motivation, etc. Perhaps all of this is due to the directing. The cinematography was jumpy and poor, shot much in the manner I would expect from a Horror film.

This is the sort of movie you know it'll be irretrievably bad after you've passed the first 10 minutes. God, I hate that feeling. I'm actually very very angry that such an interesting and unusual plot idea has been butchered the way it's been. It's bland, badly written, full of awful clichés at every level and about every 2 minutes. And the camera moves are nauseous.<br/><br/>Flat, unemotional, linear, unconvincing, so annoyingly predictable. I'm embarrassed for Vincent Cassel. How did he ever end up in such a mess of a film? I'm no prude at all, but the sex is so obviously gratuitous (and badly directed, think either Charmed, Buffy or Angel) that it made me cringe. Why bother at all in this case, just stick doing TV shows! I'm no ballet expert but for the little knowledge I have of this Art I sense every actual ballet dancer will find this appalling. They even managed to make the music sound bad. Tchaikovsky butchered too!! Waste, waste and more waste. I wish this film could be wiped off from the surface of the planet and be done again. The only redeemable thing is the excellent work of the costume designer.<br/><br/>Another case of Emperor's new clothes even if I do respect other people's opinions, I truly believe this is one of the worst films ever made that leaves you with a bitter frustration thinking of what it could have been. :("

However, since my aunt recommended the movie, I didn't feel the need to.

There is NO need to make an audience sit through moaning, screaming, and invasive camera angles on every part of a body that I DON'T want to see.<br/><br/>Further more, does every actor and actress in this particular movie have to be a god damn pervert? You've got the main character, who will do ANYTHING, and I mean ANYTHING to get a part in a lousy dance. You've got this mysterious woman who is in her dance glass that feels the need to be all touchy with her. Then you've got the conductor who fondles everyone.

Part of this method is to fool the audience into thinking they are watching something when they are really watching close to nothing, and not the good Seinfeld ""nothing."" <br/><br/>The acting is good, especially Cassel who has been seriously unrecognized for his extreme versatility in bringing very different characters to fully developed performances. Natalie Portman is getting lots of nominations. I have always liked her performances, but this is far from her best work, mostly because the screenplay is probably the worst she have ever had to act. Even the silly Star Wars sequels are far superior and gave her much more to do. It doesn't take a whole lot of talent to play psycho with all the camera tricks going on. <br/><br/>The cinematography is mostly nauseating for no particular reason. Everything is confusing and blurry, so it doesn't really matter what is being shot.<br/><br/>The only explanation for this movie's success is that critics and audiences have never seen the films Aronovsky stole from to make this--Repulsion, Red Shoes, The Tenant, All About Eve, films of Cronenberg and DePalma."
"wheretocontactme","3","14","25","14 February 2011"," A series of clichés that left me annoyed
","I doubted whether I'd like this movie, as I'm a dancer myself, and never can quite get into the story when the actors are not dancers themselves (you can tell when it switches from actor to real dancer and vice-versa and that's all you notice in the end). However, I was nicely surprised on this occasion, as I thought Natalie Portman was REALLY believable as a dancer (and I guess the director made a point of blurring the effects from real dancer to Portman, which is a nice change to many other films depicting ballet). <br/><br/>So, after 5-10 min of the film starting, I thought, actually, I'm going to enjoy this very much!! But no, it wasn't to be... The oppressive mother, the frigid 'white' swan that is Portman and the eating disorder: all these are great clichés that just simply aren't the norm. Once people realise that ballerinas are simply great athletes but do not live in world of their own, they may appreciate the art form a lot more(dancers have a life outside the studio, otherwise, they would indeed not survive -was that the aim of the film? to tell us it's a harsh, harsh life to be a dancer? I must have missed the point then). <br/><br/>I thought there are several faults in that film that makes it cringe-worthy to watch: the pushy mother-who-was-once-a-ballerina-but-never-quite-made-it so makes her daughter's life a misery? Really?; The frigid dancer who cannot get into the role of the black swan -I mean, come on, how hard is it to embrace your dark side? If you're a dancer, at this level, you know how to change your personality from the age of 10!!; the cliché of the artistic director sleeping with all of the female dancers, and the bullying that is permitted at rehearsals? I mean again, come on!! We don't live in the 19th Century!! Those practices are no longer permitted and it's like nobody cares what TRULY happens in a dance studio (it would have been a LOT better if they had consulted real professionals). Some aspects however were actually quite well represented (the preparation of dance shoes, like burning the ribbons, almost daily sewing of elastics, ribbons, etc and training that is constant).<br/><br/>Overall though, it made me feel like I'd rather attend a company rehearsal (more boring in that all you see is dancers repeat the same steps) than watch this film again. I went on the recommendation of a friend, who said he was 'mesmerised' by the role and the film left him shiver with pleasure. I think we probably don't have the same taste in films, and he's definitely not 'au fait' with what dancers are about anymore... I would certainly not recommend it to my friends, dancers or not.<br/><br/>Shame, because I wanted to like it, and to be fair to Portman, she does quite a good job as a dancer (in fact, I'm quite in awe about what she achieved after only a year of practice)."

And I agreed "" Yeah, ballet is a tough business"".<br/><br/>Nothing had prepared me for a slasher movie. I had not read a lot about the movie, only that it was about ballet and artsy and as I love ballet, it was a given for me that I would go and see it.

Portman was never shown dancing only waving her arms and close-ups of her starving face. For a movie about ballet there was not a lot of dancing going on. The horror part I did not watch because I find it disgusting and I am getting so tired of lesbian sex. Obviously trying out lesbian sex is fashionable but this scene was not erotic or arousing and what other purpose has a scene like this but to arouse people?

"Robert_duder","4","13","23","17 February 2011"," Wow....and not in a good way...What the...???
","You can't go anywhere without hearing about Black Swan. Reviewers on here say ""Perfect"", ""A Nightmarish Brilliant Piece"", ""the best movie of the year"" and it seems destined to score Academy Awards especially for its star. Even my 75 year old father loved it so I thought it was just going to be spectacular. It stared out promising enough making me cringe at the brutal lengths the determined dancer goes through and then it started to make me cringe at how terrible it was turning out to be. Black Swan in my honest opinion was absolute garbage. It was one of those artsy movies that I hate more because everyone loves it because its the 'In thing' to do. Yes the film is unique, gritty, twisted, and dark but it just continually makes you scratch your head and laugh out loud at the sheer absurdity of the film. I looked around at the other theatre goers who were enthralled and devastated by the emotion and I wanted to start laughing because the film is so completely absurd, it isn't emotion, its silly. Maybe there was a lot of expectation going into this but I hope to never see this film again. It aims for shocking and the only thing shocking is how much everyone loves it.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives a solid performance. She is probably the sole reason I managed to squeeze a 4/10 for this film. But Portman is a great actress. Her descent into madness is silly but her performance is honest and she really does a good job handling the insanity. Mila Kunis is doing a good job breaking out her career although she seems to struggle finding the right role. Her role in this film is not a big stretch for her. I think its probably pretty close to her true personality as far as being strong and outspoken. Really she is a more mature 'Jackie' (her character from That Seventies Show.) Her and Portman don't have great chemistry and while Portman is giving this role her all, Kunis is far too laid back. Vincent Cassel also gives a solid performance as the dictating and disturbing Ballet director. Cassel has good chemistry with Portman and gives probably the second best performance in the film. Unfortunate given how disturbingly stupid the movie is. Barbara Hershey could be good, in fact she does raise the standard of the cast but then some of the bizarre twists in her behaviour makes it even stranger. What's with the breakdown over the cake? She's just odd. In true Winona Ryder style as of late she shows up in an odd cameo showing plenty of twisted emotion but its too late to redeem her performance in the film.<br/><br/>Some people will say that I didn't 'get' this movie and I do get it. Portman's character's emotional crash reflects that of the Swan Queen in Swan Lake as she pushes herself to a breakdown. I also know that Darren Aronofsky is not known for run of the mill mainstream films although I have only seen a couple of his films. How scary is it that he's tied to direct the next Wolverine film? The cold hard fact of this film is that there is too much bizarre and absurd all thrown in at once. It comes at you like a freight train. You're watching this dancer who is so insanely driven to be perfect and then suddenly...visions, scratching open her skin, paintings moving, drug hallucinations, murder, suicide...it just is overwhelming. I suppose because so many are raving and critics are in love that film fans should go see this but for me this was simply a huge waste of time. Given the sexual tones of the film it isn't even gratuitous. I'll be crossing my fingers for the academy to bypass this one because there has to be better films this year! Although I don't suppose Jason Statham will ever get nominated. 4/10"

Yes, I'm sure Natalie Portman will win an Oscar for her notable portrayal of a disturbed young ballerina and am equally confident it will take home the naked golden man for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky, the Director, attempts to lead us down the Rabbit Hole through the psychiatric disillusions of a talented, albeit coo-coo, young ballerina. There's no supernatural element here (as I was led to believe in the trailers) only the visions of a poor disturbed individual. Frankly, I find that notion a bit exploitative to all those who suffer from a mental illness. Yes, I get this is a thought provoking tale with the the whole White=Good and Black=Bad thing. The audience however, is left to wonder what the heck is going on. I must admit, I kept waiting for the shoe to drop but it never materializes.

","Maybe this goes over well with people who never saw ""The Red Shoes"" or ""Turning Point"", or any other ballet films, but for those of us over 30, ""Black Swan"" is the most heavy-handed, cliché-ridden soap opera in years. <br/><br/>First, in case you don't get that Nina is ultra pure, she wears pink or fluffy white (like feathers)in every shot. She even has a bedroom full of stuffed animals, emphasizing her childlike virginity.<br/><br/>Second, her nemesis, well-played by Mila Kunis, wears dark colors, loose hair, and appears to have black swan wings tattooed on her back....got it yet? <br/><br/>There are oh-so-discreet shots of Nina's feet facing the toilet so we know she's bulimic. <br/><br/>It seems the producers wouldn't allow her to be a ""cutter"". Instead she scratches, including in her sleep. I guess it's possible, but her scratches are long and vertical, paralleling the BACK of her bra strap. Try to make that motion; it's right up with kissing your elbow. She tells her overbearing mother ""it's a rash"". <br/><br/>It's Ballet-Mom-From-Hell, a former dancer whose behavior is so over the top as to be laughable, even trying to get her daughter to stop talking to a friend by saying dinner's getting cold, and sleeping in a chair in her daughter's room. <br/><br/>The same over-the-top can be said for the ballet-master, whose lust for the women in the company is unprecedented, to say the least.<br/><br/>Ms. Portman was indeed very thin. She managed ""swan arms"" decently. No one expected to see her en pointe, or doing the famous 32 fouette turns, but the camera never even shot her below the bustline as she danced. In fact, it seemed that 2/3 of the film was either close-ups of her face or shots of her hair bun as she walked away from the camera. (Whoever did the dancing in the longshots was excellent.)<br/><br/>Balletically, this is a revisionist ""Swan Lake"". Every ballet book has the story if you don't know it. Apparently the only reason for the revision was to create a death scene at the end. Gore galore.<br/><br/>This film can't make up its mind if it is a romance (lesbian or straight), horror, or fantasy.<br/><br/>The only award should be for the black swan makeup. <br/><br/>Oh yes...DON'T take the kids, especially if they study ballet."

However, in reality it is monotonous, dreary, and populated by single-dimensional caricatures who play the same part in every scene.<br/><br/>Portman won the Oscar® for her performance, and much was made of her dancing, both the fact that she trained for more than a year and also that her stunt double didn't get any credit. Well, as someone who has spent forty years going to the ballet, and as someone married to a ballet dancer, I can state that this movie has some of the worst ballet dancing ever recorded in a movie.<br/><br/>Finally, all the metaphors in this failed movie are trite, and some quite laughable. For instance, the appearance of actual feathers, at least in the mind of the crazed black swan, is one of the oldest lines in reviews of ""Swan Lake:"" ""She was so convincing you could actually see the feathers"" is a typical review line that I've read many times over the years.<br/><br/>In this case, I didn't need to see the feathers, and I didn't need to see the movie.<br/><br/>If you want to see a great ballet movie about a ballerina going mad as art and reality follow parallel paths, rent the timeless classic ""The Red Shoes.""

The plot in this movie is almost non-existent and the characters sketched very poorly. The rehearsal room scenes gave no real indication of the blood, sweat and tears involved in producing a professional ballet - it takes more than a few shots of bloody toes and dancers breaking in their ballet shoes. Would a ballet company allow a dancer to have a dirty great tattoo plastered across her back? I don't think so.

The disappointment! I truly think that if this movie hadn't starred Natalie Portman, it would have remained anonymous or, anyway, nobody would have talked about it this much! OK, so she is good as what she does and the sexual themes really contribute at this film's success, but what is there to see beyond this? Basically nothing. It's a ballerina's drama, which we don't understand if it comes from her past or because she is given the lead role (!!!), so basically it's about a lesbian psycho unable to come out. It's not about the dancing, it's not about art, it's just a trashy way of saying that there are disordered people out there.

","I think this movie is not THE great movie that many people think. It is a mix from Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream. Natalie Portman's performance was very poor because I always saw her pretending to be a ballerina and no the ballerina herself. She never couldn't wear the skin of the character she played. In The Wrestler, for example, Mickey Rourke was much more convincing and was easy to forget who the actor was and get involve with the story. I found the movie full of dramatic effects but it's not effective, because everything is so artificial and full of clichés that disappoint every member of the audience who expected a better work than the last. I know that visual effects and music are an important part of any movie, but when these resorts become more important than the performers or the argument, then something is wrong with the movie. By the way, the argument is very predictable. At least for me, there were no surprises like in the previous works of Darren Aronofsky."
"jleecbd-959-192731","5","12","21","24 January 2011"," A Failure of Character Development
","If the Black Swan deserves any awards, it is likely the ""Emperor's New Clothes Award"". After watching the film, I can't help but think that everyone feels that they are supposed to fawn over this film because it is supposedly artsy, and contains one of the hottest talents in Hollywood right now (I think Portman has something like 5 movies releasing in a 12 month period). Of course, the lesbian scene probably has something to do with the need for all of us to love the movie, as well.<br/><br/>The reality, however, is that the movie fails to live up to its purported goals, or even come close. Portman plays a character with essentially one facial expression throughout the movie (with the exception of her expressions during the unfortunate, and crass, sex scenes). That expression is one that makes her appear as if she is about to burst into tears at any moment. Although the movie is supposed to chronicle her developing the Black Swan personality, we have to rely on characters in the movie, most notably the company director, to assure us it is happening. Nothing shifts in Portman's portrayal of the character to clue you in to this change. Whether this is due to her acting skills or the director's skills, I can't completely say. However, thinking back on V for Vendetta, the most interesting character in that movie was the one wearing the mask. Portman's character, while somewhat interesting, undergoes a sudden shift toward the end of the movie, similar to that in Swan, while we are deprived of really observing the subtle transition.<br/><br/>Rather than watching her become the Swan, I spent the entire movie waiting for her to have the role stripped and handed to someone else. It is never believable that she is given the role in the first place, and as opening night approaches, it is impossible to believe that she isn't given the boot, because nothing about her has changed. Yes, she does yell at her mom, but that is hardly some significant character development.<br/><br/>The only two highlights to the movie are the cinematography, which creates a wonderful air of foreboding, ""grit"", and darkness around the entire movie (and facilitates a reasonably good handling of her descent from extreme neurosis to insanity - although that is not a terribly long journey), and the dancing itself.<br/><br/>Actually, to be fair, when Portman plays the Black Swan for the actual show, she does a tremendous job portraying that character. Unfortunately, like in Vendetta, there is nothing in her portrayal of the character up to that point that allows you to observe and experience the transition."

I rate it as a B movie, not unlike Night of the Living Dead. Boring. Boring from beginning to end. I give it points for costumes, score, and makeup. Portman is too tall for a ballerina, unrealistic, she needs to stick to Pirate movies. She is much over rated. Honestly, what is the big deal with her?

I wasn't too surprised to learn that it has the same creator as Requiem for a Dream, for the resemblance is indeed strong.<br/><br/>What I liked least was the depiction of drug use - I liked Portman's character way too much to see her depicted as so weak-willed.

"roman8","1","11","19","5 February 2011"," Black Swan Down
","This isn't a movie review in the proper sense of the word, but more of a rant, mainly because the subject of this writing is... not a movie. What it is, is an amazing sum-up of all clichés people totally unfamiliar with any kind of performers - but especially with ballet dancers and classical musicians - think the lives of such persons to be like.<br/><br/>There are quite a few movies on ballet out there, that can offer great studies in character development - like Billy Eliott, for instance; Black Swan though isn't one of them, simply because it has no characters to develop in the first place, just two-dimensional cartoon-figures who can think and speak and act in nothing but common-places.<br/><br/>There are also quite a few movies out there that offer amazing, heart-breaking insights into the world of dancers - like The Red Shoes or A Chorus Line, but Black Swan isn't that either, opting instead to present nothing but prejudices and preconceptions that clearly have never been challenged by even the tiniest amount of research into reality whatsoever. People whose job is to be on a stage and perform regularly are disciplined - in body and mind. There are no hysterics, no psychological mumbo-jumbo fitting luxury house-wives with no occupation - and, since they are used to 'give' themselves to audiences on a regular basis, very little sexual immaturity.<br/><br/>Last, not least: there are also movies about ballet and dance, that can be gripping thrillers. White Nights comes to mind. Black Swan obviously fails in that respect too, because thrillers are ""thrilling"", which means that you cannot anticipate every word, every turn, every twist and still be supposed to wonder. From its first to its last scene, Black Swan leaves no doubts, offers no surprises, lights up no question marks. You know what it is, where it is going, how it will end and why.<br/><br/>In addition to all that: the cinematography is inspired by Peter Berg (which is annoying even in an action movie), the script is lazy, the directing uninspired and the acting left to its own devices. Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey struggle with what they're given, but the truth is that they're given very little. (In fact, they are given nothing - little would have been an improvement here.) If you want a movie about ballet, dancing, music, psychology, characters or even thrill and horror, go look somewhere else. If, however, seeing Natalie Portman's transformation into Darth Vader is your thing, then by all means: go ahead! You'll find the experience rewarding, wooden dialogue and fiery eyes (yes, even THIS cliché appears) and all."
"RichardvonLust","5","16","30","16 January 2011"," Soft Porn masquerading as serious drama
","I'm sorry to say that I found Black Swan a deep disappointment. The hype had me believing that the film had something serious to say about the grey borderline between virtue and temptation. But although many of the crew and cast probably entered the project with such worthy aspirations in mind, their producers and studio bosses have turned the work into something little more than a lusty romp between sexy ballerinas in a dark vampire like setting. <br/><br/>For me the film lost significant credibility within minutes of opening. Ballerinas capable of landing lead parts in major productions are never naive virgins too frightened to look at their own shadow. The enormous work and effort required to reach that pinnacle is not possible for the faint hearted. And definitely not for the mentally disabled either. It was clear to all that the lead was suffering from various serious mental conditions and no director or producer would ever allow such a mentally fragile unknown to top the bill in a major production. It would be too much of a risk for everyone concerned. In consequence the whole scenario was contrived rubbish. Moreover no professional would freak out at the thought of a understudy coveting her role. It's perfectly normal and healthy for the understudy to covet the role they are covering. And any professional who had a problem with this would be 'let go' on the spot. And neither do débutante lead performers take serious psychedelic drugs in night clubs into the small hours during the evening before their opening. Again this was unimaginable rubbish. And as for the chances of a performer pulling off a fantastic solo with a fatal piece of glass rammed in their gut for half an hour I can only say that the idea was indicative of the whole production; pathetic fantasy. <br/><br/>Of course we did see a lot of lesbian love scenes, semi nudity, breast touching and genital licking by the lead female performers. Plainly there has to be something to excite some of the excessive interest in this production and the high scores it has achieved on this site. But whilst full frontal nudity among male stars is now quite commonplace (I mean who hasn't seen the penis and testicles of Jonathan Rhys Myers, Leonardo Di Caprio, Daniel Bruhl and Ewan Mgreggor for example)the equivalent exposure for female stars is sadly lacking. And this film was no exception. So I can't give it high marks there either. <br/><br/>But the film does popularize Tchaikowski and some of the scenes are well crafted in terms of visual and music mixing. The general idea behind the movie, namely the interface between good and evil in us all, is also excellent. But what a pity the concept was ruined by typical Hollywood smut and primitive sexual marketing."

But the story is just way too simple and straightforward without any actual surprise or shock as in ""The Piano Teacher"" for example. These movies are similar in theme, the ""Black Swan"" is prettier, but it is basically just a fantasy or ride to the unreal schizophrenic world whereas ""The Piano Teacher"" is deep, brutal and in many ways almost analytical examination of ill relationship between abusive mother and cold and distant daughter. It is way, way better and faithful to reality than this fantasy carnival ride.<br/><br/>The Black Swan tries to present something similar but fails in its narativity.

Sadly I found it so artistic that it was more likely boring and bland and the main so-called bad-ass was awfully irritating me the whole movie because of the actor and his insufficient ability to represent the character on higher level than a high school play.<br/><br/>However, what disappointed me the most was probably the end of the movie. I won't write any spoilers here but just for you to know - a good movie shouldn't end up like this, that end indicates that the director didn't know what to do with the main character and therefore he chose the easiest way to end it.

Behind the quite predictable storyline lies some pretty good scenes and amazingly good acting from our main character Nina played by Natalie Portman. She makes the story believable at least subjectively, told from inside her own perspective. If you can manage the cheesy character of her producer, Thomas Leroy, the rest of the cast does a good job. <br/><br/>For you out there interested in a mysterious thriller have something to look forward to in Black Swan, because even if you figure out how the story will end around 20 minutes in you will still feel the thrill of every scene. There's something cosy about occasionally getting your heart rate up and having total focus on the screen. The Silence of the Lambs and Gothika comes to mind here as a combination for a fitting comparison. Only lacking the true mystery behind an intelligent MS and being predictable hinders Black Swan from becoming a real blockbuster. What I like then is that it doesn't seem to be produced to bring good sales only, but rather to be a meaningful experience within the genre.<br/><br/>If you get a blanket for the youngest this is a movie for the whole family.

"Danusha_Goska","1","85","203","19 December 2010"," Bombastic, Pretentious, Misogynist, and Anti-Art
","""Black Swan"" is a bombastic, pretentious, middlebrow soap opera that struggles hard to say something profound about art and women, but manages to peddle hateful lies about both art and women. Men who've read too much Freud and have no understanding of women and teen Goth girls who wear black fingernail polish will embrace ""Black Swan"" passionately.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" has no rise in tension, no complication of plot. The entire film is a bleak, dreary, depiction of a schizophrenic who hallucinates and wears nice ballet costumes. Nina (Natalie Portman) is never depicted as having any normal life or healthy relationships the audience might care about her losing. From start to finish, the film features tight close-ups on Portman's anguished face as she careens through one hallucination, and one dance rehearsal, after another. Since Nina's world is so relentlessly bleak, horrific – and unreal – from the start, we can't invest in her. We can't care about her losing her hold on sanity, because she is shown from the get-go to have no hold on sanity. We can't care about her losing her friendships, or her hope, because she has no friendships and she has no hope. Nothing changes. Nothing is at stake. Nina is as big of a messy basket case an hour into the film as she was at the beginning. The endless close-ups on Nina's anguished face get old really fast.<br/><br/>The film-goer comes to understand disastrously quickly that Aronofsky's bag of tricks is limited. The sets are all in stiflingly monotonous black and white, no doubt to show how deep of a film this is. Since viewers don't know which scenes are real and which are Nina's hallucinations, it's impossible to invest in them.<br/><br/>The one bright spot in the film is Vincent Cassel, who relishes a bath in smarm as a ballet troupe's sadistic, manipulative, and very naughty director. He's the only one who has any fun, and God bless him for it. He could probably dance on the deck of the Titanic. With his French bonhomie and predatory amorality, Cassel is a cross between Maurice Chevalier and George Sanders.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" tells us that women are fragile and neurotic and if they do anything remarkable it makes them crazy. Craziness, in women, oddly parallels male sex fantasies. When women go crazy they have catfights with other women, including their moms, they torture their bodies and others in bloody, gory ways, they begin to pleasure themselves in visually artistic ways, and then they engage in same-gender erotic expression. Most of the women involved are young, fit, and minimally clad. How convenient for any kinky men watching this movie! Is this film misogynist? Ask yourself this, would Aronofksy make a parallel film about a football linebacker who goes nuts because being a football linebacker is a big stress? Yeah, I didn't think so, either. Of course this film is misogynist. ""Black Swan"" is a throwback to soft-core women's prison flics and misogynist film noir like 1947's ""Possessed,"" that depicted Joan Crawford driven mad by passion.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" struggles really hard to say big things about art: that the drive for perfection can drive you mad, that artists sacrifice for their art, that art and madness are virtually identical. This viewer just cannot believe that someone suffering from full blown schizophrenia could become the prima ballerina of a high powered NYC ballet troupe. Ballet is not the whim of an afternoon. Ballet demands a lifetime of showing up on time, getting along with colleagues, and successful performance. Someone as ill as Nina could not have carried this off.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" wants us to believe the old, crude, invidious lie that art equals madness. It doesn't. There have been some high-profile artists who were also mentally ill, but that the public tends to focus on these people doesn't make art and madness the same thing. For most artists, art means years of unpaid hard work, dedication, self-discipline, and self-restraint. The creation of powerful art demands that the artist be, not crazier than the bulk of the population, but saner. Not buying into popular lies arouses envy and suspicion. Some people who hate art and artists are often simply envious of art and artists. And some people really don't understand art or artists and so they feel threatened and enraged by art and artists. It is these people who have given us the lie that art and madness are identical. Aronofsky doesn't do art or artists any favors by peddling this lie."

It is clear from the majority of honest reviews that it stinks. I'm sure it conveys some deep message, but the point is to get it across (will this review do the trick? I wonder...) Sure, I have seen bad movies. I just eat them, like french fries. Tasteless, but sometimes a fatty sauce like mayonaise (i.e. good acting, appealing visuals, well thought-out concepts) will get me to sit through it, no matter the overall quality. This was like having a day-old, flabby, stale chip to chew on for two hours... a lot like chewing on your own tongue. And nothing of the aforementioned sauce, perhaps only dripping with dog saliva.<br/><br/>Perhaps a lot of 15 year old girls with tormented souls vote on IMDb. That is to say: perhaps they can relate to becoming a black swan after ""scratching"" themselves once too much.

","Billed as a sexy physiological thriller, Black Swan is instead a comedy of sorts - albeit one where the audience laughed at the actors not with them. A thriller succeeds by creating a character you get to know and care about and then slowly 'tightening the screws' of suspense by subjecting them to ever more frightening and surprising plot developments (e.g.Psycho, The Shining, Memento). <br/><br/>But no one on either side of the screen gets to know or care about Natalie Portman as the Swan Queen. We first see her as a one of a company of ballet dancers technically proficient but emotionally challenged - a 20 something nervous schoolgirl. Unfortunately, Ms. Portman proved incapable of changing her expressions or projecting new emotions as experiences impacted upon her character. In the film's terms, Ms. Portman is a White Swan incapable of portraying a Black Swan - a fatal flaw since the movie is about her transformation.<br/><br/>Since neither the audience nor the other characters in the film care about her it is impossible to feel any real suspense. And so the heavily foreshadowed elements of the film which are supposed to convey 'thriller' just come across as ever more ridiculous magical realism - pretty to look at but without emotional content.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Vincent Cassel breathes life into the arrogant artistic director, Wynona Rider has a delightful cameo as the deranged prima ballerina, and the ballet mistress displays her back to show the audience what an actual ballerina's muscles look like."

","The fact that this movie is getting so may good reviews speaks to the dumbing down of the movie-going public.<br/><br/>First of all - as someone with experience with the dance world, let's set the record straight - Natalie Portman may have tried hard, but she is strictly an amateur dancer. If you know dance she is simply unbelievable as a prima ballerina.<br/><br/>More importantly - the combination of genres Aronofsky tries here doe not work. Its not a dance movie, not Rosemary's Baby, not a Vampire movie - some strange and unconvincing combination...<br/><br/>I saw the film at the Hamptons Film Festival - if I hadn't been trapped at the end of a row I would have walked out.

","At the start I was only slightly disturbed by the inappropriate scenes of aimless evil inflicted upon the fragile and pure Nina. I wiped them away, and thought a deep drama would unfold about the psychological problems of Nina caused by stress and pressure. But later on I got more and more annoyed by detestable scenes of pain and sex. Especially the sudden shocks (sudden loud sound and movements) every five minutes became highly irritating. I wondered if this was meant to be a horror movie, but then another scene with some warm human response changed my mind. During the movie I had more and more doubts about the actual theme of the film. Where was the director going? What does he want to say? Eventually I got the feeling I was looking at a bad directed sequence of painful and shocking moments, that had no connection with real life whatsoever. At the scene where Nina returns to Beth in the hospital to give her back her lipstick (etc.) and Beth starts stabbing herself with the nail file I said to myself: 'this is enough!' I stopped the movie (dvd) and rigorously took care this garbage will never meet my eyes again. I decided not to lend my mind any longer to be fed with such mental vomit.

","""Black Swan"" is an extremely perceptive and chilling expose of the world of classical dance. Ballet is an art form that is as ruthless as it is breathtaking, and Aronofsky does an excellent job of portraying that dichotomy. Nina's (Natalie Portman) descent into madness is on par with Catherine Deneuve's portrayal of Carole in Roman Polanski's 1965 classic ""Repulsion"", albeit with modern (read graphic)scenes. The audience was gasping at certain scenes. Although they were ""imaginary"", they were able to convey such an immediate sense of horror and revulsion that the audience was totally captivated and drawn into Nina's world. Even the end leaves you wondering if, once again, Nina's madness is manifesting itself. What is scarier - that Nina is gone after one ""perfect"" performance, or if she will be continuing on in her (and her mother's) obsession? On another note, Mila Kunis' performance (as Lily)demonstrates her range beyond comedy. A beautiful and natural actress,her casting was perfect! Be prepared for the extremely visceral nature of this film when you go to see it."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","13","25","15 December 2010"," Portman and Aronofsky achieve the difficult combination of darkness and beauty
","Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" will leave a myriad of lasting impressions on different people for different reasons, but universally, the film will prove to the masses that ballet is most definitely not boring. Beautiful, thrilling, breathtaking -- yes, I'm referring to both the art form and the film. ""Black Swan"" echoes everything there is to love about both art forms: the passion, the elegance, the drive to create something deep and moving. Aronofsky's film is every bit as graceful as the art form and culture it seeks to capture, but more noticeably, every bit as challenging and dark and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Although Aronofsky's name has the reputation attached because of his visceral, deeply emotional and borderline distressful filmmaking style (""The Wrestler,"" ""Requiem for a Dream""), the spotlight belongs on star Natalie Portman as the film's first image so appropriately conveys. ""Black Swan"" is her story, a partial allegory for the ballet she's working on (""Swan Lake""), but more so a piercing journey into the mind of a sheltered and innocent young woman whose quest for perfection plunges her into a psychologically state that she cannot comprehend.<br/><br/>Portman plays Nina Sayers, a ballerina in New York's finest company whose dedication to her craft is never compromised (need I point out her name rhymes with ballerina?). Her success is partly thanks to her mother (Barbara Hershey), whom she still lives with and who literally mothers her to a ridiculous extent, but has kept her focused and out of trouble. Hershey plays the part carefully, not lapsing into clichéd overprotective mother territory too much, with a bit of help from the script not overdoing it as well.<br/><br/>Nina's dedication and innocence have finally appealed to her instructor/the company's artistic director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), who casts her as the coveted role of Swan Queen, which combines both parts of White Swan and Black Swan to make an artistic point about duality (and the film more interesting). Thomas tells Nina she's the quintessential White Swan, the innocent, picturesque dancer, but that she possesses no qualities of the seductive and fluid Black Swan. He believes in her, however, and is attracted (somewhat inappropriately) to her, so while he's given her the part, she still has to ""earn"" it.<br/><br/>Nina's quest to become the Black Swan, to divorce herself from the sheltered lifestyle that has wound her so tightly so she can convincingly do the Black Swan dance, is the center of the drama. This is accompanied by a mysterious ""transformation"" she appears to be undergoing into an actual swan along with times when she's on the subway or other places and she sees herself. The suspenseful elements grow from subtle tension to full-blown horror as the film goes on and the pressure mounts for Nina to succeed. At times the ""scares"" feel extreme, but the horror complements the poise and elegance of the ballet nicely. In fact the two work harmoniously at times, especially thanks to Clint Mansell's Tchaikovsky-twisting score.<br/><br/>Seeing as Aronofsky enjoys seizing the opportunity to make his audience uncomfortable, the horror should come as no surprise and neither should the pervasive sexuality of the film. Nina must learn to feel not think, to be seductive in her movement, and so the sexual ties to that are inherent (and arguably forced in at times). When Mila Kunis enters the picture as Lily, a fellow dancer who embodies the Black Swan characteristics Nina so desperately wants (she does drugs, sleeps around, eats cheeseburgers), a thick layer of sexuality drops onto the story. Overall, there's quite a bit of female sexuality, which despite how far movies have come, still has a taboo on it more so than male sexuality, so it does distract from its point at time. By and large, however, Aronofsky keeps these scenes pertinent and meaningful.<br/><br/>In the perspective of the entire film, however, sexual tension marks just one of numerous tensions that Aronofsky constantly weaves under the plot. Every scene has layers of text and subtext to make the scenes that don't have a fantastical element to them equally gripping. Aronofsky and Portman are the real dance partners here, working together to make what's beneath the surface an equal player in the viewing experience as well as to reflect -- quite literally with all the mirrors -- the levels of turmoil in Nina's mind.<br/><br/>Portman's performance ranks heads and tails above all her previous work. The overprotected child who is rigid and naive could be seen as an archetype, but Portman convinces us of Nina's reality by taking all these attributes to her core. Her emotions, like her in-tears excitement over getting the part of Swan Queen when she calls to tell her mom, are so convincing. We identify with her mixed feeling of excitement, fear and doubt among others and her performance communicates all those emotions stewing together inside her. Considering that ""Black Swan"" seriously features her performance if not hinges on it, her success cannot be overstated.<br/><br/>Nina's pursuit of perfection, to embody both sides of the coin instead of being the best at one side, will relate to everyone who has ever dared to be really good at anything challenging. The circumstances and results of Nina's particular story are stretched for dramatic effect, but Portman's performance remains so convincing throughout and Aronofsky's direction every bit as masterfully artistic that ""Black Swan"" deserves some of the highest of the praise that will go around in 2010. The film achieves the rare poetic synergy between the music, ballet, acting and direction that leaves you thinking a lot about what you just saw. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"shirleykernan-1","6","9","16","30 January 2011"," Ballerina spirals out of control with so-so results
","Darren Aronofsky's latest foray into the agitated mind of a perfectionist seems to have divided film goers down the middle. Some have lauded it as a top thriller/horror while others have deemed it more schlocky than shock and a real let down after The Wrestler. This time, instead of Mickey Rourke's ageing wrestler sacrificing body and mind to desperately cling onto fame, we have Natalie Portman's ambitious-to-the- death ballerina's descent into madness, all in the name of the spotlight.<br/><br/>Portman, who has visibly put herself through the paces to get into the skinny, taut body of a young ballerina, plays Nina Sayers - a mummy's girl dancer who has put everything, friendships, boys, growing up, on hold to achieve her ambition of becoming principle dancer in her New York ballet company. Her dream comes within grasp when lead ballerina, the gorgeously deranged Beth (Winona Ryder) is put out to pasture and artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel on mean, moody Frenchman mode, as per) casts his net for someone to play the lead in a new production of Swan Lake.<br/><br/>That's when the real fun begins. Angelic Beth-wannabe Nina seems to be a shoe-in for the role of the virginal White Swan – but does the mollycoddled little princess have the necessary darkness to play the evil Black Swan? Especially when new competition, bad girl dancer Lily (Mila Kunis hamming it up wonderfully as the femme fatale), arrives on the scene in a fog of drugs and sultry looks. <br/><br/>From the beginning, Black Swan enjoys teasing the viewer, playing out its twists and turns with relish – from Nina tearing at her own flesh in grisly detail through to the horror staple of having characters appear suddenly in a darkened corner. Yip, watching Nina unravel proves to be pretty compulsive viewing, even if you are trying to hide your eyes for the bloodier scenes. This Black Swan doesn't pull her punches. She teases, she bites, she claws and slowly, uncertainly she loses her mind, bringing us along for the ride. She also, however; takes herself a little too seriously.<br/><br/>Portman obviously threw herself heart and soul into this role but intensity be-damned, Nina is just too twee to really engage with. All those teddies and pink and frilly cakes and mousiness. No wonder none of the other dancers want to befriend her, she's a right oddball, like a female version of Norman Bates. And not in an interesting way either. In fact, Nina's so cutesy that when anything remotely untoward does happen, it's giggle inducing - which doesn't just reduce the tension, it deflates it. Like the scene where Nina is in bed and realises mummy's asleep in the chair beside her? Titter, titter. <br/><br/>All in all, Black Swan isn't a bad yarn; if anything it will certainly keep you guessing until its bittersweet end. You just probably won't want to bother with it a second time.<br/><br/>*It gets an extra 0.5 point for the fantastic make-up job on the Black Swan."

"Mark_Hixenbaugh","Null","12","23","20 December 2010"," At the precipice of perfection
","""Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.""<br/><br/>–– Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good And Evil<br/><br/>We have often heard numerous variations of the phrase, ""It's the journey, not the destination."" Sure, the line has attained a rather trite status, but still manages to maintain relevance. The greatest lessons seem to come from the process of achievement, rather than the achievement itself. In overcoming obstacles, we learn more about ourselves – or at least we should. <br/><br/>Black Swan is a film that examines the ""journey"" with an emphasis on the shadowy corners that encompass it. When trekking towards notability, sometimes you must traverse dark passages. This is when the real inquisition takes place. What is the price of perfection? Would you sacrifice relationships? Would you compromise your morality? Would you risk your sanity?<br/><br/>While watching Black Swan, it becomes apparent how ballet is the perfect backdrop to explore the theme of well, the pursuit of perfection. For even novice-minded individuals like myself, who have little knowledge of this art form, we quickly realize just how demanding, taxing, and grueling it can be on the mind and body – but all of that is just the superficial lining.<br/><br/>Black Swan begins as the classic story of an individual's pursuit of success. It's a story we have seen many times before, this time within the arena of the performing arts. We soon discover this archetypal tale unfolding into something more elaborate though. This is a surreal and mind-bending journey that is anything but standard storytelling fare.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, an outwardly fragile yet inwardly confident ballerina who aspires for the lead role in a production of Swan Lake. The show's director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassell), demands that the Swan Queen be someone who can pull off both the delicate innocence of the White Swan, as well as the seductive nature of the Black Swan. He sees in Nina a precise and talented dancer, but someone who seems to lack the alluring appeal necessary for the darker role. Leroy wants Nina to let go of herself and he takes rather questionable measures to facilitate the process.<br/><br/>Standing in Nina's way is Lily (Mila Kunis), a fellow ballerina who has career aspirations of her own. That is where the similarities between the two characters end. Nina's morally bound character starkly contrasts Lily's unbecoming demeanor. Where Nina relies heavily on preciseness during her performances, Lily dances with a natural flair that impresses the director. Nina is drawn to Lily's mysterious persona and the two quickly develop a tense and estranged relationship.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky successfully blends his definitive style with the engaging substance of the script. With Black Swan, his career has clearly realized its fruition. There are obvious remnants of his previous works evident in his latest. Aronofsky effectively depicts the deterioration of the body a la Requiem for a Dream (2000) and The Wrestler (2008). The gradual descent into madness is another phenomenon that he previously examined in Pi (1998) and Requiem.<br/><br/>Aronofsky exudes an auteur stature that recalls trademarks of other marquee directors. Like Brian DePalma, he traverses the psychological thriller genre utilizing eroticism and the doubling motif. Like David Cronenberg, he delves into venereal horror and psychosomatic disturbances. And like David Lynch, he reveals a dark underbelly in a typically bright world while blurring reality and illusion.<br/><br/>The acting here is top-notch and delivers a genuinely neurotic punch. Portman is stunning and clearly sheds any previous conceptions of modesty and chasteness. Look for her to be the favorite in the Oscar pool for Best Actress. Supporting roles are almost certain to be in the awards mix as well. Kunis is the perfect choice as the sinister adversary. Cassell depicts demand and debauchery with the utmost proficiency. Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey also shine as a past-her-prime ballerina and an overprotective mother respectively.<br/><br/>The cinematography is technically precise and visually stunning. The camera work of Matthew Libatique pulls us into the world of ballet in dramatically up-close fashion. Drawing from The Wrestler, we are thrust into the arena of ballet, almost as if we are dancing along with Nina. The kinetic rush of each spin is intensified with the rotating lens. The illusion of flight is captured with hand held proficiency. We follow Nina's footsteps along her journey as if we are hovering over her shoulder. The motif of mirrors plays a dramatic role throughout the film. The multiple shots and angles, incorporating reflections from mirrors, must have required a tremendous amount of preparation and exactness.<br/><br/>There is an underlying sense of captivation in Black Swan. It is a mysterious omnipresence looming almost from the start. Darkness lurks in corners, within corridors, and behind reflections. It reveals itself only periodically at first, a strange rash on the back, and inexplicable bleeding. Even the mundane act of fingernail clipping induces squeamish moments. It leaves us to wonder – like Nina – what we are witnessing. Aronofsky tells his story in Hitchcock-like fashion, injecting suspense in strict moderation. It develops initially as a slow simmer, and is clearly boiling over by the film's climax. <br/><br/>The conclusion, though, reminds us of the true essence of Black Swan. Competition can often times be relentless as well as remorseless. Contention can fuel our motivations, test our wills, and catapult us to greater heights. When the mind overcomes the body, we all possess the potential for greatness. Within the journey, we discover something essential about ourselves. The pursuit of perfection, however, can sometimes lead to consequential outcomes. Sometimes, we learn just how far beyond the cusp of morality and sanity we are willing to go. We gaze into the abyss, and it gazes back at us. And sometimes, when we leap beyond the precipice, there is no coming back."

","We fought our way through the season's first serious snow storm in New York to see BLACK SWAN, much praised (in some quarters) for reasons which I can only conclude have something to do with the silent movie style reliance on close-ups - one gathers a Darren Aronofsky trademark - to disguise the fact that this ""ballet"" film has almost no actual dancing except in the background because the leads *can't* - getting there and home again was the fun part. For anyone with any actual frame of reference either in the ballet or modern film, the movie was simply dreadful.<br/><br/>A conflation of the *worst* parts of THE RED SHOES performed without actual dancers (three minutes of details of ballerinas working on their toe shoes do NOT equal 30 seconds of actual DANCE) and a very bloated ""Twilight Zone"" episode, I would ONLY recommend this film to parents who would prefer to drive their children to therapy rather than have them take up ballet, or to hard up straight men and lesbians who want to see ""respectable"" pornography (it is R rated for extended segments here no respectable gay man should be forced to watch as well as ""violent content, language and some drug use""). Seriously: years ago I found ""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind The Green Door"" *significantly* less offensive.<br/><br/>The basic story of the artist so totally wrapped up in her role she loses herself with tragic consequences is perfectly valid - Carlos Saura did it with a flamenco CARMEN in a 1983 Spanish film brilliantly and even Isaac Asimov used the idea of the curse of a ""perfect"" performance as the basis of one of his more memorable short stories. With competent writing and direction, it could make a *thrilling* film or even stage musical, but under Aronofsky's close up direction, the screenplay by three separate hands raises all sorts of potential issues without resolving ANY of them. Is the choreographer a monster trying to seduce the virginal Portman or merely trying to get a performance out of her? Is Portman being drugged by an ambitious rival in the corps de ballet or perhaps her own jealous mother or is she merely having a mental breakdown under the pressure of her big break and the artist's quest for ""perfection""? WE'LL never know, and once he's convinced the shallow that he's ""serious"" by raising the issues, Aronofsky doesn't seem to care - competent suspense, surrealism and even Grand Guignol macabre are not merely the incomprehensibility and bad behavior drained of the inherent beauty of his subject that Aronofsky gives us.<br/><br/>Even beyond the core plot indignities Miss Portman's character is forced to endure, apparently unprofessional behavior which would never be allowed to pass at Lincoln Center (where the film is set) is consistently given a pass - or is it part of the actress' delusion or the director's conceit? The choice *as presented* in this movie is not sophisticated or even surrealistic, it is simply lazy film making - writing, direction and acting. Worst of all, the film is dishonest even to its own story telling. Portman's flirting with ""perfection"" in her official performance is early destroyed in her first act on stage and the supposed perfection of her act two ""Black Swan"" is rendered physically impossible by the director's final (and ludicrously drawn out) ""coup de theatre."" That is simply bad movie making.<br/><br/>Even the MUSICAL direction is poor, frittering away the great Tchaikovsky themes in Clint Mansell's lame adaptation which rarely was allowed to soar except in the movie title segment of the actual performance of SWAN LAKE (leads only shown from the chest up) to help give the impression Ms. Portman's acting is supposed to, and scared far less than even middling work in an average Hitchcock film. (Hitchcock could have made a corker of a thriller out of this mishmash - just add the detail that the director had poisoned the lipstick the girl steals.) Anyone who thinks this is ""outstanding"" really does need to check out an even middling ballet film like THE TURNING POINT (of *course* it was melodrama, but hot without resorting to pornography, the dancing was REAL and you could care about the characters!).<br/><br/>If you don't think the present producers are fully aware of the quality of their work, look at the ads in Sunday's papers (26 December 2010) touting the movie as ""WINNER"" of 19 separate ""Critics' Choice,"" Golden Globe"" and ""Screen Actors' Guild"" Awards - but in dishonest, almost disappearing print *half* the size of the word ""winner"" is the word ""nominations"". They haven't won a single award yet - and if god respects the arts, they never will. (Since this was written, Ms. Portman has been given an award or two for her ""acting"" which can only be a devastating comment on her competition and ""the voters."" For those who understand that acting is more than just appearing angst ridden, this is mere scenery chewing.)<br/><br/>I *will* say that the theatre was nearly full (to my surprise given the snow storm already in full progress), and afterward I heard as many people bubbling ""how great"" it was as grumbling that it was the ""worst piece of crap"" they had ever seen. At $13 a ticket for the early show some people have to defend the expenditure even to themselves. When out on DVD, the film's failings as a surreal thriller will doubtless be more tolerable reduced to the small screen, and no serious artistic values will be lost. I'd probably raise my rating to an overly generous 4 as a failed attempt at ballet based Grand Guignol, but it's still a basically bad movie that would be relegated to the ""midnight"" trash circuit if it didn't have a major studio behind it."

","I have watched Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" at its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film exposes the viewers to the highly competitive world of classical ballet through a psychologically intense pirouette of emotional and physical battles of a company dancer. A behind-the-curtain portrayal of the rise and fall of a principal dancer, it captures, from an every possible angle, the inner and the outer struggles of a dancer that is now required to climb above and beyond technical perfection to deliver a brilliant performance. Aronofsky has been very keen to reveal to the audience very early in the film that what they are about to see is an inner metamorphosis of the main character, but what he reserves revealing is just how wild exhilarating the ride will be. Natalie Portman in the lead role has delivered a perfect act on every level. Her introduction of the main protagonist as a tragedy waiting to unfold greatly augments the anticipation of the transformation the audience is so eager to see. The relationships of the protagonist with the key surrounding people (mother, creative director, alternate, male partner, other dancers in the company, and even the former principal) are explored to great depth, and Aronofsky builds his storyline on every factor that would have influence on the success of this new principal. Natalie Portman has delivered a sensational performance, depicting effortlessly, it would seem, yet with great intensity, every emotion to keep the audience captivated. Aronofsky does a great exploring the main character's obsessive drive for technical perfection, chronic physical and mental exhaustion, and her damaged and uncultivated sexuality, while exploring how, under changed conditions and increased pressure, these would collide to create a self-destructing ingenious artist. The ballet subject chosen by Aronofsky is perfect for such explorations – it is the one art where technical perfection and artistic expression are often at odds. The timing is impeccable and the thrill is sustained all throughout until the very end, taking us through a number of sometimes very chilling crises. Musical score is a superb adaptation of Tchaikovsky's themes. Aronofsky has really told a fascinating and complete story here (in his own twisted and dark flavour, of course), and that is what great directing is all about! It is a ten out of ten!"

Here, the camera moves every bit as energetically and gracefully as the subject. Some shots I simply cannot fathom how they were done unless with precision, quite dangerous choreography of bodies, camera and lights. We are in the space dancing as we are watching the elements in the space build order.<br/><br/>Yes, our subject is mad. Yes, she is a driven genius. Yes, the people around are relative imbeciles, slaves to their own ghosts but without any reward.<br/><br/>Yes, she is prepared to die for the immersion in her own creation, but that is what it takes, what drove Nash mad. Yes, she has to unharness the beast within, without which she has no sight whatever, and which always hurts. Always. <br/><br/>Thank you sir, for giving us this. Thank you for mastering the symmetries involved: or stillness and motion; of madness and sense; of losing to gain; and of pain for joy. Thank you for allowing us to have our imaginations revealed.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this."
"DJMo","9","13","26","9 December 2010"," There is a thin line between perfectionism and insanity
","Darren Aronofsky immerses the viewer in the world of the dancer, where performance anxiety is routine and one is always looking over one's shoulder. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman in a mesmerizing and Oscar-worthy performance) is a fragile ballerina coddled by an overprotective and infantilizing mother. Her perfectionism attracts the attention of ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel in a brilliantly creepy performance), who on the one hand encourages her poise and controlled form for the role of the White Swan but on the other hand, finds difficulty cultivating the looser, more seductive form required for the role of the Black Swan. He believes that he can coax this performance out of her, and Nina pushes herself to meet this expectation. She endures the director's rebukes, her mother's suffocating attention (and career-associated guilt trips), the knowledge of what happened to the company's former star ballerina, and the arrival of her rebellious understudy, Lily (played surprisingly well by Mila Kunis). Despite all of these obstacles, as Leroy tells her later, ""the only thing standing in your way is you."" Aronofsky distills themes from ""All About Eve,"" ""The Red Shoes,"" ""The Wrestler"" (his companion piece with similar themes from 2008), and of course the Swan Lake ballet itself, with imagery inspired by early Polanski (i.e. ""Repulsion,"" ""The Tenant"") and Cronenberg (i.e. ""Videodrome""), as well as deft use of black, white, and red color and moody chiaroscuro. While it is not quite as disturbing as ""Requiem for a Dream"" (few things are), it is just as visceral and engaging and is probably Aronofsky's best film."
"gortx","Null","24","54","6 December 2010"," Aronofsky strips SWAN LAKE
","** Mild possible Spoilers ** Early on in Aronofsky's BLACK SWAN, the Choreographer Leroy (played by Vincent Cassell) states that his version of TCHAIKOVSKY's Swan Lake will be ""stripped down"" and made ""real"". The Choreographer can be read as a stand-in for Aronofsky's himself. And, for the next hour and 45 minutes or so we see Leroy/Aronofsky strip Swan Lake down.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this leaves a version which is pretty naked itself. Naked in the sense of being thunderingly obvious in it's ambition. Naked in it's use of sensation and razzle-dazzle to mask its flaws. And, quite naked of any real meaning or human feeling.<br/><br/>Nude Movement One: Aronofsky has never been one for subtlety, but here the characters stammer with the most bald artiste clichés imaginable. And, did he really have to have a GIANT BLACK SWAN tattoo on Lily's (Mila Kunis) back? Why not just have a giant Monty Python-like arrow point at her from the rafters of the theater? Nude Movement Two: You could say that Aronofsky is following in the footsteps of Ken Russell with some of the over-the-top techniques, but that would be a slam on Russell (who could often attain great heights while simultaneously infuriating the viewer). And, Russell would never have been as boring as during the many rehearsal scenes here.<br/><br/>Nude Movement Three: While there have been a lot of folks who have been wowed by the visual pyrothechnics, horror movie motifs and hocus pocus, the film's fatal flaw is that entire thesis of the enterprise is not so much missed, but squashed. Namely, for Nina/The Swan Queen (Natalie Portman) to feel emotion. But, all of the aforementioned Aronofsky ""touches"" actually detract from any emotion being felt - by either Nina or the audience. It simply is naked of heartfelt passion. We're told that Nina has changed, but don't believe it.<br/><br/>And, quite assuredly, Leroy/Aronofsky has made Swan Lake/Black Swan less ""real"".<br/><br/>The positives do include some intriguing performances, and Portman is darn intense in the lead (even if you don't buy the ending). One can't help but wonder why Leroy would entrust such a critical role to Nina (not just in this ballet, but as the kickoff for the troupe's season) if she is so obviously in turmoil. Matthew Libatique's super 16mm photography is nimble, and Clint Mansell (with Matt Dunkley) does a good job of adapting Tchaicovsky's music (though one does wish that, you know, PETER ILYICH TCHAIKOVSKY got primary music credit, not being relegated to the long end credits roll).<br/><br/>***************Spoiler******************** And, Aronofsky had better watch out because he's come dangerously close to M.Night Shymalan territory with an ending in back to back films which are tres similar - it worked better in THE WRESTLER"
"f-odds-1","1","7","12","4 November 2012"," The worst kind of trash
","I can't resist writing the one-thousandth review! Just watched the movie on DVD. I thought this was supposed to be a great and compelling film about the pressures of ballet dancing. It's just a pile of tripe. No top-flight dancer, musician, athlete or anything else professional can be as self-absorbed as the heroine (?) of this film: they have to do a squillion technical things to get over their performance, otherwise they'd be replaced without hesitation. So let's assume it's all a fantasy in which the Natalie Portman character imagines all manner of hallucinations as she goes into the toughest role in the ballet repertoire (is it really?!). A good film fantasy makes the viewer interested, shocked, amazed, horrified. This one mostly makes the viewer bored, with an overwhelming sense of nausea at the stock characters (domineering mother, rivals out to trip up the star) and the stock situations (sexual interactions that may or may not be real, woundings and murders that may or may not have happened). For goodness' sake: this sort of thing has been churned out time after time in countless B movies and it's done here more expensively but not any better. The whole thing resembles a Ken Russell effort made on an extremely bad and mindless day."
"tedweigh","Null","7","12","31 March 2011"," I hated it!
","I am so disappointed in this movie!! I was so looking forward to seeing it having heard that it was a great dance movie. I have loved some dance movies that have had terrible plots (Dancers, Center Stage) just because of the great dancing, but this moving doesn't even have great dancing! There are dizzying shots of Natalie Portman filmed from the waist up. Then a few shots of her brilliant feet (obviousl not NP's feet), and on a very few full body shots where it is obvious that NP's head has been CG'd onto a real dancer's body. Would any director allow her deer in the headlights, constipated expression on her face during the practice sessions? They say she was supposedly 'perfect' for the white swan, but during all of those shots, she has that same expression of panic on her face. Yuck! Anyone who knows anything about dance would know that so much of this film is inaccurate.<br/><br/>There are so many ballet cliché's here, too. She vomits, she has ugly feet and a wacko stage mom...This movie is so obviously a horror show based on the world of dance with the directors having no idea what that world is really like and relying on all the cliché stuff they have heard.<br/><br/>As for the 'lesbian' love scene. How typical of male producers and directors throwing in a scene like that, presumably to entertain any men that were forced to come and see this movie by their girlfriend's or wive's who thought they were going to see a good dance film.<br/><br/>The end? Is she or isn't she dead? Even Natalie Portman has said that she doesn't believe that Nina died, but that she killed her old self. Well, la de da for her.<br/><br/>One thing that i haven't seen anyone else mention...I don't believe that there is a company in the world that would allow a dancer to have a full back tattoo visible while the dancer is in costume. A mark like that would more than likely make any company hesitant to hire Mila Kunis's character. Yuck! I came away from this movie feeling cheated and disappointed and most of all sorry that I'd wasted $4.99 to watch it 'On Demand.' The only saving grace for me was that I didn't pay to see it in the theater.<br/><br/>That part aside, the rest of the movie is offensive and cliché. Why can't any film director give us enough credit to allow a descent into madness that doesn't involve cheap hallucinations."

","Take ""Red Shoes"" for the ballerina being driven into catastrophe by her self centered surroundings, including a ballet company director. ""Secretary"" for the girl dominated by her mother and cutting herself in response. And maybe ""Shining"" for some horror effects plus that camera closely following a protagonist for the thrills. And you realize that this film brings nothing original to the table.<br/><br/>The characters are cardboard. A loser mother pretending that she had given up her career for her daughter. A ballet company director whose single function is an endless telling the ballerina to ""let loose"", and promoting that agenda by putting his hand between her legs. And a ballerina supposed to have no friends, no social contacts at all actually besides her mother and jealous colleagues. This is indeed black and white, lacking depth, nuances or even just realism.<br/><br/>It gets worse though. Better films in this arena decidedly blur the distinction between reality and the disturbed protagonist's fantasy. This film doesn't have that courage though. We're presented with a scene where ballerina peels off the skin of her finger, then a film cut, then the finger is intact. And from that moment on we know that, whatever weird is going to happen, it's happening in her mind.<br/><br/>Then Portman as a ballet dancer. One could cast Michael Fox as a sumo ringer. And it might work the day before his great fight, when he's looking into the mirror, in a closeup, and asking himself if he's gonna make it once again. But once he's entering the ring there's some likeliness that he'd be failing to convince. The impression Portman is making as a dancer is suffering from the very same problem.<br/><br/>Cheapest of all though is the ending, which can be considered 1940th Hollywood style at best, and a mere cop out by today's standards: the hero(ine) dies with a last sigh, everybody standing around is guilty and none of the conflicts is actually resolved.<br/><br/>Made for the effect. Unoriginal. Lazy. That's the bottom line I'm drawing here."

It involves a girl who has to somehow transform her whiter than white style of dancing in such a way that she can perform as the Black Swan.

"MsMaryE","10","10","19","20 December 2010"," Good vs Evil
","A psychological thriller about a ballet dancer's battle with innocence, the end of guarding that innocence, and rival competition. The director encompasses this three-dimensional trait into one gifted, beautifully poised lady named Nina, played by Natalie Portman, whose solo life is domiciled with her smothering and controlling mother Erica, played by Barbara Hershey. They shared one thing in common, ballet. This tradition from mother to child persist without resistance. Nina soar above her mother's failed career. One shocking look into Erica's grimy face, said washout, disappointment and collapse in ones hope for success. Unfortunately dance wasn't the only continuity, so was schizophrenia. Her inner world was suppressed with demons and dark impulses, a cruse Nina learned to live with but never shared. Her strive toward perfection in her ballet and her diet, clearly steered her toward anorexia. For the sake of the movie title, The director, Darren Aronofsky, chose not to place the spotlight on Nina's beautiful swan like movements but, on Nina's downward spiral descent into deep psychosis.<br/><br/>The white swan is exquisite, sweet, and pure and the black swan dark, mystical, and bewitching. In order to be the Swan Queen, Natalie Portman had to be all of these characters. The artistic dance director, Thomas, played by Vincent Cassel, knows Nina is the white swan and must push her to become the black swan. In order to accomplish this, Thomas suggests she forget about being perfect. Perfection is not about control, you must try to surprise yourself and the audience. This order undoubtedly forces her to unlock the trapped demons into her world, an experience she has so, so dreaded.<br/><br/>The Director's target to give birth to the evil swan was right on point. Natalie skillful acting abilities switching from good to bad-- friendly to hostile and from naive to worldly was just incredible. She laid her emotions out there, haunting us with spontaneous hallucination and phantom sensations. Our vision became blurry with her vision. We could no longer discriminate between real and imagined experiences. This unique concept, To see what a schizophrenic sees, gave insight to her unintentional altered perception. The evil twin, the evil force was pulling her, pulling me.<br/><br/>The music was simply magnificent and speaks for itself, Tchaikovsky's 'The Swan'. The music score enhanced by Clint Mansell, uses the dark tones to keep us in tune with the delusions surrounding her virtual reality of violence. It works extraordinarily well throughout the entire movie. As with many others, Tchaikovsky's music has been part of my memory since attending the symphony during grade school, listening to CDs, and movie scores past and present. The whole musical affair is clearly meant to separate good and evil and believe me it struck the right note.<br/><br/>Black Swan is intriguing and captivating. I promise, you will not be disappointed, perhaps a little confused. Hopefully, it will arouse your curiosity to listen to its music or see a real ballet performance or perhaps watch 'The Turning Point' where real ballet dancers such as Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne perform effortlessly. If it does that, and not focus on weight loss or self-destruction, then we all win and can say, ""It was perfect."""

","I consider myself a sophisticated film-goer who loves indie films, but I was extremely disappointed in this movie and am surprised that it is being taken so seriously (although I know Hollywood considers Darren Aronofsky a genius). It is about women, but not real women. Instead we are presented with a completely male-oriented fantasy: the repressed ice queen vs. the slut, with lesbian sex thrown in to spice it up. And the horror element becomes ridiculous towards the end, like The Exorcist in toe shoes. People in the audience I saw it with laughed. <br/><br/>I also did not care for it artistically: grainy jumpy hand-held camera shots interspersed with lots of camera-in-the-face close ups which usually cut off the top part of people's heads.

It was annoying, and just awful, The director in his usual ham-fisted ""style"" gave us 3 options: It is a disappointing ballet movie, it is part horror and part dance movie and it is a pyscological thriller? It fails completely like all film school-like directors films and is so heavy handed it makes you want to walk out. Ms. Portmans acting consists of 2 expressions grim and crazy grim. The dancing is infantile, with arm waving and spinning around substituting for the real thing. As is true of amateur directors and screen writers, there is NO background given of the lead part, so we have no idea if her actions are real or fiction. It would however make a great film to show film students a showcase film with terrible writing and even worse directing. The dance director is not written skillfully and he is an ass and we have no hint as to why he is the great artist-director of dance, None of the characters are fleshed out as human beings, they are all stock human beings. When one is asked to GUESS what this movie is trying to be, mystery hysterical girl part horror or dream then it is simply not worth wasting your time on."
"MovieManMenzel","9","14","29","19 October 2010"," ""Black Swan"" is a dark and dramatic near perfect masterpiece from director Darren Aronofsky.
","""Black Swan"" tells the story of a dedicated ballerina named Nina (played by Natalie Portman) who life revolves around her becoming New York City's number one ballet dancer. Obsessed with being the best, Nina is offered the lead role in Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel) version of Swan Lake. This role is set to be one of the hardest for Nina as she has to play two roles within one character. The White Swan, which, requires innocence and grace has been mastered by Nina. The Black Swan, however, is the role that is giving her grief. You see the Black Swan is nothing like Nina and so begins her struggle to obtain greatness by learning how to enter into this darker character. It's only a matter of time before Lily (Mila Kunis) arrives who proves she has what it takes to play the infamous Black Swan. Its now up to Nina to learn from Lily how to unleash her dark side within the role or forever live life as a failure in the ballet world.<br/><br/>What the hell was that? Was all I could say when the credits began to roll at the end of ""Black Swan."" One thing I knew for sure was that it was a dark and brilliant piece of cinema. Sure, I was uncertain by what I just witnessed on screen for the past two hours but that was sort of the point. This movie was made to leave its audience feeling uneasy and it does it well. This movie ends on a note that lets you know the movie is over and doesn't leave the audience hanging. The film however, leaves you wanting to discuss it right away once it ends.""Black Swan"" is a dark and psychological piece of cinema and truly makes you think throughout the entire film. While the subject matter of ballet may not intrigue many, it's how the film plays out that truly makes it worth wild. Its a dark and deep piece of cinema, filled with a few chills and thrills along the way. You will definitively leave the theater with plenty to say after viewing the film. You will probably begin to argue with others about what exactly the outcome of the film was as it was very open to interpretation.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is absolutely terrific in this film. I am so used to her playing characters, where she is so independent and strong willed. As Nina, Portman plays a scared character who is afraid to reach outside her comfort zone. She is straight laced and as innocent as they come. She is obsessed and truly dedicated with all things dance. This is a truly haunting performance by Portman, one that deserves an award..Portman's character is not likable in the film as she is a very dark and unlikable character. Her personality is obsolete in most of the film. This is one of those roles that truly show off a good actress from a bad one. Portman pulled it off with such ease. As for the other supporting roles, they were great as well. Kunis in particular played a role unlike anything she has played before. A wild sex cat so to speak with ties to all things seedy. She was perfect for the role and truly offset the timid and innocent character that Nina was. Vincent Cassel, was perfect as the hard ass ballet teacher who truly used and abused his students. He was truly incredible. Winona Ryder was great as well in her minor role. She was a very dark character as well who truly showed how living a life as the ""Black Swan"" was a truly horrific lifestyle to live. She was surprisingly raw and real in this film.<br/><br/>I haven't seen much of Darren Aronofsky work and I know as a film lover and critic that is a shame on my behalf. I have had ""The Wrestler"" on Blu Ray since the day it was released but never watched it. I have however, watched his other critically acclaimed film, ""Requiem for a Dream"" which is a dark and depressing piece of cinema. That movie WILL make you depressed if you have not seen it. Its a story of life and the battles people go through. Its not a happy film but a well crafted cinematic masterpiece. With that being said, ""Black Swan"" is probably Aronofsky's new masterpiece. Its well shot, it's interesting, its dark, its haunting, it's deep, its creepy, and most importantly it makes you think. Its a film that isn't confusing but rather challenges you (the audience member) to come up with your own conclusion. You will hear a lot about this film in the next few months and I am sure most of it will be positive. Aronofsky is a brilliant filmmaker and that goes without saying. His vision as a filmmaker is truly one of the kind even if he is too humble to ever admit that.<br/><br/>When Oscar season rolls around come January, you will be certain to see ""Black Swan"" up there with ""Social Network"" as one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year. It will be nominated in several categories including Best Picture, Director, and Best Actress. Portman shines in the film and delivers a haunting and one of a kind performance. Aronofsky makes a film that truly leaves an audience talking and wanting more when it ends. It is a near perfect masterpiece hands down and may not be for everyone but lovers of film will truly appreciate the brilliant piece of film making ""Black Swan"" is.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Black Swan"" is a solid 9 out of 10. One of the darkest and well acted films of the year!"

It does not persuade to go and watch ballet, or try to perceive Swan Lake better. Nay, in fact, thyme filmmakers killed any hint of interest to this. This boggy plodding mess is not a decent take on mental disease, either. It does not provide any deep picture or awake any sympathy to any of the heroes. In fact, it is so cold, detached, distanced and bleak that all the possible attempt to like ballet will die immediately. Waste of time, and all the parts are very weak too - neither Portman, nor Kassel, Ryder, Kunis or else did anything to get us involved. It is so vapid and dry that next idea would be to get and watch some light-weight comedy or something"

Natalie Portman over acts the part of a whiny, weak, sissy girl for the majority of the film, and might have a nice transformation into the black swan, but who knows with all the special, musical, and editing effects added to that part. Has an unresolved ending. Of course you can expect it's one of those fight club twists, but we never know just how much of it was reality and how much was in her head. Either way I don't think the director cared much, as it seemed like the film was just an excuse to see some grab assing and lesbian scenes. Really just a waste of time.

Can it really be possible that someone this insular ever went to an audition, let alone performed in front of an audience in any capacity? I cannot think so. There are many nice moments in this film, like the scenes with Winowna Ryder in them, and I have no complaints about the acting, yet why make a psychological thriller about a character with no psychology to speak of? I found it impossible to care about this insufferable twit of a woman. It seems to me that Aaronovsy's histrionic characters, like the dancer/ wrestler/ drug addict/ maths genius who goes out in a blaze of glory, are merely there to compensate for an inability to tell a story well enough to keep us interested."

BS (as I will appropriately abbreviate) was overblown, over-hyped, poorly scripted and reliant on a constant bang-bang-bang of clichés and frenetic camera rushing about (usually just behind the heroine's head). And if I ever see another ""symbolic"" mirror in a film I may throw up - there was hardly a scene without one. One of your other reviewers mentions ""Repulsion"" as a reference point, which got me as well, and just showed how much that particular film succeeded by understatement. I really don't understand why this film is seen as a shoo-in for multiple Oscars - Natalie Portman acts well enough and Vincent Cassel manages to be Anton Walbrook from the ""Red Shoes"" up to a point, but the film otherwise relies totally on cliché and isn't even as well directed as some auteurist reviewers seem to think. By the end I really didn't care whether Natalie was hallucinating or the events were actually happening - the film would not have suffered any more either way. If the Oscar selectors are mainly prurient teenagers looking for an undemanding mixture of dull sex and ersatz culture (even Tchaikowsky is played too loudly!) this year, then this film will indeed win a few."

","I finally got to watch ""The black swan"" after hearing good comments about it for months. Once it ended, I came to IMDb to see if I was the only person in the planet who didn't like the movie. Well, it was a relief to see I wasn't alone. But it startled me that this movie is now 73 in the top 250 movies at IMDb! Well, this movie left me cold. Two hours passed watching a cliché ridden story about a crazy ballerina who somehow managed to get the role of Odette/Odille in Swan Lake at a presumably large American Ballet Company. I guess a ballerina slowly going crazy or destroying her personal life in search of perfection in her art is not a bad idea (watch the Red Shoes), but this is not the case of the movie. If I can define this movie, I would pick the lack of one thing: SUBTETLY. Oh well, I would also add CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Two things completely absent in the movie. Everything over here is told/narrated/musicalized/filmed in the worst in your-face way. It's so clear that the girl is crazy from the very beginning that what's the point on going on with her hallucinations? We know perfectly that what we are seeing is her deranged mind. No surprises, no turns here. The end is completely predictable though is utterly unbelievable. The acting? I haven't been impressed by Natalie Portman in other movies and this was no exception. I had seen enough lived and recorded ballet to have an idea how a prima ballerina looks and moves. Though Miss Portman underwent a difficult training for several months, it doesn't replace the years of hard training of a true dancer. If the effort on training your body is the best resource you have as an actor to pull the part, instead of facial expression and a thorough investigation of what being a dancer means, then Miss Portman deserves her Oscar. I personally prefer actors that may not be so fit physically but can communicate with their audiences with their eyes, facial expressions or language. I only saw a blank faced one expression Portman through the movie and a few shots of her arms trying to mimic a ballerina's moves. Mr. Cassel fares better with the little he was given to. Winona Ryder is properly over the top as the former prima ballerina dumped by Cassel. Ms. Kunis at least looks sexy and sympathetic in her brief role. Direction and cinematography: I know is hip and artsy to film as a 10 years old with an old camcorder, but don't you have the feeling that this is just becoming a tired way of trying very hard to be original when using such an old story thread as the one used here? I'll watch now The Red Shoes for a movie about ballet. And then I'll watch Psicosis for a thriller. And I'm sure I'll forget ""The black swan"" in a couple of days. It wasn't even interesting enough as to enter in my list of movies that other people love and that I love to hate."

","I don't often use the word 'perfect' but this movie is perfect, Aronofsky is a genius and Portman the greatest actress born in my decade  It's been an eternity since I haven't lived such a unique experience  proving that cinema still means something, as it can inject such emotions in your skin you feel like living inside the character, which was the message: you don't play someone, this is a myth, a lie, you have to embody the character, to live him, to feel it deeply in your skin, your soul. Even the simple use of 'watcher' to describe my position is an absurd understatement.<br/><br/>Whoever 'watched' this film, missed it, or was probably so disturbed by the images of skin scratching, bleeding, self-destruction to understand that these were NOT the expression of Aronofsky's sadistic tendency to betray our visions with indelicate pictures, not expected from a gracious dance-themed movie, but were meant to enlighten our minds that perfection is self-destruction, annihilation of a destructive duality for a total soul dedication to the purpose to our inner 'Black Swan', this something that no one, not our friends, not our parents, can extract from us, and only we have the power to achieve the dream or destroy it. We are our own ally or worse, our own enemy; to get rid of this psychic duality is the key for salvation. And if self-destruction is salvation, it's still better than insignificant normality.<br/><br/>The intelligence of ""Fight Club"", the upsetting graphicness of ""The Wrestler"" with a kind of Bergmanian grace inhabiting the philosophy of the film, were carried by one of the greatest female performances I've ever watched. No, I didn't even watch Portman, I was Portman, I was this fragile little woman struggling to beat her inner demons and become the ""Black Swan"", I was her when she was losing her balance while carried by that bastard who didn't realize he was holding the purest incarnation of the most famous ballet character ever. I was her, when she fell, I felt the pain, I couldn't even watch the audience, her face while crying behind the curtain was like a mirror. Never had a movie made me feel like a character in such an empathic way, forget gangsters, forget tormented anti-heroes, Nina Sayers is the greatest cinematic creation of the last 10 or 15 years.<br/><br/>How to put it? I have no music, no sound to emit, I have no grace, no movements, words seem so futile to describe a movie showing how the best medium of human soul is movements, transported by played or inner music  think about it, even the greatest instrument player owes his virtuosity to repetition, a total time dedication, but the real gift is the one of the composer like Tchaikovski who did the immortal and haunting ""Swan Lake"" music. Artistic talent is virtually nothing when you think about it, inspiration, technicality and repetitions, but creating through written notes or body movements, is another matter, you can repeat the same movements one million times, you won't embody the soul and the spirit of your character until you get your character, and to get is to become him, and to become him is to live him <br/><br/>Nina lives the story of the ""Black Swan"", everybody got the parallel, no need to write a thesis about it  But why did she live like the character? Because she was BORN to play the swan and this privilege was her doom. She lived and perished by the swan, and she became the Black Swan when she got rid of that ounce of fragility that controlled her, that made her so white  and made this dark side communicating aggressively through self-destruction, which was nothing than a destruction from a part of her eager to explode and let the whole passion burst out. Thomas Leroy, magnificently played by Vincent Cassel, looked through the glass and tried to help Nina but only Nina could have made the black swan finally fly.<br/><br/>The images are nightmarishly disturbing, but they are an eloquent illustration of the violence we apply to ourselves, that's how we act, when our quiet part tries to put out the flame of our most burning impulsions, these hidden imperfections that actually best define us  Nina's soul was fragile because it was trying to keep balance between work and talent, when the point was to loosen up, trying to play, to enjoy the dance, to be more like Lily, Mila Kunis in a performance that totally blew me away Lily catalyzes all the fear that govern Nina's actions, being dethroned, being the white swan, hence, half a swan, half of Nina, which is nothing, since the perfect is made of everything  Lily was a danger because she was whitening Nina's darkest soul, like the overprotective mother, Beth, the ex-star, all these characters that made her repeat that pathetic whitening catchphrase : ""I'm so sorry!"", the whiter she was, the more desperate was her situation and I felt it, the fall was her downfall, and the solution a constructive destruction through a spiritual union with that black swan, killing her by becoming her ... but what a rewarding self-destruction, what an intense scene of metaphorical resurrection when Nina became the Swan.<br/><br/>This self-absorption was magnificently illustrated in the most sensual sex scene I've ever seen, the film already had strong sexual connotations but Lily and Nina's scene was the climactic expression of our fascination by the dark side, god why are all the sensuality and pleasures in the devil's side. After all, we're both angels and devils, we're black swan and white swan, we're Nina and Lily  and perfection, is total embodiment, which implies destructive but creative fusion Sara Goldfarb's constructed an image to ultimately destroy herself, Nina Sayers destructed herself to reach perfection, she's dead but immortal, and my haunted cinematic soul will mourn her forever"

I agree with one of the other reviewers that the audience is ""spoon-fed"" the horror and everything is so obvious from the beginning. There's no real psychological challenge or thrill, it was too superficial to be a serious portrayal of someone's descent into madness. In fact it became plain silly at times and the audience in my cinema began to giggle and laugh, which I found myself doing also towards the end.<br/><br/>Artistically it is pleasant enough and the costumes were superb.Despite reviews to the contrary, I don't agree that the actors were the best choice. I think that Natalie Portman is too one dimensional and bland for the part and Barbara Hershey - an odd choice - in a role too big for her. By far Mila Kunis as Lily was the only believable presence who gave an outstanding and authentic performance."

"blanbrn","8","13","27","2 January 2011"," Painful. Visually raw an entertaining psychological thrilling drama. It's very wicked and sexy it proves a profession sacrifices the body and soul.
","I must say ""Black Swan"" is visually stunning in a crazy and raw kind of way, and in the meantime it leaves your heart bleeding with sorrow and pain. One thing is for sure and it's true that many of us can relate to and that is in a profession or line of work it's tough and most of all as this film proves it's a sacrifice to one's body and soul especially if one's going for perfection and clearly the lead character here Nina is trying her best. Director Darren Aronofsky(""The Wrestler"") is one who's known to go over the top as many of his films show the pain and dark side of life and clearly with this mind guessing thriller drama ""Black Swan"" Darren clearly pushed the envelopes to the edges as after viewing you will feel exhausted with satisfaction. Yet despite the accomplishment your heart will feel the pain and sorrow that came from the dark transformations and mind changes that little Nina went thru to obtain grace and face her demons.<br/><br/>Set in New York city young Nina Sayers(done brilliant and emotionally raw by the beautiful Natlie Portman)is a hard working and up and coming ballet dancer. Nina is working her butt off to impress as she has to stay busy training when she receives constant stress and high expectation thoughts of success from her lonely ex ballet dancing mother Erica(Barbara Hershey). Then a window of opportunity opens up as in the cutthroat business of dance a former lead dancer Beth(Winona Ryder)is let go. Now it's Nina's turn for the lead role in the production of ""Swan Lake"". Nina is ideal for the role of the white swan, yet from the get go she feels dogged and stressed by the great deal of pressure that's put upon her by her coach and instructor Thomas Leroy(Vincent Cassel). It's almost like Nina feels like a black swan already.<br/><br/>To complicate matters in what is really the most wicked and psychologically engaging and highly entertaining parts of the film is the work of Lily(Mila Kunis in such a raw erotic wicked performance) who is Nina's rival dance performer and Lily's the ideal part for the Black Swan. Only a tricky and cruel plan is in the works Lily will take Nina on a mind numbing wind journey of total transformation in my opinion and this will put Nina more in the form of an actual Black Swan! The performance from Mila was so great as her character Lily who's such a free spirit really rocks the boat as having Nina to come out of her shell and engage in hot lesbian love making just makes for some sweet eye candy especially seeing Kunis in a sexy black bra. Aside from that Nina feels overthrown with pressures from all three as the expectations of Thomas, Erica, and Lily's wicked cutthroat cat and mouse games have Nina on the edge of a mental and nervous breakdown. Interesting seeing how she's even resorted to masturbation to prepare for her lead role as the Swan. As many scenes are visually explicit not just the peeled skin, bumps, bruises, and blood scars but clearly you see in Nina's eyes she's like a possessed woman both mentally and physically as she's grown into the Black Swan literally.<br/><br/>Overall ""Black Swan"" is a film that proves to aim for perfection it's a sacrifice with many struggles both mentally and physically. And even though Aronofsky showed that the goal can be obtained in the end as Nina did, still it comes with great sacrifice and sorrow as really Darren went over the top as his outcome and message will disturb many as clearly Aronofsky proves life can be dark even in the world of dance. Still aside from the sorrow and pain the film brings it's well blended with determination and will power that obtains satisfaction and highly enjoyable seeing one explore some of their wicked ways like Nina did as it's a little fun being wicked and sexy. The performances were top notch from both Portman and Kunis you could really see these two actresses were really inside their roles in fact it was reported that Portman said she felt she was even gonna die in real life on set while doing this role. ""Black Swan"" is well done even though hard to enjoy it shows that life is tough, and that sacrificing in a profession can be wicked, raw, and emotionally disturbing especially when perfection is obtained while the body and mind goes thru a psychological transformation."

","No real spoilers here but just in case I'm checking the box. Possibly a spoiler for a DIFFERENT movie.<br/><br/>I don't know where all these great reviews come from. We have a poor mentally disturbed girl struggling with her sanity while she tries to dance ballet as the white swan (and the black swan).<br/><br/>I am a 58 year old male professional so it's not like this is coming from a 13 year old (who DEFINITELY would not like it!). <br/><br/>She's having mental problems, so what? The excitement and suspense was not there. At least, in movies like Single White Female, someone gets killed with a high heel to the eye! Does anyone get killed with a high heel to they eye in this movie? No! (That's my one plot hole for Single White Female, I don't think it's possible to kill someone with a high heal.. no way it would reach the brain..., but anyway..)<br/><br/>The relationship with her mother - couldn't care less...

Keira has a more dancer type body but there was no dancing in this movie so if you expect that, you will be let down.<br/><br/>Her mother was also over the top in her character portrayal and was more annoying than anything. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time watching this - I regretted losing almost 2 hours of my life to this mess."

"aysx87","5","5","8","28 October 2011"," Over-dramatic and cliché
","The cliché aspect of this: this is so diatomic--the first half is the director yelling at the dancer to go from ""virginal white"" to unleash the ""passionate black swan"" which is... really not what I thought Swan Lake is about, but just seems to be made up and stretched to add a dramatic plot. The script is totally lacking--the mother has the worst, most cliché lines--""I gave up my life for you! Sweet girl!"" and the director continues to pound the black-vs-white metaphor. Sexual harassment for advancement and the vengeful aging star also put in appearances here.<br/><br/>It also seems pushing credibility: Portman seems to have an agonized, needy, nervous expression on her face during the entire film, complete with ragged uneven breathing, which is OK in a person-loses-her-mind film but ballet is famous for valuing athleticism & lightness of expression and no one so obviously nervous and unhinged would be let a lead role. For example, in the rehearsal scene where you can see everyone casually and elegantly doing a straightforward degage/fondu combination, Portman looks so nervous the audience expects she's going to bolt or break down at any second, straining credulity that this would go unnoticed by anyone else or that she would be picked for the lead. In many dance scenes [27:20], she performs with a furrow in her brow--is she psychologically tortured or is she confused and trying to remember how to do the combination? In one scene, there's a head shot of her looking nervous and not spotting, paired with a full body shot of her (presumably body double) confidently doing perfect passe turns, which is pretty physically impossible.<br/><br/>The sensuality and club scenes were sexy and made a darker transformation, but again, it's hard to believe that ~suddenly everything is OK. I thought the sex added to the plot as much as the groping and come-ons did--people seem to be extra defensive for some reason. I liked the feathers growing out of skin as a kind of horrifying, shocking moment. I love the way Lily and Nina work together; Nina was not very sympathetic, but Lily was just so full of life and a bit sarcastic; I thought their relationship was great. I did think it was tasteless that Lily had a tattoo of black wings. 1) Can you be any more obvious 2) It seems pretty dumb and career-ending for a ballerina to get a tattoo there. But anyhow.<br/><br/>The way scratches kept coming up were really chilling and it became a bit of a horror movie at the end that did shock me.<br/><br/>Finally, it passed over ballet as a dance form and made it into a cliché: overworked dancer trying to strive for emotion and compete with other catty dancers. There's shockingly few dance scenes here--I'd say 50-75% of them are closeups of Portman's face and a camera wheeling around her shoulders and upper body, which is not dancing. Ballet has gorgeous lines and this movie doesn't really show any of it, which would be disappointing for dancers. It also doesn't accurately portray Swan Lake. More of a dramatic horror movie showing one deranged woman, rather than anything to do with the artistic endeavors of ballet."
"skysaxon","5","5","8","19 March 2011"," Torture
","I suppose it is Aranofsky's artistic temperament, but this movie is torture to watch. The first half hour goes beyond torture. Portman gives a one-note performance that is difficult to watch. A little variety in tone might have made her character a bit more sympathetic. We're supposed to feel for her. Aranofsky's ineptitude ensures we don't. She is a blank slate, filmed upon a black canvas. <br/><br/>The look of the film is that of a rainy day. There is no colour here. Filmed through a bowl of pea soup, the life is drained out of every scene, leaving one robbed of emotional involvement. There is little beauty or elegance. Vincent Cassel, so wonderful in the Mesrine movies, works overtime to pronounce each word, lending to the overreaching artiness of this still life. <br/><br/>I suppose the ugliness of the film, the performances, the cinematography are all intended to alienate and cause discomfort in the audience. People love this movie. I guess some of us have a streak of masochism in us. Some of us don't."
"d_imdb-467","3","28","68","25 October 2010"," one trick cygnet
","I say I have spoilers. There is probably only one thing to spoil as there is only one story: a performer becomes her art and is consumed by it. You can see the pitching. We will bring Swan Lake to the screen by having the protagonist/prima ballerina live out the story of the ballet in her own life. That seems fine but the story is for ballet not film. The film tells you, in case you did not know, what the story of the ballet is. So it takes someone of very limited perception not to work out that the mark on her back is her swan stigmata and she will transform into a swan.<br/><br/>So you know what will happen. Not always a bad thing. Now they have to get you to suspend disbelief and to care about the journey. Nina Sayers is a completely unattractive character so it is hard to care what happens to her. She is annoying and whining. She is unrealistically underdeveloped as a human being - self-pleasure is her departure point for the dark side. None of the other characters have any true depth or identifiable humanity. They are plot devices, stereotypes and ciphers.<br/><br/>The plot developments are unconvincing. You bit me so I will abandon my judgment as to your artistic abilities and make you the Swan Queen. The great lothario of the ballet is won over by a little bite. It just doesn't convince.<br/><br/>The horror parts are a little smorgasbord of frights with no consistent theme. I'm seeing my twin everywhere; I see things in mirrors; pictures are speaking to me. They are generic scary things but none of them have a coherent justification. They are just random symbols of the dark side, shrieky strident counterpoints. They can all be excused as the product of a deranged mind but they don't make for good story telling.<br/><br/>Vincent Cassel was supposed to be seductive. He wasn't. He was pure cheese himself (see the film - or not). Yes Portman's naive ballerina might have bought his cardboard sleazy take on seduction but not her menopausal predecessor(Winona Ryder).<br/><br/>Natalie Portman maintains one facial expression or rather non-expression for most of the film. It all adds up to making her impossible to watch without sighing in boredom. Well the desire to slap her was evoked. Only an actress like Meryl Streep can carry a film where the focus is so much on her face. And sadly most of the focus has to be on her face especially during the dance sequences. To add to the irritation she makes on ooh ooh noise throughout the film. I am not enough of an ornithologist to know if this was a remarkable imitation of a swan in pain and therefore worthy of a feathery Oscar.<br/><br/>And the greatest absurdity is when she develops gooseflesh whilst having lesbian sex. (Oh yes I know it should be swan flesh but turning into a turkey would be just as accurate a description.) I am afraid the association that was in my mind was Jennifer Lopez and turkey time. Maybe Ooh Ooh is the graceful swan version of Gobble Gobble.<br/><br/>Overall it really was a film for Tom and Jerry - the two guys she screws who have never even heard of the ballet. Even Tchaikovsky's score was cheapened when it no longer accompanied ballet but these trite transpositions of the story."

","I rarely stop movies before they're over. Black swan got ejected a little over half way through. I had to make myself watch it that far.<br/><br/>Yes, there will be some spoilers following...<br/><br/>The concept? Awesome... the execution? Lacking.<br/><br/>I understand that dancing is a serious business and that there will be conflicts, accusations of sleeping around to get roles, etc. HOWEVER ... the director seems to be intent on taking the sexual aspect to the extreme and focuses on masturbation and girl on girl oral sex to make a statement. Not sure what statement that is...<br/><br/>The mother was so cliché, there isn't much need to complain about her, but here goes. She is way too overbearing, and obviously wants to live through her daughter. She cages her up and tries to rule all aspects of her life while she (the mother) has no life of her own.<br/><br/>The director is supposed to be some sort of playboy, but he is a)too old and b) too unconvincing. ""Go home and touch yourself, Nina."" Oh, please. He is just saying that so he won't have to sleep with her, even though we are supposed to believe he really wants to. Not saying the man may not like the ladies, but it's painfully obvious he isn't that interested in Nina sexually.<br/><br/>I have no interest in ever finishing Black Swan.<br/><br/>This film has flimsy dialogue, long moments of awkward silence and flat imagery. It could have been brilliant, but what I saw was lackluster and disgusting."
"Steven459","3","8","15","15 February 2011"," Awkward, cliché-ridden cross between a psychological thriller and a horror movie
","There are two reasons I saw this movie: first, I saw Natalie Portman interviewed on Letterman and he heaped such praise on her performance, I thought maybe it really is something special. Secondly, a week or two ago I happened to see Portman on TV in the movie ""Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" and thought she brought soul to a part which on the face of it didn't have much to offer. So I was intrigued to see what she'd be like in a more substantial role.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie doesn't offer one. The script is horribly clichéd (just read the quotes listed above) and the plot is just plain silly. To begin with, we are supposed to believe that a ballet director would risk his entire production on the fact that the technically correct but emotionally frigid Nina (Portman) bites his lip when he tries to kiss her, thus supposedly revealing a hitherto hidden passionate side which she needs to play the role of the Black Swan. You don't have to know anything about the world of ballet (I certainly don't) to perceive the absurdity of this as a plot device.<br/><br/>From there it only gets worse. Nina begins to have hallucinations - or are they? The problem is that it isn't at all clear whether they are hallucinations or whether there's truly something otherworldly going on. Is it a psychological thriller or a horror movie? This question is not resolved until the final reels, but again, the denouement is every bit as silly and unbelievable as the opening plot device - indeed, more so.<br/><br/>This movie appears to be trying to say something profound about the artistic impulse, but the symbolism is at once both crude and barely comprehensible - which is quite an achievement, though hardly a positive one. Perhaps the film's biggest flaw, however, is that it simply fails to engage the emotions. I yawned most of the way through it. Portman has been highly praised for her performance but I found it overwrought - like many other reviewers, I quickly grew tired of her tears and long faces. Hershey is serviceable in her role as an overpossessive mother. But really, there isn't much to recommend here. If you've seen the posters of Portman made up as the Black Swan, you've probably seen the best of this movie already."

"truemythmedia","10","3","4","21 August 2019"," A Masterpiece of Light and Dance
","This film is one of those rare times that the public actually appreciated a true work of art, an inventive story, a brilliant performance, and a story told in a way which only cinema is capable of accomplishing.<br/><br/>It feels weird to call Aronofsky a tortured soul because he is a wealthy director of films and has dated hollywood elites repeatedly. Maybe that is part of being a tortured artist? Nothing can resolve the tension you feel inside.<br/><br/>Certainly this is the through line of his career. ""Pi,"" ""The Wrestler,"" ""The Fountain,"" ""Noah,"" and ""Mother!,"" all carry within them themes of creation and destruction going hand in hand. ""Black Swan"" is similar in this respect but most similar to ""The Fountain,"" and ""Mother!"" in the way it explores this theme.<br/><br/>It is similar to ""The Fountain,"" mainly because of how Aronofsky uses light. Light usually represents life, creation, or artistic expression, not just in Aronofsky but in most filmmaker's work. However, this source of light usually casts a shadow, darkness, and death of some sort. They go hand in hand.<br/><br/>In Aronofsky however, while they still go hand in hand, often times it is the darkness which spawns the light. In ""Black Swan,"" This dynamic is shown in that for all her perfection and poise, Nina, played by Natalie Portman (Garden State, Annihilation) who was awarded Best Actress for her role, is uninspiring, hollow, and a disappointment to her company's director Thomas Leroy, played by Vincent Cassel, (Eastern Promises, Ocean's 13).<br/><br/>Once she engages with her darker side however, the art flows from her in a whirl of destructive lashing out at her mother, her director, and even the other dancers. In the end, they accept this as her dalliance in the dark has allowed her a brilliant display of beauty previously inaccessible to her. All of this plays out on a dark stage, spotlight desperately trying to keep up.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is similar to ""Mother!"" in the relationship of Nina to her Director and Lily, the young ingenue who seems to both admire and despise her. Here, the death that leads to creation is submission and shame. In order to find the parts of herself that she must tap into and unleash, Nina must accept and even internalize the criticisms she receives, even those she disagrees with. She must allow herself to be consumed in order to give birth to a new Nina, who can be what the old Nina could not.<br/><br/>I know that many may find Aronofsky's way of expressing these things to be too rough, featuring sexual acts may consider taboo and abuse from those in power over her, but for me, I find Aronofsky to be ironically, one of the most redemptive directors working today. His obsession with death turning into life is core to many faiths, and to my own personal beliefs.<br/><br/>In ""Black Swan,"" he has outdone himself, partnering with Natalie Portman to achieve one of the most beautiful portrayals of dance, light, and creativity I have ever seen."

Unfortunately, the questioning of her own talent is going to show at some point. I can't say I enjoyed this movie. I realize that obsession is often a strength with artists, but it can also be all consuming. This film is about as dark as it can be but it puts a stranglehold on the viewers."

The first, 'NOAH' was equally as appalling as this mess. 'Swan' is based on a perverse script by Andres Heinz (and others) who succeed in revolting the viewer with all manner of uninspiring, low grade ideas. No-one comes out of this cesspool without being drenched in these film makers sordid sludge.

It seems like the director attempts to shock us with sex and mental delirium, something that bored me even more. Maybe he thought that taking the somehow worshiped ""lolita"" N.

How pitiful.<br/><br/>He added some nice CGI to it, in order, no doubt, to boost the aesthetics of the movie.

","This movie, for me, failed to live up to the hype it has received. While visually very attractive, with nicely done camera-work and very powerful use of the white and black contrasts, the story was boring and failed to engage. Very early in the movie it becomes evident that Nina is an unreliable narrator cracking under the pressure of ballet. As the movie progresses it focuses on the steady deterioration of Nina's mental state, which is all to predictable as it tries to spook with a combination of paranoia, stalkers and moving reflections. The more unreliable she becomes the less the I feel like watching her hallucinations play out in a seemingly pointless direction culminating in a shock value suicide. This movie could have really explored a lot further into the high level of pressure in professional ballet but instead achieves little as we watch Nina fall to pieces. If not for its very well done visuals I would have given a significantly lower rating."

The only emotion a ballet gives me is boredom and also repulsion as the body as shown in the movie suffers too much. <br/><br/>* psychotic character: I don't like this kind of story because I just don't like losing control for real or with a surrogate screen. <br/><br/>* authoritative parents: mine are like that so it's already enough! <br/><br/>* stupid attitude to have fun: I have never understand why booze, drugs and sex are considered as the ultimate experience as they are either dangerous or premature. <br/><br/>* porn action in mainstream movies: I agree with Nathalie's father being upset at her lesbian scene. The problem isn't that this scene is gratuitous because it was due to happen in regards to the story but it's too much graphic. In other words, I can't tell the difference between how this scene has been directed and a simple porn movie: we have the same kisses, the same moans, the same lickings,  <br/><br/>* modern art: here, black and white are everywhere. It's bleak, sad, depressing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if Natalie was a marvelous pick for a fragile, hardworking and sincere young woman who aspire to realize herself, watching her suffering is just not my definition of a good time."

","Black Swan is brilliantly directed and impeccably acted. But beyond that, I'm not sure how impressed we should be. It uses masterful technique to sell shallow and possibly fallacious insights.<br/><br/>On a dramatic level, the film shows us a feeble, repressed, self-destructive person, who - despite being offered an unimaginable opportunity - spends most of the running time whining, panicking, or blubbering. This may be a valid basis for a story (albeit a dreary one), but it offers very little in the way of novelty or nuance. There are no detours in Nina's character arc. You can fill in the ending of the film after watching the first five minutes.<br/><br/>Black Swan also misrepresents the creative process. The 'obsessive, self-destructive ballerina' is a tired cliché, which didn't ring true in The Red Shoes, and doesn't hold up any better here. Ballet, like any art, is NOT produced by mystically 'losing yourself.' It's created through long hours of intense, tightly-focused and highly-skilled effort. In other words: boring WORK. 'Talent' is 90% perspiration; obsession and psychosis are entirely optional. (And not particularly common.)<br/><br/>Aronofsky does a beautiful job of presenting Nina's inner journey in visual, symbolic terms. But that journey is neither pleasant nor particularly instructive. Nina's failing is ultimately no more than a lack of commitment."

","Natalie Portman performs skilfully and with dedication her part as the lead. The illogical script and gimmicky directing what comes to the centering untrue psychiatric downfall does not do any favors against demotivating and estranging well-versed viewer and as such only serves as an fantasy of the writer and director, diminishing the room to empathize. Aspires for artistic finesse evident with the style, but lacking the creativity, subtlety and thought provoking sensitivity ends up being a touch artsy. This all adds up for the film to fall far short from greatness. Acting and overall crafty cinematographic style helps to rise this above average filmmaking."

","This is seriously a trashy film without any redeeming qualities. It's a perfect example of why Hollywood and movie-making globally needs more women producers, directors, writers and cinematographers.<br/><br/>This movie badly masquerades as high art when it's nothing more than violent porn. It's so vile it's absolutely shocking to see how highly rated it is here on IMDb.<br/><br/>The story is as absurd as a porn plot. The acting is bad except for (surprisingly) Mila Kunis. The cinematography is pathetic and simply makes the viewer more keenly aware that the choreography is bad and the dancing even worse.<br/><br/>It's not Gothic horror.

It's nothing more than the narcissistic violent'male gaze' exploiting, degrading, raping and murdering women.<br/><br/>For dance films, I recommend The Red Shoes, Swing Time, Turning Point, The Band Wagon, Top Hat, 42nd Street, Gold Diggers of 1933, Go Into Your Dance, An American in Paris, Singing in the Rain, Born to Dance, Broadway Melody of 1938, All That Jazz, Strictly Ballroom, Step Up, Cabaret, Dirty Dancing and the documentaries Baryshnikov: The Dancer and the Dance & Mad Hot Ballroom."

"i_ianchev","10","4","6","18 February 2014"," Extreme artistry
","I'm continuing my journey through my favorite movies of all time with the graceful extremism of ""Black Swan""...<br/><br/>This melodramatic film piece by Darren Aronofsky was such a big inspiration for me back in 2010, that I felt that I need to present it with a special place here. <br/><br/>The role which brought an Oscar to Natalie Portman (well deserved) is passionate and creepy at the same time. The story is loosely based on Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet, but the main focus is on the extremism of the artistic dedication. Only the best examples of artistic expressionism reach to such a point that they loose themselves into the abyss of the eternal applause. And the character of Nina Sayers really does that at the end. Her emotional breakdown transforms into a state of perfection which transcends over ballet into eternal veracity. Her repressed personality and extreme dedication hurl her into the frightening world of temptation and danger. The jealous mother, the unsatisfied director, the tempting competitor - they all play their role in the creation of the wonderful symbiosis of the White and Black swan in Nina. We witness the growth of a confused gentle swan which is aimed at perfection. <br/><br/>Nina truly achieves perfection at the end of the movie, but at the cost losing her sanity and life. Giving everything to the performance, she embraces happily the applause of the world which has made her suffer so greatly before. As a true artist, she crosses the line between reality and fiction with a gentle, but firm ""pas de deux"".<br/><br/>The cinematography, the choreography are truly astonishing contributions to this art piece. And the music - marvelous. Lurking and intoxicating, graceful and majestic - the soundtrack is an essential part of the story. <br/><br/>It is namely the mesmerizing psychological entirety of ""Black Swan"" which makes us gasp at the end of the movie. This embodiment of the artistic life and performance is and will be given as an example of perfect cinematography. A glorious garland which shines through life, death and ultimately over eternity."

","I'm not normally keen on melodramas, and this was definitely one of those... but, to be fair, the ending tied together the more over-the-top moments pretty well. <br/><br/>Ultimately I enjoyed it, but I definitely wouldn't herald it as some kind of masterful psychological drama. The big scenes spin too frequently into hysteria to be effectively chilling, for me. It's hardly subtle, but it does work well if high-camp and grandiosity is what you're after. <br/><br/>What it does do is confirm that Aronofsky is always willing to take risks and do interesting things with the projects he chooses to make. Like the film itself, he's never dull, but he's not always classy, either. At least he can't be easily pigeonholed (beyond his consistent work in the independent sector, that is)"

In that case you could see a lot of special effect, well done effect and knowledge of CGI animation and after production rendering and processing, and after all, well chosen actors. ""Normal"" movie, let's call him like that, will be the movie where producer spent let's say a 100 thousand. But acting is ""low profile"" so natural, so close to us, normal folks. I can clearly say, I haven't see normal movie for a while, where actors don't use film language, but normal,street, house, school, or just a simple conversation speech. Is there such a movie? I don't know why this movie is made at all? Acting is fine, scene too, story is fine, but after all, i felt some emptiness. Something was missing. This time,and in future especially, will be only movie like good action, drama,comedy and SF. All other type of movie will die, for sure.

","Black Swan's release was painful. I had looked forward to seeing it for months and bang, I had to drive 50 miles to see it. Upon reflection Portman's performance may be among the best of all time. I have seen thousands of films, taught theater and film making for years, and the arch of her performance is unmatched in my memory. She appears as a child, fragile and weak. She appears as an artist at the apex of her career. She is cold. She is sensual. She is fearless. She is terrified. I can think of no actor who has achieved such range.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is an almost great director and achieves more in this effort than he has in the past. The telling and revealing of this story has so many complexities and layers, the film is a great achievement.<br/><br/>But the claustrophobia of the sets, the relentless close shots reminded me of something. The visual literacy was borrowed from somewhere. I had seen these image structures before. I knew this visual language.<br/><br/>I it hit me. Bergman. When I got home I went back to study Bergman's middle period. Persona and Trough a Glass Darkly have great similarities to Black Swan, especially Persona. Aronofsky's visual images are richer compared with the sparse Swede's but the images are consistent. This is not meant to diminish Black Swan in any way. It just seems that I have not seen any reference to this homily and tribute to Bergman in print."
"scbt","10","10","20","4 November 2010"," Black Swan: The Beauty of Aronofsky's Reminiscence of Gothic Fiction and Dario Argento's Suspiria
","Tonight I attended the opening night of the Virginia Film Festival and got the chance to see a premiere showing of the highly anticipated film by Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan. The film tells the tale of Nina a professional ballerina, played by Natalie Portman, who is extremely hard working in order to attain the lead role of her ballet company's production of Swan Lake. The director of the production, played by Guy Pierce, is looking to create a new provocative form of the classic ballet by having the same dancer, performing as the Swan Queen, portray both the White Swan and her evil and seductive twin sister, the Black Swan. Nina, who is nothing but perfect for the White Swan, cannot produce the correct form of sensuality and eroticism that her director can accept for the Black Swan. However, with Nina's lacking comes a new comer named Lily, played by Mila Kunis. Lily is a rival character to Nina's goal in that she possesses the sexuality and eroticism that Nina lacks. Throughout the film, tension builds as Nina begins to see unnatural and disturbing visions that make the audience wonder if Lily is out to get her or another jealous character.<br/><br/>This film is all about tension and beauty paired with extremely disturbing images of sex and violence, including self mutilation. Furthermore, the film makes it very difficult to tell whether certain visions are real or simply illusions. What impressed me the most, was the film's subtlety in terms of showing blood. Like John Carpenter's masterpiece, Halloween, Aronofsky plays a similar hand in that Black Swan shows very little to no blood at all. However, even without the gore and bloodshed, this film still had the capability to make the entire audience cringe in pain. For example, one particular scene involved Nina pulling at what looked to be a piece of dangling flesh on her middle finger's cuticle. She pulls and tugs at it, all while we hear the tearing and ripping of flesh. Then for a quick second we see her pull a long piece of torn flesh off of her finger. At moments like these, the audience, myself included, reacted by cringing and hissing in pain. While having mostly subtle images of blood, there are some rather grisly scenes in the film as well. I must say that Darren Aronofsky presented the violence beautifully in a way that seemed very reflexive of Dario Argento's Suspiria.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, along with the violence and disturbing masochism, we also are given extremely sexual scenes and images. This film is extremely sexual in terms of body language, derogatory slurs, and even scenes of sex and masturbation. These scenes were intense, but revealed Nina as becoming more experienced. In the beginning, Portman portrays Nina as a very sweet and innocent character who develops herself into a much darker individual by the end. The story is of Nina's metamorphosis into the one role she has obsessed over for years. Meanwhile, Lily seems to represent one of the sources of Nina's corruption in how they are both complete opposites, and it seems to be Lily's sexuality and attitude that attract Nina. Furthermore, we are given combinations of disturbing imagery with sex in specific scenes of the film. One scene, for example, involved Nina walking in on Lily having sex with what appears to be the director who is suddenly seen as a demonic visage with black wings. This ultimately provides the audience with a fusion of sex along with dark and disturbing imagery.<br/><br/>Overall, I must say, I was extremely impressed with the film. Having seen The Fountain, I have already been a fan of Aronofsky's work, but Black Swan was absolutely the most beautiful, psychological, and disturbing film I have seen since Shutter Island. I feel it is one of the best films of the year, and I couldn't be happier that I got the chance to see it. Natalie Portman was truly exquisite, and this was her best performance ever. I definitely believe that she deserves the Oscar Nomination for Best Actress. She does a beautiful job in presenting a character that the audience can't help but pity and, at times, even fear. Meanwhile, Mila Kunis, whom many know as the voice of Meg on Fox's Family Guy, was also fantastic and also deserves an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Kunis presents Lily as the character the audience can love and hate simultaneously. Furthermore, Winona Ryder also makes a few appearances in the film as a jealous dancer, named Beth, who is forced to retire. She makes a very frightening and stunning return back to the screen in a very impressive way.<br/><br/>I must say, this movie is definitely Aronofsky's masterpiece in that it produces the right amount of chills, thrills, and laughs. The camera work is phenomenal, and the art and set designs are gorgeous. Meanwhile, the artistry of the imagery of the film seems to beautifully reflect moments of Gothic literature. One could almost interpret it as a modern retelling of Swan Lake amalgamated with Edgar Allan Poe's ""A Tell-Tale Heart."" The plot is told at a very smooth pace, and by the ending the whole film flows together beautifully. I strongly recommend seeing this film. It's dark, violent, disturbing, sexual, and absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing. It ultimately reveals Aronofsky's artistry at its absolute finest."

","I came to this with high expectations, and about half of the way through the film I started shuffling my feet, shifting, grimacing, and muttering ""sheesh!"" under my breath. The film is about as lacking in nuance as Nina is lacking in sensuality. And heavy handed on the symbolism. The story could have been such a good one! Unfolded with so much subtlety. <br/><br/>A young, virginal girl, uptight and perfectionist, cracks under the strain of performing as prima ballerina in Swan Lake, under the demanding glare of her trainer and the smothering influence of a mother who infantilizes her. That ghastly pink bedroom. She must learn to convey the sensuality and evil of the Black Swan in the ballet as well as the fragility and innocence of the White Swan, into which she has been turned (through a curse) in both legend and in worldly ambition. She must learn, in effect, what she has never known-- sexual passion, and to this extent the movie was fairly good. Dancing and sex aren't so anxiously associated for no reason.<br/><br/>However, it wasn't clear to me why choreographer chose this brittle virgin for the part, taking an enormous risk in an enormous spotlight when it was clear that she wasn't up to her sensual counterpart, that she was increasingly unstable, and I got tired of the constant rehearsals where this was pointed out. SPOILER: the moment we've been waiting for is magnificent, and magnificently portrayed by.... / / / / a metamorphosis on stage where she literally turns into a great black bird: the itching she feels and the scratches she tries to cover up are in fact the passionate nature she represses. But the filmmaker insisted on bludgeoning us with horror-film clichés and violence ad nauseam (literally... we see her vomit three times, suffer hallucinations where she is ripping her skin off, stabbing someone with a shard of glass, watching while a former ballerina gouges her face with a nail file, etc. etc.). The horror genre has already been there done that with the clichés about the distortions in the mirror, the blood in the bathroom sink, the startling appearance of a reflection or worse. None of this needed to be so over the top or so derivative. The mother and the cruel fellow dancers was enough. I prefer magic realism to horror. It's an entirely different approach to film, and it was done to so much better effect in The Fountain. Best Picture? HARDLY!!"

","As an Arafonsky fan.. OK, it isn't that hard to be a fan as he has only a handful of excellent films to his credit.<br/><br/>He is probably in the part of his career where he has to match personal projects (The Fountain) with money making stuff. Portman is probably at a similar place, and that maybe the best way to understand why this film was made. And the assembled cast is excellent on paper.<br/><br/>The Black Swan falls down rather quickly. The depiction of the claustrophobic Jewish princess and mother starts well but departs usefulness rapidly. And between the clichés (dark reflections in subway etc) there are three part performances (her mum, director and rival) that don't quite mature. But that's because she is mad, and we need to see two sides to everyone at once. Because she's mad. Yeah? No. The camera is on Portman a lot, and that may be the problem. She is not allowed to evolve fully one way or another, and when she does change it is rushed.<br/><br/>This film seems to be a backward move from Requim for a Dream, where we got to see vibrant threads of collapsing lives. With Nina, we just don't get a valid journey. Which leaves the film on a certain river."
"JaysonT","5","7","13","12 January 2011"," Natalie Portman Can't Save this Dying Swan
","""Black Swan""is a dark look at the world of ballet, but its only giving us a surface of what makes it so biting. Natalie Portman delivers an outstanding performance, but because we can't really relate to her or understand her motives, it just looks like a really great piece of chocolate that's too bitter to enjoy.<br/><br/>Portman is Nina, a hyper-sensitive, vulnerable beauty that lives with her mother in New York in quite a nice pad for a single parent. There's evidence that she cuts herself and is a perfectionist, and the first time we see her dance she's punishing her poise and acting like the world is about to demolish. Over-dramatic? Of course all artists are like this, but in Nina's case she seems to be twirling in her own universe. She wants the role of the Snow Queen, the lead role in the premiere ballet of a French Director whose so positively sleazy his accent justifies his predictable actions. She confronts him in his office about getting the role, and when he tries to seduce her she bites him. 10 minutes later she finds out she has landed the role. Is the director intoxicated by her hard to get actions? Or is she just that great? Nina is a great dancer, but technique- as he points out- isn't everything. She needs to lose herself in the role of the White Swan & later the darker Black Swan. She seems to be able to play the White Swan fine. After all, the White Swan is delicate and refrained. But the Black Swan is elaborate, sultry and relaxed. Nothing that Nina is used to. This whole White Swan/Black Swan ordeal would work if we understood what makes Nina so uptight and scared when she dances? Its as if she performing for Hitler every time. I would have understood this fear more if it escalated as the rehearsals progressed. But instead, she remains psychotic from day one. It's like Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"": We knew he was a nut the moment he entered the Overlook Hotel. No need to be shocked he later tried to murder his family. Nina is a mess from the start, and so she ends the same way.<br/><br/>The other problem with ""Black Swan"" is the confusion of reality. What's real and what's a hallucination? Nina meets a girl named Lily who resembles her quite a bit and also is more vivacious and forward. This tips Nina into thinking Lily is trying to back stab her for the part. Or is she just this innocent sexpot? The movie can't decide and neither can the audience. The cinematography is so jerky that we're inept to think this is all just a mind twist.<br/><br/>Without revealing the ending, I will say its a bit daunting and underwhelming. Nina's final curtain is supposed to be a spectacular emotional moment, but instead we're still looking for clues as to what the hell is wrong with this girl, and what makes her so paranoid? Why is her mother this abstract figure in her life? Why is Lily coming across as a mysterious persona? And does her director just want sex or does he believe in her? There's also the business of Winona Ryder, who plays a brief role of a has-been who tries to warn Nina of the directors ways. After she's hurt in a senseless accident, we never really get a glimpse of her purpose. She's just thrown in for a reason to see a drunk woman say nasty obscenities to the new star.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman luckily kept me intrigued the entire way through. She's extremely beautiful to gaze upon and her dancing is impeccable for a movie star's standards. It's just too bad even her performance can't save this dying swan that's got a lot of potential, but not enough empathy for me to care about the outcome."

","The Black Swan is the type of movie that you are shocked at how it will illicit so many emotions considering you either know the story before hand or within the first 2 minutes of the film. The themes, symbolism, and story are laid out for you and even though you know what's around every turn you can't get out of the way of the basic human notions that are within each and every one of us. A Swan is born into innocence, loses it's innocence along the way, and finds it again only in death. <br/><br/>Miss Portman's character Nina can no more escape her natural progression to become the Black Swan any more than she could escape becoming ,Miss Ryder's character, Beth. Nina's scratching of her skin was the Black Swan trying to escape the prison within. Nina was trapped in a series of motions (as we all are) with Nina's progression to become the exact same as Beth's. Mr. Cassel's character Thomas is the constant. He is God, or the Devil or both in every character's world. Pulling on the strings that make the dancers dance and tugs on the strings of Nina's mind and innocence. Referring to Nina with the same affection reserved for the once great Beth.<br/><br/>There are often comparisons between Nina and Ms. Kunis character, Lily, as Nina being the White Swan and Lily the Black Swan. I think in many ways Lily with her free spirit had an innocence in her deviance, her carefree approach and lust for life was certainly unjaded. She had more difficulty losing the blackness to play the white than Nina did losing the white to play the black. <br/><br/>Mr. Aronofsky likes to remind us of the duality of people. The strength and power of the mind vs it's fragility, as he did in Pi. Black Swan, the Wrestler, and Requiem for a Dream look at life through simple and yet complex glasses with the same frailty and power that take place through self image and desire.<br/><br/>What better conscience is there than one's mother and Ms. Hershey's character is one that played the role well. She had power and became powerless just as one is to nature. Nina must destroy the hand that protects her and keeps her from evolving. <br/><br/>I saw this movie with my wife and we discussed it at length, where she wondered did this scene really happen or did that scene ""really"" happen. ""None of it was relevant yet it was all relevant"", I stated. It is the fact that none of it was inescapable, which goes back to the beginning.

"Barnali_Saha","Null","9","18","20 December 2010"," A Tragic Masterpiece
","Film Review: Black Swan <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan strikes you as a well narrated tragic masterpiece where the protagonist's flaw in character is her child-like innocence. The drama narrates the strange vicissitudes of the life of a young ballerina as she sheds the raiment of mollitude and adorns the evil prowess of a femme-fatale. In a broader sense it is a story of art consuming the artist.<br/><br/>The dream like movement of the plot is well threaded with the wonderful choreography, and Natalie Portman comes out as a sensational queen of both drama and dance. She is perfect; her face a pool of emotions, each sentiment is penciled into her features with deft mastery. <br/><br/>For years the pious Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) has served her term in a New York ballet company mastering her techniques and generally polishing her act, but what she lacks is the acting prowess. The company having suffered an alteration of fate, the director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to rejuvenate the under the weather corporation by recasting the classical Swan Lake. He selects the naïve Nina to play the role of the protagonist, even though he is unsure of her prospects in the portrayal of the black swan, the double of the pious white swan, and this is where the conflict strikes. A clattering windmill of admonitions, cheering ups and even sexual stimulations could not fully unveil darkness in the angelic diva. What Leroy doesn't realize is that Nina is too unpretentious to don the dark attire without hurting herself in the process. She is gullible, she is scared. Under the authority of her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina is a child of subservience lacking heavily in the power to assert herself. But her journey to the realm of darkness begins with the advent of her competitor Lily (Mila Kunis), a sexually deviant female exuding the aura of darkness in every breath. She is a natural ""black swan,"" and Thomas Leroy casts her as Nina's alter in the drama. Feeling thwarted and wronged Nina peels off her suave exterior and displays the characteristics of the dark, primeval self. <br/><br/>The thrilling suspense of the movie grips you from the beginning. The atmosphere of darkness, the cerebral horror, Nina's doppelganger, all predict a grim finale for the narrative. The disturbing scenes of graphic injuries send chills down your spine and you are left with the cardiac organ getting crazy inside your rib-cage. <br/><br/>Black Swan is a perfectly written Gothic novel where each scene is chronologically threaded with the next. Despite the marked ambiguity of certain events, Black Swan comes out as a drama that doesn't require a high gray-matter content to decipher. Of late, several Hollywood pieces (Inception, for example) have used the decipher-it-yourself technique in their works leaving a sizeable portion of audience vying for the correct interpretation of the cinematic riddle, and thereby making them focus their attention on the mathematical calculation rather than on deriving pure pleasure from the motion picture. But appreciation of art is not a forced process; it is natural and spontaneous. Black Swan deftly balances this artistic truth with perfect harmony, and the resultant magnum opus therefore comes out flawless and un-blemished. The subtle movements in the plot, the astounding visual effects and the incommensurable depth in the story leave the audience spell-bound. Never for the moment the plot seems thin or dragged out, never does the director lose his focus. In fact, the entire effort shows so much perfection that I, like many of my co-viewers, sat appreciating the work even after the final credits have rolled. <br/><br/>A review of Black Swan would be incomplete without a paragraph of homage to its protagonist. Natalie Portman has surpassed herself in the role of Nina. She is beyond perfect. She is a cross between an arch-angelic superwoman and a half-baked adult with no sexual experience. Her transmogrification strikes us as the wrath of hell. I still feel the goosebumps on my skin when I recall the miniate-eyes of the black swan. Portman's academic background as a pupil of psychiatry has undoubtedly helped her drink in the tricky role to perfection. She has come a long way from the brat in the Closer; she seems more matured. Her final words go through you like a pair of sharp knives inflicted on an already wounded surface. ""That was perfect,"" she says as volumes of unspoken emotion fill her eyes, and then she empties her lungs; an artist sacrificed at the altar of art. <br/><br/>The supporting cast in the movie balances the spectacular lead performance. Mina Kunis is exquisite as Lily. She too seemed matured and out of the cocoon of Jackie (Kunis's character in ""That 70's show""). She is a woman of great attraction, not the starry eyed teenager in love with unicorns. Barbara Hershey as Nina's imperious parent seems more like the wicked witch holding the pretty princess captive rather than a mother-cum-career-coach of her ballerina daughter. Winona Ryder as Beth also deserves a round of applause. Despite appearing in only a handful of scenes, her presence is vital in the drama.<br/><br/>The chiaroscuro like cinematography is breathtaking, and so are the editing and sound effects. The director Darren Aronofsky plies with the audience's expectation and unfolds before their eyes a drama of a lifetime. This epic tale of innocence killed at the hand of its vicious replicate is one of the best cinematographic renderings in 2010. After Christopher Nolan's Inception, Black Swan comes out as the second biggest hit of the year."

","This is a movie that will be recognized as one of the year's best, was it for the script, the directing, or the performance of the cast (special mention for Portman, and Cassel and Kunis are pretty good too). Nina is a girl who, due to the strict education her mother gave her, ended up repressing a part of her personality which could only reveal itself through light psychosomatic symptoms. Her dedication and love for ballet and a life-time chance to perform a piece she adores (Swan Lake) lead her to confront her repressed side and finally meet perfection... and freedom, just like the swan in the ballet. Aronofsky gave a specific attention to visual and sound effects, which are amazing. This is no action or sci-fi movie, yet watching a ballet dancer perform becomes a mind blowing spectacle. I'll add that I was delighted to find again in this movie the nightmarish visions/schizophrenic delusions typical of Aronofsky's work!"
"Red_Identity","Null","10","21","19 December 2010"," Nightmarish, horrifying, and ultimately Spectacular!
","I had recently gathered interest in seeing Black Swan because the reviews made it out to be very original and bizarre, and that combination is something I always look for. Turns out the reviews were right.<br/><br/>I have only seen two other films by Darren Aronofsky- The Fountain and The Wrestler. While The Fountain was a good film, it was heavily flawed but it did try something unique and was a visual experience. The Wrestler was the complete opposite. It turned out to be a better film than The Fountain but it had a much more conventional storyline with great characters and his direction was very simple and realistic. Here, we have a film that combines elements of both those films. <br/><br/>Black Swan is very much as much of a horror film as the genre tends to look for. Actually, it is much more horrifying than I would expect all of the award groups to be noticing, which is why I am surprised by the awards it has garnered. It is a film of mystifying beauty. If you are looking for subtle direction and writing, look elsewhere. Aronofsky thrives on the over-the-top theatrical style with loud, classical music. He gives the film a nightmarish feeling of mystery and dread while still focusing on Nina. Natalie Portman goes all out in this one, creating a character who seems like much of what we have seen before but whose dedication to the project might be her flaw. I do not want to give much away, so I will stop there. I am surprised by how far Mila Kunis has come, the girl from That 70s Show. Her role is small, but I cannot imagine anyone else in the role and am glad Aronofsky took a risk with her. <br/><br/>Black Swan is certainly not a film for everyone, and let's appreciate it even more for that. It is certainly Aronofsky's only near-masterpiece thus far (and by near I mean that it is a hard film to truly grasp on first viewing, so more viewings are in store). Also that ending is masterful and compares with The Wrestler in that respect."

","It is one film of the year where I walk out of the theater and went, Hmm, nice! Well, that doesn't mean it's better than some other films I saw this year, but this is an impressive. Black Swan offers plenty of drama, plenty of thrilling moments, and plenty of sexiness. With a thrilling and perplexed performance by Natalie Portman, and stylish directing from Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan can go far. The story is more complicated than you think it is. It is not just about a ballet dancer, it is about a ballet dancer with deep mental issues. Nina is professional ballet dancer who got promoted to play the key role in a ballet performance, the Swan Queen. With a lot of pressure on her, the story proposes that she is obviously hallucinating about her body being deform. At first, I thought all of this was real because Natalie Portman is so believable. But as the story developed, I know for a fact that this girl has some serious mental issues. A summary about the film really doesn't do it justice, go watch it and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Black Swan demonstrates how ballet is as exciting and thrilling as an action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. Natalie Portman might even win the Best Actress Oscar, that is if she beat Annette Bening (but she already locked herself an Oscar nod). Darren Aronofsky will probably snatch the Best Director nod, but Black Swan will definitely have a chance at the Best Picture run."
"ethan-oser","10","10","21","12 December 2010"," Black Swan: Not Just For Ballerinas
","Black Swan is just another example of burgeoning director, Darren Aronofsky, flexing his muscles to prove that he is the king of getting in to the eager viewer's head and sending them on an experience that transcends the screen.<br/><br/>Black Swan tells the story of the dedicated ballerina, Nina Sayer (Natalie Portman), as she is given the lead role in an avant-garde version of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. In Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel), the ballet's director, version of the classic ballet the role of the Swan Queen is divided in to two parts, the White Swan and the Black Swan, that are to be played by the same ballerina.<br/><br/>In the eyes of Thomas, Nina is the perfect candidate for the White Swan. She is sweet, innocent, and unexposed to the world of temptations around her. Where her skill and devotion to the art of ballet do not help her is in the case of the Black Swan. Thomas makes aggressive sexual passes at Nina, kissing her against her will and telling her to touch herself just to see how being bad feels are simply the beginning of his attempts to prepare her for a part that requires charged passion above ability.<br/><br/>Slowly, as Nina becomes more engrossed in her attempts to become the ideal candidate for the part of the Swan Queen, she loses her mind. Between her over-bearing ex-ballerina of a mother (Barbara Hershey) and the other dancer vying for her position (or is she?), Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina is thrown in a world much darker than the role requires.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is based in its ability to get at the viewer. The idea of who is the ""good guy"" and who is the ""bad guy"" is constantly being challenged and blurred until the lines are indistinguishable by those both in the movie and those watching from afar.<br/><br/>The film brilliantly mimics what Thomas is trying to accomplish in the ballet itself. Rather than the parts being clear-cut and easy to see, it requires a sharper eye to realize who is playing a certain role at any given moment. Basically, guessing and anticipating is the name of the game and the only way to play is to stay pinned to the back of your seat with every passing moment.<br/><br/>After having seen this film I am only inclined to see it again and again. I do not have beyond a shade of doubt that every time I see it I will experience something new as a result of its depth and brilliance of story telling.<br/><br/>The last Big Five (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, and Best Screenplay) winner at the Oscars was the Silence of the Lambs in 1992.

","Firstly let's dispel the myth that this is sexually explicit. It's explicit only in the sense that badly feigned sex in which nobody gets naked is explicit. Sure there's lots of pretend eroticism and that's the irony - the main character is supposed to let go of her inhibitions and she never can, just like the film. Even if the sex had been more explicit it would still have been a case of more is less. Everyone who thinks this film is good should go and watch ""The Red Shoes"" a film made over 60 years ago which shows the real eroticism and danger of the obsessional nature of dance. It is much less direct than Black Swan and a hundred times more effective."

","Seen as a companion piece to director Darren Aronofsky's critical hit The Wrestler, Black Swan is his love-letter to the operatic world of ballet. Similar to The Wrestler, this is a psychological study of a loyal servant to a chosen profession, who are pushed to the limits both physically and psychologically by the pressures of being good and relevant to their craft. Black Swan throws in a bit of mind-f*****g and horror for good measure too.<br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman) is a gifted dancer who is reaching the make-or- break stage in her career. Always being pushed and encouraged by her mollycoddling mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), she hears about a new production of the Swan Lake to be directed by Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), which requires one actress to play a dual role of both the White Swan and the Black Swan. Nina is an ideal choice for the role of the virginal, elegant White Swan, but Leroy has doubts over her ability to let go and become the darker, seductive Black Swan, a role that would be ideal for newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis). After a talk in Leroy's office, Nina reacts badly to Leroy's advance and he becomes exhilarated when he catches a brief glimpse of what she could be capable of. And, when the casting is announced, Nina is awestruck when she lands the lead role.<br/><br/>The second act sees Nina engage on a mission to become the Black Swan, and this is when things get stranger. Doppelganger's, reflections that seem to have a mind of their own, and a dabble in lesbianism start to push Nina towards psychological breaking point. It is unfortunately at this point where the film begins a steady decline, after the highly promising first hour or so. The twists and turns of Nina's ever- declining mental state feature various strange episodes that I felt very familiar with. It had the same predictability as other films focusing on similar issues (Jacob's Ladder, The Machinist) and things rarely come as a surprise. Of course this is a film about the theatrical dramatics of ballet, but it begins to get overwrought and camp, when I feel it would have worked better with the style of the tense, slower-paced first act.<br/><br/>Not to knock the film too much, there is still much to enjoy here. The performances are excellent, namely Portman. She is in practically every scene and is every bit as good as you've most likely heard. Her transformation from the sweet, dedicated Nina of the first half to the desperate, troubled one of the second is wholly convincing, and that is down to Portman's acting ability. The scene in the cubicle when she calls her mother to tell her she got the part perfectly captures Nina's joy mixed with utter disbelief and confusion. She's always been a very good actress, but apart from 2004's Closer, she's never really been given a role she can really chew on. Here she chews with aplomb. Like I stated in a previous post, I would not begrudge her the Oscar if she beats my hopeful Jennifer Lawrence for Winter's Bone.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a very well-made film with amazing scenes of ballet, powerful acting and loose, confrontational camera-work, similar to that of The Wrestler. I just wish Aronofsky had been a bit more original with the horror scenes and offered something genuinely tormenting, similar to what he did with Requiem For A Dream. Probably not for ballet-buffs either, unless you also enjoy scenes of fingernail removal and masturbation.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","I can already see that most reviewers won't agree, but: this movie is overrated in my opinion.<br/><br/>I will just briefly say: the actors are really good, so is the camera and artwork and yes, the characters do represent some interesting psychologic constellations.<br/><br/>But overall nothing about it seems brilliant (except perhaps for camera and artwork, which create a very tense atmosphere): the characters portrayed, a girl who cannot realize an own sexual identity and has to pay for preventing her mothers career by being born; a mother who has given up on life since she failed to become a ballerina and now makes her daughter suffer for her loss while at the same time, lives through her and forces the daughter to live her mother's lost dream. All of this has been portrayed before and much better. There is no ""beyond"" this in the movie, the rest is exploration of the scenario with endless ""thrills for entertainment"". Neither does the lucid nightmare portray ballet, nor the music, nor the characters in a credible way. One can accept the hallucinative horror episodes as some surrealistic form of storytelling, but the very bold symbolism they incorporate makes it just less credible and nowhere deeper.<br/><br/>Afterall the movie works somewhat similar as any teeny slasher: shocks for entertainment."
"cultfilmfan","5","6","11","23 January 2011"," Black Swan
","Black Swan is about a young woman named Nina, who is auditioning for a new version of the classic ballet Swan Lake. Nina really wants the lead role in this part and she gets a lot of pressure from her mother Erica, at home as well as her strict and no nonsense teacher named Thomas. As Nina continues to practice and work herself to the brink of exhaustion to get this part, we soon start to see changes in her. When we first meet her she seems quite kind and gentle and in a lot of ways let's people push her over, but soon her friendly and forgiving attitude starts to go and we see Nina's personality change before our eyes as she grows increasingly more paranoid and eventually experiences, or drives herself to some kind of madness because of all this. I really wanted to like Black Swan. When it came out I could not wait to see it, but unfortunately I could have waited and it may have been best if I had never seen the film at all because I did not like it one bit. Basically, I felt the storyline of the film and just the overall look, feel and style of the film were all copied off of older Roman Polanski directed thrillers such as Repulsion and The Tenant. Having seen both Repulsion and The Tenant quite a few times, it was very easy to see where this film borrows (or should I say copies) from both of those two films with the story, certain aspects of what happen in the story and the style and direction as well. The film just did not feel fresh, or original. Instead it just felt like it was recycling these other two movies with only a handful of new footage that the writers came up with themselves thrown in. Basically this is a very ugly looking film and it was kind of awkward to sit through. As time passes during the film, events and situations get so bizarre that they are no longer fascinating, but instead over the top and ridiculous. Although, I never laughed out loud during this film, several people in the audience I was with did and I have to say that I could not blame there. There is not a moment of intentional comedy in the film, but because everything seems so forced, overly melodramatic and at times foolishly ridiculous, at times you can not help, but laugh by the mess of the whole film. Even the acting that is really getting praised I am still not sure what I thought about. Natalie Portman, who plays Nina and won a Golden Globe award for it last weekend does deliver a lot to the role because it seems like a really exhausting and physically demanding role and to learn ballet to play the part is also quite impressive. I wouldn't say it was a terrible performance, it's just that it never won me over in the sense that I really cared for Nina, or for the outcome of the film. I think if the film had been handled better and gone in a different direction, I probably would have felt differently. Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother was just campy, over the top and melodramatic acting that I did not care for at all, but out of all the performances I would have to say the two strongest, or at least the ones that I found worked were Vincent Cassel as Thomas and Mila Kunis as a rival dancer named Lily. They were able to do their parts without over acting them and by still bringing some intrigue and fascination to these characters. I think if Black Swan had been written and directed using original ideas and an original way of filming it, instead of copying Polanski films and using all the old horror clichés and tricks around, then with the talent involved, it could have been a really good film, but as it is it is uneven and I go as far as to say it is a mess in just about every way and one of the worst films of 2010. Oddly enough the film is being praised by a lot of critics and up for some major awards, which I just do not get at all. Maybe, I missed the point of this film, or perhaps the other critics did. After watching this film I do not care who is right, I just do not want to sit through this film again."

","This is possibly the best movie I have seen for a long, long time. It was next to flawless. I hated it. The direction is incredible, with camera angles, scene usage and lighting being used to their utmost. Portman's acting is the most Oscar worthy I think I have ever seen. I will never look at her the same again. So, why did I hate it? Because it was too good at what it intended to do - to show you the mind of a deeply psychologically disturbed person. The combination of acting and direction made me feel as if I was undergoing all of her fears, rather than just watching them on the screen. At the beginning you want to protect Portman, and feel terrible at the isolated world of bitchiness and exploitation that she is in - a world too intense and demanding for someone as delicate as her. This is perhaps the brilliance of casting Portman for this role. She is naturally a very delicate person, whose beauty owes to the innocence of her looks. This is an innocence which, as a man raised to be a gentleman, I feel obliged to protect. But in pretty much every single scene in the entire movie, her innocence is being tested, exploited, broken down and abused. By the end you are terrified of her and what she has become. There is not one single moment in the movie that did not have me wincing and tensing, and once the movie was finished it took a long time for me to relax. Had the acting and directing been less than brilliant I think I could have shrugged it off a bit more easily.

"pachuta_lucas","8","9","19","18 December 2010"," Psycho, Sexual thriller is what it is!!!
","This is movie portrays what is said about itself ""Wicked Psycho Sexual Thriller"". This movie follows a Ballet dancer named Nina. Her mind and body is devoted to dancing and to perfecting everything about her dancing. Through out the movie she is constantly competing against her sanity. Along with her sanity on line she is beginning to feel she is losing her part in the production of Swan lake, to a dance sister named Lily. If it wasn't enough pressure on Nina to have to deal with her sanity, that could soon be gone, and losing her role in the play, she goes home to a unstable mom. Her mom is lost in her own failure as a dancer and can not accept the fact she never made it. Nina's mom blames it on her that she never made it has a dancer. She wants her to succeed so bad that she pushes Nina to hard. <br/><br/>The Relationship between Nina and Lily in this movie is extremely intense, passionate, provocative and mentally thrilling. Lily seems to take advantage of Nina's situation and send Nina done an even darker path of her own destruction. Lily please a creepy and sexual character, yet at times she is just a regular friendly girl that does nothing wrong. Nina in this situation starts to blame her problems and struggles on Lily and that Lily is trying to get her out of the show and take her place as the lead ballet dancer dong the White and Black Swan.<br/><br/>Nina is trying to make sure she can keep it together. She is constantly being told to let go by her director, but she is so obsessed with making everything absolutely perfect she can't let go. Nina's life is now on the line because she is going insane over the need she has to make her dancing perfect. <br/><br/>This movie was a great film and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Darren Aronofsky's movies. This movie, I believe was not as good as Requiem For a Dream because I didn't feel there was enough story and enough character information given. Like why did Nina pick to fear Lily from the beginning what reasoning did she have for Lily? Why did Lily come to this place to dance what did she do prior to dancing at this studio? A little more information about what the mom went through when Nina was growing up? If there was a little more depth to the characters i think the movie would easily be a 10/10 but i am giving it a 8.5/10."

","Black Swan can only be described as a complete tour de force. From Aronofsky's intensely dark and layered direction to Portman's incredible, transfixing performance, the film attains perfection in my eyes.<br/><br/>I won't go into plot details in this particular review because it's better the film is best viewed in order to take you by storm rather than me spoil any aspect of it here. I use the phrase ""take you by storm"" for a reason, the film is a breathtaking ordeal conveyed by powerful direction and performances. Portman delivers the most unbelievable performance of 2010 and the rest of the cast is nothing short of amazing. I'm pulling for Hershey to be nominated at this year's Oscars in particular. If Portman does not actually win the golden statue this year, it will be one of their greatest disappointments along with Rourke's loss in 2008 and Blanchett's loss in 1997.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful, dark, and emotionally wrenching film. Its reward lies in the fact that it is a consummate masterpiece. I may be using a ton of hyperbole here, but I really do believe this is the best piece of cinema I have ever seen in a theater. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who wishes to observe what cinematic perfection truly is. I'm sure whether you think so or not, after you view it, the idea of perfection will undoubtedly linger in your mind long after you see it. ;)"
"niagass","10","9","19","19 October 2010"," A Masterpiece
","The obvious themes that Aronofsky's Oscar nominated ""The Wrestler"" has in common with ""Black Swan"" are self-destructive, narcissistic athletes as its lead characters. This is reflected through multiple hand-held, unfiltered camera shots; but the similarities don't end there. The two stories paralleled themes flow through this story effortlessly. The only difference I noted is whereas ""The Wrestler"" has a genuine smaller indie flick feel, ""Black Swan"" presents in the manner of magnificent old style movie thriller. From the very first scene there is a distinct sense of menace circling the story from the very start that grabs and pulls you in. As you are experiencing the innocence pouring out of Nina (Natalie Portman), dressed in pristine white shrugs and scarves and baby pink coat, you feel there's something else in store. You are afraid of seeing something extremely disturbing.<br/><br/>The film explores multiple themes. One theme shows that perfection is an impossible and in some cases a destructive state of being, where we can be our own worst enemy. The opposite sides of black and white in terms of Nina being very controlled and impulsive verses the character she is charged to embodies her role as the Swan Queen.<br/><br/>This is the story of the Swan Queen from Swan Lake come to life in film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays the narcissistic ballerina to perfection. It's a very demanding role where she appears in every single scene! She was more than believable as a dancer. There is a point with a character such as this where you know it will all come together and this point was when she became the ""Black Queen"". She nailed it and I know because ""Swan Lake"" is my favorite ballet. I have seen this ballet too many times to count. I knew what to look for and I found it Although Natalie is not a professional dancer, her portrayal of one was quite impressive"

","I heard about this movie thru a friend and heard fantastic reviews from her friends. The previews looked like just my type of movie, in fact. My boyfriend and I and some friends went to see this movie last night, and I was highly disturbed and very disappointed. The movie has a huge overload of sexual content that is very explicit and unnecessary. I'm not an ultra-conservative movie-goer but it was almost embarrassing to watch with my boyfriend--to the point that I walked out of the theater halfway through.

","You could say such as: we follow this delusional woman or hard-to-take visit into a woman's not-all-there mind or haunting and most accurate of all films ....on....emotional disorders or this confusion and terror is probably one of the best aspects of the movie or pursued by internal demons but then again these were all said of the 1948's Snake Pit regarded as a classic, ground breaking cinema study of the ravages of mental illness.<br/><br/>Black Swan may will be a 21st century reincarnation of sorts. The title Ballet Pit rings the right bell.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the fact that the Swan was billed as a 'thriller' that found me chuckling aloud during several scenes where thrills were clearly tossed out the door replaced by delusions or were they delusions? I was taken so far into Nina's head that I quickly waved adieu to any semblance of a real tale of suspense & thrills and instead slide, against all my effort, down Nina's rabbit hole into her world where heads are tails and tails are heads.<br/><br/>I missed several of the major thrills as I averted my eyes while others were on the edge of their seats wondering just how far the macro shots of self mutilation would go. Now those were thrills the film delivered.<br/><br/>Although mother Erica is touted as the slave driving, relentless stage mother she is the one who tells Nina that she is pushing herself too hard and needs to cut back, slow down and ease up on her career.<br/><br/>Aside from the delusional.... I found myself shaking my head at these junctions: A ballet director selecting some one he believes is one dimensional and so is not up to the role? Willing to replace the show's star Nina even after she assures him she is fine and ready to work? Casting couch BITE? By the film's finale I was so far down the rabbit hole that Nina could have metamorphosed into real black and white swans and this would have fit the 'norm' of scene after scene where suspense gave way to guesswork of reality versus delusion. At least Jacob's ladder delivered a suspenseful thrill ride before dropping the final scene s reality gotcha moment.<br/><br/>Swan lake screams gotcha ad nauseam but does this in an otherwise perfectly crafted film. For me....time to watch Snake Pit again."
"jdpif208","5","15","36","6 December 2010"," Black Swan
","BLACK SWAN After walking the red carpet to the New York Ziegfeld's 1131 seat theater I settled into my chair to watch Darron Aronofsky's newest opus, Black Swan. Having enjoyed his last outing, The Wrestler, I had high hopes and although I can't speak for the other 1130 people, mine were not fulfilled. Increasing my disappointment is the fact that Aronofsky is a competent director who had a good story, performed by good actors and set in a great city. Unfortunately, he was handed gold and delivered lead. The film's plot was touted as a modern day All About Eve, substituting ballet dancers for actors with Natalie Portman in the Bette Davis role and Mila Kunis as a conniving Anne Baxter type. When Portman's character ""Nina"" is given the lead role in a production of ""Swan Lake"" by her womanizing producer, played by a creepy Vincent Cassel, she immediately becomes insecure about her own talent and feels the competition of Kunis' ""Lily"" biting at her heels or should I say flats. Making matters worse is her domineering stage mother ""Erica"" played by an underused Barbara Hershey and the previous Swan Queen ""Beth"" played by an also underused Winona Ryder (in fact, Ryder's scenes consist of standing silently in a sea of extras, verbally assaulting Portman with language that would make Tony Soprano blush, lying unconscious in a hospital bed and self-mutilation). Aronofsky's style is evident early on, with hand held camera shots which although give a voyeuristic point of view, may also be a distraction, especially in moments meant for plot points and clarity. Speaking of plot, some seeds are planted and never explored while others are planted and watered with predictability. The resultfertilizer. Case in point, when Portman enters her mother's bedroom which is covered with dozens of drawings of faces with large mouths, when she becomes unhinged and enters a second time what do you think she sees or should I sayhears. What Aronofsky believes will save this hodge-podge of related situations (connected by a thin shoe lace) is the much hyped and gratuitous sex scene between his two female leads. Although interesting, especially to men who like movies about ballet dancers, it goes uncomfortably too far, as does a scene where Portman pleasures herself with her sleeping mother in the room. It is obviously meant as artistic expression but comes off more as immature perversion. One wonders if this was done because the director wanted toor just felt he could. Lost in the shuffle is the actual ""dance"" which is the reason we're supposed to care about these characters. There is some interest in the hard work that goes on behind a ballet production but like the sex scenes, Aronofsky takes it too far focusing on sexual harassment, deformed feet and bulimic behavior when any one of these would have been enough to underline the point. For what it's worth, the core of the story, if one can still see it amongst the sex, drugs and gore, is relatable and Portman's performance is good and credit should be given for the training and discipline she endured to prepare for the role. Unfortunately, what could have been a movie about an artist dealing with competition and inner demons turns into a cheesy horror flick with over the top symbolism. If it does indeed garner Oscar nominations, one should be given to the special effects team which was obviously borrowed from the last Twilight film. To sum upBlack Swan wasn't the worst film I saw all year but as the credits rolled instead of hearing Tchaikovsky's score, I heard Bette Davis turning in her grave."
"dancechick115","2","17","42","23 December 2010"," Could've been much better - ultimately disappointing.
","I was very disappointed with this film. As a trained ballet dancer, I was not fond of the majority of dancing shots that featured only the upper body rather than the entire body. As ""artistic"" as these shots may be to a non-dancing audience, they only irritated me. In addition, the audience only witnesses either arms or feet in the same positions throughout the entire film. If a film about the ballet world is going to be made, it should convey non- stereotypical aspects rather than what we see in Black Swan: the bulimic protagonist, the overly-aggressive artistic director, and the fanatical ballet mother. Many ballet films (with the exception of ""The Turning Point"" and ""The Red Shoes"") fail to represent the ballet world in a deep manner. Black Swan is no exception.<br/><br/>Portman's performance lacked any sort of depth. She only gave one expression throughout the entire film. We knew very little about her character's background. Although we must forgive that she isn't a professional dancer, it may have been better to have a professional dancer as the lead character in this film. The dancing would've been much more believable. Portman's dancing was not at all equal with that of her character - a soloist at a New York City ballet company. Kunis, in addition, performed equally as poor. When the extras can dance better than the leads, then that signals that the lead ""dancing"" characters were wrongfully cast. <br/><br/>This film was static, disappointing, and ultimately a letdown. I believe it would've succeeded if a better cast was built, a deeper exploration of the plot and subplot occurred, and if the dancing scenes were re-shot to show the entire body versus just the upper body or just the feet. We need less stereotypical ballet films, and Black Swan is just another failure to add to the stack of stereotypical, dry ballet films."
"h23154","3","20","51","12 December 2010"," Overrated
","The movie feels as if it was intended to be hour longer than it is and that multiple scenes were removed to get to the desired length. There are to many loose ends, scenes that make one wonder why they are in the film, and, ultimately, what was going on. There are some cheap shocks that lead to nothing and not much else. I have the sense that people are praising this movie because of the director's reputation and a fear of being uncool if they do not like it. Aaide from that, I must say that Natalie Portman needs to eat something and work on a facial emotion other than grave concern. Vincent Cassell does his usual fine work as a sleaze, and Mila Kunis is all grown up and seductive. Barbara Hershey is excellent as a mother who is either maniacally overbearing or genuinely concerned about a daughter with serious mental issues. The excellent work of all three of these performers is not enough to save this movie or forge a coherent plot."

","Oh dear. Expecting greatness and achieving disappointment.<br/><br/>I have to ask - if this film hadn't received all the nominations it did, would there be so many good reviews? I seriously doubt it. We have been told by the media that this is a wonderful film, hence the Oscar nominations and, I suspect, hence all the positive hype (after all the people who 'know' about such things have said it's good, so we will appear ignorant if we think it is bad).<br/><br/>Well, let's not follow the herd. Let's make an educated and calculated assessment of the film ourselves.<br/><br/>The development of a character from pure and naive to someone who discovers their dark side is not an original idea, but if done right is interesting and emotionally gripping. The problem with this film is that Portman was obviously disturbed from the beginning, so the subsequent 'slide' into darkness wasn't very dramatic. The said 'slide' played out as Portman arguing with her mother and engaging in lesbian sex. Hardly earth shattering badness!! Tame really by today's standards and the suggestion that someone engaging in lesbian sex is embracing their dark side is clichéd and offensive. Oh, don't forget she used drugs, but these were slipped into her drink by Kunis, how badass is that? The hallucinations Portman had came with no sense of drama. She had a hallucination, realised it was a hallucination, and carried on.<br/><br/>Her disintegration could have been handled much better. This was really lazy film making. So many avenues could have been explored to show her emotional state, but obviously that would have required too much thought and effort. There was no need for the sex scene and the sexual overtones in the relationship with Cassel was stomach churning and clichéd.<br/><br/>Portman never once portrayed the Black Swan. At all times she appeared dominated and ready to burst into tears - with a twist of madness thrown in.<br/><br/>This movie is really not worth paying to see. A trip to the cinema isn't cheap these days and you will regret wasting your money."

","Although there are many great user reviews here, I am certain the critics influenced much of that.<br/><br/>Yes, the ballet sequences are filmed beautifully. If you're a fan of ballet, this may be more interesting for you than most audience members. And yes, Natalie Portman is a brilliant performer. Sweetness and innocence literally exudes from her in a some magical way. She's a phenomenon. Vincent Cassel is so sexy and magnetic --truly, the cast was great.<br/><br/>But, the movie is still style over substance. Way over. There is just not much happening. It's pretty slow. The only interesting parts are her hallucinations. This movie is SO MUCH like the director/writer's last two films, ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Pi"". (And ""Pi"" is possibly the worst film I've ever seen!) Black Swan has better-known actors and a much bigger budget, but the bottom line is this: these films are about a person who is slowly spiraling out of control. The person is paranoid, anxiety-ridden, obsessive, fearful, and eventually hallucinatory. There is almost always hallucinated self-inflicted injuries, gore, and gratuitous sex, in addition to a lot of nothing-happening scenes..... just nothing. <br/><br/>I am heartily pulling for Natalie Portman for the Academy Award as she is and always has been a ""to-die-for"" actor. I think anyone who doesn't adore her has not seen her films. But, I certainly hope this mess of a movie doesn't receive any other awards!"

","""Black Swan"" presents, I think, a modern more updated definition of film noir (black or dark film) that existed in the 1940's and 50's. It is, indeed, a psychologically dark film as it attempts to recreate the ballet Swan Lake using Natalie Portman as the film's Swan queen. Blood, psychological torment, human cruelty and sexual perversion are its emphasis. If that makes you doubtful you want to see the film I do not blame you. I wondered why I made the effort.<br/><br/>I do not mind if I have to go to some lengths to sift through a film and analyze its nuances but this one was too much for my psyche to absorb. When I read theater of the absurd authors such as Pirandello ""Six Characters in Search of an Author,"" Samuel Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot,"" or see a film based on the Edward Albee book ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf"" I can appreciate its absurdity, its torturous message of life's difficulty and even the extreme pathology of relationships at its core but at some point if the content gives me nothing else but a headache, I stop and ask why did I inflict this upon myself. Alright already I get the point! I do not like to be forced to analyze a film to death so that every word and every scene needs interpretation. In this film I kept asking what is reality, what is fantasy and what is simply a psychotic break. Is the woman insane, is the world around her insane or both? There were too many unknowns. I needed a film analyzer to sit next to me to explain the action and/or the symbolism of each scene.<br/><br/>Some loved this movie and see brilliance in it. That may be so but it was much too enigmatic for me to waste my energy attempting to decipher it. Moreover, the rather graphic sex, utterly ugly bloody hard-to-fathom violence, allusions to maternal lesbian incest and other perversions including drug use made me uncomfortable. Watching the minutiae of it was, I thought, unnecessary and disconcerting. There were enough squirmy moments to make me turn my head and look away and ask why does a filmmaker have to show such graphic sexual detail and unhinged violence. I believe there are boundaries one should not cross. I do not want to see some things in living color because, in my opinion, it contributes to the crudity of our culture. I think the illusion of a sexual encounter is often times more erotic than its body machinations which leave nothing to the imagination.<br/><br/>Having said all of that the film does show the complexity of ballet and its all encompassing art form to which some devote their entire life. If Natalie Portman did the dancing herself she is, indeed, a very good dancer. She is also an excellent actress. The part itself demanded hefty talent and she showed she had that and more. The performance often was riveting but the disgusting violent nature of the script, its graphic sexuality and twisted psychological content makes me give it a thumbs down. I loath fluff films too BUT I do not want utterly psycho-pathological, difficult-to-analyze and bloody ones either. I rather watch the swan boats on Boston Common in the spring instead!"
"st-shot","6","7","14","11 January 2011"," Portman prevents Swan from diving
","Darren Aronofsky's signature hallucinogenic style dealing with the individual in crisis is well in evidence in this take on a prima ballerina going bonkers in pursuit of perfection. But there's more frosting than substance and Black Swan lurches from Polanski to Halloween franchise in order to make its case.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is the hardest working hoofer in the ballet company over at Lincoln Center. A technical marvel she lacks the killer instinct to play the heavy but is never the less chosen to take on the dual role of the white and black swan in the Tchaikovsky ballet. In rehearsal white is going well, black isn't. Her autocratic and always horny director tries to get her to ""loosen up"" with him or a Frisco company import, Lily who also is understudying her. Feeling the pressure (including that of a suffocating mother) Nina begins to descend into a paranoid abyss as the big dance approaches.<br/><br/>Aronofsky usually deals with a heavy hand, balancing it with bravura camera work that climbs inside his troubled leads (Ellen Burstyn in Invitation to a Dream, Mickey Rourke in the Wrestler), forcing the audience to see the world through their eyes with ample amounts of subjective angles. He gets the same results here with Ms. Portman whose serene physical beauty is undermined by her struggle with a polarizing combination of innocence and ambition. But visually Swan flounders as the director with an embarrassment of possibilities to go Gothic horror zaps the films rhythm with repetitive and unnecessary supporting character re- enforcement. Andrew Libatiques camera work is a bit sloppy and erratic as he chases Nina around the stage duplicating dance moves without really achieving full extension. His resting compositions are at times shapeless and unfocused and while it may be arguable to say it does so to reflect Nina's emotional state its rumpled look extends beyond her character. <br/><br/>The Black Swan tips its hand early but overall it is a decent suspense/horror film about the destructive nature of striving for perfection; something that Portman's performance flirts with from start to finish."
"BigHiggaHigga","10","7","14","23 December 2010"," Effing brilliant! (And I mean that in all sincerity)
","Black Swan is, far and away, one of the most powerful films I have viewed in quite some time. Natalie Portman is hypnotizing in the role of Nina. She demonstrates amazing subtlety in attacking the complexities of her role. She is a 90-pound mousy waif of a thing packed with 1000 pounds of dynamite just waiting to be set off. Vincent Cassel is spot-on perfect in his role. As one of the catalysts that will help carry Nina to her ultimate destiny, Cassel brings just the right mix of measured patience and surging force to his character. He doles out the perfect quantity of psychological pleasure or pain as needed to push Nina. Barbara Hershey, playing Nina's mother, forever puts an end to the debate of the influence of nature versus nurture on an individual's ultimate behavior.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky's films always give you a nice meaty hunk of cinema to chew on and this film is no exception. He is at the top of his craft right now and Black Swan bears that out. The way he blends the narrative with continuous flashes of artistic beauty, nerve-racking tension and fever dream-type sequences is a wonder to behold. He has a firm grip on the material from beginning to end but offers it out with a very deft touch.<br/><br/>This movie should be at the front of the pack come Oscar time. IMO, Ms. Portman should win best actress hands down, case closed with no further discussion. She was that good. Hers is a role that will be remembered and studied for a very long time. It just blows you away from start to finish! Aronofsky's genius is evident throughout the film. He has been passed by at award time before but it will be very hard for him not to get serious consideration this time around. He flawlessly crafts a film that grabs you from the opening frames and brings you along on a journey that doesn't end with the closing credits. This film leaves you thinking for days.<br/><br/>I believe that Black Swan stands a very good chance of grabbing the Best Picture award. If there are Oscar voters who appreciate the finest of film making in all of its majesty, Black Swan should be hard to pass over when it comes time for them to mark their ballots."
"magdalena-waz","10","7","14","13 December 2010"," Horrifically beautiful story raises questions about art
","Darren Aronofsky's new film Black Swan was difficult to watch because I knew how it was going to end, but I didn't know why bad things were happening and whether or not they were real.<br/><br/>This confusion stems from the fact that the film is from Nina's (Natalie Portman's) perspective. We see what she experiences without any indication of whether or not what she's experiencing is real. Then, we start to realize that much of what we had believed to be true is not true (never even happened, really). But as soon as we start to understand this, the film reaches such a level of intensity through great use of music and frantic cutting that we forget we've been tricked by what Nina has seen before. We start believing what we see again. This part (the suspense, the fear) is very well-crafted. And it is oddly triumphant- much like The Wrestler.<br/><br/>What doesn't work so well is the premise itself. In the end, the question becomes ""Can an artist immortalize herself through one role (or one work of art)? And can the process destroy the person inside of the artist?"" We don't get the critical distance to think about the answers to this question until we start to catch on to what is going on. Throughout, we are too concerned with Nina's physical well-being as her body falls apart to care about why this is happening.<br/><br/>Performances from the actors are all great. Mila Kunis's rough around the edges ballerina was surprisingly believable, and Vincent Cassel was creepy as the director and (at least in part) the only character who was aware of the questions about artists, their bodies, and their legacies.<br/><br/>I'm always impressed but turned off by Aronofsky's films. The most disgusting things are confronted unflinchingly. He is, of course, not the only director who employs this tactic. But he is the only one who clearly (at least by the end) does it in order to make us think about why we're alive and what alive actually is.<br/><br/>See more of my reviews at http://girlnotbeast.blogspot.com"

Before I saw Black Swan I didn't even know what Swan Lake was actually about. But since I'm a fan of psychological dramas, such an unfamiliar setting in this genre is exactly what appealed to me; this was going to be a little bit different. An art form as skilled and precise as ballet needs a skilled hand to depict convincingly on screen, and director Darren Aronofsky is the man to do just that. The pacing of the film is very tight; no scene drags or feels rushed and the gradual build-up of Nina's descent into madness accumulates very steadily.<br/><br/>In terms of performances, everybody is perfectly cast; I particularly liked Vincent Cassell as the perfectionist director. Probably the most convincing performance though, is Barbara Hershey as Nina's control-freak mother. Throughout the film this character presents a very two-faced attitude, and the subtle ways in which she changes from a beaming smile one moment, to an indignant stare the next, appears very real and always makes you feel uneasy. Basically no one else could have played this role.<br/><br/>The film does run into some problems when the 'horror' elements start working there way into the foreground. This is obviously what the writers and Darren Aronofsky were going for and it does work in principle, but there are just a few moments that are slightly over-the-top and, well, a little bit silly. Some of the more surreal moments incorporate certain CGI/post-production enhancements, and this bothered me for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they just look out of place with the rest of film. Secondly, Aronofsky has proved in his earlier work (Pi and Requiem For A Dream) that he is capable of creating paranoia and disorientation purely through the editing of what he has already shot.<br/><br/>This could have been a lot worse though (I'm grateful there wasn't any full-blown CGI monsters in sight), and only taint the overall film rather than ruin it. Black Swan is good, it's very good, but just falls short of being exceptional. Still, it's too well made, too well acted and too entertaining to dismiss outright because of its flaws, and I highly recommend it."
"andyflavoured","2","5","9","4 April 2011"," Laughably bad - don't waste your money!
","In contrast to other reviews here, I will give an unpretentious and honest assessment of Black Swan. It should have been more accurately entitled 'The Emperor's New Clothes', since it is devoid of any meaningful content and has been feted by reviewers who really ought to know better. <br/><br/>It looks stylish (though the insistence on using hand-held camera for long periods has a tendency to make the user feel seasick), but is essentially meaningless tosh. Worse than that, at key moments it is laughably awful. Portman emotes like her life depends on it, but she can't help the stilted script or the director's clumsy handling of his denouement, which in turn says nothing and was foreseeable through the entire film. <br/><br/>Ignore the accolades. This is truly a movie worthy of the Razzies. Please, please do not buy it on DVD and if you were thinking of venturing out to the cinema, stay home and watch Polanski's Repulsion. Now there was a director who knew how to hit nerve endings and portray a descent into madness credibly and scare the audience witless. <br/><br/>So in short, there are no redeeming features - this really is a film that could have been decent in the right hands but which has been sabotaged. Please save your hard-earned cash!"

","I understand this was a thriller set in the ballet world and did not expect a 'Turning Point' kind of ballet world movie. But there was too much unpleasantness that it seemed one dimensional. I wouldn't really want to watch this again. They succeed in making one of the most beautiful ballets in the world ugly.<br/><br/>There are some good points - like the blurring of reality and fiction was like an actual delusional person. It does succeed in keeping you on edge.<br/><br/>The main actors: Natalie Portman does the anguish and fear well she has evolved as an actress. She used to have a high school drama class expressions on her face now she is clearly better and deserves her awards. However physically she does not look like a ballerina. She is bit stunted and doesn't have the lithe long look of a ballerina or an arched back. She didn't really have to train so hard since her dancing moments were actually quite short. But I see why they couldn't use a real ballerina for this role - it wasn't really about dancing.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis is a good bad girl but the trashy look is a bit overdone for a proper ballet company - it seemed more appropriate for a Step Up kind of dance company.<br/><br/>Winona played her crumbling aging ballerina well could hardly recognize her but wasn't given enough screen time they didn't focus enough on her face. Also her storyline of collapse is a bit exaggerated. Retirement cant be that bad.<br/><br/>Vincent Cassel is a bit too unattractive and predatory for the role. He doesn't look the part either - bad casting.<br/><br/>Barbara Hershey was quite effective. Her crumpled face was probably the most frightening thing about her.<br/><br/>The main fault is the screenplay and story. The sexual elements were just too much and distasteful. About 10% would have been enough. It distracted from the story. It should have had more beautiful elements to contrast with the ugly. Showing things from just one perspective can be limiting. The horror elements were a bit too cringe inducing.<br/><br/>Overall worth one watch but just didn't enjoy it."
"kateprice","3","5","9","20 February 2011"," A patronising and hysterical treatment of a sensitive subject
","I have just come back from seeing this over-rated movie. Unsubtle is the kindest thing I can say about it. I am furious at the way that we the audience have been patronised by this hysterical trash. Mental breakdown in anyone is a harrowing subject. Yet to portray it as a horror movie so malevolently and in such an exaggerated manner misses the point. At times one did not know when one was watching reality and when fantasy. It would have been much more interesting to have shown the pressures on the Nina the dancer in a more truthful way. It would have forced more acting ability from the actors; it would have been more harrowing to watch. It would have induced compassion. (The giggling of the 2 young women next to us at the end was a very apt and perceptive critique in its own right.) The pressures of the over domineering mother, the sexually rampant choreographer, the evil intentions of Lily, the rival dancer, the fact that Nina's sheltered upbringing resulted in an emotionally and sexually virginal and immature young woman, the challenges of the first night, the tragedy of the previous prima ballerina laid off, the envy of the other dancers -- all these make for conflict and drama. Yet the opportunity for a subtle and absorbing drama was thrown away by the director who substituted instead cheap thrills (of a horrifying and harrowing kind). I repeat. Please do not patronise us, the audience. We all live with our own pressures. We know what fear and guilt feel like. You don't have to ""simplify"" it for us with Gothic and corny images. Grow up please and make us a grown up movie."

","After several euphoric reviews of this movie I was absolutely curious about it. But since the plot turned out to be a mix-up between a casting show and a bad horror movie I was rather disappointed. On the other hand the actors did a respectable job and the movie is ""a solid Hollywood production"". But by using this set of actors and a ballet setting they could've achieved a lot more if they'd tightened up the whole movie a bit - since the first half of the movie is just boring. Don't get me wrong - I do understand the characters in the movie have to be developed - but this was just all too obvious. MHO: not a bad movie - but not worth watching."
"Turfseer","4","5","9","23 January 2011"," The Red Shoes meets Angel Heart
","Who knew? Rather than a profession peopled with a crew of dedicated professionals, the ballet world, according to director Darren Aronofsky, really consists of a bunch of back-stabbing bitches, self-mutilating neurotics, sleazy artistic directors and a 'Stage Mom' from hell.<br/><br/>Black Swan has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in this one-note tale of a dancer's quest to come out on top as she pursues the lead role in Swan Lake for a prominent (unnamed) NYC ballet company. The film is really supposed to be a cautionary tale about people who will stop at nothing to further their careers. Ironically, Natalie Portman (as the protagonist, Nina Sayers) worked herself out like a dog in order to replicate the look of a full-time ballet dancer; many internet posters have commented how unhealthy she looks on screen and seems to be just as guilty as the character she plays (where Nina will stop at nothing to become the so-called 'Swan Queen', Ms. Portman has worked herself to the bone in her quest for Oscar Gold!).<br/><br/>Vincent Cassell plays the sleazy artistic director of the company, Thomas Leroy. Leroy has no qualms about throwing the over-the-hill principal dancer, Beth Macintrye (played by a way over the top Winona Ryder) under the bus after deciding that the younger Nina must now carry the torch. His decision is not immediate as he has reservations about whether Nina can actually play the darker 'Black Swan' part. He senses that things aren't right with Nina as she is unable to 'let herself go'. The consummate professional that he is, Leroy instructs Nina to go home and masturbate which will help her to get in touch with her more spontaneous self. When he gives her pointers on the dance floor, he says things like, ""Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me!"" Nina finally gets the role when Leroy tests her by attempting to kiss her while they're alone—in response, Nina bites him on the lip (that proves to Leroy, believe it or not, that Nina has what it takes!).<br/><br/>Also in the mix is Nina's pushy mother, Erica, who she lives with in a small, unattractive apartment. The mother wanted to be a ballet dancer but never made it and ended up pushing Nina to become the driven artiste she has become. It's clear that Erica is unconsciously jealous of her daughter's success but I can't agree with others who have suggested there is an incestuous sub-text here. If anything, Nina's mother is extremely upset over the evidence that Nina has been self-mutilating and is now trying to get her to slow down and take care of herself.<br/><br/>Finally, there's Lily, Nina's rival from San Francisco who Leroy names as alternate in the Swan Lake production. Lily sports a bunch of tattoos and has a mouth like one of the performers you might find on 'Jersey Shore'. Nina hallucinates having a steamy sexual encounter with Lily but soon finds out that it was all in her mind.<br/><br/>Throughout 'Black Swan', Nina keeps imagining seeing her double which unnerves her no end. Aronofsky deceptively leads us to believe that Nina harbors murderous impulses. Prior to the climax, Nina fights with her double who morphs into Lily. It then appears that Nina stabs Lily to death just prior to the opening night performance. But during intermission, Lily knocks on Nina's dressing room door making it quite clear that Lily's murder was just another one of Nina's hallucinations. It turns out that Lily is not a murderer at all—rather, the murderous impulses were simply a reflection of Nina's own self-hatred. She ends up stabbing herself prior to going back out for the second act and presumably is found bleeding to death as the curtain descends and the oblivious audience roars their approval.<br/><br/>Nina's last words regarding her performance was that ""it was perfect"". The irony of course is that although achieving her goal of mastering the role of the 'Black Swan', she sacrifices her life. In real life, those who give up a piece of themselves for their ambition, don't usually kill themselves. Rather, they end up with a feeling of a self-satisfaction and achievement of their goals. It's of course for others to judge them whether their rise to the top was conducted with a modicum of moral integrity.<br/><br/>In the end, there are few surprises here as Nina's self-destructive internal arc is played out as if someone kept hitting the repeat button on a video monitor. All those scratch marks and peeling toenails become tedious after awhile and the potential tempting plot that Nina's actions might lead to a murder investigation turns out to be nothing more than a big tease on the part of director Aronofsky.<br/><br/>Some may feel that Nina is the epitome of a tragic heroine—she accomplishes her goal of mastering a difficult dramatic part but throws away her life at the same time. If you are going to have a heroine who is self-destructive, why not model your character on Tennessee Wiliam's Blanche Dubois? Her back story is a real one as opposed to the one-note Nina, molded by a stereotyped Stage Mother from hell.<br/><br/>The frenetic pacing of the Black Swan narrative will hold your interest to the end but the ride is decisively creepy. Has Aronofsky created a true cautionary tale on the dangers of careerism? Or does he revel in the excesses that he is supposedly criticizing? Somehow, all the gory goings on in The Black Swan don't seem to be a very appropriate venue for the dignified world of ballet. Better to catch a young Mickey Rourke in 'Angel Heart' if you desire a blood-fest that's a tad bit more creative."

","I went into this only having seen the trailer. I was excited about it. It looked dark, creepy, and intriguing with the ballet aspect. I was going into it not knowing much but the trailer.<br/><br/>From the beginning I saw the scene from the trailer of Natalie portman dancing with a black swan. Within the first 10 minutes I had seen and heard everything else from the trailer. Natalie portman obviously did not do most of her footwork, as the cameras OBVIOUSLY never showed her feet except in closeups, the plot was obvious and direct and PREDICTABLE, and the acting was terribly contrived. There was a moment where when the teacher told her to touch herself, it was funny in its awkwardness. It lost the humor when she actually did in fact go home and not only touch herself, but masturbate herself and lucky us, we got to see the whole thing. It was disgusting. The cameras were ALL off-balance and made me SICK, and I got so sick of seeing the back of her neck for minutes at a time. I would not have minded the IMPLICATION of masturbation if she hadn't done it at least 3 times and we didn't have to see it in great detail. Come on, we get it. If we wanted to see porn we would have done something else besides go to THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>What dumb asses wrote this? It TOLD you what was going to happen from the very first two sentences of the movie. That's not foreshadowing, that's bullshit.<br/><br/>And we left mid-movie during the lesbian make out/oral scene. I'm sorry, but it did NOTHING for the plot and it made us very uncomfortable. I don't care if it was a guy and a woman, something that explicit should be left out of a freaking SWAN LAKE movie about BALLERINAS. What the hell, people? I guess they were going for intense but instead went for pornographic.<br/><br/>The ""horror"" scenes were just gross and unnecessary, and the people were so one-dimensional it hurt me. So she was crazy, who cares? I surely didn't. I just wanted to get the hell out so I wouldn't be subjected to the nonsense of this movie anymore. I didn't see the ending and I could care less to know it. That is how bad this movie is."

","The hype for this movie is way out of proportion to its quality. I found I tolerated this film more then I enjoyed it. The story, artistic merit and even the performances have been extremely overstated. The thing I was most disappointed in was Aronofsky's direction or at least the use of his camera. I swear that 50% of this film is a steady cam shot five inches from Natalie Portman's face. 10% is more hand-cam directly on her shoulder. One thing's for sure, I hope Aronofsky leaves the hand held stuff at home when he films The Wolverine. Maybe he wanted this film to feel claustrophobic and jarring but it was very distracting and even nauseating at times."
"nycmec","5","8","17","7 January 2011"," Don't Believe the Hype
","I really don't understand all the awards buzz surrounding this film. It is so over-the-top campy! Maybe a little bit of this was on purpose--casting Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder is already perhaps something of a clue to where this film's sensibilities lie. Even Vincent Cassel camps it up, and he is too good for this not to be on purpose. The premise is just so tired: ""You must break through to the dark side to create real art, even if it means destroying yourself."" Yawn. Maybe the film was really, at heart, making fun of this credo? I just don't give it that much credit. But credit is due to Natalie Portman, who manages to weather the storm and play her role convincingly enough. Maybe this is what is so jarring--she plays it straight while most of the other actors in the movie do not. Anyhow, this film didn't gel for me, though I could not fail to be moved by Tchikovsky's music for ""Swan Lake,"" the most beautiful ballet score of all, and overwhelming in its beauty."
"GoddessCeCe","10","8","17","24 December 2010"," A beautiful and horrific masterpiece that transcends genres
","I know that this review will more than likely become buried deep within the reviews here on IMDb. That being said, I couldn't pass up the chance to comment on this film. It is too wonderful for me to be negligent in placing a review.<br/><br/>Very few movies come along that change the way you view the world. Interestingly enough, for me, Natalie Portman has been in two of them. She is always dazzling. My favorite movie is V for Vendetta. That incredible film changed my entire outlook in so many ways. It remains my favorite, but now, we have Black Swan.<br/><br/>This movie is as beautiful as it is horrific. It is a study of incredible contradictions. It is a study of intense character. Of the human condition. Of the thin line between sanity and insanity, good and evil. Of the pursuit of perfection to quell the indestructible demons that lie within. Unlike most films, Black Swan can't truly be identified as one specific genre. It never falls into one category, but rather masters several at once; its main elements are a blend of psychological thriller meets horror. There is also a very gritty, real, independent feel to the film without ever causing it to feel low budget. It is really a beautiful blend with something to please even the most discriminating movie goer.<br/><br/>Aronofsky takes an incredibly stunning, disturbing and enthralling story and brings it to life beautifully with intricate close shots and over the shoulder follows. There are so many shots where you feel as though you are walking behind the characters, or right there beside them. This visual achievement allows you more intimate access to the story and characters as they develop throughout the film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is superb and Oscar worthy in hands-down the finest performance of her career. She plays Nina Sayers, a professional ballet dancer who has always strived to achieve perfection. Ever the studious daughter, Nina still lives at home with her overbearing and smothering mother (Barbara Hershey). As the movie progresses and you see interactions between Nina and her mother, you begin to realize where Nina gets her insatiable quest for perfection and her instability from. Always eager to please her mother, she has never allowed herself to grow from a child into a woman (subtly of this character flaw is evident in Nina's still-childlike bedroom). This works for her mother who forever wants to keep her the child she is in her mind.<br/><br/>Nina is finally given the lead role of her dreams at her ballet company in""Swan Lake"", for which she has to portray elements of good (the White Swan) and evil (the titular Black Swan). She easily taps into her good side, but struggles to express the darkness within. Despite finally getting to fulfill her dream, it is here that Nina begins to go off the rails. The closer she gets to the show, the more she starts to lose touch with reality. She begins to hurt herself in ways that are unfathomable to a well mind. Aronofsky uses this to his advantage so that we, the viewer, are at times unable to separate fact from the fantasies of Nina's delusional mind. Her fractured psyche comes into play, and the people around her become more aggressive in their attempts to undermine her. Sadly, it becomes glaringly obvious that her downward spiral is not due to any outside influence, but her rapidly deteriorating mind.<br/><br/>Some of the finer moments, to me, are when Nina is discovering not only her sexuality (several scenes are highly intense but very tasteful), but when she is shedding her ""White Swan"" to make way for her ""Black Swan"". The transition is flawless and terrifying. She begins letting go of her inhibitions, of the things that have held her back in her life, that have kept her with an unstable mother who, due to her own mental instability, hindered her growth. Natalie plays this character so well that you honestly forget that you are watching Natalie Portman, but actually see her as Nina instead. For someone with a film resume as long and varied as hers, that is the mark of a truly brilliant and skilled talented actress. I think she is the best actress of our time.<br/><br/>I also wanted to give a mention of Mila Kunis, who is brilliant as Lily. She has been in the industry for a very long time and is finally coming into her own as the gorgeous, talented lady she is. Her performance really shines in an already stellar cast. I look forward to Mila's future work. She and Natalie Portman have both been nominated for Golden Globes, and I'm sure Oscar noms won't be far behind. Both nods are VERY well deserved.<br/><br/>Black Swan is what separates movies from cinema. It is art in its purest and rarest form, not just trash on celluloid as the majority of Hollywood releases today. If you haven't seen Black Swan yet, please, do yourself a favor and treat yourself this holiday. You will be horrified. You will be mesmerized. And, if you're like me, you will be changed."

","I had never heard of Black Swan before a local paper review tickled my fancy; glad it did because the two friends I dragged to see it throughly enjoyed themselves. Unfortunately, attendance was sparse...<br/><br/>Black Swan's protagonist reminded of the disturbed protagonist in Fight Club on many levels. Both are living fragmented, illusion-based realities that they manage to overcome to reach the pinnacle of their self-destructive achievements. While comparing the Black Swan role to Project Mayhem may be a stretch, this movie gives Swan Lake a whole new, visceral, edge.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman makes meek and mild a household name in most movies and she reprises that attitude to its zenith here. Living with an overbearing mother, Nina Sayers (her role) desperately attempts to climb the rungs of her dance studio...stealing from the past, guarding against the present and forsaking the future for her complete immersion into the dual role of White Swan and Black Swan. The Black Swan eludes her until she loses herself in lust with her rival Lily, shipped in from California to compete for the role.<br/><br/>Many side stories ensue, from the overbearing mother to the small-studio struggles to the prisons of fame, but Nina somehow keeps her fragmenting mind alive for a bravura performance. We slowly see her, literally, transforming into the Black Swan, pulling illusory feathers from her back and standing up to home and studio to achieve perfection. It isn't an easy ride as her fragile confidence meets relenting pressure and results in a boiling point finale where she becomes the Black Swan, but at what cost to herself?<br/><br/>Portman carries the movie, but her supporting cast, like the lithe ballet crew that surround her, make it an incredible and memorable journey. Who knew ballet could be surrounded by a psychologically taut and at times disqueting aura?<br/><br/>Simply wonderful, see it at once!"
"crazzeematt","10","8","17","1 December 2010"," A true masterpiece, anchored by a tour-de-force performance from Natalie Portman
","I saw Black Swan recently and it was nothing short of amazing. From the first moments in the movie where we are in Nina's(Natalie Portman) dreams to the eventual end of the ballet where Nina utters ""It was perfect"", and boy was she right. By know you all know about the story, Nina is pushed by ballet director(Cassel), lives with and over-bearing mother(Hershey), faces a rival(Kunis), and is tormented by an aging ballerina(Ryder). I want to talk about the supporting cast...all of which were great. Cassel is arrogant, pushy, and charismatic as Thomas, he really elevates a one note character into something amazing. Barbara Hershey was great as the over-bearing mother of Nina. Hershey was born to play this role and I think she deserves more awards buzz then she is getting. Kunis really shocked me, I mean I really never thought she could be this good, she will shock you. Winona, although only in a few scenes, makes you remember she was there, she blew me away, and brought a sort of grace to a very chilling character, certainly a triumphant return to cinema.Also one to talk about is Ksenia Sols, who plays Veronica in the film, she is really great and does a good job with her small role. Now, lets talk about Natalie Portman... WOW, just wow was she amazing. I have been a fan of Natalies for some time now, but never have I seen her this good. She takes this performance so far beyond what I thought it would be. She allows you to take this journey with her, and by the end she will leave you stunned by her performance. Certainly THE best performance of the year by far. As for the other aspects, the score was amazing, the camera work was superb, and Aronofsky's direction great. Mr. Aronofsky and Ms. Portman really take us on a journey in this film, a journey that I won't stop thinking about for a long time. Black Swan is truly a Masterpiece. 10/10, 5/5, 4 stars, which ever way you wanna say it, just go see this movie."

","Empty and vacuous writing, directing and acting; those are the kinder words I can summon twenty-four hours after viewing this POS. Hats off to the costume designer, and to the casting agent who booked that magnificent older ballet instructor. I promise to go back and retrieve her name for this review before I'm finished. They made it somewhat redeeming in a couple of cameos, however briefly.<br/><br/>Portman was lacking in the lead role. For any one of you who have experienced the aura surrounding a prima ballerina, then you know of what I speak. There is an elegance about them that transcends all cultural boundaries, a sense of grace divine if you will. Portman did nothing to present a case for herself. The Black Swan/White swan doppelganger had no believability and this viewer never allowed himself to become invested in this cartoonish melodrama.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of pornography. As Justice Potter Stewart once said, ""I'll know it when I see it."" It lacked any shred of humanity. It strove for mystery and left the audience pining for the final credits. It was written with unskilled naivety, using passionless characters to tell repeatedly how they felt while telegraphing their actions.<br/><br/>This reminded me of a movie from the sixties called Elvira Madigan wherein the director tried to incorporate a tragic love story around one of Mozart's piano concertos. Much like that movie, this was a failed attempt at achieving recognition by association with a phenomenal work of art, Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, the dance mistress I believe was Marina Stavitskaya, a former Russian prima ballerina herself who teaches in NYC now.

"pf9","4","18","47","4 December 2010"," The Meshuge Swan
","The old chestnut about having to experience life before being able to be a true artist is rehashed in the case of a psychotic ballerina. Trouble is, beautiful Natalie Portman, the actress portraying this ballerina is no great dancer, and therefore the dance sequences are being filmed either in a now-you-see-her-upper-body closeup, with her arms executing over and over the same ballet-101 gesture, or in a now- you-see someone's feet closeup, or finally now-from a greater distance-you-see-a ballerina in a pas-de-deux. It makes for clumsy filming and we get too much of it. Add to this that her male dancing partner lacks the good looks one expects of the Prince in ""Swan Lake,"" and then, he turns out to be a klutz to boot. All the characters come in two one-dimensional variants, which might as well carry tags of ""I am good"" and ""I am evil."" True, this reproach could also be leveled at the scenario of that superb ballet, ""Swan Lake,"" but then most people watch it for story told by Tchaikovsky's music, and not for its silly scenario by Begichev and Geltser (you can look this up in Wikipedia, like I did, for if you are honest, you will have to admit that, like me, you have never heard of either of them). The ballet is rescued by Tchaikovsky, but no, even remotely comparable, genius rescues this silly movie. The horror of the hallucination scenes has been done to much more effect by Roman Polanski in ""Repulsion.""<br/><br/>To my mind, the only thing that could save this movie would be a remake as a Woody Allen comedy under the title ""The Meshuge Swan"""

","A bit late to the party perhaps, but here goes.<br/><br/>I watched this film when it was just released. Although I do think Aronofsky makes some decent work, I am no member of his fan-club or anything. Much of his movies seem distant to me. Too distant to be in any way involved or even interested in the story that unfolds. Much of the time Aronofsky is trying to hard to show something sophisticated and intelligent. Usually he succeeds in some way or another, but with Black Swan he misses the mark. By miles! The story consists of nothing more than a ballerina (at the top of her game)who is cracking under the pressure of starring in Swan Lake. It is all visualized by cheap horror clichés and some rather tasteless sex-scenes. The worst part is that from the first few minutes of the film, it is pretty clear where were all headed. And no, the movie does not surprise us with a nice twist. It is what it is.<br/><br/>I can only shrug my shoulders.<br/><br/>The only thing that keeps me puzzled with this movie, is the fact that a lot of people seem to think it is a masterpiece.

They get ratings above 8 and the only explanations I can think of are that IMDb is the focus of marketing campaigns or that the whole world has taken a step back into the dark ages."
"amacallum","2","6","12","26 February 2011"," This is an over-rated and 'fake art house' film
","It's amazing how many times this film has been reviewed on this site. <br/><br/>The answer is simple.<br/><br/>It's one of those films that gratifies the limited intellectual and aesthetic awareness of the masses, who, let's face it, don't really understand cinema.<br/><br/>Usually what US cinema does, is survey European cinema, steal any successful film they think can be translated culturally into an American idiom, and create a US version. The leading US filmmakers will even steal British stories such as Alice in Wonderland (Tim Burton) and Gullivers Travels (Rob Letterman) to make a fast buck out of other cultures indigenous creativity. Now they are doing it with the Stieg Larsson films!!!<br/><br/>Here, with Black Swan we have a film that has taken the process a stage further. It is a film that looks like it might be a European art house film. The male lead sounds like he is French, the majority of actors hold back displaying overt American accents. New York is not paraded like a shiny medal, like it is in most US films. There's a crazy woman in a really small apartment, two actually,.. no three. It's dark and gloomy the whole time, we can't work out what is real and what is not, it taps into the unconscious rather than follow a neat story, it really confronts the truth of life. Not ! <br/><br/>Vomit !<br/><br/>Also, if I remember correctly, no-one gets killed. How can a film be classed as American if no-one gets killed or murdered?? OK, we are led to believe these things happen, but they are clearly deranged projections of the leading character. ..A bit of a case of having your cake and eating it, i.e. in US films, sorry, 'MOVIES,' people get killed, but here people can get killed, and then we are told, 'it was only a dream.' How nice !<br/><br/>It's shot in low light, with fast film. This is a technique used originally by documentary filmmakers to bludgeon their audience into believing that what they are viewing is real, honest and truthful. Please !<br/><br/>In the best European cinema, we are left asking questions. An ultimate and traditional resolution is not that important. Here in black swan, there aren't any questions buzzing around in our mind at the end of the film, only soporific and banal ones, such as, 'is success really that important? Profound ! <br/><br/>American cultural production does not ask questions. Their culture demands certainty so the audience won't feel undermined or belittled by things. How insecure is that????<br/><br/>Underneath the stylistic deceptions of this film, it's just a very traditional reactionary story, protagonist struggles against all the odds, antagonist tries to stop her, turning point one, turning point two, resolution, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Black Swan seems to display a freer attitude to sexuality than most American films, but at no point are we allowed to see a female breast. I don't go to the cinema to see such things, I'm just making the point that showing female breasts is anathema in US culture and cinema. So even the depiction of sex is a bit fake in this film.<br/><br/>This just leaves the question, why are US filmmakers making fake European art house films? The answer? - $$$..Dollars ! The quickest way to make money is to gratify the fragile egos of the people with money in their wallets.<br/><br/>PS As I submitted this review, I was not allowed to submit it because my spelling mistakes were highlighted so I had to go back and correct them. These spelling 'mistakes' were intentional, and used for creative effect. Very ironic that it did not let me use them !"
"intelearts","6","6","12","14 February 2011"," My 370th Review: More Awful Than Excellent: The Explicit Exploration Of The Subconscious Is Not A Winner
","Since the Ballet Russe and Dhiagiliev ballet has been explored on film. But not often. This is a waste, given that Merce Cuningham and The American Ballet changed the dynamic of dance and that film and ballet are both moving arts. Ballet has been explored in films like White Nights with Baryshnikov and All That Jazz, but has only been captured once truly successfully in Powell and Pressburger's stunning The Red Shoes (Which is one of THE films - whether you like ballet or not). <br/><br/>So we were looking forward, especially after the positive reviews, to seeing Black Swan. I considered The Wrestler to be very very good indeed and while I get that they are companion pieces I did not find Black Swan to be the same rich experience.<br/><br/>This is not the fault of Natalie Portman or an excellent cast who do give it their all.<br/><br/>Perhaps Aaronovsky in trying to pull the same trick twice shows too much smoke and mirrors here - and by this I mean, the film's constant desire to explicitly state the tortured side through images, which the Wrestler never does. It is effective sure, but it lacks the aesthetic to bring the dark side of the dance life to more than a reduction - and what we get IS a sledgehammer to crack an egg. I have nothing about the scenes per se (and they have been discussed so much in the papers I don't need to any spoilers here) but in this reviewer's opinion they do seem a cop out for the really hard process of conveying what they convey without this chicanery. <br/><br/>The better question is does the film lose by removing them? - In this reviewer's opinion, in all but the final 20 minutes - no, not a jot - which means they are at best a device and at worse a distraction. There is enough emotional impact in the relationships to drive the character to her final place, and the other scenes do not lend weight they simply overburden the film.<br/><br/>The film is at its best in the dance scenes - and I don't just say that simply as someone who loves ballet - it simply is. The back stories, mother, NY bars etc; somehow don't give the weight to the creation of Natalie Portman's character in anyway the same that the dance rehearsals do, or say, the simple act of children chasing Mickey Rourke in the Wrestler did.<br/><br/>I sense here a missed opportunity - yes, it is one of the great films about dance, but there are not that many to compare it to. Black Swan tries to imagine the complex world of pain, agony, and happiness that dancers inhabit, but in doing so it resorts to several devices that though uncomfortable are not more than effective. <br/><br/>It is worth seeing, but I for one, and this won't be the popular opinion, cannot rave about it.<br/><br/>All in all I was left strangely unmoved and distanced by the subplots and would wish that it had focused harder on the dance process. It is not an easy to watch, and I would not want that for one moment, but by making the internal so external it fails to achieve the pinnacle."
"kine_lepsoe","10","6","12","5 February 2011"," A white swan decays, and a black swan germinate
","WOW! Just wow! Black Swan just blew me away, in every way that a movie should. There is a beautiful balance throughout the movie between the sane and the psychotic and the beauty and the grotesque. You would think the movie might be all about dance, but it really isn't. There is very little talk about the dance steps, and the names of the dance steps, which is perfect if you're not really into dance. The characters have a lot of debt – even the mother who does not have a big role, acts like the supporting mother, when really she's manipulating her daughter into thinking it's her idea. The Swan Lake ballet is an allegory of the protagonist's life on the outside. Her obsession with being perfect and loved, makes her unable to distinguish between reality and dark character in the play. Beautiful cinematography, excellent acting and a hot and raw sex scene, tastefully done. And it keeps you guessing 'till the very end – and perhaps after as the interpretation is not carved in stone. This might just be my new favorite movie of all time. Don't walk to the movie theater, RUN!"

","I am just back from the movie theatre where I saw the UK advanced screening of Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan (it will be released nationwide on January 21st).<br/><br/>The movie opens with the main character Nina who dances alone on a dark stage of what it seems to be a ballet company theatre and since this very first scene we, as audience, are captivated by her obsessive, and at the same time intoxicating movements.<br/><br/>Parallels between Black Swan and The Wrestler are unavoidable, even if here the fragility of mind is the main issue Nina is facing while Rourke's Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson fought the off age passion for the ring.<br/><br/>Jealousy and fear to lose her life awaited lead role in the Swan Lake ballet are not the only reasons which make Nina's life so difficult. We also have pressures from a way too domineering mother (Barbara Hershley) and advices from a way too pushy choreographer (Vincent Cassel) who believes she can deliver the ""White Swan"", but is too frigid to play the ""Black Swan"".<br/><br/>Nina's obsession with perfection will take her to a horrific and complete identification with the role she is playing in the Swan Lake, which is in many cases disturbing.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's talented style which introduces thriller and even horror elements in a so complicated drama, pulls the best out of his actors and as Rourke and Marisa Tomei in The Wrestler also here we have a bunch of talented actors who are showing magnificent performances: first of all Portman (she dances for real), but also Cassel, Hersley, Kunis and Wynona Ryder.<br/><br/>A must see, highly recommended!"

"Ziya90","10","4","7","28 June 2013"," A director's triumph, quintessential cinema, mainstream horror, genius writing
","Black Swan is a very original film, a fresh in the air film. Yes, there is another movie with similar themes which is Red Shoes, but other than that movie in the history of cinema, I think that Black Swan is an unique film and experience. I haven't seen such a different, genius dance scenes before in my life! It is pure cinema. The camera movements and lighting are genius thanks to Darren Aranofsky, also he creates a chilling and suspenseful atmosphere in a brilliant way. The movie is technically and visually mesmerizing, for example the ballet shoes making scene captured me. The movie is pure art, but also a great psychological thriller. The script is highly smart, it is full of metaphors and clues about the content and the lives of the characters. I think the movie's main themes are the desire of being perfect and career ambition. The mother character reminds me Haneke's The Piano Teacher, in my opinion two mothers share some very similar characteristics, but the mother here is mysterious (the other was not) Portman's acting is incredible, one of the best female performances of all time may be, Mila Kunis was also a great choice for the character and as a performance she was top-notch! Also, Winona Ryder who I don't particularly like as an actress was great in this. I couldn't solve the mystery of body scratches by the way. The lesbian scene wasn't a box office tool if you ask my opinion, its necessity is open to question, but it adds some very important aspects to the story. Also, ""was I good?"" line was a clear The Family Guy wit that leaves a smile on your face. As a content, I couldn't the mystery of that lesbian scene either. There is also a climactic dance sequence and everything from editing to art direction, from sounds to meanings and metaphors, it was a brilliant experience. And after a second thought, the ending was perfect and twisted a little (an early question from another ballet dancer made us think differently about what is going on) Black Swan is one of the masterpieces of this century. It is also like the film combines mainstream suspense cinema with independent art cinema perfectly. It should have won the best film Oscar."

","This is The Marx Brothers meets The Shining. It is a movie with a very poor script, and a story that should be a warning to any others thinking about a film about such nonsense. Natalie Portmans acting was abysmal. (she won the Academy Award for best actress !). None of the actors performed well. Its another example of the poor writing that has been in so many recent movies. (when i say recent...i mean for the past 10...15 years.) The added sexual side dishes, scattered here and there at least gave me a laugh. This does for ballet, what Wall Sreet does for honesty. The fact that the Portman character loses her mind and dies only adds to the general absurdity. She may go down in history as one of the worst actors to win an Oscar."

Some of her scenes in the movie are excellent and Disturbing,and in this movie she really shows her natural talent and she totally deserved her Oscar for this role. Also a good performance from Mila Kunis as Lily and she does her role very well in the movie, and also strong performances from Barbara Hershey,Winona Ryder and Vincent Cassel in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Excellent Work from Director Darren Aronofsky who is quite bold in making this kind of a movie and makes a gem out of the movie. He also did a great job in making his actors adapt to their roles, especially the role of Portman which is a very complex one, and also doing well with the ballet dances in the movie and the scenes in the movie excellently and top marks to him for making such a gripping thriller.He proved that he is a very talented director by making this great movie.<br/><br/>The Story of the movie is excellent and it shows the life of Nina and her obsession of perfecting the roles of the White Swan and the Black Swan and her cracking up in the movie brilliantly and great job from great job from Andres Heinz for writing such a great and gripping story and also good jobs from Screen-writers Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin and Heinz himself and great job from director Aronofsky for utilizing the story superbly and making this into a great film.<br/><br/>The Choreography of this movie is superb as the Ballets shown in the movie are quite great and great job from Choreographer Benjamin Millepied(who is also the fiancé of Portman and an actor in this movie) for making specially Portman who surely had to take lessons for ballerina do the ballets superbly. The Music which is taken from ''Swan Lake' by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is divine, from the first second the movie starts the background music is excellent, and the music in the last ballets are beautiful and great work from music director Clint Mansell for giving a beautiful background music in the film.<br/><br/>This movie is really one of the best psychological thrillers of the decade and you have to see this movie patiently to understand it fully, and its greatness if mostly due to the marvelous performance from Natalie Portman and the excellent directional work from Darren Aronofsky to make it a real film to watch for every movie lover.<br/><br/>My Rating: 9/10"

","No way to get around it; a well choreographed mess. A stark melodrama about a very serious and ambitious New York City ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman)landing the dream position of a dancer's lifetime...that of the lead in ""Swan Lake"". The dance director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel)has a delicate concept of the lead being a sharp balance between the white and black swan; and he knows his former prima ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder)is too old for the part. Nina has proved to be solid, hard working and self absorbed in her own perfection. Can she even pull off being the ""Swan Queen""? She is driven and manipulated by her mother Erica (Barbara Hershey); but even worse is her own neurotic vision of body image. A beautiful new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis)joins the dance troupe and impresses Thomas and has Nina obsessing her as a major rival trying to take her new found prominence . Nina searches for absolute perfection and begins her battle with paranoia and delusion. She seems coerced in getting in touch with her darker side via a sexual relationship with Lily...imagined or not it builds self confidence with a deeper descent in mental collapse.<br/><br/>Kudos to director Darren Aronofsky for this psychological thriller. In spite of Kunis all but stealing the show; Portman dances away with the Academy Award. Also in the cast: Benjamin Millepied, Kristina Anapau, Ksenia Solo, Sergio Torrado and Mark Margolis. Rated R for the very sensual scenes between Portman and Kunis. (And I am not one to complain)."

","At the end of this movie I was about to turn to my girlfriend and say ""that was intense"" when she turned to me and said ""that was intense."" The movie, and especially the last, absolutely stunning sequence, is incredibly intense. Natalie Portman as a driven perfectionist is amazing, giving a performance more about nervous, tense looks and bottled up emotions than about dialogue. Barbara Hershey is also incredible as her mother, ostensibly supportive but suffused with terrifying jealousy.<br/><br/>The movie puts the viewer squarely in Portman's mind, and we have as much trouble as she does in understanding what is really happening and what is her vivid imagination.<br/><br/>I think this movie has a lot in common with Roman Polanski's Repulsion, although I saw the latter so long ago that I can't say more about it than that, except that if you like one I'd recommend watching the other as well.<br/><br/>I note an unusually large number of IMDb user reviews having a very pretentious tone to them. I understand why. At the end of the movie, I felt like I should have a lot to say about it, because it was such an intense experience, but I actually don't.

","Nathalie Portman can act. - That's the good thing about ""Black Swan"". - Aside from that, Darren Aronofsky's film doesn't have much to show. Suspenseful moments are destroyed by choosing Tchaikovsky's music instead of something that truly could support the mood, the cinematography doesn't deliver anything original (and is no match to Jack Cardiff's work on the ballet drama ""The Red Shoes"" - which centers around a similar story and does even show a title consisting of a symbol for a dancer's obsession), and the ""action"" goes along and along without anything that really surprises or catches the viewer's attention. Another example of Hollywood hype - if you penetrate the audience long enough, it doesn't take too long until everybody thinks they are watching a masterpiece. - All that is left in the end is a feeling of emptiness. Whoever acts surprised or shocked by the display of ballet as a world in itself, with lots of pressure, obsessions and struggle, should maybe start regarding the world with open eyes. - This movie doesn't deliver anything new or original in that field and fails as a psychological drama due to its flat and predictable storyline."

","I love cinema! I have studied film and cinematography in college as well as studied drama and have acted in numerous local stage productions throughout my life. I have also been interviewed on live television as a member of a political discussion panel and have appeared in front of millions worldwide. Impressed yet? Well, if you're not, the one thing I refuse to do to impress you is tell you that this is a fantastic movie and it is an extraordinary piece of film making. <br/><br/>A few of the previous reviewers have hit the nail on the head in their low-rating review of this film. I am here to add my own spin as I reiterate their reviews because I feel obligated to do so. Obligated because I refuse to see this film get the accolades it has been receiving without trying to bring some balance with my contrary point of view and score. I also wish to save people the cost of seeing this film on the big screen by urging potential viewers to wait until it is on DVD. If you have seen one preview/commercial of this movie then you already know all you need to know. It is merely a spectators seat at the depiction of one woman's emotional unraveling and, ultimately, her emotional liberation. That's it, nothing more.<br/><br/>Seriously. I don't know why people are so enamored with the metaphors in this film. The whole time we sat there we kept reassuring ourselves that the predictability of the scenes were part of the ultimate twist. Sadly, it is a twist that never comes. Go ahead, spend the money and the time and prove it to yourself. Then don't be afraid to speak up and ask what the big deal is all about. <br/><br/>Now I will NOT take away from Natalie Portman's INCREDIBLE performance here! She has reached a point in her craft that can only be described as breakthrough. I dare say that it is so good that it will make you re-evaluate any movie that you may have already seen her in. Particularly if you didn't care for one of her previous films; it may make you realize the shortcomings those films may have had had nothing to do with her abilities. <br/><br/>So, I'll leave it at that. I won't go on and on, trying to make you think that I must be an Hollywood insider or that I'm the next great movie reviewer. I'm a straight shooter who merely tells it like it is."

","I get it. I really do. Beautifully filmed and imagined, with excellent performances from Portman and Cassel, with the latter continuing to build on an impressive series of character roles. I get the duality, the struggle with one's-self, the domineering mother and even the psycho-sexual elements. But. And there are so many buts when thinking about this film. It was predictable, it was uninspired, it was clichéd.<br/><br/>The visuals, the score, the direction ooze considerable quality - yet are let down badly - by a poor and clichéd script. The scene where Nina's mother said, ""The career I gave up to have you!"" (it should have been me) had me wincing then chuckling; and the ageing Beth taking a swipe at the up and coming Nina by screaming ""Whore!"" (and worse!) had me rolling my eyes; and the final insult to our intelligence comes at the end when Cassel does indeed call Nina his ""princess"" (as predicted by Lily), had me checking to see if I was watching something on the True Movies channel. It even forced the stereotype of the 'diet stressed dancer' – in the scene where her mother buys a cake to celebrate her becoming the Swan Queen we hear Nina say that its too big a piece her mother has just cut - when of course it isn't. I could go on but I won't. A very poor effort indeed.<br/><br/>And it wasn't a new story. I felt as if I had seen it all before, in several different films and in several different genres. The end was predictable - the first 20 minutes of the film saw to that.<br/><br/>This film was 'clever' in many ways, but it was disappointing in many more. I am a big fan of the director, and appreciate all his technical cleverness and his interpretation. This is the type of film where the audience will either love it and consider it incredible, or see past the lovely images and ideas, and be unmoved by it. I am one of the latter."

Having read some of the reviews am I really in the minority that thinks / knows this film is not only a tragedy for Portman but an obligatory self harming frenzy for the audience.<br/><br/>Self indulgence from the director flows' the camera moves no more than a yard from Portman throughout the movie, constantly circling her and leaving everything else out. They may as well have not bothered with a set at all. Hang on...Was there a set?. It can only be likened to watching Night of the Proms from a fairground twister. If that isn't enough to make you feel sick then the failed attempts at making Portman look anything other than an angry teenager will.

The ballet scenes are masterfully directed and depicted with true passion.<br/><br/>However that didn't keep me from asking myself (after having watched the first hour of the movie) -""When is this going to end""?. The first time I saw the tearful Nina crumbling under the stress of her or her moms obsession, I could already sense where the movie was leading the viewer and what it was trying to say - an innocent and very inexperienced young girl is thrust into a world of competition, absurd physical requirements (read anorexia), unclear personal motivation, talks behind one's back and of course the obligatory overexposed sexuality.<br/><br/>Not even once did I feel so enthralled by the plot in order to believe the portrayed images and delusions. The ""Fight club""-style plot twist was obvious from the start of the movie and could only manage an underwhelming climax.<br/><br/>In my opinion the movie as a whole is not worthy of an Oscar Nomination. But if it is pretentiousness and fairly obvious conclusions of the ""Crime doesn't pay"", ""Drugs destroy life"" and ""Obsessions will swallow you whole"" type Hollywood is looking for - than by all means, two thumbs up for art for the sake of art."

","BLACK SWAN – CATCH IT ( A+ ) Black Swan is the most intense, erotic and passionate movie of 2010. Most of the time it happens that the psychological thrillers take time to throw the psyche of the movie to the audiences but Darren Aronofsky didn't play safe from the moment we are introduced to Nina (Natalie Portman) the ballet dancer, her psyche or mental state is thrown at us as she passes through the mirrors & feels somebody is following her. From there I knew that I am in for a treat, it's not the typical psychological thrillers we see normally every year. From first scene till the last scene, I was on edge of my seat and towards the ending I literally forgot to blink or even breathe because it was such a complex, intense & mind boggling thriller that I didn't wanted to miss a second of White Swan Battling Black Swan. Though during the Nina's psychological condition gets worse & even for me it was hard to understand what real & what's not? But the acquisition of ""Black Swan"" theater in the end created a spell over me and the moment Natalie Portman performance the Black Swan sequence I was literally stunned to see how gracefully or I should say aggressively she transforms into the Black Swan. I don't have perfect words to describe Natalie Portman's portrayal on Nina, she brought the elegance, the beauty, the intensity, the exoticness & the pressure of Ballet dances into the Life. Her portrayal is so honest that it actually makes you wonder what actually Ballet/Ballerina or even dancers have to go through preparations for reaching to PERFECTION. Natalie Portman completely deserves all the accolades, awards this year, she earned every bit of it & I can't wait to see her taking her Golden Globe & Oscar award. Mila Kunis was a pleasant surprise of the movie, she was right parallel to Natalie Portman because where Natalie brought the intensity, and Mila brought the sweetness to the movie. The chemistry between Natalie Portman & Mila Kunis is exceptional. Mila Kunis also deserves all the accolades & awards nominations. Vincent Cassal was cut throat Brilliant, it was amazing to see hoe he arose exoticness in Nina & then suddenly left her hanging there in Aww of him. Winona Ryder's cameo was nicely presented and she never disappoints. Barbara Hershey as over stepping & sensitive mother of Nina Sayers is incredible. Ksenia Solo as Veronica did a fine job. Benjamin Millepied as David/Prince of ""Swan Lake"" is an exceptional ballet dancer. It was just spell biding to see him gliding with Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis. Sebastian Stan and Toby Hemingway provided the perfect good looks required at the bar sequence.

","Highly stylised, intriguing production nicely woven with the Swan Lake story. But also sometimes very predictable, clichéd, and no more incisive than TV-series-level thriller.<br/><br/>There are plenty of elements of psychological horror, all of which you'll be familiar with and offer no real suspense - we've been down this road many, many times before.<br/><br/>I was expecting something darker and deeper after reading many fanboy reviews on here. I'd hoped for a treasure akin to Jacob's Ladder in psychological mainstream horror/thriller terms but ultimately this was Diet Lyne/Demme for figure-conscious ballerina types.<br/><br/>But this does sound as if I have a downer on it. No. Black Swan deserves to hold its head above the monotonous waters of 2010's film fodder.<br/><br/>It does so mainly thanks to the performance of Natalie Portman. From Leon's jailbait sidekick to yawnsome Star Wars royalty to prima ballerina, she's grown into a sometimes stunningly beautiful woman and refined actress.<br/><br/>She carries her character's dramatic personality shifts effortlessly and is completely convincing. None of the supporting cast let anyone down and all-round they work well with an occasionally fragile script.<br/><br/>The story itself is conveyed skilfully enough to absorb anyone unfamiliar with the world of ballet (hello, fellow blokes) and the dramatic hooks snag effectively to hold your attention even if the subject matter is completely alien (hello again, fellas).<br/><br/>I suspect many gushing reviews are from those who willed this forte into the ballet world to be a success and may be slightly blinkered as to its merits on a strictly thriller level.<br/><br/>All in, however, is is a welcome alternative to the usual lame fare. Doesn't deserve nominations but does deserve a mention and a recommendation for all. A good 7.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>Liked it but won't be watching again until its on terrestrial TV."
"gigadragon12","10","7","15","18 December 2010"," Black Swan (aka Everyone wants to bone Natalie Portman)
","Directed by: David Aronofsky Ho-lee crap I don't think I can quite express in words how awesome this movie was. If you need a short version, its absolutely amazing, probably the best movie this year, and shoves all the complexity of a great work of literature into some of the most interesting two hours of film ever.<br/><br/>Now then, Black Swan is about the ballet Swan Lake, in which the ballerina who plays The Swan Queen must show both the innocence and virginity of the role of the White Swan, while also playing the opposite role, the lusty and seductive Black Swan. Natalie Portman plays Nina, who is one of the hardest working dancers in her ballet company, who gets picked to play The Swan Queen. The conflict arises when her director, played by Vincent Cassel, tells her that her White Swan is perfect, but that she seems to lack in the role of the Black Swan. This is followed up by the director attempting to unleash Nina's inner Black Swan through means of seducing her, and waiting for her to go and seek her darker persona.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nina's Mother is over-bearing and highly protective of her, in what ends up being a very psycho kind of obsessive nature. Also, Mila Kunis plays Lily, who is the opposite of Nina, perfect at the Black Swan, but not the ideal White Swan. Nina feels pressure from her director to adapt to the Black Swan, pressure from her Mother to remain the White Swan, and pressure from Lily's presence and the possibility that she will lose her role as Swan Queen to her.<br/><br/>All of this is built up over the fact that Nina herself is popping up all over the place with bloody wounds, scratch marks, and in general experiencing a full on mental breakdown, in more ways than one. When it all combines it brings the damn house down.<br/><br/>What is really so great about Black Swan is how seamless all of this feels. There isn't a single moment in the film that feels forced. Every aspect of it is set up early and remains as much a part of the film until the very end. The psychological aspect presents itself slower than most, but makes up for it by ruling over the final act of the movie. Furthermore, the pressures that Nina feels are not the pressures of a ballerina that has to play The Swan Queen, they are the pressures that everyone feels, pressures of parents, pressures of playing your role, pressures of competition, all of it applies universally across men and women. Once the movie wraps up it seems to be about breaking everyone's expectations, rising to the challenge, and doing what you want to do.<br/><br/>But this aspect also bring out other more challenging aspects of playing a role. Nina is originally seduced largely by her director, what she does subsequently largely has to do with how she is told to adapt to the role. The movie seems to play an underscore about how far do you go to break the expectations? Furthermore, whose expectations are you really playing for? At what point do you stop being yourself and become your role? The complexity of all this is all presented really well, through beautiful dance scenes, and a brilliant classical score. This movie has blood, sex, dance, and art, all mixed up together in a blend that has been seen before, but nowhere near as great as it is presented here.<br/><br/>If you like movies, you'll love Black Swan. This is absolutely a must-see!! Go see it now. Now! NOW!!!"
"Braddigan","9","7","15","13 December 2010"," Deflowering the repressed
","Darren Aronofsky is no stranger to the psychological thriller, a sub- genre Black Swan fits in comfortably. Like Aronofsky's first film, Pi, Black Swan depicts an internal struggle between selves, the grappling for equilibrium, and the external manifestations of mental disintegration. However it is more dramatic and more transparent. No shock-value gimmicks here. The sufficiently clever viewer (not necessarily me) can vaguely project the trajectory of the film from early on. As ""The Gentleman"" and stage director, played by Vincent Cassel, says by way of describing Swan Lake: ""Everybody knows the story...""<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Black Swan is far from predictable. Suffused with tension and suspense, Aronofsky massages fear and apportions violence and beauty in equal measure. Natalie Portman, apparently a life-long dancer, provides a stunning performance as actress and ballerina. She is enchanting and convincing: she seems like a real pro to amateur eyes. Similarly, Mila Kunis and the rest are stellar dancers and unendingly lovely. Cassel provides a subtle turn as the devious and brilliant theater director. Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder's characters are tragic and forsaken souls with just the right amount of darkness, threat, and suffering.<br/><br/>There is a lot to Black Swan. It is symbolically rich and provides all kinds of food for thought for psychological analysis. It's also just good drama, with strong characterization and performances. To top it all off, the soundtrack, at turns pulsating menace and sweeping to salvation, and the claustrophobic, person-centered cinematography make the viewer feel the repression, passion, and fear at every turn. Aronofsky has shown that the psychological thriller is still fertile ground for imaginative, but accessible film-making."
"Meven_Stoffat","3","12","30","29 December 2010"," A lot of pretty pictures, but not a lot of story
","Look guys, I do ""get it"". Before you tell me to ""go watch a Die Hard box set"", let me say that I am an adult moviegoer and I see at least 50 smaller/indie/foreign/what have you movies a year. So therefore that defense it totally useless. OK, now let's get on with the review.<br/><br/>I'm not really down with Darren Aronofsky to begin with. I saw Requiem For A Dream When I was teen and boy, that film messed me up good. I was compelled to watch it after being shown a compilation of clips in an anti-drug presentation, so I sought out my friend, who has quite possibly the biggest DVD collection ever. After it was done... well let's say that movie taught me my lesson about drugs well enough. In the following years his films didn't really do much- Pi was an incomprehensible mess, The Fountain I watched 3 times and didn't get, and The Wrestler started off nice but ended poorly. However, I was interested in Black Swan when I saw the trailer with Paranormal Activity 2, so tonight I finally saw it.<br/><br/>About the dancing scenes, as much as I actively participate in dance but know nothing about ballet, I thought they were well done. Like I said, I know absolutely nothing about ballet, so you best not trust my judgement. I thought Natalie Portman did a fantastic job, and I totally believed that Natalie did her own dancing. I thought the cast did pretty good jobs considering they were not dancers to begin with. Natalie's performance is, of course, the reason to see the movie. She is pure cash money with each performance, and this movie shows. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey were good too. Oh and the movie looked pretty too. That's where the praise unfortunately stops.<br/><br/>Basically people seem to be raving over nothing but just a middle-of-the-road horror-thriller, but with bits of weird sex added in and several over-the-top shock moments that seemed more unintentionally hilarious than shocking. Basically it's just Mulholland Drive with any being able to care for the characters taken out (We even get the obligatory lesbian sex scene- just minus having a place). In other words, you're getting a typical messed up girl story. I didn't really feel for the Nina character at all. For one, I dunno why she wouldn't just get a red flag when Vincent Cassel's character forced a kiss on her, or when he told her to touch herself. Yet somehow she's smart enough to lash out at her over-controlling mom and tell her ""I'm not 12 anymore"" and dump the plush toys down the garbage disposal.<br/><br/>Truth be told, Black Swan is honestly just an incoherent mess. There are moments of brilliance, which all go to naught when something that reduces you to laughter (at an inappropriate moment too) comes. Yeah as you guessed, I laughed at several moments that weren't meant to be funny. Like when Nina masturbates and finds her mom in the room. Or Winona Ryder going all joker on herself. The film looks nice, has good special effects and performances, but you can dress up a pig in fancy clothing and it's still a pig.<br/><br/>Oh, but what do I know. Like most Oscar bait nowadays, this film will go to win awards and enjoy a bit of hype for a while. And then, of course, like any other movie, people are going to regret the hype and it will end up on most people's overrated lists.<br/><br/>Cue people telling me ""I don't get it"". Shame on me for being honest, I guess."

It took me a while to get into this, it takes a while to build and I was worried I was going to be watching a movie about a ballet dancer moaning about her life, but man does it pick up! The music does wonders, and the team have managed to fuse the movie well with music everyone is familiar with. Swan Lake, something everyone is familiar with, is suddenly all very new, and it's dark and disturbing territory.<br/><br/>A wonderful performance from Natalie Portman with an excellent supporting cast (Winona seems to be clawing her way back).<br/><br/>Excellent visuals which reach an epic crescendo in the 2nd and 3rd acts of the eventual opening night of 'Swan Lake'. As the screen faded to black with a roaring crowd and blasting classical music I got shivers down my spine.<br/><br/>I would definitely agree with one of the other posters, at times this movie feels like a horror, I could see other audience members hiding behind magazines during one particularly tense scene.<br/><br/>In the words of Nina, it's 'PERFECT'."

","In New York, the twenty-eight year-old Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a dedicated and perfectionist ballerina of the ballet company that lives with her controller mother and former ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey). The director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to renovate the company for the next season that will open with the Swan Lake with a new face and retires the prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder). Nina is his first option to perform The Swan Queen, perfect for the role of the White Swan, but too restrained to perform the Black Swan. Nina feels threatened by the newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis), who can perfectly perform the Black Swan, and is stressed with the situation. When Nina has a nervous breakdown, she gets in contact with her dark side and has constant nightmarish daydreams.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is a beautiful but predictable film of Darren Aronofsky, with a cinematography that gives a nightmarish environment to the story that is too dark for a drama and too dramatic for a horror movie. Natalie Portman has a great performance but her character is too naive and with lack of confidence for a New Yorker indicated to be the prima ballerina of a ballet company. The theme is a variation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with the case of split personality but the film does not justify the hype around it.

"hknakna","6","15","40","6 December 2010"," Poor Odette...Poor Odile...
","An anonymous NYC ballet company takes on a bold new interpretation of 'Swan Lake'. Unfortunately, the production, aside from some visually arresting moments, is anything but. The fact that Mr. Aronofsky, whom I greatly admire, was unable to deliver even a simulacrum of a new swan experience may be at the heart of why the film falters.<br/><br/>Having been a dancer myself, I am reflexively attracted to all things dance but even the hypnotic effect of Tchaikovsky's music couldn't save the film. Aronofsky uses the mirror image both as a visual device and as a plot device but in neither case is he able to get past surface reflection. Where in the 'Wrestler' and even in 'Requiem"" he deftly navigates the 'mind' field of human weakness, strength, depravity, longing, and loneliness, here there are only incoherent fragments. Nina (our protagonist) is a woman whose age I continue to wonder about. The room she occupies, in her overbearing mother's apartment, remains prepubescent and it's highly likely that this very beautiful woman/child is still a virgin who has never even masturbated. It's not that this scenario is completely implausible but it's disturbed enough to need some substantiation. Perhaps Aronofsky has only a two dimensional view of women and their interests portraying them as strippers with hearts, prostitutes with hearts and in this case childlike, suicidal 'little princesses' with hearts.<br/><br/>Though Ms. Portman gives it her best, and I applaud the effort, I keep thinking that this movie would have been more credible if he had chosen to work with an actual mid-level, aspiring ballerina. I believe we would have forgiven unpolished acting for the more authentic experience. Actually, I've never been a fan of Ms. Portman's and Darren surely leaves her in a lurch with this wafer thin study of an emotionally stunted and psychologically complex character that is well beyond this actresses ability to make coherent. That said, I enjoyed Barbara Hershey's performance, and found myself thinking, ""I've missed her"", more than once during the showing. It doesn't seem worth mentioning any of the other performances.<br/><br/>There are some thrilling visual effects throughout but a few too many trite mirror phantoms that, unfortunately, overshadow the truly awe inspiring transformation of Nina/Odette into a black swan in the third act.<br/><br/>Sadly, over it's entirety, the film lacks arc and believability, and I very much wanted to swoon over this film."

As you watch the film you can almost plot what is going to happen next, based on the films I listed above. Winona rider is Gina Gershon in Showgirls. Barbara Hershey is Piper Laurie in Carrie.

"bwoodin08","3","12","31","25 December 2010"," Bizarre and Painful Film
","I cannot understand all the rave reviews for this tortured and tortuous dark and brooding film. It is painful to see a young vibrant dancer turn into a demonized pathetic wretch, with plenty of help from her cunning unscrupulous director, a rival dancer who plays mind games and sexual games with her at a drug and alcohol fueled nightclub. Not to mention a harridan of a mother who alternately smothers her into childish submission and praises her ability to win the title role in ""Swan Lake"". An ambitious film, it just goes off in too many directions. Nina has emotional, physical and mental problems that send her spinning out of control. She self-mutilates, indulges in sexual dalliances, fears she can't handle the role, but wills herself to play the menacing ""Black Swan"" by going deep into a place she cannot control. If it's a movie about lack of control of one's life, Darren Aronofsky got that right, but it's not up there on my list of must see films - in fact, I'd forgo it and see a film that didn't leave me feeling like I needed a hot shower to cleanse my spirit! The movie is soulless and surreal, utterly devoid of any humanity."

The darkness was too well hidden and just didn't make sense, IMHO. It was also a little shocking to see how skinny Ms. Portman got to portray this role - you may not want to let your impressionable daughters watch this.

"hitchcockthelegend","7","5","10","26 February 2011"," Aronofsky dabbles in mirrors, triplicates and the doppelgänger effect.
","Black Swan is directed by Darren Aronofsky and co-written by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz & John McLaughlin. It stars Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey & Winona Ryder. Clint Mansell scores the music and Matthew Libatique is the cinematographer.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Portman) is committed to her art as a ballet dancer, she lives a secular life with her over protective mother (Hershey), herself a one time dancer. When Nina's ballet company announce that a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake is seeking a new prima to play the Swan Queen, Nina pushes herself still further to land the role. But with the role comes more pressures. Her instructor, Thomas (Cassell) urges her to explore darker passions within so as to nail the Black Swan part of the role, her mother becomes even more over-bearing and a new arrival to the production, Lily (Kunis), pushes her fragile state of mind to the limit. Perhaps more worrying is that Nina appears to have a doppelgänger lurking within her enclosed world.<br/><br/>Black Swan, once the dust has settled, will prove to be a most divisive film. More so when under the scrutiny of a repeat viewing. How it holds up after the exhilaration of that first viewing has faded will be most interesting to observe. For Black Swan ""is"" at times ""exhilarating"", brilliantly performed by its cast principals, and in Aronofsky's hands it's directed with a hand-held panache befitting one of America's most talented directors: but is it the sum of its parts? Aronofsky has been quick to let people know that he views Black Swan as the sibling to The Wrestler, and fact is is that he reworks a lot of that film's particular aspects into this Swan Lake skin itcher; only now he's cloaking his subject in the darker side of the human mental condition. So if it isn't broke, don't fix it then. Be it the back drops (dim and raw), specialist entertainment professions or the suffering for their art central characters, Aronofsky clearly isn't pushing for a career reinvention here. However, he ups his ante visually and shows himself to be a dab hand at psychological horror. Other critics have name checked the likes of Polanski, De Palma and Cronenberg, those are all fair comparisons, and in the grand scheme of things, enormous pats on the back for Aronofsky.<br/><br/>He is also a director able to get career defining performances out of his charges, many have been quick to remember Mickey Rourke's much lauded turn as The Wrestler, lets not forget the performance he garnered out of Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream, too. Portman, tho, tops both considerably, pushing herself, like her character, to the limit for the role; with her director now on record after Portman's win for Best Actress at the BAFTA's as saying she's the best actress he has worked with thus far. Both Portman and Kunis undertook months of ballet training to put some reality into the film, with Portman gaining praise for her dancing in ballet circles. But from here is where the problems in the film begin to unravel. Ballet dancers we know are driven, it's a tough form of the arts, but in some quarters of the medium the film has been criticised for portraying the dancers negatively, and for over exaggerating their lives. It's a good point, because my lady partner who I first watched the film with felt that Nina comes across as a whiney whinger, and she is right. Nina as a character is hard to feel any sympathy for. This is more evidently annoying upon a second viewing, so much so it's debatable if you will even care about Nina once the applause has died down at the finale. Great performance, but written as unsympathetic or otherwise? Eh?<br/><br/>Another issue is the matter of sense, or the not making of to be exact. Many greats behind the camera have thrived on producing head scratchers, complex pieces designed to nag away at you as you try to sleep. The narrative here doesn't suggest anything complex, yet incidents don't add up, with one critical incident rendering the finale as questionable. It's also awash with clichés, but the crafty Aronofsky is able to mask such issues with smoke and mirror tactics, calling on his skills to avert the eyes with enjoyable visual flourishes that are essential to the tonal flow of his film. Technically all is wonderful and at times rawly lurid, sweeping cameras getting up close and personal, the music, the choreography and the grandiose sets, all impact hard on the viewing experience. While the film's blending of themes opens it up to a wider demographic audience; even if ultimately it's caught in the void between camp horror and serious psychological drama. Away from Portman the support is also crowd pleasing, Kunis is sly and slinky, Cassell is Mephistophelian and Hershey reminds us all that she can act.<br/><br/>It's sure to be a the top of many critics best of lists for 2010/2011, partly for being not of the norm and asking for use of the cranium: and partly because director and lead actors make it compulsive viewing. While it's sure to engage fans of dance and classical music. But after taking off the tutu and slippers, and unwinding with a glass of wine, it shows itself to be a film that's far from flawless, and certainly not the masterpiece that already some insist the film to be. Maybe it should be watched just once and not pored over to truly get the benefit? Maybe? 7.5/10"

","Seems like a weak and predictable attempt at going for a Fight Club like result. Storyline is totally predictable and unoriginal. Natalie Portman is well, but not astonishing and losing weight or learning some ballet doesn't make up for poor character construction and really just being herself throughout the movie. The directing is very poor, severely wanting steady-cam for the first 15 minutes or so, and totally missing glorious beauty factor that should be there for any great ballet inspired movie, having only a few truly beautiful scenes. Comes out as disturbed and not disturbing, unnecessarily violent and not strong, cheap instead of sensual. As some others have said a lame pseudo-thriller/horror movie attempting to go by as an art movie. Grows towards the ending, but predictability and lack of good art direction really ruins the moment. A true disappointment and a waste of money, especially considering the great reviews it's been having. Another example of movie industry and critics going in the opposite direction of what good film making is supposed to be, choosing weird over good, disturbed over moving, appearance over greatness. Goes straight to the list of movies I would rather not have wasted my time on."

","I went to Black Swan with trepidation - expecting, hoping against, but unfortunately getting, a Horror film. All of the trappings of horror were there, in profusion - the shocking around-the-corner, over-the-rim-of-the-bathtub reveals, the violent thrums of music, the continual anticipation of violence. I have been a long-time moviegoer and perhaps, as a younger fellow, I could enjoy horror and violence in a way that is now more troubling for me, but for this film I had hoped that the power of the story, the setting, the performances would outweigh any tendency of the film to dwell in horror. The performances were great, the staging and dancing great - I loved Nina's final metamorphosis into the black swan and her back stage swagger and shimmy, but alas... <br/><br/>As the movie progressed, I still held out hope that rather than having to watch a descent into violent madness we might see instead a reckless, but finally satisfying, immersion of an artist into a role, which to me is a more compelling, more instructive, and less awful outcome.

The white and the black?,,Right after that line we see a short shot of a Thomas's reflection,split in 2 mirrors(suggesting split personality or ,,dissociative identity disorder,, of Nina to come?).In Wikipedia article about this disorder,it says that many ppl suffering from it were sexually abused as a child.Hints about sexual abuse of Nina:Nina's mom offering Nina to lick cream from her finger in an unpleasant manner.Nina blocking the door in few occasions in a manner that suggest fear from mom.And finally,scene where Lily is going down on Nina where we can see face of someone else on Lily for a split second...pause that scene and look that face-Actress playing Nina's mom made to look younger?Now read the next part of the script: -Erica tries to enter Nina's room but the door won't open as Nina has placed a piece of wood between her wall and door- Nina Sayers: Don't come in here! Erica Sayers: What's this? Nina Sayers: It's called privacy! I'm not twelve anymore!(was abused when she was 12?) Erica Sayers: You're not my Nina right now! Nina Sayers: Leave me alone! 4.Nina is trying to dance for black swan,Thomas is yelling/putting pressure on her.As she is spinning we are looking at Thomas's face from Nina's eyes.We see it in brief after each of Nina's rotation.NOW,look at the last shot of Thomas's face-Its going down in a strange manner(NINA HAS FAINTED-but we don't see it because hallucination continued where reality stopped)Lily enters and Thomas says:,,Well,good of you to join us,,(he is speaking to Nina who woke.)HA! 5.Lily and Nina alone in the dancing hall.Lily lights a cigarette. Nina Sayers: You can't smoke in here. Lily: Well, I won't tell if you won't.(Well DUUH,you are living in Nina's head ) Near the end of the movie,Nina returns the stuff that she stoled to Beth(Last thing she puts on the table is a pack of cigarettes 6.Nina and Erica are talking and the talk is becoming unpleasant.They hear a doorbell and Erica opens.She returns after few second and says that its nobody.Nina opens again and starts imagining Lily.Notice how mom doesn't talk to Lily and is acting like there is nobody there. (Someone actually rang and exchanged few sentence with Erica then left.It was a mistake so she says,,nobody,,)So Nina goes to town with her imagined friend.I am having hard time explaining to myself the interaction between Nina,Liliy and two guys in town...I have idea but this post is getting to long so I leave it to The Lounge 7.Guys in the club ask the girls:Tom: So you two sisters? -at the same time- Lily: Yes. Nina Sayers: No.(Me:hmmmm) Lily: Blood sisters.(Me:hmmmmmmm) Nina Sayers: We dance in the same company.(Me:ahhhh WTF,for ***** sake,I will figure this out with the help of The Lounge) 8.Scene where Nina and Lily are back in Nina's place after night out.Erica is awake and starts to question Nina about her night out.NOTICE the interesting shot of Nina and Lily SPLITTING then mom asks: Erica Sayers: Where have you been? Nina Sayers: To the moon and back.(we see Lily as she whispers ,,...and back,, in the same time while Nina is answering to mom...conclude for yourself ppl heh.Also,mom seems oblivious to the presence of Lily...strange?-VERY. 9.Scene where Thomas and Nina are talking about Lily...Thomas:I know it's been a struggle. But you just had a break through this morning. Tomorrow's yours, just give a great performance and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else. Now, go home and rest. ,,I know it's been a struggle,, maybe means that Thomas is aware of Ninas mental issues.,,break through this morning,, meaning:Erica called to let him know that Nina is sick but she decided to show up and fight with her illness (definition of break through-,,An act of overcoming or penetrating an obstacle or restriction,,).,,Lily or anybody else,,(maybe Lily isn't Nina's first imaginery friend/alter ego. 10.And finally,Nina stabbed Lily(No,Nina stabbed Nina)...I hope this post was helpfull."

Complicating the former with the latter, for me, is totally unbelievable.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, we come to realize that much of the unsavory behaviors of the surrounding cast is really only projections of Nina's psychosis. And while Nina's aberrant behavior comes part and parcel with the syndrome plaguing her, the scenes of graphic self-mutilation could have been just as effective with a more Hitchcockian approach or simply left on the cutting room floor. It was these scenes, most of all, that destroyed this film for me.<br/><br/>All-in-all, my first impression upon leaving the theater was...'Well that's 2 hours of my life I'm not getting back'. It was only after further reflection that I felt a rating of 3 out of 10 was warranted....instead of a 1.<br/><br/>That said...this movie will continue to be feted and garner numerous award nominations. And while Natalie Portman will receive the Best Actress nomination many times over...I fear the star who pulled the movie together will be neglected. That is Mila Kunis as Lily. She was entirely believable as both the young understudy and as the evil interloper in Nina's psychotic fantasies. Without Mila's strong performance, this movie would have completely failed."

It was somewhat confusing in it's theme. It skipped back and forth between reality and fantasy. I wasn't sure what was what. The mother's role was a little twisted, I didn't quite understand her role. The other dancers associations to 'the swan' were strange, jealousy, anger, pride, revenge...

","In Black Swan, Darren Aronofsky creates a nightmarish world that the audience is viscerally thrown into, with continuous twists and surprises at every step of the way, never knowing what will happen next. We only hope there is some salvation at the end. Black Swan is created by one of the most passionate bright young filmmakers alive. The camera style is more regimented and thoughtfully composted compared to the cinema verite, looser, documentary style of The Wrestler. Every shot is perfectly thought out, and the use of mirrors in this film is simply magnificent. The monochromatic colour tone is stunning and at all times the colour palette of everything in shot is tempered to enhance the story. Especially in the wardrobe coloring. The Wrestler was based in the real world, the world we all live in, where a man is grappling with the failures in life, has a daughter, works part-time as a butcher, falls for a stripper and tries to resurrect his fledgling career. It deals with his ego and his determination. Its almost documentary in style. Black Swan is a film sprung from Darren Aronofsky's imagination, aided by a team of talented writers. It is a dark tale of ones inner struggle with perfection. In essence the film centers on the central character of Nina Sayers as she grapples with life as a star ballerina. She does all she can to find perfection within her self and with others. We go into the depths of her mind, and at times the film is as frightening as a Polanski film, at its best. Natalie Portman went on a rigorous training regime for this film and it shows, her performance is mature, dark and stunning. I can continue to write numerous pages on pledging my love for this film but I wont waste my time, or yours, as if you need further information on this, the web is abound with it. When Darren Aronofsky was recently talking about his next film, The Wolverine he made a very interesting point ""I'm just trying to have fun, and for the first time in my life Every single film I've done so far, I've been the only person in the room who wants to make the movie, And I kind of am excited about doing a film (The Wolverine) where actually everyone wants to make it — just to see what the experience is like and see if I can do what I do in that world. It's not like I'm going to change my process. I'm going to be working with the same team and makingreally trying to do something very, very different. In more extensive interviews with Aronofsky he speaks about the struggle for funding Black Swan, as he mentioned in that interview ""Every single film I've done so far, I've been the only person in the room who wants to make the movie"", and it takes brave filmmakers like that to make those great films, that no one wants to make, which are not normal or average. He took a risk, no one wanted to make this crazy film, but the audience has won, we have this film. Once again, this film is not average, it is not formulaic, it is not a normal film. It is unique, stunning and suspenseful in every cinematic sense. It proves that cinema in the hands of giants becomes a canvas for creating beauty, art and entertainment. Black Swan gets under your skin, creeps into your veins, pumps through your heart and sets fire to your imagination."
"ryangozlan","9","6","13","3 January 2011"," 'Black Swan' - Obsession Takes Control
","Though it is no masterpiece like Requiem For A Dream in my opinion, Aronofsky has made another good (but not excellent) movie in Black Swan. As I sat next to my buddy, he turned to me and asked, are we in a ballet or something? I couldn't help but laugh as I some would agree with that statement, though I was a little more open minded than my movie counterpart. There was scenes in the film that blew you away (and even made you feel a little uncomfortable), then there were scenes were you would have you saying enough ballet already, when is this scene going to pick up? Regardless of the films ups and downs, it managed to keep you interested for the majority of the film, which is what a good and director film does. There is little reason to believe that Black Swan won't be nominated for Best Picture at this year's Oscars, but in my opinion has a slim chance of actually winning, especially with this year's competition. Now, let's get something straight, I'm not here to rip this film to pieces, I'm just stating that my personal opinion that the film was a little different the most critics. With that being said, it is still a great piece of film making, with great directing, pace, and of course outstanding performances (especially from Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>The cast in this movie was nothing short of spectacular. From Natalie Portman all the way down to Wynona Ryder, the acting in this film was extremely well done. Well let's start with the male lead in this role, played by French actor Vincent Cassell (Eastern Promises). Cassell was outstanding as the egotistical, seductive yet brilliant ballet teacher, displaying the characters strong, confident and desirable actions perfectly. The actor was able to make you hate him at times, but also respect him as well depending on the different scenes in the film. Mila Kunis, who is known for more comical roles, didn't disappoint playing Lily (or the Black Swan). Her ability to play nice and gentle, while also competitive and ruthless, really allowed for great character development with the other lead in the film, The Swan Queen herself, Natalie Portman. For those of you who thought Natalie could only play the sweet and gentle type, go out and see Black Swan because in this film she juggles her characters emotions perfectly. At first the actress plays the sweet and gentle Nina Seyers we are all use too, but quickly gets more in touch with her dark side, changing into an obsessed and evil girl immersed in her role as the Swan Queen (which eventually destroys her). The actress does a fantastic job toying with audiences emotions, playing innocent and graceful (as the White Swan) while also being guile and sensuality .The buzz has been roaring for her to receive the Academy Award for best actress, and I can now see why. Her performance was perfect, warranting her an Oscar nomination, and most likely a win. <br/><br/>Though the movie could be perceived as horror, i'd like to think of it as more of a dramatic thriller. Aronofsky plays with your emotions so well, sometimes making you sad, while at other times absolutely frightened. His similar directing style to The Wrestler was present throughout this film. His use of playing to the actors back with his camera was done well once again, allowing for the scene to feel more real and suspenseful feel for the audience. His dark style of directing allowed for the film to give off that uneasiness feeling you experience with most thrillers. Even though some would think of this film as a ballet concert, Aronofsky does an excellent job of deflecting that focus with plot twists, lustful/thrilling scenes, and brilliant acting from his talented cast. <br/><br/>Black Swan is a movie highlighted by obsession, jealousy, envy, sex and pure lust. It is a film that plays with your emotions, taking you on a roller coaster ride of gentle and moving scenes, to more disturbing and uneasy ones. It is a film that highlights how obsession and immersion of a particular role can lead to the downfall and life of a person who was once so gentle. It makes you think, confused, and intrigued at the same time, with great directing and performances alike. Although critics are raving about this film, I'm going to score it as an A- simply because it is not a movie that everyone will like, and doesn't muster up to Aronofsky's masterpiece, Requiem For A Dream. I will go ahead and say that this film is definitely worth seeing, and will keep you entertained for the majority of the film. For those of you who think they are going to watch a ballet recital, don't, as Aronofsky does an incredible job of shifting the focus of ballet into spooky, thrilling and captivating scenes. Get to a theater near you and check out Black Swan!"

","Black Swan and Inception are the best films of 2010, but Black Swan stands out as the most stirring film. Portman was marvelous, and the film provides a setting that enthralls the viewer. From the very beginning of the film, reality is constantly in question--in a very pleasing fashion. The mystery of Nina's sanity is well hidden. This film also delivers a well portrayed sexuality while simultaneously depicting a perverse community of dancers. If I could give this film an 11 out of 10, I would. The protagonist's mother is another character that spices up the film. There is always a certain tension between the two characters the causes the viewer constantly expect some sort of violence; the build up in itself becomes almost sexual. I had to laugh out loud at that. I thought this film was well cast, marvelously written, well directed, and incredible to watch."
"Michael Fargo","10","6","13","19 December 2010"," This is pretty grand, Guignol
","Truthfully, if I had to sit through one more preview of the trailer of this film, I thought I was going to scream. Aronofsky is someone I just don't get, and the deluge of publicity for this film as well as all the award nominations made my heart sink that I would have to man-up and buy a ticket to see ""Black Swan."" The big surprise is this is the most coherent film Aronofsky has managed to make. And good for him! I could finally join the legions who applaud him. I was, however, reminded often of two Polanski films: ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" But I won't begrudge the achievement. This is a rip roaring horror film on tippy toes.<br/><br/>The heart of the film belongs to Natalie Portman. Just go ahead and give her all the awards. She's magnificent. But so are her costars, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder and the incredible Barbara Hershey. But to be honest, I couldn't wait for Mila Kunis to reappear in whatever scene was next, usually precluded with a slamming door; she's absolutely riveting.<br/><br/>While the hook here is ballet (and it's all very well accomplished and convincing, which is admirable) this might as well have been a Freddy Krueger film. Quite a few scenes are (were) unwatchable. And the suspense/dread Aronofsky creates earns the price of admission.<br/><br/>While I won't say it's the best film of the year, Ms. Portman elevates it to something near that. While it pawns itself off as a study of the stress put on performing artists, it's really just a good scary film. And it's a great job from everyone involved."
"Soundstage8","9","6","13","17 December 2010"," A gorgeous horror movie
","If this movie looks attractive, it is. But don't go into it with a weak stomach. Darren Aronofsky weaves a subtle epic with Black Swan: the story of a fiercely dedicated ballerina and the trials and tribulations she endures while preparing for the role of the Swan Queen in her troupe's performance of Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Black Swan is horrifically terrifying, romantically evil, violently sexy and masterfully nuanced. The entire cast of characters are flawless, but Natalie Portman stands out in one of the best performances I've ever seen. But much of what makes Black Swan reverberate within me are the workings of director Darren Aronofsky.<br/><br/>There are so many positive things I could say here it's hard to narrow it down. The camera work is great. The closeups are effective, the steadicam shots are tantalizing and the dancing scenes are exquisite. The audience moves and breathes with Portman as the camera weaves and sways with her: graceful and misleadingly innocent amidst the true horror story of mental collapse.<br/><br/>The pace drives the film. At times it is slow to mislead the viewer and build the tension, and other times it feels like the film is an out of control car careening toward something we know is there but don't want to see, only to stop short and abruptly and fall back on the delicacy of its innate beauty.<br/><br/>Every scene is a marvel, every motion of Natalie Portman's face, every shimmer of her eyes builds upon her character and moves her psyche forward to insanity as the film goes on. But speaking of good acting, let's not forget about Mila Kunis, who is perfectly devious in her aptly named character of ""Lily/ black swan."" I would say Black Swan is a must see, but it isn't for everyone. That being said I still give it probably a 9/10. I've never seen a gorgeous horror movie before.<br/><br/>""perfect"""

"coltonschropp","7","7","16","16 November 2010"," One hell of a movie
","Darren Arnofsky has gone through a change of taste in filmmaking within the past 10 years and after the first decade of the 21st century he topped it off with one of his best. Black Swan is a fascinating story that brings snippets of different aspects from all his movies combined with the very profound story of a belle dancer which creates this very beautiful film. The blacks,whites, and subtle pinks in the set design bring such a unique feeling that most movies are not doing now a days. Portman and Kunis's roles were articulated perfectly to the very last bit of dialouge. But the things that really made me give this movie a 8 rather than a 10 is the music and some of the special effects were a bit of a let down for me. The epic Lux Aterna from Requiem to the sorrow filled compositions of the fountain to this was no comparison. The Wrestlers music had done the same to me as Black Swan too.Anyone who is a Arnofsky fan should go see it though no matter what. Its in the top 10 best movies of the year in my book. Hope this helps."

","Have you ever thought what is success for an artist? Have you ever broken down any their perfomance into pieces?<br/><br/>Being aspire to become the superstar, the perfect and unique artist, a person might lose his control and with his actions blur the border between the light and dark. Then the dark can swallow you whole without any chance to survive and become the previous version of yourself...<br/><br/>The film ""Black Swan"" can push you to start thinking about above-mentioned, about perfection and idealism overall. Some things in our life we try to do perfectly. Pressure from many aspects could change our personality and all our wishes might be only about being perfect. But nobody knows how it is incredibly hard to achieve the highest level in a perfomance. In this film one specific subject was revealed. It's a ballet. However, in my opinion, the showing story could happen in any sphere.
Here is one ballerina, being always under control and over loved from her mother, having only one dream in her life to be a great artist, she embodied herself into a character giving away whole her mind and soul to this performance. Actually, it was real and breathtaking performance if only it wasn't the last performance in her life. It shows us that artists really put all their physical and emotional efforts in their performances. People can reach glory only in this way and many of us couldn't image how hard it could be. And really, geniuses and successful people might become the most outstanding people only by sacrificing something and it is a bitter true.<br/><br/>But if we really think about this deeply and carefully, we can realize that it doest't worth all the torments. People are really becoming crazy on the way to achive a success. They lose humanity and empathy to each other trying to achive their own goals. But it's not the main problem, the worst thing that they become to hate theirselves without seeing any progress. And now worth thinking about this, is it really worth of this? I mean the glory and the celebrity? Or if you became better than Your Yesterday Version, it could be enough to feel happy? Everyone can find the answer by themselves."

It's an artsy fartsy film that borrows (or should that be steels) from other films I have seen before. Many clichés are strewn throughout the film and the cinematography and directing doing nothing to improve the overall lack of enjoyment in what turns out to be a very confusing film as Nina succumbs more and more to her hallucinations. Nina being a meek, insipid, mild character would never have been given the starring role in a real ballet company and as for her searching for her bad side so that she could get and therefore play the bad swan well the way they went about it was, quite frankly, absolutely ridiculous! The hallucinations become really ridiculous to the point where you don't know if she is still hallucinating at the end or not! And why is she hallucinating anyway? She is not on some type of hallucinogenic drug so why is she hallucinating? If you are exploring your dark side and trying to find it you wouldn't hallucinate while doing!

"ironhorse_iv","7","3","5","14 December 2014"," There is nothing uplifting about this film. Black Swan is just one depressing unpleasant movie.
","Not to be confused with the 1940s Tyrone Power's film, 'The Black Swan', this Black Swan is a very haunting film. Directed by Darren Aronofsky, the movie is a psychological thriller-horror flick about a committed ballet dancer, Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) in a competition between rival, Lily (Mila Kunis) trying to get the lead role of the dark and sensual Black Swan in the company production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. You really do see, her character overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare. The film is a twisted coming-of-age story. Even though Nina is a woman, she is very child-like, as she hasn't yet gone through experiences that usually occur much earlier in a girls' life such as body image issues, and coming to terms with sexuality. Due to this late adolescence development, Nina might not be all there. Natalie Portman is very much, deserving winning the Oscars: Best Actress award that year. She is a perfect fit for the role. I enjoy how the film was shot. The mirrors shots were used very good as it got us to the depth of Nina's dark side persona. I love all the dream like hallucinations. You really don't know, if she's dreaming up this nightmare, or if it's happening in the film. Lots of freeze-frame replay value, as several times, the movie blurs surrealism with reality. I like how one of Nina's mother's (Barbara Hershey) paintings appears to move slightly in an early scene, foreshadowing Nina's madness later. If you blink for one second, you might miss some really awesome split-second morphing such as Nina's Black Swan or White eye costume, or people's faces morphing into that of Thomas (Vincent Cassell). Blurred imagery of a nude woman can be seen in at least three frames, as well. Lots of scary imagery. There were some very eerie scenes in the movie, like the finger peeling scene. It was the one that got me, cinching. It had that David Cronenberg-style madness. The twist toward the end was great, even if it was kinda stupid. Maybe, I was hoping too much for a 2008's Wrestler type of an end. The movie was really a good thriller, but it really push the buttons on my feelings, and I really came out of the movie, kinda unhappy. Don't get me wrong, there were a few moments that were good. I like the use of classical music. The soundtrack is very engaging to listen to. I like how there were some semi-funny scenes like how Nina's mom can be a bit overbearing. Then, there was that really hot sexy scene that a lot of people love. Still, it kinda had that dirty feeling when watching it. The scene where Nina is masturbating is strangely uncomfortable. Even the much-anticipated lesbian sex scene is designed to deter rather than titillate the audience. The film does have some clever symbolism as it relates to the ballet play, Swan Lake. There are tons of Swan Lake Easter eggs throughout the film. In addition to that play, there's also some to Edgar Allan Poe's William Wilson, about a man with an opposite-natured doppleganger and the Greek myth of Icarus. Aronofsky also cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ""The Double"" as another inspiration for the film. Lots of meaningful names here, as well. Nina literally means ""little girl"" and is often used in diminutives of Russian names, showing how babied she is by her mother Erica. Lily reminiscent the name of Lilith, infamous demon and seductress of the night. The symbolism of Lily's tattoo, flower, symbolizes purity and the color white, as well as death and resurrection. Even with all visuals, the movie lacks good dialogue to go with it. It went a little excessive in the use of special effects. I was reading that the original screenplay, The Understudy written by Andres Heinz was a little more entertaining, with 1950's All About Eve drama set in the off-Broadway world. I just wish, this movie had that, too. Overall: It's an art-house masterpiece, but it doesn't translate into a good well-rounded film. Black Swan is a hard watch for me, with little to no entertaining value. It's had such a negative feeling to it that I felt worst, after watching it. I always believe that good depressing horror movies could be good if they have a good moral story to go with it like 1990's Jacob Ladder. Something to make you, want to live life harder. This movie is cold and nihilism, just there to make you depressed. That's isn't what type of film, I look for."

","I thought this film was very significant because, Darren Aronofsky, being the highly-educated man that he is, takes little bits and pieces from other great directors and films. He takes obviously some clichés from The Red Shoes, which seems intentional to me. He even takes some from David Lynch, in the way that he uses sound and sound effects and music in general. The sort of oddness of it, or way that it gets its scares across is rather Lynchian as well. Instead of using the over-used Jump Scare, he builds to the shock, using a very, very well-constructed storyline to get there. And then there is Natalie Portman's performances. Jesus Christ, Lord almighty, what a performance. Natalie creates this very believable, highly-protected, little-girl psychopath type of character and executes it to death. She can go from being a little harmless, very sexually afraid little girl, to a true monster. Some of the instances using Tchaikovsky's music are just so MOVING. Words cannot describe. One of the final scenes of the film, after Natalie stabs Mila Kunis' character and goes on to dance as the Black Swan with the music from Act III No.18 of Swan Lake, I can't even describe in words the emotion that comes as a result from that. One of my favorite films of the 21st-century"

I have to admit, I was crying a little bit in the climax and near the end of the film I was so apparently touched by this film. Sure, it's not one of the best movies of that year, but it's still a great film worth-watching to those who have not seen it yet.<br/><br/>The only problem that I do have with this movie is that some of the characters would've been given a lot more depth to them with the exception of Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, but that doesn't matter. In fact, the acting is excellent with Natalie Portman doing a fantastic job with her main lead as did Mila Kunis with her meatiest role as the Black Swan. The cinematography and editing is magnificent and the music from Clint Mansell is brilliant (with some nice Tchaikovsky motifs as well), but Darren Aronofsky's solid directing and a compelling, tragic, haunting, and darker story with a great concept about the ballet and a determined girl desperate to achieve a role steal the show.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Swan may not be a masterpiece, but it's still a great film, like I said before, to die-hard fans of Natalie Portman & Mila Kunis. With all my heart, this deserves a thumbs up from me!"
"robert-temple-1","10","3","5","24 July 2012"," Amazing performance by Natalie Portman
","This is a very difficult film to describe, and as many have already done so, perhaps I should not struggle too hard to give an account of it. The film is chiefly notable for the amazing performance of Natalie Portman as the character Nina Sayers, a young ballet dancer who is chosen to dance the lead in a new production of SWAN LAKE, where she has to play both the 'good' white swan and the 'bad' black swan. This leads to her having a psychological crisis, where she splits into a dual personality of the good Nina and the bad Nina. The idea is frankly rather contrived, but the film is very powerful despite this, and Natalie Portman, who has been taking dancing lessons since the age of 4, miraculously becomes a prima ballerina on the screen. Ever since she appeared in LEON in 1994, Natalie Portman has been attracting attention by her remarkable presence, personality, and ability. She has even directed two short films and has now become an executive producer. Is there no limit to her talents? This film has a lot of unnecessarily prurient scenes, and sexual content which some will find highly objectionable. Portman sturdily hangs onto her clothes and refuses to do nude scenes, and good for her. She is not a 'lets show em me tits' gal at all. But there may well have been a struggle over this with the director, Darren Aronofsky, for the way he does extreme close-ups of her bottom and makes her masturbate on screen suggests that he may be a 'rip their clothes off' kinda guy. Maybe the microscopic study of Portman's bottom was his revenge for being denied a sight of her tits. It certainly looks that way. Anyway, I am very glad that Portman kept her tits to herself, because it was absolutely unnecessary for her to do otherwise. Actresses do need to resist lecherous directors and producers more than they do. The new production has been devised by a dynamic character played by the ever-versatile French star Vincent Cassel, who seems to know every language (I once saw him speaking fluent Portuguese in a film, and that ain't easy to pronounce). Here he yatters away in English as if he had been born in America. I would not say that he was the ideal casting choice, but I can appreciate that the director was trying to find someone a bit more cosmopolitan than the average American movie star, as they are mostly so provincial and culturally unsophisticated that the idea of one of them directing a ballet would be a joke. Portman's mother is played by Barbara Hershey, who does an excellent job as a frustrated and thwarted stage-mother who has some deep psychological issues herself. This film is a very powerful and disturbing emotional experience, and is extremely well made. If one sets aside the fact that the whole premise of the story is extremely contrived, it can sweep you away for 108 minutes. I have known a number of ballet dancers, a few very well, and I never came across any who were genuinely and thoroughly bonkers, but maybe they really do exist out there somewhere. I suppose they must do. Everybody else is crazy, so why not also ballet dancers? Certainly Natalie Portman is so convincing that she must have inspired shivers down the spines of millions of people by now. Mila Kunis, a Ukrainian Jewish girl with a slangy American accent, is also brilliant as Portman's rival, the dancer Lily. She is not only sexually liberated, she is positively promiscuous and wild, whereas Portman's character is repressed and virginal. These two play well against each other, and generate a lot of sparks. Certainly that was an act of casting which thoroughly worked. Kunis also does a lot of spectacular dancing. This whole production is extremely impressive, and the film deserved its great success."
"CinemaFrostedBetty","9","3","5","16 May 2011"," An intoxicating film
","Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan (2010) intoxicates its audience with compelling art-house thrills. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we love the cinema so much. 2010 was a year filled with box office flops—major disappointments in prequels, sequels, and remakes. Finally Aronofsky hits us up with something fresh and genuine, something that finally gets the wheels turning up there. When ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman) is cast as the two part lead in Swan Lake, she easily proves herself as the graceful and innocent White Swan. It is the dual role as the cunning and seductive Black Swan that will be the challenge, especially with Lily (Mila Kunis) standing as a major threat to Nina's shining moment. This fantasy drama takes you on a surreal ride through the mind of an obsessive perfectionist—one who is certainly 'losing it', if you know what I mean. It is a glimpse at the underbelly of ballet, an act we so often understand to be glamorous and beautiful. Black Swan is wildly over the top and will have you thinking about its content and imagery for hours, even after leaving the theatre. The narrative's ambiguity is what makes it so fun to watch. It is a film you must see more than once, taking a different mindful approach every time. So many interpretations! Natalie Portman gives an outstanding performance and any recognition given to her because of it is well worth it. Definitely a smart career move. Though, I sadly would not make any bets on it winning best picture at the Oscars this year, I will say its nomination is certainly deserved."

","This review may contain... WILL contain spoilers. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either. Usually after watching a psychological thriller, I am left disturbed for a few days and pondering the movie. I continually am trying to figure out the characters and their motivations - even when I don't like the movie. Here, I am left indifferent. The movie is pretty obvious in what it says and in the end feels quite empty. I recommend reading Mikelepost's review.<br/><br/>The movie is about repressing your dark side, which Nina (Natalie Portman) has done and I'm assuming that's why she has cracked. She wears pink while everyone else wears black, she is perfect for the white swan but not the black swan. First problem, though, is Nina is already teetering on the edge and has been for quite some time now. This reduces the tension the movie can achieve and any surprise when given a reveal. She was suppose to have ALREADY dealt with her self-mutilating problems but still is scratching herself - in case you didn't get it, that's why she always has blood on her finger tips. This already unstable wacko is then picked to be the lead in swan lake. Why? Because as we see through the prior prima ballerina, Beth (Winona Ryder), the director Thomas (Vinent Cassel) likes his primary dancers with a healthy dose of crazy. Nina's struggle with her repressed dark side/black swan comes to a head from the pressure of dancing the lead and the introduction of Lily, the free-spirited Californian who embraces her dark side. Lily begins to manifest in Nina's brain as a representation of her own dark side. (Helpful hint if you missed it - The sex scene between them is clearly imagined since when Nina and Lily walk into her apartment, their reflections in the mirror behind them are split as if the two people are really one.) Has Nina repressed her sexuality because she has lesbian tendencies? Another potential idea that is not explored.<br/><br/>That's the setup and here's the breakdown... The first hour of the movie is boring with little action or plot other than some Nina doppelgangers. Winona Ryder's character is near pointless. Some, umm a lot, of the dialogue, especially everything Lily says is poorly written and a lil cheesy at times. Most characters are one-dimensional - OK it's Swan Lake but no other character is explored - I thought Vincent Cassel's character had no sexual interest in Nina and was just trying to drive her a little mad to pull the performance out of her. Even appointing Kunis as her understudy because he knew it would rattle Nina. Also, it seems Nina is more interested in Cassel but the 'hot for teacher' aspect that gets hinted at in the beginning goes no where and I thought these were missed opportunities and potential for an actual plot as there really was none. There is little to no dancing. Nina finally perfects the Black Swan, on the night of the performance mind you, and all you see of it is crazy eyes and a couple of twirls - some crowning achievement. The whole point of the delving into the dark side and you don't get to see its release. As for Portman's Oscar win - I am OK with it. To me, her acting is always wooden and here it is the same but perfectly suits the character Nina. The reason for her visions go unexplained and have no significance other than she goes outside of herself when she is scratching. <br/><br/>There is no complexity to the movie or the one-dimensional characters, everything is pretty much right on the surface. What happened to our sweet little girl Nina? She really was the clepto black swan that convinced the world she was the white swan and I am still indifferent. I also agree with the reviewer who said, the whole creative process of the movie was done by men, men who still think women are either the repressed virgin or the whore. This contributed to the lack of depth in any character. It was a good idea with good visuals but the screenplay needed some work.<br/><br/>EDIT: I also didn't see the mother as over-bearing as most did. Was the mom a little too much and not necessarily fully sane herself? Sure, however, I felt the mother knew her daughter wasn't mentally well. Her constantly checking her body was to make sure she wasn't mutilating herself again and she also repeatedly said the lead role was too much for Nina. It seemed mom knew that Nina's psyche would crack under the stress and it did. So there must have been some prior break-down's in Nina's life. Again though, in a movie that was painfully obvious, the minor characters intentions are so subtle to the point of incomprehensible."

","Aronofsky comes out with a splendid piece of movie-making yet again! Black Swan is dark, spine-chilling and a magnificent piece of demonstration of Aronofsky's ability to portray emotions on the celluloid. The plot is dark, portrayal of a ballet dancer (Natalie Portman), whose life is all about ballet-dancing. Portman scored on all fronts as she depicts the lead ballet dancer to inch perfection. Unlike many other directors' works, Aronofsky's demands a strong portrayal on the part of the actors and surely the cast does not disappoint. The storyline is wicked and often needs you to look out for deeper meanings; but that is what you expect from a director of Aronofsky's caliber. That is what you pay for. And you never feel your money got wasted. Though not as intellectually challenging as ""Pi"" or ""The Fountain"", this one is an artistic masterpiece and he makes sure he brings it to a awesome finale. <br/><br/>Some scenes just make you ponder over the hard-work the actors and the director might have put-in, but the realization of the director's genius does not come until you have entered the final moments of the movie. I will not put any spoilers , but will give you reasons why you should go and watch this movie on the big screen-<br/><br/>1) Its a typical Aronofsky (fans would not want to miss this at any cost). 2) Natalie Portman - Seldom do you see an actress this powerful in her portrayal of a role. And finally, 3) A rare mix of art and intellect - Aronofsky, as always makes sure that he does not make a movie complex just for the sake of making it complex (sorry David Lynch fans-but had to say it!)- but his works are a genius mix of a strong touching storyline and a mind-boggling depiction of that story.<br/><br/>So go ahead, have an artistic chew from one of the masters of storytelling- hats off Aronofsky!"
"mkataria_kec","9","3","5","5 March 2011"," Simply Awesome
","I am not someone who is very fond of writing reviews but if I don't write something about this movie, it would be nothing less than sacrilege. A master piece like Black Swan deserves all the praise in the world. I have enjoyed watching other movies also from director Darren Aronofsky but Black Swan is a notch higher than the rest. He has clearly outperformed himself. <br/><br/>Credit is also due to him for his cast selection. Natalie Portman was the perfect choice for this role which she carried off flawlessly. The metamorphosis of her character has been described beautifully. It seems like she were a picture, the director a painter and with every brush stroke the picture radiates darker and darker hues. The whole experience of watching this movie is so intense that it lingers on in your mind much beyond those 2 hours."
"josengels","5","3","5","28 February 2011"," Good movie until 20 minutes before the end..
","The build-up of the story is reasonable, but is spoiled when the insanity of the ballerina is not filmed properly. The audience sees her as a black swan with wings etc, but this was only in her own mind, and should have been filmed from her eye-view only. The audience should see her as a normally dressed dancer. The ending, where she is supposed to have danced the whole scene with a self-inflicted wound in her stomach, which only starts bleeding after she takes the fall onto the mattress, is ridiculous. It is disappointing to sit through the whole movie, expecting an emotional climax towards the end, only to walk out of the cinema wondering how the reputation of Oscar-nominee was built up.."
"admiralmurf","9","3","5","23 February 2011"," Almost perfection
","When I first told my university friends that I wanted to watch Black Swan, I was responded to by being called 'gay'. Despite this, I went to the cinema to watch it with old school friends, as was not disappointed despite all the hype this film has been given. It turned out that some of the scenes in the movie make it quite far removed from being a 'gay' movie. In short, the movie is a very well made psychological journey, similar to that of Fight Club, although it somehow manages to avoid becoming a cliché, notably for me by not adding a cheesy flashback reel at the end to show 'what really happened'. It is also worth adding that the film never attempts to hide the fact that a lot of the events, or at least what we are allowed to perceive, all happens in the head of Nina Sayers, the protagonist.<br/><br/>To add a very brief synopsis of the story, an eager and hardworking, but innocent, ballet dancer lands the role of the white swan and black swan in a new version of Swan Lake. During the film, Nina is taken along a psychological trip where the pressures of being 'perfect' for the role often distorts what is really happening through very creepy hallucinations, where she eventually completes a change of character and 'becomes' the black swan. Although the makers deny that this is a comment on the world of ballet, I think it is clear for all to see that the primary purpose of the film was to do this.<br/><br/>It is very worth pointing out that Natalie Portman's performance in this film was mesmerising on so many levels. Firstly, the traditional acting element of her performance is done with a great level of skill. She starts the film with a really innocent and vulnerable look in her eyes, and ends it being the evil black swan, all of which can be read directly from her face. Praise for this level of subtle acting is important and must be credited greatly. Then there's the dancing. Not being a ballet expert myself (in fact I have only ever seen a short segment of a ballet live in my life), it is hard for me to give a detailed comment, except what I could see through my ignorance. To paraphrase one ballet expert, Portman pretends to be a dancer very well. Naturally, she was never going to pick up the technique that people spend their lives learning and get it completely right, but she does a very good job at it. If I had not known that she only spent a year learning, I would be happy to accept that Portman had been dancing for her entire life if I was told. For me, the overall level of acting in this movie, traditional and dancing combined, this is truly one of the better performances I have seen in film.<br/><br/>Some of the feedback from the world of ballet was that the film was an inaccurate portrayal of the world of ballet, to which the film makers responded in agreement, as mentioned earlier. However, I think the world of ballet would try their hardest to disguise the truth if it was the case, so I encourage people to draw their own conclusions. I would argue that Black Swan has actually helped the industry, since my friends and I, and probably I high percentage of people that watch the movie, are now keen to watch Swan Lake to see it in its real form.<br/><br/>This is the type of movie that I would be happy to give a 10/10, although this would devalue the true greats. As a result, Black Swan gets one less."
"Argemaluco","9","3","5","17 February 2011"," A fascinating and unique film
","Something the films directed by the great Darren Aronofsky have in common is the obsession. Independently from what the plot is about, we can be sure that the axis of the story will be the obsession which is devouring a person's life, either if it is in the shape of an impossible mathematical formula (Pi); the addiction (Requiem for a Dream); the eternal love (The Fountain); or recovering past glories (The Wrestler). Now, his most recent film Black Swan follows that thematic tendency, at the same time it brought me a unique and fascinating experience.<br/><br/>I think that Black Swan is a movie which will provoke divisions between the spectators, because while some ones will acclaim it as an excellent film full of deepness, symbolism and emotion, other ones might consider it as an absurd melodrama due to the visual tricks Aronofsky uses in order to portray the unstable mind from the main character. Personally, I belong to the first group, because even though there were a few occasions in which I found the visual tricks to be a bit excessive, I was ""hooked"" on the film from the very beginning until the end. And something which helped me to that is the extraordinary performance from Natalie Portman. To put it simply, she brings one of the best performances I have ever seen (I am not exaggerating). From the first seconds of the movie, Portman establishes the attitude and personality from her character with an incredible clarity and precision, and as a consequence, we do not need too much dialog or ""exposition"" in order to understand the hard way she took in order to lead to the New York Ballet, the difficult situation she lives at her house, and the damage the suppression of emotions and natural instincts in her search of perfection provoked on her. Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey also bring solid performances; however, they get a bit darkened by Portman's monumental work.<br/><br/>The only time I have seen ballet live precisely was a staging of Swan Lake, and I was left impressed by the elaborated scenic effects the show was adorned with (I particularly remember a lightning which announced the entrance of an evil sorcerer). Black Swan also employs many special effects, but most of them are subtle and almost invisible, something which makes them to be more disturbing because we are never really sure if we really saw what we think we had seen. That is the general atmosphere from this movie...an ambiguous balance between fantasy and reality, not as opposite extremes, but as fusion of experiences which have to be interpreted by every spectator in order to draw conclusions. That nightmarish tone might be the reason why some people consider Black Swan to be a horror movie; but I think that it would be a mistake to typecast it into a specific niche, because its ambition is superior to belonging into any formula or genre.<br/><br/>And I think that it is not convenient neither to ""understand"" Black Swan, or to separate the real scenes from the ones which (maybe) take place into the main character's mind, because I feel that the purpose of the movie is for us to feel the confusion, anguish and terror the main character experiences under the intense pressure the different aspects of her life provoke on her, from the horribly competitive world of professional ballet, to the anxiety she feels at her house due to her own insecurities and the influence from her suffocating mother. Aronofsky and Portman can make us ""live"" that situation with excellent results, and I enthusiastically recommend this movie, because despite not being perfect, it definitely is a great movie."
"Absolem","5","3","5","12 February 2011"," Decent, but Aronofsky repeats himself
","Black Swan was not an easy film to make. It took ten years for the it to be adapted to the screen. The lead actresses, Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, went through the harsh process of attaining a body type and muscular tone similar to professional dancers, which required them to work out for five hours a day for six months, with exercises including ballet, cross-training and swimming. During the course of filming, Portman suffered a head injury as well as a twisted rib, which delayed the production.<br/><br/>Portman plays Nina Sayers, a ballerina in the New York City ballet, who lives with her mother who still treats her like a child. She dreams of being the lead in the production of Swan Lake, which is has a new twist to it. The story of Swan Lake focuses on a princess called the White Swan, whose lover is stolen by her evil twin, the Black Swan. Nina is cast as the Swan Queen, which is a fusion of both parts and the main element of this new interpretation.<br/><br/>She faces stiff competition from newcomer Lily, played by Kunis, who has a more natural feel. Pressured to perfect both parts and switch convincingly from one to the other, Nina suffers a lot of strain and several injuries. Ultimately, it is carefree Lily who is the more likable of the two, in contrast to the perfectionist Nina.<br/><br/>While Kunis and Portman play their parts well, the audience's attention is always caught by the charismatic Vincent Cassell. He plays the production's director, Thomas Leroy, a perverse individual who pulls no punches, and pushes Nina to the limit, using sensuality to direct her. Nina's attraction to him is what drives her to perfect the role, and her fear that Lily will take both her part and Thomas is where the homage to Swan Lake becomes apparent. Winona Ryder has a short but memorable role as the jealous former lead ballerina.<br/><br/>As the film progresses Nina's obsession with the role begins to damage her mental state. This is effectively shown through her hallucinations where she sees herself slowly transforming into the Black Swan.<br/><br/>One of the places the film falls short is the way certain scenes are delivered. Often they end up being funny when they are meant to be serious. In one such scene, Nina is on a subway, and an old man blows kisses at her and touches his crotch at the same time. While this scene is clearly intended to be disturbing, the audience find themselves laughing.<br/><br/>In the end, the film's biggest flaw is that for anyone with a knowledge of director Darren Aronofsky's work, it is all too familiar. The plot and story structure have noticeable similarities to his second film Requiem for a Dream. It focused on a group of junkies and the effect that drug abuse had on their lives. As those people were addicted to drugs, Nina is addicted to the idea of achieving ""perfection"". In both films, the plot has a slow start, then it begins to pick up, and towards the end it enters strange territory.<br/><br/>While Black Swan is a solid film, Aronofsky ends up repeating himself. If you haven't seen Requiem for a Dream, then Black Swan may impress you. If you have, I wouldn't bother."
"diewenbeer","9","3","5","11 February 2011"," This Film Broke Me
","It took just about everything I had to watch this. Very few are able to translate the profundity of the human experience in a way the people involved in Black Swan have just done. <br/><br/>I'm unable to console myself knowing the reality this film portrayed. Black Swan transcended cinema's cathartic potential, producing an anguishing authenticity in a medium so fundamentally impersonal as film most often is to me. Black Swan is a bitter taste of the darkness I witness around me, which makes it so unrelentingly sublime. I'm hurt, and in tears. <br/><br/>Black Swan is dreadful. It's beautiful. I hope I never have to see anything like it again."
"DragonAge","10","3","5","10 February 2011"," The performance of a lifetime by Natalie Portman...
","There is a lot to enjoy in Black Swan.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, particularly Vincent Cassel and Mila Kunis are terrific. Both give memorable performances and play key roles in the development of the story.<br/><br/>Darren Arenofsky ensures lively and creative direction. The ballet sequences are well choreographed, thrusting us right in to the heart of the action.<br/><br/>Arenofsky also places a strict emphasis on characterisation, tone and theme. It is these three elements which give the film its superbly dark, tense and claustrophobic feel.<br/><br/>But the star of the show is undoubtedly Natalie Portman, as lead ballerina Nina Sayers. There are two main reasons for this: <br/><br/>First - Natalie Portman's physical performance. I have heard that Portman underwent 10 months of intensive ballet training for the role. To my 'untrained eye', she expertly captured the beauty and poise of an authentic ballerina. Her competence in this most difficult and uncompromising of art forms is an impressive achievement in itself.<br/><br/>Second - Natalie Portman's outstanding character performance. I felt Portman captured every nuance of Nina Sayers' personality to perfection. A young woman's journey through joy, despair, doubt, confusion, jealousy, vulnerability, passion and lust are laid bare for us all to experience. I left the cinema really feeling like I knew Nina Sayers personally.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's performance was undoubtedly the finest I have seen by an actress in a leading role, to date.<br/><br/>For that reason, I recommend this unique and compelling film to anyone.<br/><br/>10/10."
"wozzizlozz","6","3","5","7 February 2011"," Unpleasant without a cause
","Black Swan is almost the same as 'Requiem for a Dream (2000)', another of Darren Aronofsky's work. <br/><br/>We saw the characters in 'Requiem for a Dream' slowly spiraling downwards because of their heroine addiction.<br/><br/>Black Swan tells the story of a girl spiraling down because she is obsessed.<br/><br/>I really 'liked' Requiem for a Dream, drug addiction really deserves the 'unpleasant' card to be played, and because the spiral is so slow, we the audience, keep hoping everything still might turn out fine. Drugs really work on a persons instincts (like it or not, people are still fundamentally governed by their instincts), that's why the 'artistic' unpleasantness works so well in Requiem for a Dream, we understand and feel how the characters are driven to full-fill their 'instincts', the need to get drugs again. <br/><br/>However, this doesn't work so well when showing, and visualizing, an obsessed girl in Black Swan. It was just... very very unpleasant. Obsession is not an instinct, it's a self-taught (or indoctrinated) defect (in the same manner as people can be religious, or start stalking someone). <br/><br/>I had a hard time relating to Natalie Portman's character. I'm a reasoning man, and I can't for the life of me fathom being so obsessed without alarm bells ringing in my head. She doesn't have any alarm bells whatsoever, even when it's all too clear (even to her!) she's being schizophrenic. I know it is my own fault that I don't like this movie, I can't relate to nor do I respect unreasoning people. That leaves only pity. So out of pity I give this movie 6 points out of 10."
"estebangonzalez10","9","3","5","6 February 2011"," And the Oscar goes to Natalie Portman
","¨It's about a girl who gets turned into a swan and she needs love to break the spell, but her prince falls for the wrong girl, so she kills herself.¨<br/><br/>If there is any justice in the world then Natalie Portman should win the Oscar for her leading role as Nina. She has to win; her performance in Black Swan is by far the best of the year. She is just incredible in this film and the transformation her character experiences in order to become the Black Swan is just amazing. I can't think of any other performance from any actress this year that can compare to this one because the entire movie revolves around her. The rest of the characters are all secondary, she is the only lead and star of the film. I just hope Natalie Portman didn't have to go through all the psychological torture that her character had to go through in order to become the black swan. I would've never thought that a film about ballerinas could be so gruesome, raw, and full of psychological and sexual tension. This is the scariest film I've seen this year, and the only person who can pull off a movie like this is Darren Aronofsky. In order to direct a film of this caliber, one has to be completely submersed and passionate about the project, and Aronofsky has always proved he's totally dedicated to his work (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Wrestler were all great and difficult films to make). Black Swan is a different kind of movie and probably will divide audiences because it isn't a film for everyone, but if I have to compare it to any of Aronofsky's previous films I would say it resembles The Wrestler. Mickey Rourke resurrected his career in that film playing a washed up wrestler. He had his glory days, he was passionate about his profession and didn't know how to let go. Natalie Portman plays a ballerina in Black Swan, she's also passionate about her craft and completely dedicated to it. Both of these characters lives revolve around their profession, Mickey is at the exit point of his career, while Natalie is just now trying to make it to the top of hers. As different as these professions may seem, the physical and psychological pressure to succeed is the same.<br/><br/>Nina (Portman) is about to get the role of her dreams: Being both the white and the black swan from an adaptation of Tchaikovsky's ballet ¨Swan Lake.¨ She has been working endlessly for an opportunity like this and when director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), considers her as the new lead she doesn't want to miss her shot. He has decided that it is time to find a new prima ballerina since Beth (Winona Ryder) is getting old and her career is coming to an end. Nina is one of his best and most dedicated dancers. He knows that she would make an excellent white swan due to her perfect form and technique, but she doesn't seem to have what it takes to become the black swan. In order for the transformation to take place, Thomas insists that she loosen up and let her feelings guide her. A new ballerina named Lily (Mila Kunis) shows up and suddenly becomes a threat for Nina because she is so free and confident, everything the black swan should be. Her technique isn't as good as Nina's, but she sees her as a threat nonetheless and at the same time she also becomes fascinated with her. Lily represents everything that Nina has repressed her entire life, she seems to be the opposite of her and that is exactly what she needs in order to become the black swan. Nina begins to lose herself in the role, and the fine line between reality and fantasy becomes blurry.<br/><br/>One character I didn't mention in the plot is Nina's mother (played by Barbara Hershey), who is really scary and over controlling. She has definitely played a big role in Nina's life and shaped her character. Nina is a very insecure perfectionist, but she won't let anything stop her from getting the lead role. She begins to push herself so hard into trying to become the black swan that her life begins to get out of control. The entire cast is great in this film, but Portman steals the show. The psychological torture she goes through is perfectly captured by Aronofsky. The score is amazing and plays a huge role in building the suspense and tension as well as the cinematography of the film. Every shot is just perfectly executed. I couldn't help but cringe every time I saw those extreme close ups of the ballerinas feet, of their nails being cut, and so on. If I ever have a daughter it's really going to make me think twice before letting her take ballet classes. Aronofsky has completely changed my perception about ballerinas. Black Swan is a really bizarre, but great film. I recommend seeing it in the theater because the sound and cinematography in this film is just amazing. It's one of those movies in which larger and louder can make a huge difference in the viewing experience. Aronofsky is completely in control of his craft and delivers a terrific film. This is my favorite film of his so far. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Although this film has followed the Inception route of receiving amazing reviews for the first forty pages on this site, followed by scores of negative reviews which are actually more on track, there are some elements to this production which do make it stand out over others.<br/><br/>Lovers of ballet would have been left breathless by the exquisitely shot dance sequences and the development of Portman's character as she attempts to discard her porcelain doll beauty and let her Black Swan truly take over. Add to this a psychological struggle with reality, clearly brought on by the stress of such a hugely emotional production, and you've got the recipe for a critically acclaimed commercial success. To some.<br/><br/>To others, we see another example of style over substance as the narrative plods along slowly, intentionally attempting to throw its audience off the scent that the storyline is actually a lot less confusing than the director is trying to make out. Although it provided me with no titillation in the slightest, Nina's exploration of her sexuality could have been utilised as a much more effective tool to keep the audience interested in order to create some empathy with the lead. As it stands however, although beautifully played, for those who are not fans of ballet there was very little connection between Nina and the audience. At times I wanted to shake her and scream ""get over yourself woman and just do the bloody dance."" Target audience for this film? Educated women in their forties and the upper middle classes. A surefire Oscar winner then."

","I really wanted to like this film. Indeed I wanted to love this film. However a film about self mutilation, mental sickness, sexual harassment and quite possibly abuse by a domineering parent is very hard going. This was a beautifully made film of a dreadfully upsetting story. There is no doubt that each of the actors within the film put their heart and soul into it and Darren Aronofsky is a film maker of courage and vision. It is just that the story is so bloody dire and unpleasant! I would have enjoyed seeing how the main character managed the transition from the White Swan to the Black Swan without the gratuitous (and incredibly un-erotic) sex scene. There is definitely the foundations of a wonderful film on this most beautiful of ballets, but this film most definitely did not manage the transition from a cygnet to a swan, either black or white."

","In general, I rate movie average. Every scenes were unpredictable. Sometimes, it seems there are logical disconnections, but difficult to see it. For example, at the beginning you may think movie is about some kind of sexual acts, but not. I don't know why they added this point into the movie if they are not going show any results about these.<br/><br/>Everybody played their roles very well. <br/><br/>Sometimes, the film seemed naughty, in result, I thought may be I should stop wasting my time and start watching another movie.

","Although the acting was generally fine the movie was a waste of my time and I am pretty sure of your too. I guess you must be a fan of ballet to appreciate this movie but I think even a ballet fan would find this movie excruciating. You constantly feel like you want to slap the main character out of her pathetic persona. It's all very winy and overly dramatic without even the slightest hint of a interesting story developing. Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel all put in a very descent performance and especially Mila Kunis surprised me as the only interesting character in the movie. I am a big fan of Natalie but this movie was not made for a broad audience and I am fairly certain I am not in it. I must admit I saw a trailer with the scene of Natalie and Mila in a passionate bed scene and was looking forward to seeing this movie but that scene was clearly the only thing this movie had going for it. Do not watch, whatever you do."

","The director shares with us the repulsive story of a psychopath in all the disturbing details. As he usually does in his movies. But this time the trip feels cheap and forced . And boring. And forced.<br/><br/>During the entire movie I was pushed so hard to feel this horror story that after a while I simple didn't care anymore. And all this ""trip"" wondering what is reality and what's not got really repetitive and pointless after a while. (Another new trend in the movies today, not to know what's real or not..oh well.. confusing is the new black)<br/><br/>I would appreciate it better if Aronofsky was narrating about an average character and her descent to hell under some circumstances instead of the obvious, to tell the story of a really troubled woman (to say the least). <br/><br/>The duality of the main character is also for laughs.<br/><br/>The ""white Swan"" side of the heroine is a shy virgin 25+yo who always listens to her mom and lives only between her teenager room and the ballet. <br/><br/>The ""black swan"" side is an arivist,manipulative, sociopath, murderer, oh yes and ESPECIALLY someone who likes or even dares to have sex (with the same sex no less!). Wow I didn't know having sex or even touching yourself brings you in the dark side...<br/><br/>Two extremes in the two corners fighting till death. <br/><br/>Does the creator underrates its audience or he doesn't believe in the power of his storyto simplify it that much? Or he simply tries to tell us the story of a psychopath in a tad confusing way?<br/><br/>In any case, IMHO, none of the above worked well. <br/><br/>p.s. <br/><br/>I would praise Portman's performance but I think the sides of her character were way too loud and obvious so I doubt she had too much trouble portraying the two swans."
"nyceyes-2","2","12","33","31 December 2010"," A boring done-before psychological thriller....
","My inclination to write this review came from seeing an average rating of above 9.0 (circa Dec 2010), and my opinion that the move merits at most a 2.0 rating.<br/><br/>This doesn't really contain spoilers, but I marked it as such just in case.<br/><br/>At first the movie attempts to beguile you into thinking that the misfortunes of the emaciated leading actress are the result of jealousy and foul play. That notion looses credibility not far into the movie as scenes possible only in an *imagined* world play themselves out. The alert movie-goer quickly recognizes this and is disappointingly left with the smoldering remains of a Hitchcockian theme we've all seen before: little more than a psychological thriller with random unoriginal scenes representing the psychotic metamorphosis from innocence to darkness. And whether or not the movie's leading characters are well regarded, is immaterial: it's just lipstick on an ugly pig!<br/><br/>But perhaps even more psychotic than the movie itself, are the reviewers who gave this movie a 9+ rating (including many perfect 10's). That is their right, of course. But do they actually think this movie approaches the greatness of, say, ""The Godfather"" - which enjoys a 9+ rating, and deservedly so.<br/><br/>I'm a *reasonably* discerning viewer, so admittedly my scoring is strict. Still, in the coming year I expect this movie to take it's rightful place in the 5.5-ish ratings range."

","I'm no ballet expert so I won't speak to that aspect of the film. Basically, you get to see what used to be called a nervous breakdown (do psychologists still use this phrase?), accompanied by Hollywood special effects and production values. Was the symbolism interesting? Perhaps, but I was too bored to pay too much attention, to be honest. What's the point? She lives with her mother, who likely has OCD and is overprotective, and she's in a high-pressure situation, and probably has been since childhood. It's an ugly film, really, and there's not much to be garnered from it, other than what any ""normal"" adult probably already knows, about life in general.<br/><br/>I'm all for ugly films, actually, but I need something else, to ""break the tension."" In the foreign film, ""The Forest for the Trees,"" the young teacher keeps talking about ""new techniques"" that she will use in her classes, yet all we see is her being treated badly by her students while she fumbles around, having difficulty doing the basics. It's that kind of ""sick humor"" that can work in this kind of film, at least for me, but in ""Black Swan,"" it's just a buildup to the obvious. Of course, they could have had a different ending, but where else could it go? Essentially, it's too one-dimensional to be considered a ""must see,"" that's for sure."

"dionyzus","2","17","52","28 December 2010"," An assault on the senses
","I saw Black Swan over the Christmas weekend and I would not recommend it. There are some good qualities and the acting is terrific, but the movie itself is just too much. Too chaotic and ultimately too bizarre to take seriously.<br/><br/>First to state what may not be obvious, to classify it in my opinion this is a horror movie more than any other genre. I generally like horror and suspense movies, and I've seen this film's style compared favorably to David Lynch who I'm also a fan of, but Black Swan takes things to an extreme. The object of the plot (*SPOILER*) seems to be following a ballet dancer's (Natalie Portman) descent into madness, and to show this from her perspective. At first the small things which happen to her are creepy and effective, but they start to increase and get much more violent and graphic. Eventually it becomes a futile exercise in sickening images and startling scares.<br/><br/>I remember thinking during the movie that I couldn't wait for it to end so I wouldn't have to submit to any more bizarre shocking imagery. I almost walked out in fact. But one of the positive things about the film was that the story was engrossing and riveting, and you couldn't help but want to know what happened to the dancer in the end. Not really in a compelling way, but more like seeing the result of a car crash and not being able to look away. The other major positive was the acting. All the major players were very effective, in particular Natalie Portman who has a very difficult role to portray this woman as she becomes gradually more unhinged, all the while dancing beautiful ballet.<br/><br/>But getting back to my main point, the style of the movie is quite brutal, assaulting the viewer with unpleasant images and shocks. After a while Shakespeare's phrase ""full of sound and fury and signifying nothing"" came to mind. The movie was in a word disturbing, and not in a good way. I wouldn't see it again. If acting honors are handed out for Black Swan they would be deserved, but that doesn't redeem it as a movie."

","This film consists of a number of stock characters going through their usual motions until an ending which is semaphored well in advance. Now this is true of many movies, but a well-executed film can still capture your interest even with these handicaps. <br/><br/>In this case, though, the characters are lifeless, not particularly well-acted and completely under-written. The script almost comes off like first draft, and is devoid of humour, wit or originality. So no one says anything interesting or memorable at any point, and none of the characters even begins to elicit your sympathy, or goes off-piste in an interesting way. The ostensible bad girl dresses in black and even has a tattoo of black wings on her back, ferchrissakes. She likes a drink, too, as well as some other naughty stuff. Or does she? Poor Vincent Cassel probably wins the photo-finish just ahead of Barbara Hershey in the most-clichéd character stakes. <br/><br/>The central conceit needed to be handled with a good deal of subtlety to make it work. It's actually dealt with in such an appallingly ham-fisted way that it made me laugh out loud several times. Hokey, I think, is the mot juste. Clearly, Aronofsky didn't have sufficient trust in his own abilities to make the point without B-horror movie special effects and truckloads of symbolism that smack you in the face like a wet kipper. Either that or he didn't trust his audience to understand the movie without battering them into submission.<br/><br/>Utter tripe."

Admiration of the stamina, endurance and the way she lives her dual life while reaching the top. The viewer can almost empathise and 'ok' the existence of their deepest secret thoughts. The catharsis of the 'swan' leaves a feeling of contentment after the symphony of the emotions. It is as if the whole movie was written with the music in mind and the emotions go up, down; mix up like the notes on a page of a music composition. In one word: Brilliance!"

It takes enormous determination, strength and personal courage over long thankless years to rise to a prominent position in a top ballet company, so it is simply not believable that someone as tortured, insecure and fragile as Nina could have achieved her position. The relentless depiction of her mental strain becomes annoying after so many repetitions. And this is before the movie wanders off into wild impressionism, blending hallucination with reality, that make us wonder if it is Nina or the director who is schizophrenic.

","I really wanted to like this movie as I've always really liked Aronofsky but it's plain impossible to like this movie. Nina (Portman) is crazy from the start, even way before it was an option for her to become the Swan Queen. So the idea that the role is driving her into madness is somewhat not working. The film ends with her being very mad but that's not really an exciting development. Add to that the more than obvious hallucinations that are always identifiable as hallucinations and the laughable horror cliché elements and you have a very disappointing movie. At several instants the audience did laugh out loud, especially at the end. A great camp movie indeed. Oh and of course the film cites really every possible cliché about ballet without finishing it or really letting it add to character development.

"blackburnj-1","9","4","8","25 January 2011"," Mad, bad and extraordinary to watch
","Black Swan is beautiful, engrossing, crazy, over-the-top, on-the-money, unrelenting, unforgiving, incredible, insidious, ridiculous, brilliant, intoxicating, exhilarating, mad, bad, dangerous and stunning. Not to mention disturbing. And bonkers. It is a film which inspires many adjectives. It may not be everybody's cup of tea, but it is undeniably an incredible experience.<br/><br/>It is hard to know where to begin, because the film is so much. It is horror, ballet, psychological thriller, comedy, coming-of-age tale and family drama. Darren Aronofsky hasn't held anything back. This could have been a fairly straightforward character piece, probably starring a second-rate actress which would have garnered her a Best Actress nomination and been middle of the road and solid. But, Aronofsky has taken that and turned it up to eleven.<br/><br/>He is helped by the fact that Natalie Portman is much more than a second rate Actress. Here, she truly excels as Nina. Her character is charged with playing two separate roles, and, in a way, so is she, but Portman must bring the White and Black Nina's into one character in the end, recognisable in one moment.<br/><br/>This is not a story about a fall into darkness. This is a story about a duality. Nina's sweetness and innocence is unhealthy, particularly in her over-sheltered relationship with her mother, played brilliantly by Barbara Hershey. She is immature more than anything else and has to grow. Of course, this is not a coming-of-age tale through and through. It is about the insanity and pressure of young adulthood, the drive of ambition, the craving of perfection. Portman puts all of this across brilliantly, with great support from Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassell, and a very fine cameo-esque performance from Winona Ryder, who is strikingly convincing as a disturbed woman whose career hasn't gone to plan. I wonder why she got cast for that role though.<br/><br/>All of whom remain under the guise of Aronofsky. In this film though he starts it quietly with a girl dreaming and waking up in a quiet, beautiful, princess' bedroom, surrounded by pinks and whites, Aronofsky quickly begins the crescendo of noise, tension and madness which lasts and grows through the whole film. There is no respite. A lot has been made of the lesbian scene between Portman and Kunis. Frankly, at first it's a relief – seemingly a moment of quiet – but Aronofsky is not in the mood for titillation. He is in the mood to drive his audience mad.<br/><br/>The whole thing continues to build, knowingly over-the-top and funny with it. Nina's paranoia and hallucinations likewise grow, and, by the end, I had not got the foggiest of what was real and what was not. The ending was baffling, to the extent that it made ""Inception"" look simple. But, I came out and was thrilled and filled with energy. Those who are unsure should go, because even if you don't like it, it's an experience which is well worth having. Besides, the level of craft and acting here is exceptional, and there is entertainment and great fun to be had as well.<br/><br/>Four Stars out of Five"

","Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed Black Swan, but i can't give it a 10 full moon. I rated this movie with 7 stars, that goes to Natalie Portman, who makes a magical job in portraying Nina. She truly deserves an Oscar 2011 for Best Actress. Despite of this wonderful achievement by the gifted Natalie Portman, ""Black Swan"" is too simplistic and too fast. The story is way to modest, compared with amazing special effects and cinema (probably Best Picture 2011...probably, because of ""127 Hours""...). What i'm trying to say is that the plot is too basic. White, Black, Good, Evil, with some great acting, dance and cinematography. The screenplay is good, but nothing memorable. You see, the only elements that resides from Black Swan, for me, as a truly film lover, is Natalie's perfect acting performance, Vincent's deep role and a wonderful cinematography. The rest is just a simple plot, evolving across a ballerina, her dreams, her hallucinations, her mentor, a basic fight, good vs evil and white vs black, on a stage. Nothing more. 7 stars of 10 for Black Swan."

","Everyone please go out and see this movie now. It was completely a spectacular film. I was absolutely blown away by the film once it reached it's end. If Natalie Portman doesn't nominated for Best Actress, I'm gonna be pretty upset. Her performance was riveting, she plays the character so well and you see the change she goes through throughout the film and by the time you see her dance as the black swan, she's a completely different person. Amazing.<br/><br/>It's definitely the best film of the year so far and one of the best I've seen in quite some time. There need to be more movies like this! To those who've seen Repulsion, be ready for your mind to be screaming ""THIS IS SO SIMILAR!"" The Tenant and Suspiria came to mind while watching it too.<br/><br/>The cinematography was extremely beautiful, so complex in certain scenes yet so simple in others. The music score was so lovely, I really enjoyed how the composer mixed in elements of Swan Lake and blended it with a modern musical score. Both the cinematography & the music score really deserve nominations too.<br/><br/>From the opening scene (which is probably one of best opening scenes I've ever seen) the film draws you in and keeps you in until the ending. I was literally shaking by the time the movie was over. I was that amazed. Darren Aronofsky sure has come quite a way from Pi (that is great movie too), but really every one of his films gets even better after the next. I'm really excited to see what else has to offer. I personally think he's the Stanely Kubrick of our times. (In my opinion) I absolutely loved it. Go see it now. 10/10."
"gradyharp","10","5","11","14 February 2011"," White Jekyll to Black Hyde
","BLACK SWAN is a clinical examination of psychosis vs borderline personality dichotomy and as such it succeeds well. It is not unusual for director Darren Aronofsky to plunge into controversial subject matter ('Requiem for a Dream', 'The Wrestler', 'Pi', 'The Fountain') but his mastery of a new zone of cinematic investigation of mental illness based on a story by Andrés Heinz who also wrote the screenplay with Mark Heyman and John McLaughlin is his most daring work yet. BLACK SWAN is as disturbing a film to watch as it is a richly rewarding testament to storytelling based on age-old themes. <br/><br/>The setting is a ballet company preparing a new version of the familiar Petipa and Ivanov choreography of the ballet Swan Lake, a story based on Russian folktales about a young girl transformed into a white swan ('Odette') and the darker malevolent black swan ('Odile') who under spells from the evil Rothbart vie for the love of Prince Siegfried. The choreographer Thomas (Vincent Cassel) must retire the reigning white swan queen (Winona Ryder) because of her age and has tryouts for a new swan queen. The shy, introverted, frightened but excellent dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) seems perfect for Thomas' new concept of the white swan, but she lacks the visceral and sensual passion for the extension of the role as the black swan. Nina is the daughter of a frustrated ex-ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey) who gave birth to Nina and missed out on becoming a prima ballerina. Erica is controlling and forces Nina into rigorous training and discipline so that Nina will become the star Erica failed to realize. Nina devotes her life to ballet, participates in behaviors such as self mutilation that suggest she is an unstable personality. Thomas continues to attempt to bring out Nina's passionate personality but the attempts become Nina's obsessive delusions regarding her fear of being unable to be perfect: she imagines all manner of events and body changes, finding that her only friend Lily (Mila Kunis) leads her into an even more distorted lifestyle - or does she... The manner in which Nina transforms herself into the black swan is breathtaking and the climax of the film leaves the audience wondering about the real ending versus another version of Nina's broken mind. <br/><br/>The cast is excellent, with Natalie Portman (who trained into her own balletic role so that she could perform Odette/Odile credibly) delivering a brilliant performance as the fragile, vulnerable, mentally disturbed Nina. Her partner in the ballet, David, dancing the role of the Prince, is Benjamin Millepied - a remarkably magnetic actor/dancer with whom Portman is now engaged and pregnant. Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey raise their characters to an even higher level than the script - wholly and terrifyingly credible. At times Aronofsky could have used some restraint in showing the repeated delusions of Nina's broken mind and the impact would have been a bit more subtle. Mathew Libatique provides elegant cinematography and Clint Mansell reinterprets the Tchaikovsky score - sometimes it works, other times it is maddenly warped: the most successful plagiarism is in the piano-only reduction during the credits. But the overall impact at film's end is a stunning work and a tribute to the talent of Natalie Portman. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","This is one of the few films I've personally ever come across that from moment one begins - unobtrusively and almost imperceptibly - to draw the viewer in, and then suddenly - before you know it - you're absolutely hooked and unable to let go even if - after the first few minutes - this looked as if it was shaping up to be a good but ultimately forgettable film. In the end, though, director Darren Aronofsky shapes and builds this movie almost perfectly and leaves you with few if any unrealized expectations.<br/><br/>In the beginning this all seems so simple. Nina (played brilliantly by Natalie Portman) is a young, shy, nervous, beautiful and technically proficient ballerina who seeks the lead role in a modern production of ""Swan Lake."" The director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) recognizes that her style is perfect for the portrayal of the white swan but that she lacks the necessary ""edge"" to play the black swan. He gives her the role and begins to work with her to get her to explore a riskier, less technically proficient but more passionate side of dancing. At this point it looks like a fairly well-worn type of story, as the movie seems to be shaping up as little more than a study of the rivalries that exist between dancers in a ballet company (which you expect to be taken to an extreme) - and, indeed, rivalries within the company abound - from the dancer that Nina replaced (a somewhat limited role played by Winona Ryder) to one of her fellow ballerinas (Lily, played by Mila Kunis, who brought exactly the right look and feel to the character) who wanted the role and didn't get it, ending up as Nina's alternate. From beginning to end, in the background there's a study of the obviously unhealthy relationship between Nina and her mother (Barbara Hershey) - apparently a former ballerina herself who now wants to live her dream through Nina, who comes across as over- protective and controlling. The characters all have depth, and yet the movie never seems to get bogged down in an intractable character study. We learn about these people as the movie flows effortlessly, portraying Nina's development as a ballerina and her descent as she seems to lose touch with reality, so obsessed does she become with being the black swan.<br/><br/>The development of this movie is deliberate but spellbinding, and it never lacks a beat; never leaves you wondering if watching this is worth it. It's both subtle and in your face at the same time. It's sensual and even erotic at times - and yet there's a sense of innocence (especially from Nina) and the sensuality and eroticism are portrayed with (as far as I can recall) not even a single scene of nudity. It's violent at times and yet there's nothing here that's especially graphic. The characters all have you wondering about them. Thomas, Lily and Nina's mother all seem off balance somehow. The controlling mother; Lily who's obsessed with wanting the role and jealous that Nina got it instead; Thomas who comes across as little more than a lecherous director looking for ""favours"" from the dancers, quite frankly. And then in the end it all gets turned around. Were any of these people really what they appeared to be, or did much of this happen in Nina's mind as she became more and more obsessed about her role? That, in the end, is the psychological power of this movie - trying to distinguish the fine line between what's real and what's imagined. Once the movie hits full stride it's hard to make that distinction. The last half hour or so, dealing with the opening night of the ballet and Nina's actual debut performance in the role, is especially gripping.<br/><br/>Who'd have thought? I'm not interested in ballet. I've never seen a performance of any ballet - let alone ""Swan Lake."" And yet this movie gives one an appreciation of ballet as an art form and almost convinces me to go and see one. In addition to that, it turns out to be a tense and emotional psychological thriller that leaves not a single bit of disappointment. It is absolutely worthy of the Oscar nominations it's received, and I for one will be especially rooting for Natalie Portman on Oscar night 2011."

I keep trying to formulate words to describe this magnificent film, and I just cannot adequately express it.<br/><br/>If you are an artist of almost any performance type, mostly an actor or a dancer, you will relate almost frighteningly closely with this movie. The journey that Nina descends into after being rewarded with the role of the Swan Queen is a journey that any performer who has ever taken on any role that has challenged them can identify with.<br/><br/>The explosive climax is one that will be talked about for years to come. No matter what conclusion you come to, there will be someone else that can find a hole in your theory. <br/><br/>Vincent Cassell, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, and Winona Ryder all deliver nuanced performances that transcend the lines of a supporting performance. They are all absolutely stunning and scene-stealing.<br/><br/>However, not a single performance in the film, nor any performance in any film in the past year and possibly the last five years, can overcome what Natalie Portman has achieved. She has completely defined exactly what she portrays in this film: she has completely and totally transformed into Nina, and done so without breaking a sweat. She is mind-altering good. She is perfect. If she doesn't win an Academy Award for this performance, than nothing is right in the world. She is beautiful, sexy, dangerous, and absolutely flawless, and she delivers a performance that is perfect because it is not a performance; it is real.<br/><br/>There are surely a thousand more things to say about this film, but as I have stated, I cannot form the words. <br/><br/>If you don't see Black Swan, you are missing out on one of the true masterpieces of our generation.

I luckily bought tickets in advance because even though I arrived forty-five minutes before the previews rolled, there was a line that wrapped around the lobby of the theater and the shows were all sold out.<br/><br/>The film opens with Nina Sayers (Portman) inviting us into her world of dance. Vying for the role of Swan Queen in Swan Lake, she has worked day and night to impress Thomas Leroy (Cassel), the instructor at her New York City dance company. Erica Sayers (Hershey) is a retired ballerina who has an almost uncomfortably close relationship with daughter Nina. The privacy level between the two is non-existent and Nina continues to pull away from her over-bearing mother.<br/><br/>Just when Nina begins to feel as though she has a leg up on her competition -- a slew of well-trained Swan Queen wannabes with immaculate bodies -- Lily (Kunis) shows up. The film leaves you guessing whether or not Lily is trying to destroy Nina or befriend her. Winona Ryder as Beth Macintyre makes a chilling cameo as the long-time Swan Queen being forced to step down.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky does an excellent job of keeping viewers in the dark -- sometimes literally -- as we try to figure out how much of what's going on is actually happening, and how much is all in Nina's head as she is consumed by the desire to become Swan Queen.<br/><br/>As far as the most talked about scene of the movie, the sex scene between Nina and Lily, I found this to be more frightening than sensual.<br/><br/>With the Academy Awards just around the corner, this thriller that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat is a shoo-in for a few Oscar nods.<br/><br/>My personal reaction as I walked out of the theater: I found myself deep in thought as I left the theater. As I stepped outside into the falling snow, my eyes welled up with tears. This was puzzling as I did feel like crying when the movie ended. Upon deeper inspection I realized that I was crying because... are you ready? I didn't get it.<br/><br/>After several days of mulling it over, I've decided that I will more than likely see this one again, but I also feel as though I understand more of just exactly what happened.<br/><br/>I will leave you with that and say that this film is absolutely one that you should check out.<br/><br/>(See more of my reviews and other odds and ends at www.mssilverscreen.wordpress.com)"

","""Black Swan"" is an excruciatingly intense psychological thriller that evokes disturbing questions of identity and the dangerous lengths to which a performer (in this case, a ballerina) will go in order to nail a role. Natalie Portman is painfully good as Nina Sayers, an up-and-coming ballerina who finally gets an opportunity to dance the role of the Swan Queen in a production of ""Swan Lake."" But can she abandon her perfectionism (which suits her well as she dances the technically demanding role of the white swan) and embrace the wild passion required to dance the role of the black swan? As she attempts to master these dual demands, her psyche begins to unravel. She battles a demanding, controlling mother (played with calm menace by Barbara Hershey), a brutally harsh director (Victor Cassel), a provocative, carefree rival (Mila Kunis), and ultimately her own doubts, fears, and violent misgivings about her ability to be ""perfect"" in both roles. This is the role of Portman's career, and I fully expect her to garner an Oscar nomination, along with Darren Aronofsky's directing and the film itself for Best Picture. ""Black Swan"" is mesmerizing and enthralling."

And Mila Kunis comes out of no where (believe me, I liked her ever since That 70s Show, but this brings her to the upper tiers of actresses to be considered for many significant roles to come) and she deserves the Oscar for supporting actress as well. The movie in entirety is just breathtaking, fascinating, intriguing and suspenseful. Great directing, just a great movie!

"gothcarlito","10","5","11","18 December 2010"," A Beautiful Nightmare that will Haunt you for Awhile.
","Usually I don't do movie reviews, but I feel like Black Swan deserves one. The movie starts off with a ballerina named Nina who auditions for the part of the Swan Queen for their upcoming show, Swan Lake. The movie starts off slowly with a little cut on her toes and fingers, and as the movie progresses, the pressure that Nina is going through in the movie increases for her and the viewer. The movie gradually becomes more and more intense, the pain and pressure that Nina experience increases, the psycho-sexual scenes become more and more intense, bizarre and at one point frightening. Natalie Portman delivers an outstanding performance that will most certainly get her an Oscar nomination and and a very high possibility of a win. Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey and Wiona Ryder all give electrifying performances. The cinematography is excellent, the costumes are beautifully designed, the editing is superb and the score is absolutely beautiful. You will feel the pain and pressure that Nina goes through and in the end, deep inside you just want to cry of pity. The movie can be hard to watch at some points, but it's very hard to take your eyes off the movie. You will have this movie in mind for awhile and despite the graphic material of the movie, the story behind it will keep you thinking and it may also, possibly, give you nightmares. If you saw Requiem for a Dream then should have an idea of how disturbing it can get, and the cinematography of the film. Kudos to Darren and his cast and crew. This movie is by far one of the best films of the year and decade, better be seeing this film in the Oscar race."

","That is the opening line from the new horror film ""Black Swan."" Some of the critics are debating whether ""Black Swan"" is a horror film or a psychological thriller but it is actually both. <br/><br/>While is is one of the most hyped movie of the awards season, it is not a movie for everyone. Fanboys are probably going to see it about the much talked about sex scene but that scene only lasts about a minute. About half the film is ballet performance or ballet rehearsing. In that regard it is much like Robert Altman's ""The Company."" If you don't like ballet, you might get bored. But as the film progresses, Nina sacrifices herself for her art and loses her sense of reality and the film turns into a horror movie with the distinctive that only Darren Aronofsky can bring. <br/><br/>You can read more detailed plot synopsis in other reviews. ""Black Swan"" is the best horror film since ""Muholland Drive"" and one of the best horror film of all time."

","BLACK SWAN follows the story of Nina, a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life is completely consumed with dance. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.<br/><br/>BLACK SWAN is a dark yet viscerally engaging film that is perfect on almost every level. Director Darren Aronofsky crafts each scene with care and precision. The use of mostly handycams is nothing short of a brilliant decision, bringing in a sense of realism and grittiness which is appropriate for this film. Most importantly, Natalie Portman gives the performance of her career. Like Aronofsky's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, BLACK SWAN starts off small but slowly builds up to great intensity with a chaotic climax that will leave your jaws dropped.<br/><br/>The film manages to sustain an unsettling atmosphere throughout along with hypnotizing you whether you like it or not. The score by Clint Mansell is pretty captivating too. Along with Natalie Portman, the rest of the cast are just as fantastic. Mila Kunis is one of my favorite new stars out there after having seen her in FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL and THE BOOK OF ELI and she gives an effortless performance playing a sexy and slightly dangerous character. Winona Ryder also gives a terrific performance although she's in a brief role. Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey are pretty good as well.<br/><br/>While not as depressing and intense as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, BLACK SWAN is a pretty similar film. With a wildly terrific performance by Portman, an interesting visual palette that your eyes can feast upon, and an unrelenting atmosphere that will put you at the edge of your seats, BLACK SWAN is a twisted yet seductive tale about the dark side of human nature which we can all relate to, as unfortunate as that may sound. BLACK SWAN is really one of the best films of the year."

There is no way that a fragile person like the one she portrays here would make it in the competitive world of dancing.

"ErikPedersen1","9","2","3","16 June 2019"," An Experience
","Wow! I'm still trying to gather all my thoughts about this film, so all I can say for sure is that it was an absolute rush! The acting from Natalie Portman was tremendous - the Oscar she received for her role was definitely wholeheartedly deserved. I loved the slowly increasing sense of madness this film conveyed. I felt like I was losing my mind as I was watching it. The cinematography and editing helped add to this feeling significantly because of how the camera is always moving and weaving in and out and around the characters - making you feel like you are part of the action and dancing.<br/><br/>I also loved the use of music. Very few moments in the film are devoid of it. The last fifteen or so minutes are a particularly good example since the music is ever-present and it builds and builds along with the final performance until the very last moment and then...applause. It's hard to summarize and convey the effect that it has in a few words. Perhaps the best way to put it would be that it makes you feel the pressure, madness, rush, and finally ecstasy that Portman's character is feeling during the final act.<br/><br/>The 108 minute runtime flew by so quickly for me that when the film ended I was taken completely off-guard. That's not to say the ending felt abrupt though; I think it ended at the absolute perfect moment. I was simply completely and utterly captivated by what I was seeing that I lost track of time and everything around me.<br/><br/>I really should not have put off watching this film for so long, especially with all the recommendations I got for it. This was incredible!"

Aronofsky made The Wrestler two years earlier which I found absolutely brilliant so I suggest viewers to check that one out as well, they are both very similar in a lot of ways, the scene which ends both movies convey the same emotional punch which is of accomplishment at the cost of one's sanity and the mental and physical exhaustion and obsession with achieving perfection. <br/><br/>I would like to have given an 8 or 9 rating and the reason for it not excelling as much is perhaps because I would have liked it to be even more twisted, I was looking for an element of horror such as The Shining or Rosemary's Baby in here which I didn't find. Also, I wished there was a more memorable background score to really tie the film neatly. It is more a psychological affair with Natalie Portman's character exploring her repressed emotions and her virgin-like innocence bothering her from becoming the black swan."

","I will not beat around the bush, this film is basically Satoshi Kon's ""Perfect Blue"", but with minimal changes. When you discover that Aronofsky bought the rights to Perfect Blue just to use certain scenes from that movie, that should bring up some red flags. It is not like Inception taking Paprika's themes and doing something different, (Though Inception is another boring and unimaginative movie that gets praised as the best film ever -_-) this is basically plagiarism of Perfect Blue, but without the lawsuits since he bought the rights.<br/><br/>Due to Perfect Blue being underrated, it is no surprise that people would claim this film to be the best and have never heard of Perfect Blue before. But if you have seen Perfect Blue, then watching Black Swan would be an enormous waste of your time. <br/><br/>The movie itself was pretentious and boring. I am giving it a 3 because the performance wasn't too bad, not great, but probably the only saving grace I can give it."

","Ballet isn't my cup of tea, and never has been. It shapes an unnatural world populated by inhabitants who are aware of little else, and craves their souls as well as their bodies. The ballerinas I have known have been unbelievably ignorant of everything other than dance. It is arguable that the events in this film take place in Nina's mind, and not in reality, a plot resembling Vertigo, or Point Blank. Point Blank was OK, but I didn't go for Vertigo. In Black Swan all the people in the story (other than Nina) --- the ugly cloying mother, the other dancers, the twisted artistic director, are nasty and merciless bullies, mockers, users or exploiters. Nina, as her name suggests, is a challenged nonentity, a sad and innocent ninny, living in stressed and tortured misery. <br/><br/>There is a sense in which all that takes place on the screen is a projection of its director's and star's personal anguish and trauma. Those who consider this film to be a masterpiece, or ballet to be the acme of aestheticism, must be reminding themselves that suffering is the price of beauty. The frequency of the scenes with mirrors perhaps indicates the self-reflexive nature of this script.<br/><br/>Viewing this film was a distinctly unpleasant experience. The cumulative effect of masturbation, lesbian sex, self-harm, hallucinations, casting couch innuendo, and vomiting down toilet pans made me also want to throw up. It reminded me of the most unpleasant film I've ever seen, namely Irreversible. Picture my surprise when I discovered that Vincent Cassel had been cast as the male lead in both films. Only three stars, because I do not recommend it."

It was almost as if we (the viewer) had become this character.

","Dark, disturbing and original. I can't say I've seen many films like this before, easily one of the best movies from 2010. Natalie Portman gets it done, she's very convincing as a ballerina here and she accurately captures the madness that ensues as her character evolves. Early in the film it feels like it's going overboard with the sensuality, but once you realize what's happening, it makes perfect sense. To become the Black Swan and to achieve perfection, she has to allow herself to be seduced and let go of her innocence. But as the pressure to perform increases, she begins to lose her grip on reality and simultaneously descends into madness. <br/><br/>The last twenty minutes of this film are just incredible as the suspense and horror builds up to a poetically tragic climax.

","Natalie Portman adequately plays Nina, a slightly over-the-hill ballerina who's subject to hallucinations and self-mutilation, not to mention jealous cohorts, a perverted exploitative slimeball dance director, and a creepy overbearing mother who's a retired ballerina herself. Her primary nemesis--besides, perhaps, herself?--is Lily, a rival fellow dancer and eerie younger lookalike well-played by Mila Kunis.<br/><br/>I really tried to like BLACK SWAN. Its whole plot and set-up is something nicely different, and it at least begins to allow us some empathy with a victim of SIB, raising (however briefly) interesting questions regarding victim-victimizer relationships. The whole premise of how ballet imitates life and vice versa and how all the major players here are also dancers in life's suite has a lot of potential; unfortunately, it just doesn't play out as well as it could and probably won't mean that much to the average viewer. This film also constantly tries for scary and suspenseful, but the effect is just silly.<br/><br/>This might have worked better as a more conventional drama (keeping the symbolic roles) about the cutthroat competition and jealousies that take place between dancers who try to sabotage each others' careers and performances. It also would have helped immensely if the symphonic soundtrack had been saved for the dance performances and not pervaded the bar scenes, Nina's apartment, and everywhere else."

Hollywood may wish to believe so, and there will be a few viewers to agree, but in the end this is too embarrassing to watch.

","A psychological thriller set in the world of New York City ballet,Black Swan stars Natalie Portman in her Oscar winning role as Nina, a ballet dancer who finds herself locked in a web of competitive intrigue with a new rival at the company.The film is directed by Darren Aronofsky.It stars Portman together with Vincent Cassel and Mila Kunis together with Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey. <br/><br/>Its plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet. The production requires a ballerina to play both the innocent White Swan and the sensual Black Swan. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer played by Mila Kunis,Lily impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. When the two compete for the parts, Nina finds a dark side to herself.As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.<br/><br/>Black Swan's theme picks at our deepest anxieties as it relates to the emotions felt by Nina like injury, disfigurement, loss of a coveted job, loss of identity and even loss of sanity.It shows how she tries to cope up with them and how it even threatens her very own life as if danger lurks in her shadows.Aside from that,it also shows how a person is severely affected by a fear of failure.The film could be maddening to viewers but nevertheless it would be both enriching on how people deal with severe pressure as well as fears and anxieties in life especially when one is tested to the fullest in terms of strength and character.Aside from that,it is a movie that is entertaining as well as we see Portman portrays Nina with passion and confusion of a repressed woman who feels the very emotions of delirium that continually haunts her as well as her strange hallucinations and visions pushes her to the limit.<br/><br/>Overall,the film is one of the best not only due to Afronsky's direction and Portman's performance but also to the dark themes that are presented in this film that are not often seen in many movies."

"brando647","9","2","3","2 August 2011"," Natalie Portman's Best Performance
","I've sort of fallen away from Darren Aronofsky over the past few years. I loved both PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, but the unenthusiastic reviews for THE FOUNTAIN kept me from running out to see it and I've still not gotten around to THE WRESTLER. I probably wouldn't have even bothered with BLACK SWAN due to my complete disinterest in all things ballet-related except all the critical buzz caught my attention. And it doesn't hurt that Natalie Portman is probably my favorite actress working in Hollywood at the moment. The film focuses on Nina Sayers (Portman), a dedicated ballerina who aspires to perfection in her craft at the constant encouragement of her mother (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina past her prime who never reached the spotlight. When her ballet troupe is to set to begin rehearsals for Swan Lake, Nina is determined to acquire the starring role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan but her instructor (Vincent Cassel) finds her too controlled. Enter Lily: a wild child from San Francisco who urges Nina to unleash her wild side. Soon, Nina's psyche begins to crack under the pressure of her obsession with the role and her delving into the passionate mind of the Black Swan.<br/><br/>I love a good film that deals with a person's descent into madness and if there's one thing Aronofsky appears to understand, it's madness. From the beginning, we see small signs that all is not right in the mind of Portman's Nina. Her mother is an obviously overbearing sort, living her ballet dreams vicariously through the successes of her daughter. Her mother's blatant mental abuse has taken a toll on Nina and it's made apparent when she nearly loses her chance to tackle the dual role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan in her company's rendition of Swan Lake. Thomas Leroy, director of the ballet company, feels Nina is perfect in technique but lacks the passion and ability to let loose for the role of the Black Swan. As Nina succumbs to Leroy's sexual tensions and the arrival of party-girl Lily, we watch as Nina suffers worse and worse hallucinations as well as bizarre transformations as Nina slowly embodies the Black Swan.<br/><br/>I think what I found most appealing about this film was Natalie Portman. She's definitely a strong actress (see V FOR VENDETTA) but here we see her as a tortured individual whose grip on reality is slipping. She nails it here and, while I can't say for certain because I hadn't seen any of the other Best Actress nominees, she seems to me deserving of the Oscar she won (or at least worthy of the nomination). Mila Kunis takes an interesting turn. I'm so accustomed to seeing her in goofy comedies (FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL) that it was interesting to see her take on more of a ""bad girl"" image and prove that serious drama is in her realm of talent. I am also to see that Aronofsky maintains the unique style of his filmmaking I loved in his early films and it's given me motivation to check out the few I've missed. BLACK SWAN is a taut thriller in my opinion, despite what nay-saying I've heard from friends and those online. It's a tense film and the final act in which Nina's mind finally crumbles in the Swan Lake performance is one of the best sequences I'd watched all year."
"bhuyan-ayush","9","2","3","30 July 2011"," freakishness + awesomeness!
","I saw Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" last year and fell in love with the director (no! i am straight). I have always had hopes from this guy. But this movie that I saw today didn't just live up to my expectations, in fact it exceeded way above it! I have a whole new level of respect and appreciation for this amazing director. The movie ""Black Swan"" is another masterpiece added to Darren's collection of dark psycho thrillers. The movie is about a ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) who has been selected for the upcoming ballet performance ""Black Swan"". Actually she replaces the former dancer Beth(Winona Ryder) because of her age. Overwhelmed and delighted Nina starts practicing for the day. The rest is a journey through her life as she faces the various hurdles for getting chosen for the Swan ( the main character of the ballet)and her relationship with people around her including the ballet director Thomas Leroy(Vincent Cassel). There's another dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) who is competing with her for the role.The only thing that I want to add without spoiling the suspense is that Nina is a die hard perfectionist and crosses all boundaries to perfect her character.<br/><br/>Okay, thats all i can reveal right now. But TRUST me there's a mighty lot more to the story. I have so much to talk about this movie. Darren has continued with his style of direction with graphic and vivid repetitive sequences. I felt so much of the dark and depressive ambiance generated in the movie. And like always even Black Swan doesn't fail to leave a painful clog in the throat by the end of it. Lets take up each aspect one by one. First the acting. I HAVE to say, after the direction the next brightest jewel in the crown is Natalie Portman herself. She undoubtedly is one of the most gorgeous women in Hollywood and my all time favorite (since Star Wars itself). But not just an eye pleaser she is, an equally terrific acting in the movie displays the immense talent she has within her. The sequences with Nina's mother, the ballet director, Lily, Beth every little and noticeable piece of acting by her is just flawless. In fact it seems Natalie, just like her character Nina has some perfection in her. The grace and elegance that she carries in the movie is incredible. so thats a thumbs up for Natalie. Next is the overall ambiance and mood. DUDE, how in the name of god do you do it? This movie is a total psycho freak show with scary,brain squeezing sequences,depressing scenes and beautiful dancing. There are seemingly random and haphazard scenes, but even within this chaos lies a serene order in the storyline that makes complete sense. This piece of art demands a huge amount of maturity and understanding for you to be able to appreciate it. In fact this is the only possible con i can think of. Some of you might find it notoriously tough to get it in the head (and for the others to get it out). So I highly recommend the movie for the people of the second kind. Saddening but very enjoyable movie ""Black Swan"" has made it to my list of best 10 movies seen. Not better than Requiem but a fairly close rival. The movie also has a message in it ( which depends upon the viewer to decipher). Okay i guess thats pretty much it. Go watch it you wont regret !!"
"mad_mandonna","9","2","3","26 July 2011"," A rare and precious gem of a film, Nalatlie Portman is a knock out.
","Natalie Portman is a knock out in this film. She embraces it with every single ounce of her being, its a subdued performance at times, but one where she manages to get every audience member to feel for her. Not an easy task, but she takes to it like a duck (or swan) to water. The direction here is truly beautiful, though in full colour it feels at time that it could be in monochrome, it truly gives a seediness to the world its presented here.<br/><br/>Despite being a film based upon ballet, it is more character driven that anything else, though the main premise of the film might be put off by Black Swan this would be truly stupid thing as it really is good enough to appeal to a broad range of people.<br/><br/>Though it is Natalie Portman that leads this film with guns a blazing, other significant women in this film stick out. Mila Kunis's bad girl plays off against Portman brilliantly and the two form an unexpected and mysterious friendship. Barbara Hershey works well as the mother, who plays every second of the film with malevolence with what seems to be delight.Winona Ryder takes what little she is given and turns it to gold.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a power house of stunning direction and an ensemble of great performances. A film I literally cannot recommend any higher."
"jjnoahjames","9","2","3","24 July 2011"," A beautifully violent masterpiece in every single way, except for one!
","Black Swan is the story of Nina trying to become the top performer in her ballet class. This film absolutely portrays what some people ""feel"" rather than act like in the pressure of the spotlight, but it does it in a horror movie kind of way and this is what makes it brilliant! <br/><br/>Black Swan caught me off guard. I kind of forgot what Darren Aronofsky's films were like. Boy was I in for a roller-coaster ride!<br/><br/>I gripped the edge of my seat every time the dancers tipped on their tip toes (sound funny right, but a good director can make anything possible). That's just the beginning. There will be a lot more reasons to hold on to your pillow.<br/><br/>Every scene is acted out perfectly by the actors, and Natalie is no different. Another reviewer said she usually has no trouble showing skin, but here she does the opposite and does it perfectly. I completely agree! Natalie certainly made this movie what it is!<br/><br/>The only flaw of the film, in my opinion, is the sexual scenes. I do agree that maybe this delves in to the nature of the film, and maybe a sheltered, schitzo character like Nina's would go through this in real life. But it was hard for me to accept when the rest of the film shows how chauvinistic men can be. Yet chauvinistic men would probably enjoy this scene. To me that's kind of hypocritical. THERE IS a way to shoot a sex scene without making it like a porn video. So I think this could have been done better.<br/><br/>Also this movie just isn't for anyone and I can't give a movie a 10 that is like that. Maybe if the sex scenes were toned down I would.<br/><br/>(Contrary to what some reviewers say, sheltered people like Nina are very common in all walks of life making this very believable!)"

","I already knew the ending to this movie, because idiot told me. So I didn't have huge expectations for this movie, thinking that it would just be buildup for an ending that I already knew.<br/><br/>Thankfully I was wrong, this movie had so much tension, I love the main character, and absolutely loathed the dance teacher. The dancing was fun to watch, since I'm not a fan of ballet. Also the acting was extremely good, Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, both did great jobs, boy has Portman come a long way from the Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>But the reason I love this movie is the plot. The way it unfolds, and the twists and turns make this a movie that is more confusing than Inception. Well, almost. The movie isn't about the ending, it's about the build up to the ending. So even though some dick on Youtube told me the ending, I still gave a round of applause to this film when it was over."
"kough33","8","2","3","17 June 2011"," This is what everybody loves to see!
","Talking about such a film seems to be tough as some scenes are too fast to be understood and it's needed to be watched at least 2 times. Darren Aronofsky who ignored ""127 hours"" to direct ""Black Swan"" shows great ability to take watcher's focus and involve them in the story. Not a moment I paused the film but I only did when I was scared what will happen next.<br/><br/>Story: Nina Sayers is a young ballerina who tries to be chosen as ""Swan Queen"" in ""Swan Lake"" ballet. Vincent Cassel, the group's coach, recognizes Nina to be perfect for ""White Swan"" but so much weak for ""Black Swan"".<br/><br/>Her demand to get the role adds more stress on pressure from her mother, a former ballerina. She got all the control over Nina and acts like a baby with her, wanting Nina to achieve all she couldn't in her professional life time.<br/><br/>Nina's effort for playing Black Swan as well as White Swan didn't come conclusion except when she began to get more in touch with her dark side, as far as Black Swan indicates guile and sensuality but White Swan represents innocence and grace. This turning point starts hallucinations and changes Nina in a weird way<br/><br/>Details: focusing on the details for the second or third time watching this movie helps finding out that even everybody's clothes color has been chosen for a reason. In bar Nina wearing white and Lily black is a sign of their position in the world and their completely different personalities. <br/><br/>Sound editing: in most of the films cinematography is the main way to influence the audience. However in ""Black Swan"" sound editing does the job. Nina's toes piping all the film long when dancing or massaging is so much real that you will have to get all parts of your face together to decrease the pressure. The moments of silence right in the middle of ferment takes you right inside of brain of actress to feel what she really feels.<br/><br/>Actors & Actresses:<br/><br/>Natalie Portman: having a hard job combining emotions with ballet was the main reason she got every reward possible. Her innocent face goes straight into your mind and reinforces you sympathy from the first scene. Great job! Vincent Cassel: carrying years of experience helps him to fit himself into the role. This special face which makes him attractive in some cases has specific effect on watcher that indicates a negative role just opposite of what he is.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis: after ""Book of Eli"" pretty Mila Kunis seems to become a celebrity who just knows what to do. Admirable play of her keeps the observer's negative look on her till the last scene.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky: Absolutely my favorite as far as I explained about actors. All film long you can sense his presence and this is what I feel."
"oldschoolfan","9","2","3","13 June 2011"," Modern cinema at its finest
","***Warning: Although I tried to avoid it, this review may contain spoilers!!***<br/><br/>On Friday June 10th Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan"" was released on DVD and Blu-Ray in Germany.<br/><br/>I like to use this occasion to give just some short thoughts on the performances, the technical aspects of the movie (in short) and finally a brief personal conclusion. <br/><br/>Of course, most of the buzz surrounding Black Swan"" was triggered by Natalie Portman's performance and rightfully so. I have been a big fan of Portman since Leon – The Professional"" , but honestly, after her ground-breaking performance as Mathilda, she never reached that artistic peak ever again. Not because for lack of trying, mind you, but more for lack of that really outstanding part or character. Although all four main actors give strong performances, Black Swan"" is Portman's movie. Her transformation into Nina is simply amazing, even more when you consider that she is featured in almost every scene in the movie. Nina is a young woman under the control of an obsessive mother, making her a character almost impossible to play, since she always denies her own feelings and wishes and sacrifices them for the discipline of training (or of becoming perfect"" as Nina herself says at one time). A lot has been published about Portman's rigid training and how she performed the choreographies herself. Let me tell you, you don't know until you've seen it. It is simply breathtaking. For me personally, there are not many actors have committed that much to a character. De Niro in Raging Bull"" is the closest comparison that comes to mind and, yes, Portman is that good. There is nothing more you can ask of an actor/ actress.<br/><br/>The role of the artistic director Thomas is a crucial one in the story and Vincent Cassel handles it with almost discomforting ease. In the hands of another actor Thomas might have wound up either way, being a total prick or the supportive mentor to Nina. Cassel manages to incorporate both in a role that does not have that much screen-time or dialogue. He was the perfect choice, since he is at the same time intimidating yet also sensual, intelligent and soft-spoken, as much as cruel and demanding. Aronofsky was wise to choose an actor of such a class as Cassel, since I feel that a less believable or skilled performance would have hurt the whole movie and would have lessened its impact tremendously.<br/><br/>It is quite clear that Mila Kunis is not such a multi-facetted actress such as Portman. Nevertheless, she is great here, as she always is. Whether she was playing the spoiled rich girl on ""That 70's Show"" or was passing through post-apocalyptic America with Denzel Washington, Kunis always seems to tackle these different characters and settings carefree and with ease. This attitude is perfect for the character of Lily, since she represents everything in dancing that Nina seems not to be able to show. Kunis is the perfect counterpart for Portman: Nina interprets a lot in Lily, seeing her as a professional and sexual rival, but also as the ideal for a passionate performer. As Nina pressures herself more and more her view of Lily changes constantly and Kunis really does a great job in changing the tone of the character, sometimes underlining, sometimes contradicting Nina's inner thoughts and fears. And, although her dancing scenes are of course quite shorter than Portman's, I like to point out that her movements are equally professional and compelling on a totally different level.<br/><br/>Barbara Hershey, who plays Nina's obsessive mother, also gives an inspired performance. As with Thomas her part is not the biggest, but next to Portman's the most crucial for the understanding of the movie. Hershey manages to deliver the exact balance between love and oppression, between support and force. It is due to her (and of course) Portman's artistic ability that the viewer is always able to relate to both the character of the mother and the daughter.<br/><br/>To talk about every technical aspect of the movie would blow this review up to more than a dozen pages, so I keep this very short. It is flawless. I need to point out the sound design, which is extremely scary and very visceral. Aronofsky uses what can be called his trademark, soundbits that are distorted, used as echoes or mixed with music or the sounds of air, sometimes even before the original soundbit is used in the movie. <br/><br/>The visuals are equally compelling. I need to mention in what excruciating detail every set of the movie is furnished. The camera work is great. A lot of scenes were composed like classic paintings, using unusual perspectives so organic that you do not realize HOW unusual they are until you think about it. <br/><br/>When I saw the trailer I was reminded of the Giallo movies by Dario Argento or scarier movies of Roman Polanski. But Aronofsky has created his own beast here. Just like ""Requiem For A Dream"" this movie is an assault on the viewer, filmed in such a sophisticated manner that one cannot help but to be mesmerized and consequently think about the images. Aronofsky caught the sexual scenes like we have never seen before: honest, sensual, intimate yet also raw and violent. In the dancing scenes Aronofsky mastered the best transformation of one art form (ballet) to the other (film), just as he mastered in his previous film ""The Wrestler"". <br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is an important movie. It is an A-list Hollywood-film that is intelligent, sophisticated, thought-provoking and yet always entertaining. (Not to mention, maybe the most effective Hollywood horror-movie of the last 10-15 years). <br/><br/>To sum up a long review in five simple words: Cinema at its absolute finest."
"erikfuller5350","9","2","3","25 May 2011"," A Dark Tale of the Pursuit of Perfection
","What is the cost of perfection? This is a question many of us ask and, yet, do not have an answer for. Black Swan attempts to answer this question for us. A mystery-suspense-thriller of a movie, Black Swan is a beautifully dark movie about the torment of a ballerina named Nina, played by Natalie Portman. Constantly being pulled in different directions by the people around her, Nina's entire reason for being is the pursuit of perfection. She has toiled for 4 years to be named the Swan Queen, in the ballet Swan Lake, and her obsessive pursuit of this title will not go without consequence. As the line between character and reality is slowly blurred, Nina finds herself transforming from the White Swan into the Black Swan, and all that comes from this title. <br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky masterfully uses light, music, and dance to create world that is realistic enough that the audience feels apart of it. Through the use of Point of View camera angles, we are brought into the mind of Nina. The contrast between the Black Swan and the White Swan is striking, and Natalie Portman pulled this off beautifully. The co-stars are virtually dance partners in this movie; moving, supporting, and flowing with the brilliance that is Portman's performance. <br/><br/>The battle between light and darkness lies in the center of this movie. The use of ballet as a medium for this battle is outstanding as it allows pride, perfection, and manipulation to be the catalyst of change in Nina. Ballet is a trade that takes years of dedication to attain success in. The goal of every ballerina: perfection. Nina finds out that she must give her all in order to attain perfection."

","If you follow the director's movies, you know what to expect already.<br/><br/>The movie is complementary to his earlier Requiem for a Dream and Wrestler, exploring what it takes to follow, repress, or give up on your dreams. <br/><br/>It's visually stunning, frequent with beautiful and haunting scenes. The acting is superb, accompanied with great choreography and sounds. This is probably director's finest execution to the time. <br/><br/>He reminds us the dark side of pursuing the dream. Unable to let it go, we may keep struggling, no matter the costs.<br/><br/>We may continue, sometimes for many years, overlooking destruction we cause not only to our relatives, but often to ourselves. Hoping it is worth an elusive moment of an achievement.<br/><br/>This movie will not work for everyone, sure. But if theme of a dream resonates strongly in you, I would recommend to watch it, along side with Requiem for a Dream, with gentler approach to your's life."

"MovieMagicMaker3","9","2","3","26 April 2011"," The Brilliance of Black Swan
","Many films, like the Oscar-nominee ""The King's Speech,"" portray its main character (in this case King George) as he goes about his daily routine, fly-on-the-wall-style. The director steps away and lets the story and the actors speak for themselves. But sometimes the best films are the ones where we are thrust inside the protagonist's mind by having the director use the art of cinema to depict the world in a new and different way.<br/><br/>One of the best examples of this type of film is ""Black Swan,"" the magnum opus of director Darren Aronofsky. The film is a musing on art, perfection and beauty as told through the unstable eyes of Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a young, talented ballet dancer. From the opening shot of a dreamlike Sayers dancing the lead in ""Swan Lake,"" to the last few minutes, every shot is through Nina's perception. This isn't a portrait- it's a headfirst dive into her psyche. We all know someone like Sayers' character—too much of a perfectionist for her own good. She spends her days practicing, obsessing over her every move and eating next to nothing. After rehearsals, she returns home to her sparse and windowless apartment also inhabited by her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey) who had to give up her own dreams of stardom when she became pregnant. She cares for her daughter deeply, but has coddled and stifled her so much that Nina is still emotionally a child, as evidenced by the huge stuffed animals crowding her all-pink-and-white room. Nina dances in a company run by egotistical and smarmy director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) who is casting the lead for a reinvented version of ""Swan Lake."" Nina is the obvious choice for the Swan Queen: beautiful, fragile and utterly virginal. But the problem, he explains, is that the lead must also play the Black Swan, the Queen's evil twin. Seemingly perfect for that role is Lily (Mila Kunis), a San Francisco transplant who is seductive, sensual and dances with almost unrestrained fluidity. But the part ends up in Nina's hands and she struggles to shed her good-girl image in order to inhabit the sexy black swan. Thomas keeps telling her to ""lose herself"" in the role. And she does, but maybe a bit too much. First it's mysterious scratches, then disturbing visions, and soon Nina starts to descend into a very dark place. Adding to her stress is Lily, who appears to try to sabotage Nina in order to take her role. The more that's revealed here the less fun you'll have watching it, but the whole third act is a beautiful and nail-biting climax that is nothing short of pure theatrical brilliance. While Portman's fearless performance has been critically praised, and she is a shoe-in for the ""Best Actress"" Oscar, all the performances are uniformly top-notch. Kunis walks the fine line between sweet and naughty, radiating the screen every time she comes on. Hershey, whose snub by the Oscars is truly criminal, gives a wonderfully complex performance in a role that could have easily been one-note. The real star of the film is its direction by Darren Aronofsky. He pulls together the formalistic style of ""Requiem for a Dream,"" the warped-reality of ""Pi"" and the stark realism of ""The Wrestler"" into one coherent and masterful film. He fills every moment with meaningful art direction and symbolism. Notice the mysterious and skin-crawling sound effects and the ever-present swan and mirror motif. A brief mention must also be given to Clint Mansell, whose largely orchestral score gives the film a lush, theatrical and unsettling atmosphere. Aronofsky's biggest achievement is using the camera to get inside Nina's head. The puzzle that this film becomes has no answers because the film is told by an unreliable narrator. It is truly a key component to this film and makes it dangerous and exhilarating. While a thriller about ballet doesn't even seem logical, Aronofsky has turned it into a stylish, psycho-sexual suspense film that is far and away one of the most ambitious and mesmerizing films of the year."
"xamsx","9","2","3","21 April 2011"," Black Swan
","Visceral, beautiful, at times uncomfortable to watch and yet utterly compelling, Black Swan is a tour de force of modern cinema. The cinematography, lighting, camera work and performances from Aronofsky's cast are all nothing short of Oscar worthy, but the real stand out is Natalie Portman as leading lady, Nina.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the plot of the film drives toward the opening night of the ballet itself, with the performance building to a crescendo as Nina descends into obsession, paranoia and madness. Seeing the ballet from her perspective is truly spectacular and I was left open- mouthed and captivated, by some of the most breath-taking visuals I've seen of any film.<br/><br/>I was considering writing a full review and giving an account of my opinions, but I quite honestly don't feel I have a full enough command of the English language, to express just how astounding this piece of cinema is.<br/><br/>In short, SEE THIS FILM. It's worth it, just to have your own opinion."

She makes the part and her image is just right! I love how Black Swan combines traditional ballet ballet and Swan Lake with the modern clubbing scenes. It really gives the movie a unique category.

"TxMike","Null","2","3","4 April 2011"," Story of a paranoid schizophrenic perfectionist who gives it her all.
","This movie is somewhat controversial in that for every viewer who sees it as a superb movie, you can probably find another who says they only wanted to walk out half-way through. I am in the camp that it is a very good movie. Not a joyous one, but a good study of a dancer who suffers from paranoia, schizophrenia, and is an obsessive perfectionist.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is Nina Sayers, and she channels her sickness into her ballet dancing. It helps that she has a mother, Barbara Hershey as Erica Sayers, a former dancer herself who still treats her daughter with the control that you might for a 10-year-old.<br/><br/>Nina is in the ballet company that will kick off the season with a performance of Swan lake, and the director is looking for the dancer who can pull off both roles, that of the white swan and that of her nemesis, the black swan. (I am not a ballet fan, this is my simple understanding from viewing the movie.) Nina wants this role badly, but the director keeps telling her that she is too ""controlled"", trying too hard to be too precise instead of being more ""real."" Nina rarely smiles, it never seems like she is enjoying herself, at anything, at any time.<br/><br/>A new dancer from San Francisco shows up, Mila Kunis as Lily. It begins to look like Lily is competition for the role and Nina begins to become paranoid about her. Frenchman Vincent Cassel is good as Thomas Leroy, the director. Winona Ryder has a rather small role, as Beth Macintyre the former star now on her way out.<br/><br/>The DVD has interesting extras. Even though Portman has studied dance for most of her life, a professional ballerina was used for many of the performance scenes, and ""face replacement"" was used to make it look like Portman was dancing.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: As we view the movie we see some strange things, and in the end most of them turn out to be products of Nina's imagination, generated by her illness. She imagines an evening where Lily comes home with her, spends the night, and they have lesbian sex. She imagines another where Leroy tries to seduce her. And another where she kills Lily and drags her body into the shower of her dressing room. We see her looking into a mirror, black feather stubs are growing on her back, she pulls one out. (She is becoming, emotionally, the black swan.) In the very end, Nina turns loose, gives a good performance, but when she falls into the mattress behind the prop, as the dead white swan, we see she really is bleeding, she has stabbed herself and will die. But she smiled and said the performance ""was perfect"", she gave her life in her misguided search for perfection in the routine."
"MovieEnthusiast13","9","2","3","3 April 2011"," Natalie Portman powers this outstanding film
","Black Swan is just as much about a woman dancing in Swan Lake as it is a modern retelling of the story. Nina Sayers starts off as the perfect Swan Queen, pure, innocent and sweet. The film sees Nina (Natalie Portman) preparing for the performance of Swan Lake, as she takes on the role of the White Swan she seems to be becoming more and more like her evil twin, the Black Swan. This film encapsulates the essence of Tchaikovsky's original ballet, playing with the lines between good and evil and displaying the conflict and delusions of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Nina begins as a young ballerina who is hoping to receive a larger role in this season of the New York City Ballet as she is a perfectionist who couldn't work harder at her art form. She lives at home with her over-protective mother, a former dancer herself who invades into Nina's life. Thomas Leroy, the head of the dance company, is hesitant to select Nina as the Swan Queen in the company's new production of Swan Lake. This is because Thomas does not believe that Nina has the passion and emotion to portray both the White and the Black Swans.<br/><br/>Then another dancer from San Francisco joins the company, Lily (Mila Kunis). She seems to be everything Nina is not, outgoing, bold and open about herself. Lily's presence puts pressure on Nina, as well as the pressure of the role itself, of her mother and of the other dancers who wanted to be the Swan Queen and claim Nina slept with Thomas to get the part. Nina begins to hallucinate and slowly loses her mind with all of the emotional and physical stress she has on her.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman powers the film with an incredible performance. The character of Nina is acted amazingly as she descends into madness. Portman drives the spirit of the movie, a seemingly fragile girl who becomes passionate and aggressive through her own creation. The supporting cast is great as well. This is by far the greatest performance we have yet seen out of both Portman and Kunis.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler) directs the film with an absurd quality that makes it great. Black Swan is incredibly tense, with emotion being explored deeply. Aronofsky also explores the themes of sexuality and violence in a way that disorients the audience and almost makes people question their own sanity. Overall, Black Swan is a terrific film which delves deeper than most thrillers, exploring the psychological cause and effects of actions, as well as displaying the art of ballet and the stress associated with a role with almost perfection."
"Vishal_s_kumar","9","2","3","27 March 2011"," Black or white, love it or hate it, it is one of the best.
","It makes sense that Black Swan has provoked such a divisive response in viewers; the film itself seems to be a contradiction, a melodramatic mix of art-house ideas and psychosexual thrills. The influence of several predecessors looms shadow-like over Black Swan, from Alfred Hitchcock and Roman Polanski, to David Cronenberg and David Lynch—all filmmakers who have balanced ""genre"" elements with higher philosophical pursuits. Comparatively, Aronofsky's film is shifted more toward the commercial end of that particular scale—it tends to be obvious where a better film would be ambiguous—but Black Swan is still a brazen, daring piece of work, the kind that doesn't often make its way to the multiplex.<br/><br/>At the film's heart is Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake: ""We all know the story,"" says Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), the swaggering director of the New York City Ballet. ""Virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom but only true love can break the spell. Her wish is nearly granted in the form of a prince, but before he can declare his love, her lustful twin, the black swan, tricks and seduces him. Devastated, the white swan leaps off a cliff, killing herself and, in death, finds freedom."" Thomas intends to start his new season with a ""visceral"" and ""real"" reinterpretation of the tale, but he needs a star ballerina capable of embodying both the White Swan's innocence and her dark twin's wanton abandon.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) desperately wants the role—in the opening scene, we see her dreaming about it—and as Thomas puts it, ""If I was only casting the White Swan, she would be yours. But I'm not."" Nina is too wholesome by half, a sexually-stunted dancer who has devoted her life to her craft, practicing perfect technique but never losing herself in the movements. She still lives with her overbearing stage mother (Barbara Hershey)—a resentful former ballerina who lives vicariously through her daughter—and she sleeps in a doll- infested, powder-pink bedroom. It's the room of a girl, not a woman, and it says everything about her. Nina claims she's not a virgin, but we have a hard time buying that. Still, Thomas sees some ""bite"" in Nina and gives her the part, convinced he can coax out her dark side. Known for having stormy intimate relations with his lead dancers, Thomas is a master manipulator, using seduction and withholding to get the results he desires on the stage. His first direction to Nina is grounds for a sexual harassment suit: ""I have a little homework assignment for you. Go home and touch yourself. Live a little.""<br/><br/>By casting Nina in the lead role of Odette, the swan princess, Thomas displaces the dance troupe's former star, Beth (Winona Ryder), an aging prima-donna who refuses to go gently into retirement. He also nurtures a strategic rivalry between Nina and her understudy, Lily (Mila Kunis), a dark-haired nymphet who personifies the Black Swan's animal-like lust. She likes her meat bloody, she's a shameless flirt, and she even has a set of black wings tattooed across her shoulders. (Yes, Kunis and Portman do share a sex scene that's simultaneously hot and terrifying, bringing new meaning to the phrase ""it'll scare you stiff."") At first, this may seem like just another backstage dance drama with all the conventional elements— competition and ambition, jealousy and backstabbing—but Nina's real conflict is progressively with her own ever-fracturing psyche.<br/><br/>The film is told exclusively from her perspective—she's in every scene—and we quickly suspect that she may not be a completely reliable narrator. The hints start small. Nina picks compulsively at her hangnail-ravaged fingers and scratches a nasty rash on her back; one second she's bleeding from these wounds, but when she looks again, there's no blood, no torn skin. It escalates. Nina begins to see flashes of her own dark doppelganger, a mysterious, highly sensual version of herself. Like the similarly sexually infant woman played by Catherine Deneuve in Polanski's Repulsion—the film that most influences Black Swan—Nina grows paranoid and unhinged, troubled by grim, anxiety-induced hallucinations. Her delusion becomes clear: she's turning into the Black Swan. Mentally. Physically. Entirely.<br/><br/>It's here that the film grows a little too literal minded. And this speaks to a larger problem that holds Black Swan back from greatness—for every evocative, emotionally nuanced scene, there's another with a cheap jump scare or some other trapping of the horror/thriller genre. (A few are genuinely scary —and necessary—but others seem like overkill.) Aronofsky uses the old ""reflection that moves on its own in the mirror"" trick no less than three times here, to diminishing effect. And this also dulls the film's symbolic use of mirrors, which work as a feedback loop of narcissism and self-loathing for unhealthily body-conscious ballerinas.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Black Swan is a haunting fable that has the power to hang over viewers like a shroud. It's Gothic and lacy, decadently surging on urges so repressed they've morphed into neuroses. It explores female sexuality and ambition in uncommon ways, and it terrifies with a feathery variation on David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"". This is just the story; I haven't even touched on the lush production design, the impressive dance numbers, or the convincing performances. Natalie Portman deserves her Oscar win for Best Actress; as Nina she's beautifully frail and panicked, a not-quite-woman who gives into the darkness and pays the cost of artistic perfection. Mila Kunis is sex-charged and smoky, Barbara Hershey makes an unsettlingly perfect bitter-but-loving parent, and Vincent Cassel gets a break from his usual violent villain roles to play a masculine, eel-like impresario. This is Darren Aronofsky's best film since 2000's manic Requiem for a Dream, and while he's yet to make a masterpiece, Black Swan certainly comes closest."

It was a little deeper and i was aware of it because i have seen almost all of Darren's movies. The movie is just perfect. It's exactly my cup of tea.

","Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is a Chilling film. It's scary, ambitious, abstract & courageous. Darren Aronofsky is at his best here, as he manages to hold your attention in most parts of the film, and Natalie Portman delivers a performance that was meant for an Oscar!<br/><br/>'Black Swan' tells the story of a Nina played by Portman, a ballet dancer, perfect fit for the White Swan, while Lily played by Mila Kunis, has a personality that matches the Black Swan. When the two compete for the parts, Nina finds a dark side to herself.<br/><br/>About 107-minutes long, this psychological thriller never really loses pace. In fact, the writing, in some sequences is nail-biting. But, the culmination, leaves you in mixed emotions. Though beautifully shot & executed, the desired impact seems to be missing. A little more of detail would've worked big time! Aronofsky directs this chilly fare, with el'an. In fact, his Oscar-Nomination was so well-deserving. Cinematography is brilliant. The Ballet Dances are wonderfully performed.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Portman obviously steals the show in an Oscar-Winning Performance. And her Ballet Dances, are mesmerizing. Mila Kunis is a revelation. She delivers her finest performance in here. Vincent Cassel is bombastic, while Barbara Hershey proves her caliber once again. Winona Ryder in a brief role, is passable.<br/><br/>On the whole, A Winner! Go For It!"
"JohnRayPeterson","8","2","3","13 March 2011"," Portman is Portman and Black Swan is noir
","Natalie Portman performs brilliantly the psycho-ill ballerina role of Nina. The character is absolutely not, nor is it meant to be, endearing. Nobody likes the characters of psychological thrillers; we don't like them for a variety of reasons but mostly because they creep us out. You would not like to have a psycho-ill person as a friend and no more so as an enemy. So why do we watch those kind of movies? We watch them for the thrill of surprise psycho actions, rarely predictable if well written; we loved them also for the dramatic experience, so long as it's vicarious, and we like them if the actors deliver a solid performance. <br/><br/>The success of this movie genre rest heavily on that precarious performance. Not just anyone can deliver a good solid psycho character performance. Many, too many, have tried unsuccessfully but with little damage to their career. To pull off a good psycho performance requires all the skills and talent proper to great actors and I suppose that's why the ones who are good take on those roles from time to time. <br/><br/>I don't care much for ballet and so know little about it, but I did a little research so as not to sound too big of a fool writing this review. The punishment ballerinas are known to endure for their art is notorious. I think Natalie Portman was quite convincing on that count and you're an idiot if you don't agree with that assessment. She in fact seemed to have the whole ballerina look down pat. <br/><br/>This is why I don't care that much for ballet, too flat chested women, not enough smiling nor meat on the bones, pretty much a personal turn off. I recognized good performances by Natalie Portman and also Vincent Cassel, the key actors and for that reason watched the movie right to the bitter end. I did not enjoy the movie and was not entertained by it; it startled me, disgusted me at times and therefore it had to be good. I would not have enjoyed it regardless, had Nina been a size 36B, smiled for more than five seconds at any one time and nor if I was having my favourite cocktail while watching it. Well perhaps I might with that cocktail."

","Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) is casting for the lead in his new version of 'Swan Lake' and is captivated by the grace, control and pulchritude of Nina Sayers' dancing. Nina (Natalie Portman) is a gifted ballerina, but has become so through a life of submission to her controlling mother (Barbara Hershey). <br/><br/>We're never clear who's manipulating who in Darren Aranofsky's warped psychological thriller. Leroy has a lecherous side and will say anything to bed any of the girls he's supposed to be training. Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina's main rival, is also desperate for the lead part and will stop at nothing to overthrow Nina. Or is Nina manipulating herself? Has the unattainable goal of perfection she – or rather her mother – inculcated in her impaired her psyche? Nothing is as it seems. Or is it?<br/><br/>Beauty might be the effect of ballet, but the process to get to that beauty is shown to be ugly. The film's technicians did much to establish the distinctive look. Colour has been drained, leaving only shades of black, white and grey to saturate everything: a stylistic device, I suspect, to reinforce the White Swan/Black Swan – good vs. evil – metaphor. Attention has obviously been paid to choreography, but it would have made sense to show more of what Portman had learned. Artifice will always be exposed as something artificial. <br/><br/>I don't know what it says about me but I am drawn to artists who suffer for their art. Portman trained for a year and lost weight (20 pounds) to obtain a lissom body. She suffered an array of injuries, including a severe concussion and a twisted rib. <br/><br/>The biggest injury she sustained was the temporary absence of her renowned acting ability. The horror element in the story did something to overshadow her performance. Indeed I'd suggest that the film's success or failure depends on whether the White Swan/Black Swan metaphor is engaging enough. <br/><br/>Sean Penn once said of ballet that you didn't have to like it in order to appreciate it. That's sort of my feeling about this film. <br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net"

","If I had known before I went to see this movie that the director had also directed Pi, I might have passed on it. Having now seen it, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed the experience, or that I am likely to remember the movie a week from now.<br/><br/>For whatever reason I expected a movie about the difficult real life of a ballet dancer. And that was, sort of, what this turned out to be.<br/><br/>But, more and more, it also turned out to be a horror movie, the modern versions of which do nothing for me and I avoid. The leading character, Nina, suffers from what appear to be hallucinations. As a result, you can't tell when something is actually happening and when she is just hallucinating it.<br/><br/>Of course, if the purpose of the movie is to convey what she perceives and feels, I guess the distinction doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>Once I accepted that stance, I found that, since I didn't care for the main character at all and definitely did not identify with her, I really didn't care about anything. I didn't care whether her colleagues were really out to get her, or if she was just extremely paranoid and imagined it all, or some part of it.<br/><br/>And that pretty much sums up my reaction to this movie. I didn't care, and I was happy when it was over, as I don't much care to be manipulated by horror scenes.<br/><br/>Those that do enjoy that might enjoy this. Who knows?"

","Nina Sayers (Portman) has a dream of dancing in the prologue of Swan Lake as the white swan queen. She tells her mother who seems interested but not overly enthusiastic. After breakfast Nina heads off for ballet rehearsals where Thomas Leroy (Cassel) will be selecting his new queen for his latest production, a more visceral display of an old tired classic. Nina wishes to be picked as Leroy slowly wanders around the floor selecting dancers.<br/><br/>Naturally Nina gets selected to play the queen, something that not everyone within the company is pleased about. This has come about due to Leroy's old queen, Beth (Ryder) retiring, or being retired which leads to bad blood between old and new queens. This is when Leroy picks Lily (Kunis) to be Nina's reserve, something that also does not go down well with Nina as it would seem Lily is after taking the role from Nina, which does not help Nina's stress levels, which are becoming extremely detrimental to Nina's health.<br/><br/>Nina strives for utmost perfection but dances with no passion or emotion. While striving for this perfection in her dancing, she never really seems to actually be enjoying her craft. Leroy, obviously wanting more from Nina, believes her to be the perfect white swan, but demands that she let go and free herself in order to capture the passion of the black swan. Add in a dominant and slightly creepy mother and Nina's mental state degrades further and further to the point of madness and self-destruction.<br/><br/>Now I found this film rather difficult to watch and stay with. Despite being a huge fan of Aronofsky (The Wrestler is one of my favourite films) I was never really fully immersed into Black Swan as much as I was expecting to be. I'm unsure if the ballet backdrop was the problem, the script or something else. I'm also not sure if the film was more about Nina's mental state or a documentary about the trials of being a ballet dancer and the stress and sacrifice one must go through to get to the top, not unlike any other dedication.<br/><br/>I also found certain aspects of the story line to drag along, be played out for too long. At one point I was actually urging them to get on with it in my head due to this. I personally feel Aronofsky peaked with The Wrestler and I had high expectations from this film also which were sadly not meant. Direction was great as one would expect by now from him, but everything else just seemed lacking slightly compared to his earlier work.<br/><br/>I didn't think the script was the strongest either, an area usually very tight in an Aronofsky feature. Whether this had anything to do with the numerous re-writes, or that this tale was kind of spun out of The Wrestler itself I'm unsure. The acting in the main is very solid and Cassel is always worth watching, but there are no real stand out performances on view (despite Portman's Oscar win). Naturally given the films backdrop, the classical score is simply beautiful.<br/><br/>Aronofsky (much like other directors) has his legion of fans that will defend anything he makes, and as mentioned previously, I have loved all his prior features, but this one did let me down. A beautiful piece of art to watch indeed, but one that seems just a little disjointed and over symbolic in its presentation and story. A solid film but not to Aronofsky's previous standards.<br/><br/>The Sage's Rating: 7/10"

","Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is an examination of obsession.Obsession in striving for beauty,acceptance,and most of all perfection.It explores the dichotomy involved in both loving and hating yourself."
"khalildawod","9","1","1","13 January 2020"," BLACK SWAN
","In the psychological melodrama of director Darren Aronofsky Black Swan, the film tells the story of ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman), beautiful, weak, naive and on the verge of a nervous breakdown due to her floundering in the double character performance in the Swan Lake Ballet. Nina, a kind and fragile girl, is undoubtedly ideal for the role of White Swan, but the director of the work Thomas (Vincent Castle), doubts about her ability to embody the role of the Black Swan, he pretends that she can master the technique of dance and not feeling.
Nina, who has dedicated her life to ballet, has years of striving for perfection, years of physical and mental training that take you away from normal life. In the art of ballet, its performance is represented by the illusion of triumph over reality or even victory over gravity and this struggle between idealism and reality consumes it completely, especially since we feel that this was not necessarily her choice but the most reality she found herself in. Her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), was a ballerina once and once, and now all her life is about pursuing her daughter's career and living together in a small apartment.
Together they spend time talking like sisters and yet she feels that something is wrong.
The main storyline of the ""Black Swan"" is traditional: what happens behind the scenes, competition and artistic jealousy, but Aronowsky takes these elements and takes us on a frightening journey from within Nina's mind that seems to start confusing the boundaries of reality and illusion. This perception is evident to us at the beginning of the film with dream scenes (literally) to intersect with the dream of a ballerina's life in fact, so it is fair to see that the film is about fear, love and hate, fear of failure, fear of being let down by your body, fear of ignoring, perfect love. The fear of causing disappointment to the woman she loves - her mother - and she also hates her deep hatred is the cause of everything that happens."
"cashbacher","10","1","1","7 January 2020"," More psycho than sexual
","On the cover, this is called a ""psychosexual thriller."" It is far more psycho than sexual, I found it difficult to watch in time units greater than 20 minutes. Natalie Portman stars as Nina, a ballerina that is extremely talented, but even more unstable. She tries out for the lead role in ""Swan Lake"" to be performed by the New York Ballet company. Vincent Cassel plays the intense, hard-driving artistic director, pushing Nina hard. He even engages in what is clearly sexual harassment in his attempts to get Nina to rise to the level of a star. It is clear that sex is not his goal, his mind is on the ballet. Nina lands the role, yet she has not a moment of peace from that point on.
It is clear early in the film that Nina suffers from a serious case of mental illness, she lives with her mother and her mother is not the most stable of individuals. There are many times in the movie where there is action where the viewer is uncertain whether it is real or a wild vision in Nina's mind. All are resolved, but they are very intense and really creepy. At one point, it seems likely that Nina is going to murder her mother. It has been some time since I watched a movie that gave me cold chills, there were many in this one. It is a movie that will make nightmares and it is about ballet, which is somewhat of an odd thought."

Some of the plot developments and symbolism can be obvious, only finding striking notes of astonishment when it retreats into Portman's psyche and lets her growing madness obfuscate reality. Aronofsky's feverish, gripping vision blurs the docudrama-style grittiness of his ""The Wrestler"" with the bracing, messy nightmares of his ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream""; it's the sort of movie that he seemed destined to make, and only he could deliver quite like this.

Perhaps the best movie of 2010, this psychological drama set in the ballet milieu presents the audience with a brilliant, striking, haunting and intense personal drama of one female ballerina's attempt to be the lead in Swan Lake. Natalie Portman, as Nina, must contend with her own inhibitions and fears as the audience must confront their own prejudices and bias regarding movie character stereotypes. In many ways, Nina's journey parallels many of our own fears and imagined monsters. With only three apparent possible editing or directorial alternatives (the selection of the female lead and the biting of the mouth timing, the shot selection for the perceptual view of the rehearsing (unlike Chorus Line), and the murder scene that didn't seem to quite have the clarity of character persona transformation and credibility), this amazing personal almost mature David Lynch-like presentation makes Blawk Swan a voyage of discovery and layered emotional and psychological density the most absorbing, powerful movie of the year."

"andrewroy-04316","10","1","1","20 December 2018"," Black Swan is a roaring success as utterly intense and immersive thriller with deeper layers to it
","Black Swan feels like a combination of an obsession-based movie, like Whiplash, with a psychological thriller with a complex but unreliable narrator, like Fight Club and so many others. What allows it to so wholly succeed in both areas is the all time great performance by Natalie Portman. She shows the intensely driven to succeed but still very controlling and careful Nina early, and does a great job making her descent into madness and devotion to the part realistic and even relatable. The peripheral characters and setting were excellent, particularly Nina's controlling mother and the atmosphere Aronofsky deeply immerses us in at the elite ballet academy. While it is fundamentally a study of Nina's metamorphosis from the innocent, meticulously committed white swan to the aggressive, fearless black swan, the plot itself is entertaining and holds plenty of uncertainty. The many underlying themes that stay in your mind elevate Black Swan further. The recurrence and use of mirrors throughout the movie, punctuated in the dressing room scene with Lily, was fascinating, and Aronofsky's light and dark imagery, particularly with what Nina and Lily wear throughout the movie and his lighting, were intelligent choices symbolizing the two swans. The ending was just perfect, mirroring the actions of the play and showing that the transformation to black swan was complete, with the white swan dead. My only real complaint was with Cassel's performance - I didn't think he sold the lustful, enigmatic role he was meant to, and the relationship between him and Nina was not particularly engaging or well developed, only being saved by Portman's telling reactions and evolution relative to him throughout. Black Swan is such a special movie because it's great on several levels - I love it as an obsession/what you're willing to do to succeed movie, as a psychological thriller, and as an intelligent, symbolic movie, and it's immersive as hell from start to finish. This is truly a cinematic masterpiece."

I won't tell you what happens to her in this movie to be spoiler free, but some stuff goes down. This movie even scared me at times. Her ballet director is kind of a creep but he completely cares about the performance and Natalie Portman's health and well being. She also has competition for this leading part and some stuff happens with that as well. Mila Kunis was also in this movie, and she actually acted really well. I don't really take her seriously as an actor, but she was really good in this movie. The ending is yet thrilling and terrifying, and the last shot in the movies says so much with so little.

","Black Swan was once again a movie I had on my 2011 Oscar highlights to watch and was also a movie I've looked forward to watching for quite some time. Black Swan is directed by Darren Aronofsky and tells the story of Nina a ballet dancer who tries to prepare as well as she can for an upcoming role while also fearing that she might go insane in the process.<br/><br/>This was a terrific movie with a very dramatic story and great suspense. The performances first, are all top notch especially from Natalie Portman who deservedly won the Oscar in 2011. The story is polarizing. On one hand we have the realistic approach with Nina and how she copes with the role she gets, but on the other hand we see a more imaginative world in the movie taking place inside Nina's head while she is going nuts due to her role. This two are perfectly tied into one another mainly by Darren's great direction. There are times when you as an audience feel like Nina not knowing when the reality and when the imagination end and when the other one begins. This makes for a very unpredictable story which kept me involved in the movie until it's very end. Talking about the end, it's very dramatic and the way it was done only with images made me feel so much for it's characters and that is something rare in a movie to make the audience feel emotions only through images without any dialogue whatsoever. The message this movie sends towards its audience is very simple and powerfull at the same time. What would you be capabale of doing in order to fulfil your deam? Would you be willing to let yourself changed into something ugly in order to acheieve that?
Is your profession more important than your life? Would you be able to find the right balance between those two? The cinematography is extremely good in so many moments most of which are close-ups of Nina which makes the viewer more like her most of the time. The score although is more of a nonconformist score integrates very well within the movie and enhances it. The only gripes I might have with the movie is that at some points tries to transmit certain ideas that I for one did not saw them suited for this movie but overall there are a lot more other lesson to be learned from this movie along it's runtime. Another gripe I might have with the movie is that in the beginning Nina's hallucinations are somewhat random and it was hard for me to fandom what was that all about. Aside from that this movie is awesome and powerful and extremely emotional at times.<br/><br/>Overall: a great movie with great performances, great story, powerful moments and emotions but at times somewhat polarizing in it's message. 10/10"

","This movie is beyond my expectation. What I mean is, I believe those who love to watch exciting movie like Fast and Furious or Star Wars can enjoy watching it undoubtedly. Too often watching some movies received Academy Award nomination is a snooze fest, especially ones in which actors or actresses are free to demonstrate their acting skills. Black Swan, however, is not a tedious movie at all. Even if you are not interested in ballet, you still can have fun watching it because the movie puts less emphasis on ballet. And I want to suggest that those who don't like thriller and bloody movies should not watch it. <br/><br/>Well runs a saying that there is a fine line between genius and insanity. Too often it takes great pains to pursuit and achieve perfection for a artist. This movie presents the process in which Natalie Portman, as a ballerina, wants to dance the Swan Lake to perfection and shoulders a great deal of responsibility and, of course, stress that eventually drives her crazy. At first, I regard the movie as a B movie or a cult because in many scenes some horrible objects or elements jump out at me out of the blue; Nevertheless, the psychological condition of the Nina as well as the lamentable yet reasonable ending appeals to me. After watching it, I still cannot distinguish reality from virtuality, just like another brilliant movie, Shutter Island, which put audience in Nina's place, experiencing paranoia and lunacy together with her. Choosing ballet, which seems a graceful performance, to be the theme for interpreting repression, thriller and crazy is a perfect idea for sure."

The editing make easy to believe that she's going insane at the same time that the audience have no idea of what's going on. That brings us to the higher point of the movie, the directing. Full of imaginative chops and claustrophobic close-ups on Portman's face, making who's watching to feel her agony and despair. 
Even full of traumatizing moments, the film never forget to be sexy and provocative, evoking the audience to it biggest tension, especially at the final dance presentations which shows the ultimate directing skills of Aronofsky - well-deserved Oscar nomination - and take off our breathing.

","Darren Aronofsky did direct some of my favorite movies regarding modern movie making: The Fountain is one of my absolute favorite movies and with The Wrestler Aronofsky gave Mickey Rourke back his dignity as an actor (anyone remembers Barfly from 1987!?).<br/><br/>Black Swan is another masterpiece - a fine mixture of drama and elements of thriller, with great acting (Portman, Kunis, Cassel), and a fine story about the sometimes just too fine line between real passion and madness. The end of the movie is imo for a very long time one of the most poetic ones, maybe ever. Tragedy in the scale of a drama of Shakespeare I would dare to say. <br/><br/>Top notch!"

"Screen_Blitz","9","1","1","2 August 2017"," Darren Aronofsky's twisted tale is both gripping and uncompromising, and not without the genuine performance by Natalie Portman
","This Darren Aronofsky piece is a bleak and twisted tale focusing on the dark side of the world of ballerina, and far from ways you would to expect. It is an uncompromising character study of a woman who dreams to landing her dream role in a ballet are pushing to grueling limits, both psychological and physical. With Aronofsky's signature directing style operating the wheel, this film leans far from your average melodrama. There are shades of both horror and fantasy soaring through the atmosphere, drawing reminiscence of David Lynch. In this case, it is safe to classify this as a psychological thriller. How can a film about women dancing and prancing around in tutus slide into such bizarre territory? That is where Aronofsky's visual storytelling and gripping testament of psychological warfare come into play The director treats ballet as not just an art form, but as a blood sport with tragic consequences. The pinnacle of this dark, albeit intriguing tale is Natalie Portman who manages to shine high above nearly everything Aronofsky brings to life on screen. This film follows Nina Sayers (played by Natalie Portman), a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing and manipulative mother (played by Barbara Hershey). When Nina auditions for the role of the Black Swan for the musical 'Swan Lake', she manages to impress director Thomas Leroy (played by Vincent Cassel). However, he believes she lacks the sensuality for the role of Black Swan and instead hands her the role of White Swan, replacing an aging ballerina Beth Macintyre (played by Winona Ryder). Meanwhile, the role of the Black Swan handed over to newcomer Lily (played by Mila Kunis). As the premier of the musical approaches, Nina and Lily form a mysterious friendship that spirals into a twisted rivalry of both try desperately to outdo each other. Soon, Nina pushes herself to the point of losing her sanity. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's never holds back when portraying his sobering testament on how obsession to surpass one's quality can destroy both your inner and outer being. While he does have the tendency to take things over the top with his surreal imagery on just a few occasions, there is never a moment that feels squandered by any means. Opening up an electrifying ballet sequence shot by beautifully by Matthew Libatique, this film revolves around a character study of a woman who's psychological limits are tested by her obsession to land the role of her dreams, and does so by not just splashing us in the face of emotional resonance but presenting the action through a gripping methodology of visual storytelling. His inspiring methods allow for some dark twists and astounding surprises that leave us questioning what is real and what is not real. Is Nina living an unforgiving nightmare? Or is her obsession with competing against Lily driving her to the brink of mental insanity. Could it be both? Those are thoughts that keep us glued to our seats as we sit back to admire not only the absorbing atmosphere of the world of ballerina seemingly gone mad, but the captivating performances the cast brings to the table. Natalie Portman swallows up the role with tour-de-force versatility and complexity, a performance that allows her to expand her acting chops to astonishing boundaries. She simply grabs you by the heart and fails to let go. Vincent Cassel is genuine in his role as well, banking in sheer humanity and fortitude. It would also be a shame not to mention Mila Kunis's effort in her role. Each minute she and Portman are on screen, their chemistry is powerful, almost spellbinding -- especially in a shocking, yet erotic scene when the two engage in steamy sexual intercourse. There is a certain erotica behind their performances that keeps these actresses shining, not in a way to fulfill viewers' perverted desires but to pervade a sense of eeriness in their relationship. Although their friendship-turned- rivalry is a working hand at keeping the story on fire, it is Natalie Portman's Nina Sayers and her emotionally bleak deterioration into self-destructiveness that works the core of the film.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a twisted, surreal, yet gripping psychological drama piece grounded by an uncompromising directorial methodology by Darren Aronofsky and performances by both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis that simply demand for your attention. As this soars with Aronofsky's trademark style, this film will most certainly not please everyone. If you were uncomfortable by the relentlessly bleak imagery and material of Aronofsky's previous works, you may want to give this one a pass. Otherwise, come see what he has to offer here."

","This beautiful nightmare truly deserves recognition. It really brings the sympathy in you for Nina's struggles and stress she was being put through. This movie is astonishing and Natalie Portman earned her Academy Award for the Black Swan. From pain to romanticism, the movie throughout caught my attention and the cast was chosen very well. This movie is a movie that always needs a second watch to fully understand the concept of the story and events taken place, especially considering how dark and thrilling this movie is. This is by far my favourite drama genre movie, it was definitely worth a watch. Darren Aronofsky did an excellent job on Black Swan."
"grahamcarter-1","6","1","1","10 June 2017"," Suspiria
","Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' (2010) is a psychological thriller that recalls the finest of Italian 'Giallo.' It's rare for a film these days to actually be frightening, with most contemporary horror flicks aiming to be merely repulsive; assaulting the viewer instead of seducing them.<br/><br/>Like Dario Argento's 'Suspiria', 'Black Swan' is essentially a fairy-tale for adults. Argento's stylistic flourishes, both psychological and visual, permeate 'Black Swan'. The lethal eroticism of sharp-edged objects, a virginal heroine in the thrall of suppressed sexuality, story largely set in a theater, windows and mirrors as portals into the subconscious, lesbianism, secret societies, occultism.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has acknowledged there are similarities between the anime 'Perfect Blue' and his film 'Black Swan. However I think 'Black Swan' would make a great triple bill with 'Suspiria' and Argento's 'Opera'. Aronofsky was also attached the remake of 'Suspiria' for a few years."

","This is not a film for entertainment, nor is it some kind of a philosophical film. It is a work of art, but, meant to make an impression, like a strange painting or some such thing.<br/><br/>Looked at from that perspective, it's OK. It's over-hyped, but, it did make an impression on me. I guess if it doesn't make an impression on you, you'll be left wondering: what the hell was that? That explains the reason why there are so many totally opposite reviews of this film.<br/><br/>I don't mind that it's not in a clearly defined genre - as it is neither a thriller, nor a horror, nor a drama, yet has elements from all. But, I do feel that, for example, the horror elements are kind of too much, and it was when those started to happen near the end of the movie that I kind of felt ""OK, so, you're trying to make an impression, I get it, but is there anything else?"". Unfortunately, I didn't find anything else.<br/><br/>Similar goes for ""not knowing what's real and what's not"". Sure, Natalie Portman is crazy, it's fine that she doesn't know. But, we don't either, to the extent that doesn't serve a purpose, other than to, you guessed it, make an impression. I mean it's nice to leave the viewer a little unsure as to what's real, but, that works best if there are some clues as to what is and what isn't - and the director let's you choose for yourself, to some effect. Here, there are almost no clues and you choosing what's real doesn't matter all that much.<br/><br/>Other than that, acting is fine, though I did find Natalie Portman's performance over-hyped (she's OK, but not great), directing is OK for what it wants to do, similar goes for the story (there are plot holes, but, hey, it's about a crazy person).<br/><br/>As a parting remark: this surely doesn't make you like ballet more! :)"

","If you want to see an exercise in child-abuse this it the movie for you. It starts with a mother who forces her child to follow into her exact footsteps and have the ballet career she never had (because she got pregnant!), which leads to the daughter torturing herself with starvation-diets and gruesome exercises in a futile attempt to please her mother. As so many abused children her total lack of 'self' makes her an easy pray for sexual predators and their manipulations. She sadly never manages to come into her own (though there is a short episode of lashing out by sleeping with a random boy and with a 'bad girl' friend). And eventually dies at the end of the movie, in a scene that seems to suggest this climax of unending psychological and physical brutality heaped onto a young woman is somehow 'artistic'"
"paul2001sw-1","6","1","1","9 February 2014"," Surprisingly camp
","Darren Aronofsky's film 'Black Swan' tells the story of a ballet dancer driven to madness by her paranoid fears of her fellow cast members and the challenge of expressing two sides of her own personality in an important double role. I'm no expert on ballet, but to me one problem of this film is that Natalie Portman so palpably conveys her growing discomfort in the role that she doesn't seem credible as the lead; the sense to which she appears ill-at-ease would surely lead to any director casting someone else in her stead. I also found the character is closed to the audience; the film didn't do enough to make me care about her. The final twist is clever but camp; but for a realistic portrait of the pressures of being a professional performer, look elsewhere."
"mbsilva2512","6","1","1","5 February 2014"," The black side
","The black side.<br/><br/>Black swan is a movie about a fragile girl whose the mother had put off frustrated dreams of be a famous ballerina. The dream of any ballerina is to dance The Lake of the Swans, by Tchaikovsky, and when Nina is chosen to dance it feeling of realization is immediate. But just as success is very expensive. The movie operates as new reading of ""The Lake of The Swans"" and, just as Odete who is stuck in a swan body; the mind of the protagonist is stuck for psychological traumas. The fragile Nina feels the pressure of be the protagonist and the fragile psyche collapses. Nina is perfect for white swan, because she is pure and ingenuous, but she is not for the black swan that is more audacious and malicious. Nina feels more and more pressure and slowly goes crazy. <br/><br/>The character is forced for the director (she is in love for him) to have contact with her black side and from this moment she develops a second personality. In search of the perfection Nina and Odete get confused.The mirrors that show up during the movie are reflecting the perturbation of the character; they show the really disturbed psyche of Nina. The director of the ballet knows that there is a black swan inside of Nina and stimulates her black side. Just as the prince to prefer Odile (the black swan) the director and the public prefer the black swan, alter ego of Nina. But Nina's psyche is divided between evil and good, between light and dark. It's then that the already fragile psyche of the character is destroyed and she is led to death.<br/><br/>The Nina's dilemma of is common to everybody who seeks success at all costs, she sacrificed herself for the sake of the show and maybe, because of that the character causes empathy the audience."

We are left wondering is Nina going crazy. What I assumed from the ending was that the pressure just got to her and started to believe her life was like the white swan she was playing. Where in the end, the swan commits suicide. But I still don't get all the weird visions in the mirror and her ""killing a fellow dancer""; which wasn't real. And her dance instructor was just creepy. And what about Beth, the washed up dancer. Was any of her getting hit by a car real. Did Nina really hurt her in the hospital or just herself. Too many unanswered questions for me.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Does not live up to the hype, skip it."
"CranberriAppl","Null","1","1","8 October 2011"," What's the fuss about? Possible spoilers
","I finally caught this today, and I really don't see the fuss. As full disclosure, I didn't see any of the other Best Actress movies, so I cannot say who deserved to win, but I was incredibly underwhelmed by NP's performance. Natalie's expressions were Stressed and More Stressed. Oh, and Paranoid. Not a lot of range in this. With all the accolades, I was expecting to be blown away. I felt like I was watching NP play an obsessed (and mentally-ill) ballerina. Portman came off as very aware of this being an Oscar-bait role, and thus the performance never seemed organic. As note: MAJOR props to the special effects team. I enjoyed Nina's visual transformation near the climax from the White Swan features to the Black Swan. <br/><br/>As for the story, I expected more. It was dark, but based on reviews, I expected something more disturbing and maybe unusual? I did turn away from certain parts, such as the breaking legs and bloody feet scenes as things like that make me queasy. Based on my one viewing, it seemed to be a study on mental illness. Shades of Fight Club and Memento(both are superior), but without soul and genuine intrigue. I don't mind a movie left to the viewer's interpretation, but this movie made sure everything was up in the air. This movie asked for a lot of assumptions. We never saw Beth (Winona Ryder) dance. So it's unclear why (aside from being the prima) Nina idolizes her. We never see the other ladies audition, so Nina winning the part could really be a result of the director's creepy fixation on her than of talent. We don't see what makes Thomas' ""visceral"" Swan Lake so unique, in terms of how much of the actual performance we see. All we're watching is Nina's descent into further madness, which is fine, but I expected the climax to consume more of the run-time. I don't need anything spelled out, but the way the movie left things felt obnoxious and lazy. On the other hand, could all the light/dark/black/white have been more obvious? I've never seen Swan Lake, but based on what I've read, this was a perverted interpretation. The gratuitous sex scenes were cheap (Monster's Ball cheap) and did not move the plot. Even Portman commented on how the scene w/Kunis was how you get people in the theater. The old train pervert served no purpose.I was hoping the movie would show appreciation for ballet, but it didn't, and I'm not a dancer. 127 Hours showed both the wonders and the dangers of nature, for example. The dream sequence in Oklahoma was a better tribute to ballet. Then again, two characters did talk us through the storyline of Swan Lake, so I guess that should have been a clue that we wouldn't ""see"" it.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me was we're to believe that Nina is obsessed about being the Swan, but she doesn't seem obsessive about anything else. Not asking for much, but something as simple as having to brush her hair w/100 strokes every night or some OCD-type habit. Don't think the vomiting applies b/c I think that was stress- related. I guess self-mutilation would work, as stated earlier, anything with blood or if I felt blood/peeling skin/etc coming, I looked away. Plus, this was not done in the open, so I feel they could have added something that other characters saw. The couple of ""mean girl"" ballerinas in the beginning of the film seemed like perfect candidates to hone in on some quirk of Nina's that would point to her problem. How is it that her obsessiveness is so contained? If gratuitous sex could be added, then surely, Aronofsky could have developed Nina more. <br/><br/>Mila Kunis' character wasn't as fleshed out as I expected which leads me to believe that Nina imagined her. I believe the movie was about Nina's disturbed psyche brought on by her repressed childhood/adulthood and it culminated into her killing herself. She had a mom that was trying to live through her and she had that internal struggle of not being good enough in a highly competitive profession. <br/><br/>Another review pointed it out, but what in the world was with the mother's drawings? It was weird seeing them the first time, but when we see them again, they're animated? Unless I blinked, Nina never brought them up to her mother. Are we to believe that with at least 40 drawings in that room, Nina has never seen them? Really?<br/><br/>As a superficial observation, Natalie Portman is only 30, but looked a lot older. I get the reasons for her weight loss, but visually, it did her no favors and she came across quite harsh on screen. NOT attacking Natalie, but she looked no younger than Winona which made it somewhat unbelievable that Nina's supposedly this great dancer, but has yet to have a leading role at her age. I can't remember if they said how old she was, but anything other than 29/30 is not believable. Certainly not at a peak age which I hear is early 20s. <br/><br/>The ending was a letdown. When Nina said ""I felt it...It was perfect...That was perfect."" (complete with a smile), my ears actually heard "" All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."" So cheesy. Probably won't watch again as it didn't live up to the hype. Mulholland Drive might be a better movie. In fact, Summer Glau as a tortured ballerina dancing 'Giselle' ('Waiting in the Wings' episode of Angel) exhibited more emotion, intrigue, and coherency."

","Darren Aronofsky has made some of the most remarkable nightmares on film. Whether plunging into the mystique of numerology, the destructive wages of drug abuse, or the woes of a wrestler past his prime, Aronofsky makes films of style and intellect that are topped by very few directors, especially in this day and age. Sure enough, ""Black Swan"" is just as worthy of a film as the director's previous efforts.<br/><br/>I felt the film started off as a typical, mild character-driven drama; lots of ladies dancing, lots of bitter rivalry and stress, but little on conflict, much less style. But toward the second half, the film became totally whack. A few visual hints are dropped in the first half, which will likely make you blink and ask yourself ""did I really see that?!"" In the second half, it becomes substantially more intense, the visuals become extraordinarily trippy and surreal, and all conflict reaches a proper climax. If you stick with it, the film will be engrossing and sublime, with enough emotional punch and food-for-thought to keep you intrigued and entertained. I'd say it's about as rewarding as ""Fight Club."" The story itself is simple and straightforward; a petty drama involving ballerinas doing a bold new vision of the Swan Lake spiel. As the film goes on, it reaches deeper beneath the surface and pulls up some strong character development and refreshing thematic territory. This is very much a story about perfection, not only in the dancers' performances, but in the sense of duality: the union between light and dark creates a perfect balance that ultimately drives the main character to confront, fight, and ultimately transform herself. Not to mention, there are also some strong themes concerning maturity, lifestyles, sexuality, and ambition. The film also manages to throw in decent helpings of paranoia, and works very effectively to toy around with the audience's sense of understanding what's real in the film and what isn't. In the end, it may not be a terribly grandiose plot, but it does have great depth, and I find the central theme of corruption and duality quite elegant.<br/><br/>As far as the cinematography goes, I was pleased with the photography; there are some bouncy documentary-style cameras, but not nearly as many as I expected. Editing is excellent. Acting is great; Natalie Portman is perfect as Nina and Vincent Cassel is good. I usually find it hard to take Mila Kunis seriously, but she actually did a great job here. Writing seems good. Production value is high, and contains some awesome costumes and interesting sets. Clint Mansell's use of classical music fits this movie well, and does have a few standout moments.<br/><br/>There are quite a few sex scenes, a few cringe-worthy moments, and a lot of dark surreal imagery, and will likely deter some viewers. But none of it is overly-graphic or gratuitous at all, and I see little reason not to recommend it to anybody.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4.5/5, emotional impact: 3/5)"

","How far would you go to be perfect? After her lifelong dream of being the lead in a ballet, Nina (Portman) finally gets her chance. Pushing herself as hard as she can, she becomes so absorbed in the role it changes her life. This is a difficult movie to review without giving too much away. I can say that this is not your typical ballet movie. This is the same director of ""Requiem For A Dream"" and that should tell you what type of film this is. I would call this a borderline horror movie, and there are equal parts sex and blood as there is dancing. Lily (Kunis) plays the Yin to Nina's Yang and the movie is better because of the two sides coming together. The director did the near impossible with this movie, a ballet movie that guys will really enjoy. I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie, or the the performances. Portman deservedly won the Oscar, and the fact that Kunis was snubbed in a big injustice. If you don't want to watch this because of the ballet, keep in mind that it is only a part of the movie. It is more of a trippy thriller than anything, a very good and well done movie. You will not be disappointed. I give it an A.<br/><br/>Would I watch again? - Yes, I would.

","Reading reviews of Black Swan online made me come to a logical consensus; you either love it, or hate it. There is really no in between. If so you're leaning to one side. The film is definitely an art film. I saw a poster for this a while back as it proudly displays it's selected showings at The Toronto Film Festival and Venice 2010. Once I saw those two little messages on opposite sides of the poster I knew that one, this was a serious film, and two, it's likely to get some Oscar nominations. Junior film critic intuition.<br/><br/>Black Swan was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress (Natalie Portman), and Best Director. Sadly, it found itself a bit neglected compared to hefty competition with The King's Speech and The Social Network. At least Portman was recognized for her unique and thrilling role as Nina Sayers, a ballet dancer working at a stunning academy in New York City.<br/><br/>The director Thomas (Cassel) chooses Nina to be the white swan in the retelling of Swan Lake. Nina is thrilled to have the job, but she feels held back and forced into a box she can't fit into by her controlling and strict mother (Hershey). Nina's mom was an aspiring dancer, but failed to get to the level of fame and is now forcing her daughter to do what she couldn't do. She clearly wants the best, but not in the right way.<br/><br/>The pressure but on Nina is relenting and makes her have strange, unexplainable hallucinations and anxiety levels of high calibers. She is almost on the verge of going insane. She strives to be perfect, but at the same time she's up on a pedestal her mom and she herself know she can't live up to. It's a sad state of affairs for this poor women.<br/><br/>The cinematography and especially the music is extraordinary and very vibrant. The score is gripping and is easily the best soundtrack composed for any film in 2010. Natalie, excuse me, Oscar Winner Natalie Portman gives an electrifying performance and documents the struggle will full seriousness. She had that Oscar in the bag before the nominations came out.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis is brilliant here as well. I have called Kunis an amazing woman of beautiful looks and now I can call her one of beautiful looks and major talent. Not like she didn't have talent before this film, she just never got to showcase it like she did in this film.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky knew where he wanted to take Black Swan - above and beyond expectations. It's a film not only worthy of the Best Picture win, but a movie that should've had a wider release and more mainstream promotion. The acting, the screenplay, music, lighting, plot, etc is outstanding and some of the best 2010 has to offer.<br/><br/>As for ""the scene"" with Portman and Kunis I wasn't all amused or aroused. I'm not a fan of lesbian sex scenes in any film. Horror, comedy, or melodrama it isn't the kind of thing I like to watch. The film Bitch Slap was great exploitation, but the continuous lesbian love scene was too long and almost soiled the film and what it had going for it. While it's not meant for the reason it appears, Black Swan knows when to start it and when to stop it.<br/><br/>When it comes to ballet movies, the few and far between, there are only a selected number of people who like ballet let alone the ones who want to see it on film. I admit I probably never would've seen Black Swan if it wasn't up for nominations. But I was attracted to the film when Kunis's name appeared on the poster, but could never find a theater near me that played it. I didn't even know the plot to the film and still was interested.<br/><br/>The less you know going into see Black Swan, the better.<br/><br/>Starring: Natalie Portman.

All four were psychological dramas in their own ways. After all of the Top 10 lists and reviews I was looking forward to this film. The review on IMDb said ""The reaction of the audience was evident as the end credits came. NO ONE left their seats. They sat and applauded loudly the names as they scrolled up, then upon the very last credit on the screen, they applauded loudly again."" Completely the opposite, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over and 3/4 of a nearly full theater left when it went to white before the credits started. I appreciate independent art films, I have seen many. Although Natalie Portman was exceptional and will probably win the Oscar my review would be ""this may be the worst movie I have ever seen"". ""Showgirls"" is now a close second, at least it didn't try to pass itself off as art. I'm not comparing the two because of the lesbian overtones but because they were both possibly the worst films ever made. It isn't a comparison for the ""dancing"" either."

","Mitch Hansch/ movieswithmitch.com Masterful technician Darren Aronofsky follows up his 2008 tortured male athlete film, ""The Wrestler"", with the female counter piece, ""Black Swan"". Aronofsky delves deep into the cut-throat world of ballet with its intensely demanding physicality and harsh office politics. Aronofsky casts Natalie Portman in a sure-fire Oscar nomination as the repressed and insecure dancer who finally gets her shot to shine as lead in the production of ""Swan Lake"". Portman's portrayal of Nina Sayers obsessive strive for perfection that veers into dementia is perfection. I wish I could say the same for Aronofsky's dictatorship..ur.. I mean direction. His overbearing hand frustrated this viewer, keeping me from throwing red roses on stage for ""Black Swan"" instead merely keeping me from throwing rotten tomatoes.<br/><br/>Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake tells the story of the white swan princess who when she finds love, is betrayed and in her madness, darkly becomes the black swan. The fragile Nina (Portman) can play white swan no problem but tapping into the black swan is. Stage director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) and his womanizer reputation casts her believing he can get the black swan from her. When the younger care-free dancer Lily, played with a powerful sexuality from an excellent performance by Mila Kunis, comes onto the scene she becomes Nina's alternate and a constant object for Nina's insecurities. As you can see, Aronofsky is quite literal with his story of Swan Lake. Excellent performances aside, ""Black Swan"" isn't as interesting as it seems, simply depending on horror-esquire tactics that jar the senses but are hollow in content.<br/><br/>Dance is Nina's life. When asked to introduce herself, she replies ""dancer"" instead of Nina. Her room is pink with stuffed animals and she's still under the thumb of her supremely oppressive stage mother (Barbara Hershey). Nina is buckling under the pressure and slowly begins a path towards madness. Visions of doppelgangers in the subway show influence from Adrian Lyne's ""Jacob Ladder"" and vividly horrifying nightmares of physical trauma blur with reality of what is and is not. A bad habit of scratching resurfaces for Nina that her mother hides with some make-up and a controlling clipping of her nails that's ramped up audibly, keeping you on edge. Early on Thomas explains their version of the swan lake will be stripped down and bare. I wish Aronofsky would have done that with the film. Instead, there is an obsessive-compulsive control over every shot, beating us in the face with his style and not letting Portman's harrowing performance take spotlight as much as it should.<br/><br/>Portman is amazing, doing 90% of her own dancing including the spectacular climatic show stopping performance. Aronofsky makes the world of ballet a riveting backdrop which is rarely shown in film. Portman is nakedly intense and brings us along best as she can as she loses herself in Nina's fall but we're manipulated by Aronofsky continually pulling out the horror-laden-madness rug from under us. Her maddening is angering instead of gut wrenching, as it could have been. At the end of Aronofsky's ""Requiem For a Dream"" we feel the characters' complete loss and we're in despair for them but in ""Black Swan"" he wanted the outcome to be tragic yet beautiful, however I didn't feel much of either.<br/><br/>Propelled by outstanding performances, none more than Portman's, Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" is a dance worth accepting even if it has several missteps along the way.<br/><br/>""This"" has several missteps along the way.<br/><br/>﻿John 10:20"
"kalista1984","2","9","25","6 January 2011"," Natalie looks great only as a White Swan
","In my opinion, this movie is a way overrated. We've a beautiful ballerina, Nina (Natalie's beauty is stunning) who wants to embody two different roles (Black Swan and the White one), but, as her coach opinion (Cassel), she could be only a white swan, because of her innocence and evident inexperience in life. Another ballerina, Lily (Kunis) wants the major role too, and she's perfect for it, for Black Swan part. The only way Nina could learn to be a different person is lose her control and give her anger off over Lily, in a strange union of perversion and itch to be convincing. The problem of this movie is not the idea of make a movie about classical dance or about the hard approach of a young dancer to one of the most difficult roles, but is in screenplay. I haven't been overwhelmed by this one, and the acting is not very good. Especially Portman, who, although her incredible beauty, is very very overrated as an actress. I don't understand why every American critic define her as a prodigious. She has only two facial expressions: happy and sad. She's insomuch concentrate to be convincing as a ballerina that she forget to act as a problematic girl. She's convincing when she's the perfect and pretty girl, but she couldn't do the opposite. I'm sorry, because I know she's a very clever girl. The rest of the cast is a little bit better; the only strong performance is Mila Kunis, a great revelation. Cassel is in part, but not at his best; Ryder can do much better, but here she has only a small role. It's the same for Barbara Hershey. Definitely, a good idea in a wrong movie."

","Black Swan was one of the most anticipated movies of the 2010 Venice Film Festival (which is where I saw it), due to Darren Aronofsky's Golden Lion victory two years earlier for The Wrestler. After its premiere screening, on the opening night no less, it was met with conflicting reactions, ranging from sky-high praise to utter indifference, with some even calling it Aronofsky's worst picture alongside the hugely underrated The Fountain. Were such comments deserved? Absolutely not, but that doesn't mean Black Swan is a masterpiece either. In fact, it is fair to call it Aronofsky's least accomplished piece of work.<br/><br/>Set in the very familiar (from Aronofsky's films, that is) contemporary New York, Black Sawn is a dark, psychological thriller about two women: Nina (Natalie Portman) and Lily (Mila Kunis). The former is a young, promising member of a local ballet company, which the latter has recently joined. When company director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) announces his next project is going to be a revival of Swan Lake, he states that Nina is the ideal replacement for former star Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), who is about to retire due to her age. However, Nina has to prove herself worthy of the double role of the fair and innocent Swan Queen and the deceptive, seductive Black Swan, or she will also be replaced. Fearing Lily might steal her thunder, Nina grows more paranoid by the day, while also tapping into her repressed sexuality to find her inner Black Swan.<br/><br/>Despite the alleged ""indie"" tag (the film is distributed by Fox Searchlight, whose parent company previously financed The Fountain), Black Swan is very much a studio effort, with a budget that, while relatively low (13 million dollars), is more than the cost of Pi, Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler put together (The Fountain, on the other hand, remains Aronofsky's priciest picture). In fact, comparisons with The Wrestler - the director himself has said the two movies are companion pieces - highlight where Black Swan derails: whereas the Mickey Rourke-starring drama was a truly independent film, not to mention Aronofsky's best (and in no small measure because of his decision to let go of his usual directorial tricks), the ballet thriller is a compromise between a studio product - evident in the classic theme, akin to All About Eve, and the cast - and the filmmaker's personal vision, which reverts to Requiem for a Dream sensibilities for a story he didn't write himself.<br/><br/>Not that it's necessarily a bad thing: in its most inspired moments, Black Swan is an exquisite picture, pulsating with life and filled with indelible, nightmarish images that showcase the heroine's gradual descent into madness, all coordinated with beautiful choreography and impeccable musical cues. Unfortunately, the second half proves to be too weird for its own good, with a shift in tone that aims for visceral horror - think Polanski mixed with early Cronenberg - but gets caught up in some decidedly embarrassing moments, most notably the bulk of scenes involving a hammy Barbara Hershey as Nina's overbearing mother.<br/><br/>And yet it holds up until the end, and not just thanks to a lesbian sex scene that is bound to become a guilty pleasure lynch-pin. While the director's idiosyncrasies may get out of hand, his cast is fully committed and delivers solid work throughout (well, minus Hershey): Cassel is as enjoyably nasty as ever, and Kunis, who unexpectedly won the Mastroianni Award in Venice, finally sheds off the memory of Max Payne and American Psycho 2 and establishes herself as a promising dramatic actress. As for Portman, her schizophrenic role is one of the bravest she's ever tackled, and she remains a majestic, compelling presence for the duration of the movie, while Ryder nearly manages to steal her thunder with just a handful of scenes that ring scarily true: being herself in her late thirties during the shoot, the actress knows all too well what it's like to risk becoming a has-been, and gives an angry, unforgettable performance that should get her an Oscar.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a dazzling, spellbinding and frustrating picture. Tonally uneven and occasionally self-indulgent, it nevertheless manages to seduce and intrigue and, at its best, reminds us that Aronofsky is one of the most original and visionary names in contemporary American cinema."

","I am not really a fan of ballet. Ordinarily I would not really catch a film with this setting. However in this case, the Oscar buzz surrounding ""Black Swan"" made me want to watch it. So I watched, and I was enthralled by its artistry and repelled by its subject matter at the same time.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" tells of Nina, a promising young ballet dancer, who led a very sheltered life shuttling on trains between her ballet and her home with a domineering mother. When she wins the lead role of Swan Queen in an upcoming production of ""Swan Lake,"" she begins to mentally unravel in the most disturbing emotional, psychological, and physical (?) breakdown captured on screen. Can she successfully pull off the dance she had dreamed off all her life, or will her demons turn her dreams into a nightmare?<br/><br/>We see Natalie Portman like we have never seen her before. She is both very fragile and very daring in her tour de force performance as the rigid and repressed girl obsessed with perfection. Her ballet sequences were very realistic. She was truly a prima ballerina in this production. Not even a hot lesbian love scene could deter her. Her Oscar for Best Actress is clearly within her grasp. Mila Kunis plays Lily, a rival dancer with a contrasting carefree and natural dance style, with so much vitality in contrast with Portman's frigidity. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mother, whom we could not immediately see as good or bad for her.<br/><br/>It is impossible to describe in words this very visual film experience. I would not want to spoil things for you. You will not know which things are real and not. This is NOT just a ballet movie. Amidst the beauty, there is a persistently disturbing and downright scary tone as the movie reaches its climax. You will be hypnotized, but several times you would also want to stop watching the film. The disturbing images will stay with you. Like ballet, this film is also not for everyone, but for me, director Darren Aronofsky has created himself a classic psychological thriller."

","Film provocateur Darren Aronofsky takes the theme of artistic obsession and perfection to breathtaking extremes in ""Black Swan,"" his latest movie freak out.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, an accomplished but cold ballerina, whose obsession with control and perfection in her dancing jeopardizes her chances at landing the role of a dancer's lifetime, the Swan Queen in ""Swan Lake."" After she convinces the show's director (Vincent Cassel) that she can be sexual and dangerous, she gets the part of both the white and black swan, usually danced by two different people, and thus begins her nightmarish journey to lose herself enough to convincingly play the black swan. Lose herself she does, but not just artistically. ""Black Swan"" is one long sustained note of mental frenzy as Nina cracks.<br/><br/>The formal structure of ""Black Swan"" mirrors Nina's mental state. The film builds up to moments of outrageous camp, but always backs off just before it allows itself to go completely over the top. I spent most of the film wishing that it would push further, until I realized that the movie was building to one of the most memorable climaxes I can recall, when Nina finally makes her full transformation into the black swan. As horrifying as these final scenes are, they're also thrilling, and the film sent me out on a high.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is perfect casting as a high-strung, fragile ballerina, and for most of the movie she's not asked to do much more than cry and whimper. But those last scenes, when she so effectively convinces both audiences -- the one in the film and the one watching it -- that she's got what it takes to be dangerous, put the rest of her performance in perspective and make the whole thing more impressive than it might be at first glance. She's given a lot of terrific support by Cassel, Mila Kunis as a fellow ballerina who may or may not be a rival to Nina, and especially Barbara Hershey, as Nina's stage mom from ballerina hell. Also making a couple of brief appearances as a washed up dancer is Winona Ryder, who finds some new and unsettling uses for a letter opener.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" suggests something I've suspected for quite a while -- that frequently an artist's best work is created when he is least sane.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"lesburton","10","5","12","1 January 2011"," Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!
","Darren Aronofsky completely blew me away with this fine piece of cinema. I thought that his previous work was very impressive. This movie, for me, just pushed him into another stratosphere of film making. The only thing about this movie that kinda bothers me is that it ends, depending on how you viewed ""The Wrestler,"" the same way. That is only a very small detail though. Overall, I was left virtually speechless after leaving the big screen. If this doesn't win Best Picture and Natalie Portman doesn't win best Actress then I think they really misjudged it. Everything thing about this movie was beautiful. The camera angles were signature Aronofsky with little tweaking in actual technique. The mood is nothing that I wouldn't expect from an Aronofsky film, dark and disturbing with a hint of borderline, Horror elements to it. It's truly not a Ballet film for the faint of heart. I suggest watching this movie and simply, be amazed."
"chaos-rampant","Null","5","12","23 December 2010"," When reflections start looking back
","I do a little taoist meditation exercise most nights that involves me staring at my reflection in a mirror. It gives me an eerie feeling most times, doing it last night after I'd finished Black Swan was almost unsettling though and I had to hold the sink at some point. The exercise is about adjusting the gaze so that you're looking into yourself from the outside, or being looked at by your own self. The point of transition, when you become aware of the meditation taking place, is when the reflection seizes to be a reflection. Black Swan of course does not tell us about tao, like most Western art it's a movie of polar opposites, light and dark, yet subliminally it grasps higher concepts that deal with the perception of a world.<br/><br/>This is one of my favourite types of film, the psychodrama that observes the fracture of a soul from within the fracture, from behind the cracked glass, and like the best works of Polanski Altman or Lynch it's in the hallucination of the mind that it finds a raison d'etre, the handle and hook by which it will sink deeper into a meaningful unreality. For the first part of the film the Swan Queen, the good decent shy young girl who wants to be the leading dancer, can see her reflection in the mirror, then as we near the end of the film, the reflections begin to see her. This is still happening from within though, it's the soul itself pulling the strings, there's no supernatural touch or the ambiguous suggestion of one. Some may find unsubtle that Aronofosky will frequently trap characters in their mirrored images, I only find it necessary, like a western can better communicate its ideas in the dusty sierra. Eventually, another mirror this time to the ballet story of the Swan Queen, the Swan Queen becomes her negative image and gives the performance of a lifetime but she pays a Faustian price for it. The idea is not earth-shattering of course but I find it wholesome, proper, what it should be.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives us one of the great fragile distraught female protagonists. Susannah York, Harriet Andersson, Catherine Deneuve, Zhora Lampert, Isabelle Adjani, Naomi Watts, with the exception of Adjani, she betters them all. I like the sudden neurotic touches of the imbalanced mother, which reminds me of Lynch, and how well Portman can play the figurative swan fraught with perils on all sides of her path. It's the soul that is at stake here and I love how Aronofsky creates the nightmare world. It's a nightmare world because Nina is not ready for it, because she can't let go and be a part of the flow, as though the world itself can sense the pull and resistance and begins to spot the anomaly. That anomaly in herself is rendered with monstrous almost-Zulawski tones of self-destruction and hysteric behaviour, and the sketch itself reminds me of similar wonderful films, Mulholland Dr., Repulsion, Images.<br/><br/>I wrote in the other thread that I think Aronosfky's timing with Black Swan is perfect because it allows himself to be directly compared with Fincher and Nolan. In Requiem he was struggling for maturity, here he comes to it naturally. By comparison to his peers, his cinematic eye fascinates me because it can imagine things and bring them alive, it dazzles and is dazzled in return. I love the scenes where Aronosfky's camera dances along with the ballet, that opening for example I find a stunner. I almost hope The Social Network wins Best Picture so that it will go on to become another Slumdog Millionaire or Hurt Locker to be forgotten in due time, this one on the other hand feels to me like special, spookily idiosynchratic, work that deserves a smaller audience than will eventually see it."

","I just got back from watching ""The Black Swan"" and am still sorting out my feelings about it. Most of the way, it was borderline unwatchable, mostly about people mutilating themselves mentally and physically. Then it got very dramatic but kind of over the top with a seeming triumph but by that time you don't know what was real and what wasn't: you don't know whether to be ""uplifted"" or not. It has some of my favorite actresses in it- Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis, who I'd only seen in the lightweight ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Date Night"", (both of which were a lot more fun to watch than this). All gave terrific performances. Portman, who was also great as Anne Boleyn in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", has matured into a major actress. But Hershey is probably the best thing in the movie as the loving but somehow threatening mother. Kunis gives the film the only charm it has and hits all the right notes in her limited but important role. Ryder's appearance made me sad because a decade ago she might have played Portman's role, (although she doesn't really have a ballet dancer's body). Her career never really recovered from her shop-lifting arrest, although she's made some interesting smaller films. I may be interpreting this wrong but I'm not alone, (judging from the IMDb) in seeing her role as the aging ballerina being angrily ""retired"" as paralleling her own career. Comparisons are being made to prior films- one that keeps cropping up is ""Showgirls"", another movie that may not be as ""good"" as this one but was more fun to watch. Some are comparing it to the same director's ""Requiem for a Dream"", about people who are falling apart due to drug use, (and who also lose touch with reality, as does the audience,). That was another unpleasant one. Id have to say that this is a movie you should see if you want to make sure you have an opinion about who should have won which award. But if you're looking for a good time, skip it."
"ArtHouseRoyalty","8","5","12","9 December 2010"," Excellent but not flawless
","This is not the type of film you write a review for in just five minutes, but here it goes - unlike the super realistic The Wrestler, and similarly to Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan starts off ""here and now"", complete - in documentary style, and ends in a vortex of hallucination and CGI. It is an excellent piece of work but not without flaws.<br/><br/>Story wise what I missed is a better exposition for Nina and her frigidity. The demanding mother, a ballet dancer who ""could never make it"" and is now burdening her daughter with the task of succeeding where she had failed is the ""mother of all clichés"". The first half of the story, where we are still very much grounded in the ""real"" is overwhelmingly allegorical - the mirrors, reflections, the back and white - are all very much ""in your face"" - no gentle touches, no subtlety.<br/><br/>The same goes for the way Thomas is trying to ""open up"" Nina - through her sexuality. Instead of a subtle and slow seduction what we get is a brutal rape, of both Nina and the audience: ""go home and touch yourself"", ""would you f*ck that girl?"" - it felt almost juvenile and achieved the wrong effect.<br/><br/>Another major flaw is the repeated use of what we first think to be real but later discover to be an hallucination - again, not only a cheap vehicle but one that is used several times, each time with a diminishing effect. Nina is losing her mind - OK, we get it - but stretch that line too far and you lose the audience too.<br/><br/>This is Aronofsky's style and the result is extremely dramatic and powerful, but to me it feels ""cheap""... it is the easier path to drama - not the sophisticated one. The audience laughter at what was meant to be very serious moments is a testament to the failure of Aronofsky to master the art.<br/><br/>8/10"

"JamesHitchcock","10","4","9","4 March 2011"," Perhaps the first great cinematic masterpiece of the 2010s
","In the ballet world it has become the custom for the two leading female roles in Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"", Odette the White Swan and Odile the Black Swan, to be danced by the same ballerina in order to allow her to reveal two different sides of her personality, Odette being innocent and ethereal, Odile evil but sensual and sexually fascinating. ""Black Swan"" tells the story of a new production of ""Swan Lake"" by a leading New York ballet company and the rivalry between two young dancers, Nina and Lily, who both covet the role of Odette/Odile. The director, Thomas Leroy, casts Nina in the role, although he has doubts as to her suitability. She is perfect as the White Swan, but Thomas fears she lacks the sensuality needed to portray the Black Swan, a role to which Lily seems more suited. (I found myself wondering why Leroy, who clearly sees himself as an iconoclast, did not simply cast two different dancers in the two roles, but this would obviously have been a step too far for ballet traditionalists).<br/><br/>Nina's problem is that she is too emotionally repressed to portray the Black Swan convincingly. She is a virgin who does not have a boyfriend and lives with her controlling, overbearing mother Erica, herself a former dancer who never quite made it to the top and who has projected her own unrealised hopes onto her daughter. Thomas criticises Nina's dancing as ""frigid"", and this is as much a criticism of her personality as of her dance style. Gradually, however, Nina begins, under Thomas's guidance, to explore the darker and more sensual sides of her character and her dancing begins to improve.<br/><br/>Nina's success, however, is only achieved at great personal cost. The emotional stress of the role begins to affect her health, both physical and mental, leading to eating disorders, self-harm and to hallucinations. Nina becomes obsessed with Lily, who has been named as her understudy, and with the idea that Lily is trying to usurp her role. Yet her relationship with Lily is a love-hate one; at one stage she hallucinates that she is having a lesbian relationship with the other girl. Or is this something more than a hallucination? Natalie Portman is an actress who has sometimes disappointed me in the past. She was horribly wooden in the ""Star Wars"" films and not a lot better in ""V for Vendetta"". In ""Black Swan"", however, she is superb in the highly demanding role of Nina, a role which required her not only to master the dancing skills of a ballerina but also to convey her character's complex emotional states. Her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved. Mila Kunis is also good as Lily, although this role was perhaps an easier one. Although it demanded just as much hard work on the technical ballet side, Lily is a less complicated character than her rival, naturally sensual and easy-going where Nina is tense and emotionally repressed.<br/><br/>The other performance which impressed me came from Vincent Cassel as Thomas. The relationship between Thomas and Nina in some ways parallels that between Lermontov and Victoria in that other great ballet film, ""The Red Shoes"". Like Lermontov, Thomas is in love, or in lust, with his protégée, but with an important difference. Lermontov's love for Victoria takes the form of a subconscious desire which he cannot acknowledge to her or even to himself, except in sublimated form. There is nothing sublimated or subconscious about Thomas's desire for Nina; he takes an obsessive interest in her sex-life, encourages her to masturbate and blatantly gropes her while they are dancing together. At the purely technical level his psychological manipulation of Nina succeeds in making her a better dancer, but he cannot see the effect that his methods are having on her already fragile psyche. In a compelling performance Cassel plays him as a strange mixture of inspirational teacher and creepy sexual predator; he was unfortunate not to receive a ""Best Supporting Actor"" nomination.<br/><br/>Visually, the look of ""Black Swan"" is very different to that of ""The Red Shoes"". Pressburger and Powell's masterpiece, made during a period of post-war austerity, was shot in vivid colour. Darren Aronofsky's palette is much more restrained; in keeping with the film's theme the dominant tones are black, white and grey. Bright colours are used sparingly, with the exception of red in a key scene near the end. Aronofsky's direction also uses many shots from unusual angles; it is notable that Portman is frequently photographed from behind or in a mirror, as though her character were hiding something from the audience by turning away from them, thus emphasising Nina's repressed personality. Aronofsky also makes considerable use of ambiguity- the lesbian scene being a good example. The most likely explanation is that it is a hallucination on Nina's part, but it can also be taken as a depiction of something that actually happened, in which case it makes an immense difference to the way in which we perceive both Nina and Lily. The final scene also permits two different interpretations.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" was the first of Aronofsky's films that I have seen, but on this evidence he is a director of enormous talent. It is in my view the greatest-ever film about ballet, greater even than ""The Red Shoes"", which is high praise indeed. It is a film of great aesthetic, dramatic and emotional power, a power which is enhanced by Tchaikovsky's music on the soundtrack. It is perhaps the first great cinematic masterpiece of the 2010s; although it may be unpatriotic to say so, I would have awarded it ""Best Picture"" ahead of ""The King's Speech"" and certainly Aronofsky ""Best Director"" ahead of Tom Hooper. 10/10"

","I know many people probably saw the previews for this movie and dismissed it on the basis that ballet is the main focus. I mean, if someone doesn't like ballet, why would they want to see this movie? At the risk of sounding cliché, this movie is much more than skinny girls dancing. It is a slow, tense and thrilling ride along with a young woman whose mind gradually slips into darkness.<br/><br/>Nina is a meek, polite and fragile ballet dancer, living with her mom and mainly dancing in the background of her dance company. When she finally gets the opportunity to step into the spotlight as the lead in Swan Lake, she must learn to embrace the duality of the character. The sweet, innocent White Swan flows easily from her but it is her evil twin, the seductive Black Swan, that Nina struggles to find. Pushed to the brink mentally by her sexualizing director, overbearing and controlling mother and a new dancer that in many ways represents her Black Swan twin, Nina begins to delve into the darker aspects of the character in her actual life, slowly losing grips on reality as she goes deeper. By the time the final performance arrives, her director tells her to lose herself but it appears that she already has.<br/><br/>This is a film best described as a psychological horror/thriller. Much of the horror is derived from Nina's slowly worsening hallucinations, which is some of the best usage of body horror since David Cronenberg's films in the 80s. Ballet itself tears up the human body and that is the initial cause for those scenes. But as the film gets darker things become even more unsettling. Adding to this is the wonderfully filmed hand camera scenes, especially during the dance sequences. The shots are tight and almost always moving, creating unease and adding tension.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, if Natalie Portman doesn't take home and Oscar for this movie there is no justice in the world. Aside from her physical transformation and training just to play the part, her performance is nothing short of incredible. She is a fragile, weak human being throughout the entire movie that seamlessly moves to graphic for the short scenes. This doesn't change throughout the movie. The character doesn't have some magical snapping point where she's suddenly evil. In fact, when we think we got this snapping point, it turns out to be a hallucination. Nina is basically a victim of her own mental foundation crumbling out from under her and Portman plays this to perfection. Mila Kunis does a great job as Lily, the counterpart to Nina who becomes her main competition. The character is very important to Nina's spiral and Kunis infuses her with the right attitude. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the slimy director and Barbara Hershey does a good job as Nina's controlling mother. Both characters do a good job at earning your disgust, as they should.<br/><br/>The only pitfall I can see with this movie is that it might be hard for some to stomach. It will mess with your mind and make you uneasy numerous times and some people can't handle that. And yes, those who loathe ballet should probably look elsewhere. But for those who can handle it, this movie is an excellent look at how a person can slowly fragment into insanity."

A shame that his only film that is going to reach double digits in one weekend is going to be called Wolverine.<br/><br/>Mark Heyman And Andrew Heinz's Script is really solid and terrifying but is just not good enough; they should be thankful of the cast and director they had. But kudos mostly to Matthew Libatique's photography. He's the one that molded this dark fantasy.<br/><br/>Now to the performances. Natalie Portman was....... i don't have words to describe her. I'm not her father, but i'm just so proud of her. this role demanded her so much and she kills it. She practically commanded the film with such poise. In one scene, near the end , when she finds out how much she risked and how late it is to mend it, she starts to cry but them she swept away the tears and looks at the camera and her look is so chilling and haunting that's breathtaking. this would be the movie that is going to win her an Oscar and a document to prove why she is so beloved and talented. Kudos to Mila Kunis also ; her role also demanded her so much and every good work has it reward; a golden globe and a screen actors guild award Noms in track to an Oscar Nom. Congrats. Kudos also to Cassel, Hershey And Ryder. <br/><br/>OK, with that being said my consensus is that Black Swan is one of the most riveting, disturbing and wildly melodramatic films i have seen. It was perfect. Trust Me"
"zardoz-13","10","4","9","1 January 2011"," ""The Turning Point"" Meets ""The Twilight Zone""
","Best known for ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""The Wrestler,"" director Darren Aronofsky is no slouch when he sets out to fashion an edge of the seat thriller. Not only has he created an entertaining, first-rate film with tons of ambiguity, but he has also assembled a top-flight cast for his tense exercise in suspense about a young, ambitious, but repressed ballerina. Imagine ""The Turning Point"" meets ""The Twilight Zone"" and you'll have a good idea what is in store for you. Good performances, atmospheric cinematography, and spine-tingling editing bolster this quirky, offbeat film.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman of the second ""Star Wars"" trilogy) finds herself considerably conflicted when she discovers that she may replace legendary dancer Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder of ""Heathers"") who has starred in every ballet production. You don't have to know anything about ballet to appreciate this surprise-laden saga with the many twists and turns in a sophisticated screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andrew Heinz, and John McLaughlin. When Nina is facing competition with Beth, she finds herself attracted and seduced by a new dancer named Lily (Mila Kunis of ""The Book of Eli"") who introduces the shy Nina to drugs and nightclubs. The most villainous personage is neither Big Apple ballet company director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassell of ""Ocean's Twelve"") nor Nina's strange mom Erica (Barbara Hershey of Beaches) who keeps a tight leash on her daughter. Instead, Nina's worst enemy is herself and she often sees herself as the Black Swan.<br/><br/>Although some of the behavior in it might be offensive to prudish folks, this R-rated movie contains nothing in the way of nudity either upper frontal or lower bottom. Natalie Portman is terrific as Nina. Mila Kunis is her rival for the affections of the manager, (Vincent Cassel), who runs the ballet company. This nightmare thriller will keep you guessing right up to the last second and even then you won't be 100 percent sure what has happened. Winona Ryder co-stars along with Barbara Hershey. Believe me, it isn't just another dance film.<br/><br/>The ending isn't exactly a happy one, but Black Swan is a genuine chiller that will grip you for every minute of its 108 minutes."
"Interrogangbang","10","4","9","27 December 2010"," A new take on Tchaikowsky's classic.
","The themes of Tchaikowsky's Swan lake, goodness and innocence versus evil and seduction, may ring cliché to some. However, Aronofsky's latest offers a fresh and highly disturbing take on the classic. Nina (played by the always immaculate Portman) is the rising star of the New York Ballet, and despite being a perfect fit to play the White Swan she also faces the challenge of portraying its dark and evil twin. Adding to the pressure is the company's newcomer, Lily (Kunis), who represents all the qualities Nina lacks - mystery, sensuality and danger. As the opening night draws closer, our prima ballerina starts to break down, sinking deeper and deeper into the twisted persona of the Black Swan. As with most Aronofsky films, the interpretation of the story lies in the mind of the beholder. Perhaps it is the age old tale of being devoured by the dark side of human nature, or maybe it is a metaphor for the incredible pressure professionals in the performing arts are faced with. Whatever the case, Black Swan grabs you tightly from the opening scene and doesn't let go until the end credits start to roll.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, Portman, Cassel and the other name actors all deliver. The big shocker of the lot is Mila Kunis, mostly known for her role as Jackie in The 70's Show. With a very rough and edgy acting style, she is the perfect fit for Lily, the counter force to Porman's character that carries a lot of the film. Still being a very inexperienced actress, Aronofosky doesn't force Kunis out of her comfort zone, but it will be interesting to see if she fulfills her potential as a quality actress in years to come. Speaking of which, the nowadays very underused Winona Ryder proves she's still got it as the self-destructive former soloist of the company. The scenes in which she reveals her desperation after being abandoned by the only thing she ever knew, ballet, are some of the most intense throughout the film.<br/><br/>It is a testament to Aronofsky's talent that after successfully portraying the soft and sensitive side of the wrestling world, he now unveils the brutality of professional ballet. It is an unforgiving world with no room for error, devouring its servants as they struggle to reach perfection. This reality appears even more absurd when juxtaposed against the softness and beauty of the dance itself, another strong point of Aronofsky's directing. He creates scenes which such incredible beauty it completely mesmerizes the viewer and reminds us of why Swan Lake is one of the greatest works of art ever created. Maybe he wants to highlight that all that suffering and sacrifice is worth it, even necessary, to achieve the final product. This ideology can be parallelled with the film itself, too. With incredible attention to detail, meticulous camera work and actresses thin to the point of starvation, Black Swan is definitely not a movie made overnight. Aronofsky's finest work to date gets a well deserved 5/5."

","""The only person standing in your way is you."" The best movie of the year in my opinion. Plot: A Ballet dancer drifts deeper into insanity as her big day as The Swan Queen in Swan Lake apporoaches. Director Darren Aronofsky(Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, The Wrestler) gives a dark but unique atmoshere to this psychological thriller. Almost everything about this movie is perfect aside from one or two laughably bad moments. The movie has some pretty freaky moments and a few that may make you cringe but that just adds to the intensity But the best part about this movie is Natalie Portman. This is her best performance in my opinion. I'll be very surprised if she doesn't get nominated for an Oscar and I'll be angry if she doesn't win that Golden Globe she's been nominated for. She at least deserves that. She made her character so realistic. Mila Kunis is good to but she's nowhere near as good as Portman. Film makers, take note on this. This how to make a perfect film."
"Marjeez","10","4","9","23 December 2010"," Aronofsky Perfectly Mixes Real and Surreal in an Intense Masterpiece
","Ever since I saw the first trailer, I counted down to the day I would watch Black Swan. It has my favorite actresses Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, one of my favorite directors Darren Aronofsky, and ultimately it had the feeling of a David Lynch film. I've tried everything to stay away from any clip, review, or piece of information, even blocking advertisements with my hand on the screen. I was pumped. So pumped the night before seeing it I could barely sleep. With this amount of hype towards anything, it's easy to be disappointed. Black Swan surprised me. <br/><br/>First and foremost, the performance Natalie gives is haunting. She always plays the character she began with even when the script demands more and her mental frailty shows throughout Black Swan. She handles every situation with passion and intensity. Mila Kunis also gives her usual performance that always boosts the quality of any film. <br/><br/>Having seen all five Aronofsky films to date, I would rank them as: <br/><br/>Black Swan > Requiem for a Dream > The Wrestler > The Fountain > Pi <br/><br/>All of his movies offer something unique and interesting, but Aronofsky was never able to mix the unique with the realistic as perfectly as he did in Black Swan. This is his best work and, looking at his upcoming work, which in my opinion will underutilized this brilliant director/writer, it will continue to be his best work for years to come. <br/><br/>Who knew a film about ballet would be so interesting? The story is brilliant. It's intense, passionate, frightening, sexual, sad, funny, demoniac, romantic, and above all artistic. Everything you could ever want in a film plus more. With that said, I don't believe Black Swan is for everyone, but if you found interest in the trailer than there is a great chance that you will love it as I did. I look forward to watching it again and again in the future. It's THAT good. <br/><br/>With a year of massive disappointments, a year where boundary-breaking films were nonexistent, Aronofsky comes in and makes 2010 worthwhile. Black Swan has a safe place as one of my favorites in life. That's right, 'favorites'. It breaks away from being just a film and takes a place as a brilliant memory and piece of work that will stay with me for the rest of my remaining life."

","The movie is good and kept me in a tensed mode from beginning to end. While the music more than underscores the strong emotions felt by Nina, the Black Swan revolves solely on Nina and Nathalie Portman. Her performance is unique, remarkable, just mind blowing. Rarely have I seen an actor or actress so immensely inside of his/her character. This is an Oscar award, hands up. Back to the movie: take Nathalie Portman out and replace her with a good actress and you have a flop. My vote is a 10 for Nathalie and if the movie receives any other award, it will result from the deep emotion which Nathalie attaches to the movie. Like a magnificent perfume which remains for a very, very long time."
"guesswhonikolai88","9","4","9","16 December 2010"," I Give it a 9/10
","Black Swan is definitely a film that will send shivers up you spine, but it also has a beauty of its own, affiliating with the subject of ballet. Darren Aronofsky has a unique set of art direction in this film and a sense of elegant beauty within each scene, mainly the ballet. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman)seems to become disturbed, especially after newcomer and rival, Lily or the ""Black Swan"" comes along, trying to get the title role in stage director Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel) ballet performance. The film has some stunning sequences and may disturb many people, but I actually enjoyed all of it. Everything seemed to fit and as the story goes on, the deeper we are drawn into Portman's disturbing hallucinations. Or are they hallucinations. See for yourself because Black Swan is an instant winner and got my vote. 9/10 Rated R - 108min"
"ClaytonDavis","9","4","9","5 December 2010"," Portman is a beautiful swan...
","Darren Aronofsky, the director of the Oscar snubbed films ""The Wrestler"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" has created his most emotionally and visually charged film yet, ""Black Swan."" Showcasing a career best performance from Natalie Portman, this dark, demented, and at times brilliant take on the world of ballet assures any doubt of Aronofsky's depth. He goes back to his roots while revamping and maturing his own style. A complex yet simple concept from screenwriters Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin marries with the director artistic capabilities like a great love story. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique nearly narrates this tale with such ferocity, it leaves the viewer breathless. Clint Mansell who has been ignored for far too long orchestrates once again, a magnificent score that hopefully will not be ignored. Supporting players Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey respect their roles and deliver them poignantly throughout. But once again, enough cannot be said about Academy Award Nominee Natalie Portman. This is the role I will remember Natalie Portman for forever. She balances a broken, wounded character and breathes a hungry, cannibalistic woman tearing through the screen, frame after frame after frame. Definitely one of, if not, the best performance by any actor this year. ""Black Swan"" should be proud to be standing on its own merit with no obvious plot or clear ideas, just pure imagination and curiosity keeps us involved. Brilliant execution Mr. Aronofsky, just brilliant."
"CassandraSparkles","10","4","9","5 December 2010"," Aronofsky hits it out of the park with ""Black Swan""
","Just saw ""Black Swan"" at a packed house in NYC. Ostensibly the story of a ballerina played by Natalie Portman preparing to dance the lead role in ""Swan Lake"", it was really about refusing to submit in the face of incredible demands and everyday paranoia morphing into legitimate terror. <br/><br/>The movie was threaded with fear-inducing images and palpable scenes of murder and graphic sexuality that may have happened only in the lead actor's mind. Aronofsky put us right there in the fevered brain of the perfect little ballerina grappling with yearning, jealousy and desire. <br/><br/>Intense and horrifying with incredibly hot adult sexuality. The acting was superb, with Vincent Cassel as the ballet director, Barbara Hershey as the mother from hell and Mila Kunis as Portman's rival, as bawdy as Portman is virginal. <br/><br/>But Natalie Portman as the Swan Queen was astonishing. She was in almost every scene growing from a momma's girl to a ferocious dancer. She became the Black Swan out of sheer will. Gotta see it to know what the Black Swan is. I'll give you a hint: it's the meaning of life. Ending gives a nod to ""The Red Shoes"" but Aronofsky's thriller is in a class by itself."
"uhchilly","5","8","23","30 December 2010"," Character study without character
","I went into this movie with no expectations other than knowing some Aronovsky films and liking them. I didn't see any trailers so I was really happy to jump into a film without any serious preconceived notions.<br/><br/>I do have some spoilers in here to stop now if you don't want to know anything!<br/><br/>I have to say that I really enjoyed the acting and the story both - the problem I had was the way it was told. The lines of the story are already laid out in the title of the movie and it doesn't deviate an inch from what your initial, most obvious conclusion would be. That in itself wouldn't be a big deal if, through this journey elements of the character are revealed, illuminated somehow but again, nothing seems to expand on the initial character we see in the first several minutes. Instead all I saw was variant portrayals of her particular psychosis each more dramatic and vulgar than the last but providing no different perspective. Like watching a slide show of anonymous personal injuries. These moments just upset us and then move along leaving an empty feeling.<br/><br/>After a while the ""watch-out-behind-you""or ""see-you-imagined-it"" scenes get really tiresome and are better left to the Final Destinations and Grudge's of moviedom. What starts out with genuine tension and disturbing curiosity as to what exactly is going on (her rash, the hallucinations of herself) seems to just continually repeat itself without any purpose other than to shock. I like shock just not when its trying so hard to be meaningful (or seeming to).<br/><br/>So you have over-use of shock value (she hallucinates and then wonders - did that happen? REPEATEDLY AGAIN AND AGAIN OK. we get it.) Pile that on with the obvious metaphor of the production of the Black Swan which in and of itself is groovy, the two stories paralleling each other but when you couple the horror shock aspect with the uber-dramatized story within a story of the Black Swan coupled with seriously dramatic music (great music but so much overkill for an abundantly dramatic story and story-telling style) it all just becomes too much wherein some points I felt became unintentionally funny because I was just hit too many times in the head with the shock-hammer. Part of this was likely do to poor shot choice eg.(pivotal scene in Nina's dressing room between Acts) - it was just plain silly, like watching some monster movie - off-camera monster drags off its kill.<br/><br/>I think had any one of these elements been played with a bit more subtlety, perhaps the soundtrack, a reduced amount of repetitive hallucinations and/or shocking grossness (and I love gory movies but even the gore-masters know when and how to do it) or play down the actual parallels a bit more so we are not constantly reminded of how she is just like the Black Swan, then this could have been a good movie.<br/><br/>It just seemed like a director who became too enamoured with his ideas and decided to let them all loose in one film and it unfortunately become a ham-fisted disappointment albeit with great acting.<br/><br/>I would actually give it a 6.5 but I feel it deserves a lower rating simply because my expectations went from positive to very positive as I was watching it only for me to helplessly watch the movie circle the drain along with its main character. Bummer."

","Black Swan<br/><br/>Insanity is tricky. It is the one thing no one can escape. It is the one thing that controls us. Nina (Natalie Portman) falls very far into insanity in this film and it's a hell of a ride. Black Swan is not for the faint of heart because of graphic content, and for the psychological kickback that it has. It is literally so intense that I am still buzzing minutes after it's end. The story is a warped one of the Swan Lake ballet. The dance is about a girl who is turned into a swan who needs true love to break the spell. She is the white swan . When a prince comes and falls in love with the white swan her sister the Black Swan steals him. Distressed the White Swan kills herself. The story of Black Swan follows this story through the eyes of the characters. Nina is a ballerina who has been cast for Swan Lake. The role slowly drives her insane. That is of course in part to the criticisms of her trainer, and the threat of losing the part to another dancer (Mila Kunis). Every moment is more intensified and honestly grotesque as the film goes on.<br/><br/>Yet does the insanity of the film, the sheer disturbing content of the whole event (trust me this is probably the most disturbing film I've seen) ruin the film? Oh hell no. The more and more the film builds the more suspense it has. It grabs you and shakes you. It doesn't let go till the film ends. Also the fact you have to work out what's going on. That's awesome. The film switches from a twisted dream to a stressful reality. It's your choice to decide which one is which. This bars down on the viewer. What a real rush it creates. Aronofsky as created a twisted, but amazing story here.<br/><br/>Pushing it to the absolute limit are the performances. Everybody across the board is mind blowing. Natalie Portman is great, Mila Kunis great, the instructor, the mother. They all are so great. And the dance. I really don't know how they were able to do this. It must of taken longer to prepare than to shoot the entire film. Anyway it is superb. Just beautiful.<br/><br/>Dear Reader,<br/><br/>Don't watch this till you are ready. It is messed up and I want to warn you. That is my only criticism. I have nothing wrong with the film per say, it's just incredibly psychological and messes with you.<br/><br/>Creepy, intense and well acted Black Swan gets a 9.8 out of 10"

Characters talk and act like they are written by 13 year old boy who is deeply frustrated of still being a virgin. Scenes that were supposed to be scary just looked boring and predictable. I was expecting something truly nasty, but no.. Only disturbing thing in this is constant use of profanities and boringly stereotypical sexual clichés about female artists. Why they are always portrayed as weak, naive, psychologically imbalanced, and always under some sexual predatory of their much older mentor? OK, that was the case with Frida and Dora Maar, but this story is just getting annoying. And cruel 'Mother' in the movie obviously thought she was in some 'Carrie' sequel, and she was pretty bad at that. CGI was pure comedy gold, it like a movie turned into cartoon in that moment, it's really funny. I was just expecting Scooby Doo to turn up. The only thing that was worthy in this movie was Winona Ryder in her role of primaballerina, and even she was annoying with constant cursing. But the scene of her after accident, in the wheelchair, with her backs against Natalie Portman who brings some personal stuff to her, that scene was excellent! If the whole film was like this, it would be great, but it's not unfortunately.. Better watch Suspiria if you want a good horror movie with ballet dancers."

","What I was expecting when I decided to finally watch Black Swan was a typical movie about a ballerina trying to get a lead role in a production and she gets it in the end with a lot of hard work. I surprised when I discovered the film was really much more than that, it really was about a Nina played by Natalie Portman trying to find the bad in herself to play both black and white swan in her ballet company's production, when really the bad was there all along, but probably suppressed by the need of wanting to be good and perfect. Her mother Erica played by Barbara Hershey was a ""dance mom"" and in an attempt to live out her unfounded dance aspirations through her daughter pushes her hard to be perfect. Early in the film its discovered Nina scratches herself, which is another indication it's the bad in her trying to get out. So the theme of film in my opinion is don't sacrifice yourself to be perfect. Thomas Leroy played by Vincent Cassel and Lily played by Mila Kunis attempt to get the bad and less self controlled side out of her so she can embrace the role of the black swan, but they don't realize it would result in such a drastic change in Nina. Another film with a similar theme that comes to my mind is in the movie, The Devil Wears Prada where Anne Hathaway who plays Andy in the film sacrifices everything she held dear in her life such as her boyfriend and friends to become the perfect assistant to Miranda Priestley the head of a runway magazine. In the end, she realizes what seemed perfect was not really perfect for her. I believe the black swan acts as a symbol to represent Nina's dark side that is trying get out. The alternating of light to dark depending on what side of Nina's personality is being portrayed just adds to the suspense of the movie. In the beginning everything is done in a lot of natural lighting and Nina seems more normal, but after she gets the part the scenes become darker and darker as she become the Black Swan and in Nina's mind she becomes perfect, which to me means she became who she really was all along."

","The preternaturally graceful weaving of themes, acting talent, and striking camera-work made Black Swan one of the most beautiful and preeminent films I've ever seen, and perhaps the best film of 2010. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky, a revolutionary of directing and film-crafting, effortlessly combined all of the ideas and thoughts seamlessly, and with such cinematic flair that it is almost impossible to ignore this marvel of cinema. His camera is our Black Swan, taking us through lives with Aronofsky's jolty ease, and screen-enveloping passion. Moments of the movie burst with life, and emotion, while others are so subdued it is physically painful to watch without fidgeting. <br/><br/>Credit must be given where credit is due, and credit is due to Natalie Portman, the phenomenal back-bone of the film. She captured both the physical and emotional facets of her complex character, and this unfathomable feet is the sole reason she was handed an Oscar. <br/><br/>Mila Kunis, in her first break-out role, stupefied me with her refined control of character. Her deliciously and irresistibly seductive, almost siren-like, feats in the film are what supporting actresses only dream they can do. She was the epitome of the idea of Black Swan. <br/><br/>Vincent Cassel, an actor who can perfect any ideal or number of passions, managed the task of main catalysts without a. overacting or b. getting any critical acclaim. I believe that he lost out on the critical appeal because he managed to subdue his character in favor of the female leads. He relinquished the spotlight, and a humility of that nature radiates through the film. <br/><br/>Winona Ryder, not seen often enough as of late, managed to crown the film with a short exhibition of her many talents, and remind us why we all subscribed to her so easily in past years (and will in future ones).<br/><br/>To write about Black Swan without mentioning Clint Mansell's harrowing, and enthralling score would not be tolerated, so I must mention the score that drew me into the moment, and set the mood so perfectly. To be sitting in a chair, in a theater, and to not realize where you are because you are so engulfed in a movie is the product of direction, acting, and of course SCORE. To take the classic score and revamp it beyond all reasonable similarity (yet still leave it primarily the same notes) is a talent only Mansell can claim to have mastered. <br/><br/>""Black Swan"" was simply immaculate."

","It is quite difficult to write a review for this type of film. If I say anything about the story, one will not enjoy it as much as one actually should. Nevertheless, I will give it a try. First of all, the casting. A brilliant job with no flaws. At the beginning I was wondering if Portman was right for the role, but as the movie progressed the wondering vanished. Her role was difficult and complex both physically and especially mentally; only a master-actress could have done such a marvelous job (an Oscar well deserved). Vincent Cassel was also brilliant. His role was at times so realistic that I kept wondering if he was acting. This man is clearly a perfectionist in real life as is on the screen. Mila Kunis was that one character that gave this movie its final layer of life. Mysterious and dark but also intriguing to say the least. The story is something that develops quite slowly. Slow paced at the beginning but nerve breaking at the end. Only at the ending had I realized that the movie's ending intensity was as intense as it was, exactly because of the slow paced beginning. Some scenes were extremely disturbing but crucial to the development of the story. The ending revelation leaves one sitting and wondering what one had just seen. Shock, sorrow, pain... is something a person feels at the beginning of the end credits. The music was decent. Nothing too specific or ""to-die-for."" This movie was so powerful that I simply cannot find anything negative to say about it. Trying to find the bad elements in such a masterpiece means one just cannot enjoy a work of art when he sees one. Darren Aronofsky has done it again: 10/10"

","I never thought I would enjoy so much a movie containing elements of ballet, opera etc. But I'm glad I watched it. There's an old quote saying that many people who are successful in their job, they end up losers concerning their private life. And that what this movie is about. <br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman)is an introverted ballerina who sacrifices every aspect of her life in order to play both the roles of white and black swan in Tchaikovsky's ballet, Swan Lake. Raised by a somewhat authoritarian mother who never managed to be a great ballerina herself, she projects her needs onto Nina. A great mistake frequently occurring in many families. Nina is disciplined but also extremely fragile so when her instructor Thomas (Vincent Cassel) wakes up her sexuality in order to help her play the Black Swan who is a sensual one, she becomes disoriented. Apart from her awakened desires, she also has to confront with a rival ballerina Lily (Mila Kunis), a potential substitute.<br/><br/>And this is where the nightmare escalates. Nina's suppressed sexuality, combined with her anxiety for playing both swans lead to a psychotic episode and the view of it makes us all feel anxious and uncomfortable. From now on the movie is frenzy. You can't tell what is real and what is not and the ambiguous finale does not really remove our pressure.<br/><br/>A movie that reminded me very much of Polanski's ""Repulsion"", a movie about handling the pressure in everyday life, something not always so easy... Portman's performance is excellent, an accurate depiction of fragility well supported by the rest of the cast..!<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this. See you..."

","If Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" doesn't haunt you, then nothing will. Natalie Portman plays Nina, a young woman training for a role in a production of Pyotr Chaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"". She gets the role of the White Swan, but the intense pressure on her, along with the presence of another ballerina (Mila Kunis) who Nina suspects is trying to usurp the role, sends Nina into complete madness.<br/><br/>The scenes of dancers gracefully performing ballet is the perfect contrast to intense scenes showing Nina's breakdown. Some of the scenes made me squirm (and I'm usually someone who can take anything in a movie). Much of the movie is shot with a hand-held camera, heightening the tension. Much like he did with ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", Aronofsky does a perfect job showing a disturbing descent into insanity.<br/><br/>I saw a production of ""Swan Lake"" in the Mariinsky Theater while I was in St. Petersburg. I recognized the theme song from somewhere else (I don't remember where). That has to be the most haunting piece of music ever written. Having watched ""Black Swan"", I'm now wondering what was going on behind the production that I saw! Anyway, this is definitely one that I recommend. I didn't see every movie from 2010, so I can't say for certain whether or not Natalie Portman's performance was the best from that year, but she was definitely up there.<br/><br/>In conclusion, be suspicious the next time that you see a member of the genus Cygnus.<br/><br/>Also starring Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder and Benjamin Millepied."

","Horror film? Variation on ""All About Eve""? Upper class ""The Wrestler""? Aronofsky's creepy tale of sanity loss in the pursuit of greatness has garnered all these reasonable speculations but all hit the mark less well than ""David Cronenberg tribute."" Nina's (not a great name for this character) hallucinations of physical deformity (fused toes) and real injury (back sores) hark back to Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" and ""Videodrome."" The creepy relationship between Barbara Hershey's mother and Natalie Portman's dancer strongly resemble the twin gynecologists in ""Dead Ringers"" but perhaps the better comparison is the mother-daughter team in ""The Piano Teacher."" When you steal from greats, being derivative is not a sin and Aronofsky should be credited rather than blamed for this. However, he should be blamed for the film's repetitive and nauseating's ""Cloverfield"" ""shaky-cam"" cinematography. We follow Natalie Portman across the Lincoln Center courtyard so many times audience-members begin to suspect to find a complex security pass in their purse. The club scene shot in multi-color strobe which precedes Nina's drug-driven detour from reality mirrors almost exactly a similar scene in ""Basic Instinct."" However if you can get over the claustrophobic close-ups and other visual shortcomings, a compelling horror story about trying to tell reality from fiction and largely failing (kind of like ""Naked Lunch"") underlies the precedings. Aronofsky manufactures some true shocks and doesn't compromise on the end. Bring your mother!"

","This may be one of the most deliberately confusing movies ever made. Somebody started off with an interesting variation on an old idea. Let's have a very talented person go nuts while achieving stardom and then die after much suffering and one absolutely perfect performance.<br/><br/>Instead of the rock scene or movie stardom -- among the more common venues -- we'll set it in the ballet arena. That's full of egotists, isn't it? Kind of like opera? It's a reasonable enough premise. Being a ballet dancer is no easy job. It requires infinite practice, precision, devotion, competitiveness, and a physical fitness rivaling that of a championship boxer. Enough to drive anybody nuts.<br/><br/>Then it must have occurred to someone that a movie about a young woman, Portman, who becomes a star at the price of her own sanity is going to have an audience of about ten people, not including the producers and their mothers. Who's going to watch a movie about going for the perfect saute fouette? So they juiced it up using two techniques, both of which manage to scrap any pretensions to seriousness that the original idea might have had.<br/><br/>The film has all the clichés of any other straight-to-DVD horror movie. There is the oppressive and demanding mother, Barbara Hershey, from ""Carrie."" There is the ""friend"" who may or may not be angling for the role of prima ballerina. The dance director, Cassel, is an untrustworthy heterosexual, and if I remember you'll find the same figure in ""The Red Shoes"". There's no one else of importance in the movie. Cassel is staging ""Swan Lake"" and he sees in Portman a very good white swan full of the usual virtues but not her evil twin, the black swan. Portman can't seem to let her passions loose so Cassel gives her helpful instruction like, ""Go home and touch yourself."" (She can't do it because she's interrupted by the image of her overbearing mother.) Later, Cassel takes Portman aside, begins smooching her fiercely and feeling her up until she begins to respond. At this point he pushes her away and says, ""See? I'm seducing you when it is you who should be seducing me."" The fool. There isn't a single person who listens sympathetically to Portman. Even her affable understudy, Mila Kunis, may have ulterior motives for trying to get Portman to loosen up, have a few drinks, do a Lude or two.<br/><br/>But it's very difficult to tell whether Kunis is a real friend or not because Portman is cracking up and the viewer, like Portman, is unable to distinguish hallucinations from reality. The Jungian shadow is always nudging its way into her life. Does Portman really kill Kunis? If so, she does it in a formulaic and unrealistic way, copped from innumerable other horror movies. She grabs a piece of broken mirror and shoves it into Kunis's belly. As usual, the point pierces the stomach and leaves the hand clutching the glass unmolested. You can't help wincing when you see something as dumb as this. It's like the scene in which two guys are fighting and one knocks the other out by bumping heads. Newton's third law is herewith repealed.<br/><br/>And the hallucinations, which seem to involve everything in and around Portman, gives the computer-generated image guys an excuse to go berserk. For no reason at all, while Portman is alone, both her legs snap into the shape of chicken legs with the knees backwards. I guess nobody could think of where to take that dismal picture so it fades to black. I mean, what are they going to have her do, sit down in a chair? Through all this mishigas, the camera never leaves Portman alone long enough to take a breather. She's a beautiful young woman, though her voice comes out in her few lines as a kind of hoarse squeak. But, really, she's in just about every frame and almost always in close up. If she runs down a hall, the camera wobbles along, a foot behind her head. Talk about oppression! <br/><br/>It isn't that horror movies are in themselves bad. It all depends on how they're done. Hell, Val Lewton turned out some psychological horror movies at RKO in the early 40s that were masterful, and on a budget that wouldn't sustain a normal person for a year, and barely keep a gerbil alive. This one had genuine potential. It did not actually need CGIs that turn Portman's hands and forearms into bloated, gangrenous limbs. Acute schizophrenia can be rendered in subtle ways too. See Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion."" I, for one, am beginning to regret CGI was ever invented. Useful for dinosaurs and UFOs, yes, but they're becoming an excuse for not thinking enough about the plots themselves. When your mind becomes blank, you just have somebody's face fall off. Pfui."

","The two stars go Natalie Portman and only Natalie Portman. Have to give her credit for all the hard work she put into this movie. It's a shame the director completely misused her talent.<br/><br/>This movie so one-dimensional, it's not even funny, just cliché after cliché. By the time the movie starts, Natalie Portman's character is a timid and fragile girl that's already insane. And throughout the movie all it does is get worse. There's no substance to the character at all. She has the same ""I'm about to cry"" expression on her face throughout the entire movie, which literally makes you hate the character. At first I wanted her to snap out of it, but after about 30 minutes, it was clear that wasn't going to happen, and soon adopted the attitude of ""Whatever, this girl is super obnoxious, I bet she slits her wrists at the end""...And sure enough, not her wrists but close.<br/><br/>And OK, so this weak and fragile girl walks up to the director while in his office and says, I've come to ask for the part. He kisses her, she bites him and poof, she gets the part...Really? is that how it's done? The whole metaphor of Nina being the white swan at the beginning of the movie, but then turns out to be the black swan at the end was ridiculous to say the least. The white swan is supposed to resemble a virtuous, yet delicate lady, afraid of being seductive. But Nina was dark and crazy from the beginning.<br/><br/>I was really excited to see this movie because I thought it was going to be about a women who worked really hard to get the part of a lifetime. It sadly wasn't about that at all. It was about a crazy girl who happened to be dancer. I was hoping to see beautiful dancing and never once did I see any.<br/><br/>Safe yourself the time and don't see this move..."

Since one star is the bottom and there are certainly films worse than this one, it's important to have some perspective on ones framework.<br/><br/>Now, the film. When I was asked my reaction to the film after viewing it my response was - ""well that's 2 hours and 28 minutes out of my life I'll never get back"".<br/><br/>The positive reviews here can only go into one of few categories: Ignorant Misguided or The result of ""peer and public perception"" pressure.<br/><br/>Perhaps the logic in choosing to create a filmed version of Tchaikovsky's classic ballet was something like a) how hard can that be? and b) it'll be ""artsy"" enough for non- artistic Hollywood Oscar voters.<br/><br/>Mix in some viewers who wouldn't know a piece of art I'd it bite them in the rear and Voila! ""Academy greatness"".<br/><br/>But extract out the burden of ""Academy worthiness"" and this still doesn't stand the test of mediocrity. Why?<br/><br/>First off, it is crushed by the weight of it's own self importance. I have to think long and hard to recall a film that screamed out "" look at me! Look at how important I am! I'm symbolic, profound AND I'm about something artful"" then look at the less than subtle clues about the character and it's satellite persons hovering around it. As ""events"" just think of the first few scenes and what happens.<br/><br/>Event one- she dreams of Swan Lake, and wakes up in her ""all too precious bedroom"" that is covered in butterfly wallpaper ( hmm, wait a tic, don't butterflies go through a metamorphosis??? Yes, yes I believe they do.... Pool Hugh, I'll bet that ""means"" something for our character -but what???!!!)<br/><br/>Event two: we see her on the subway dressed in white (because the good guy always wears white) and she catches a reflection (stick with me, she ""lookimg through a glass"" - get it, ""looking glass"" )of another dancer dressed in (wait for it) Black. Again, I think this means something here.<br/><br/>Event three- she's getting ready for rehearsal and we hear (this is what we call exposition) they are going to be replacing the ""old guard"" grand dame lead ballerina (don't tell me, I'm wondering who might be chosen... No seriously, I have NO IDEA- well maybe a small idea).<br/><br/>Taken together these events along with her ""I'm wound tighter than a Swiss watch and more scared of my shadow than a balloon is of a porcupine"" and it's nearly impossible to understand how this got out of post production without some major editing (maybe there WAS major editing- how scary is that thought?). <br/><br/>This is movie whose legacy will be relegated in ten years to midnight madness showings with it on double bill of cult classics like Showgirls and Rocky Horror Picture show.<br/><br/>If you're a Natalie Portman fan like I am, watch ""Closer"" in which she is captivating and showcases her skills along with Clive Owen, Jude Law and, yes even Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>If you want to save yourself 2 1/2 hours rent this, watch the first 15 minutes cut to the last scene when she kills herself because the only ti e the word perfect will be connected to this film is in the final word of the movie when her last gasp of life is saying ""perfect"" - oh please...gag me with a spoon."

","Dazzling! Very beautifully interwoven. Unlike many other films about the two contrary forces within human beings -borrowed from William Blake's symbolism perhaps- this was not about killing the evil inside and becoming innocent or pure, but it is about initiation into experience and letting the evil force show itself.<br/><br/>The sexual approaches of Thomas are not sexual abuses but only stimulations to arouse as what we call it her ""evil side"". The mother is the superego (or in Blake's symbolism the URizen) who has imprisoned her daughter inside the walls of innocence. She must initiate into experience so that she can perform the role of the Black Swan better. That is why Thomas is trying to do. For him, the bettering of the ballet is important, he wants a wild, energetic and evil Nina to act out the Black Swan not the meek, innocent Nina who performs the White Swan brilliantly, naturally.<br/><br/>I feel dismayed why ""Black Swan"" wasn't awarded the Academy Award for best original score. Why ""The Social Network""? In my opinion, it was unfair. The music of ""Social Network"" was not worth winning the award. ""Swan Lake"" or at least ""Inception"" should have won.

He made some silly stuff (The Fountain) but knows how to create some beautiful cinema which shows his compassion for composition and bringing together old-fashioned characterization and filming and modern use of the digital effects and editing. So, Black Swan is a roller-coaster drive, full of shocks and awesome, powerful scenes that create the atmosphere of madness and obsession we see Nina going through. Well done for that; I thoroughly enjoyed that. But then, my god, are we still in the 60ies? For crying out loud when does this stupid stereotype finally dies out in cinema? Innocent virgin = good; Innocent virgin on the brink to become a sexually active woman = mad and bad, very bad, so bad, that she cannot survive.... Please, please. We had it all before. And, as before, madness and disorder in a woman is depicted with her sexual awakening and it must end with someone sticking something into her body to shut her up. (Another fine example from mainstream Hollywood for that? Watch X-Men III). Would be nice to see different stories with different women. Winters Bone for example. A lot of madness to be seen, still organic characters, with more to see than just clichés I am so tired off."
"nick-774","Null","3","6","24 February 2011"," Over blown, Over wrought and Over acted, but visually very good
","I watched Black Swan finally and though it is admittedly very arresting visually, I found the whole thing to be rather tiresome. The problem was with the script. In the first place it was very difficult to give a toss about the central character. I mean really, who cares whether she can excel at her Ballet job? what happens to her if she doesn't? nothing that's what? she'll go back to having a good ballet job playing other characters. A job that many little girls will already envy. The fact that 'artists' think we give a Frick about whether they can dig deep and emerse them selves in a role shows us just how pretentious they are, and this film if anything does reflect how actors and theatre performers take themselves waaaay too seriously. Its not like they're as important as a nurse or a soldier. There is nothing at stake if they fail to perform. But even so, I could maybe have been manipulated to care a bit more if the central character was just a bit more interesting. Jeez this girl was dull. I would walk the other way if i saw her coming down the street. she was impossible to care about. I understand that her character was meant to be closed off but that doesn't help us access the story. We need to root for her and we just don't. <br/><br/>Visually tho, it was outstanding, with some very striking moments. Aronofsky is clearly a hugely talented film maker, if a perhaps a little indulgent and too concerned with being 'seen' as a genius at the expense of his audiences experience in his movie.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman isn't that great apart from the effort she puts into the ballet scenes, but that's not what acting is all about. that is a peripheral requirement to what's important. She is dull and closed off. and Portman is just over rated as an actress. She was great in Leon but she's been been very ordinary at best in everything else. Someometimes just down right bad as with princess armadildo"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","3","6","10 February 2011"," Like a symphony... the fine tuning and impeccable interplay of every instrument is what makes it transcendent
","With an overbearing mother who lives vicariously through her, the perfectionist Nina lives and dies for getting the lead in the ballet Swan Lake(don't worry, the plot of that is explained early in this, and no, you don't need to like that form of expression... I didn't and don't, and still loved this), as the dual personalities of the Queen. She knows the steps beyond reproach, and she embodies the purity of the White half, as it reflects her own personality. But what of the uninhibited Dark one? Lily is the obvious choice, here, and is thus a potential rival for the part. And as this progresses, our lead comes closer to giving in... but with what result? The ideal casting of all three roles is a vital aspect. The talented Portman throws herself into the innocence(at times, her voice sounds frail as glass) that gradually accepts her urges(the giving up of control that is key to sexuality is an important metaphor in this... and it is rather erotic, and like everything else in this, not gratuitously so), Kunis surprises with how compelling she is, and the stiff-upper lip of Hershey is spot-on. Cassell(another passionate player) is astounding as the direct dance instructor(you truly get a sense of how unrelenting, fast-paced of a world that is). And all four are thoroughly developed, credible characters, in spite of how difficult it is to keep the first three from deteriorating into cliché-ridden, superficial stereotypes. The acting is fantastic for all involved. This really gets to you; I nearly cried three times, of either sadness or joy, feeling what our heroine felt. It's beautifully shot(there's a scene at a club where you are lost in the mood... and while you really are all the time in this, it's one of the strongest examples) and sharply edited all the way through. Like Pi and Requiem for a Dream(this has Clint Mansell also from that doing the score, a twisted variation on Tchaikovsky), this is about obsession and it is about the psychology and what it does to you, and like in those, we are experiencing the the grotesque sights and sounds of the hallucinations along with them. Aronofsky nails you to the seat and in spite of considerably brutal and disturbing portions, you're grateful for it. I recommend this warmly to any fan of his style, or the concept. 10/10"
"atlantis2006","Null","3","6","3 February 2011"," Classical music versus classic psychoanalytic theory
","Sometimes the conception of art can be everything. Every artist approaches the subject in a unique way, and there is never a right or wrong option. Some alternatives, however, can lead to self-destructive behaviors (consequently, the image of the tormented artist has been tremendously popular in the past).<br/><br/>Darren Aranofsky's latest film deals with art and the delicate balance between Eros and Thanatos. As Sigmund Freud wrote in some of his books, the vital drive and the death drive are forces that coexist in each one of us. Nina, the protagonist, though, finds out that sometimes it's nearly impossible to regain a sense of selfness after such different and opposite forces menace to pull her apart.<br/><br/>Nina has a deep devotion for ballet. Her whole emotional stability seems to depend on being selected for the main role for the upcoming ballet production. She is a superb ballerina but her director constantly criticizes her for being too rigid, too cold, too passionless. What lies underneath her unruffled expression? What's beneath all that control and perfection of movement? Only neurosis, I'd dare to claim.<br/><br/>If life and death are the most relevant aspects as some philosophers might affirm, then one could easily find a connection between sexual impulses and the vital drive. But what would occur when the pulse of nature is denied? What happens when sexual activity is not only disregarded but put off altogether? Freud did a thorough analysis of his time and he reached one daunting conclusion, which was quite polemic back then: sexual repression always leads to neurosis.<br/><br/>Nina's director can easily spot the uptightness of the future star. She is not only tense, she is afraid of her own body, of her own sexuality. Perhaps one could identify Nina's mother as the source of all evils. It has been said before that it's so easy to blame everything on the parents that one should look for other possibilities. This case, however, proves that parental influence can be most detrimental. With a mother that watches over her daughter constantly, controlling her and treating her like a child, it's only foreseeable to understand how this will affect Nina.<br/><br/>When Nina's mother undresses her or sleeps in the same bedroom, the viewer may be shocked at the lack of privacy, but perhaps what is more shocking is the passive response of the protagonist. It should be understandable, then, to see those repressed feelings surmounting the mental barriers she has put into place; in fact, after certain events Nina will even fantasize about the possibility of engaging in a lesbian affair of most physical nature.<br/><br/>There is much suspense throughout the film, and the constant supernatural visions of intrusions of the ominous can take us back, again, to the Freudian unheimlich: quotidian activities or mundane locations are infused with something that might be real but at the same time defies possibility, thus instilling apprehension and anxiety in people. Nina will experience something similar, but in a much more frightful manner. The very first scene sets the tone for these dark and ominous moments.<br/><br/>Art is creation, but it can also be destruction. At moments it would look as if Nina won't be able to resist the pressure, and the constant visions she seems to have might be seen as proof of her weak psychological condition. She could crumble at any moment as things heat up. Surrounded by envious ballerinas, sieged by her director, betrayed by the only girl she could call friend, Nina will soon find out that true artistic creation requires absolute passion and commitment to survive the experience. And thus, finally, the viewers come to realize what is the ultimate conception of art in Nina's mind."

","Black Swan <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has a certain ability to drill down to the deepest chasms of the human psyche - we have seen it in his heartbreaking masterpiece, Requiem for A Dream, and his last powerhouse, The Wrestler. With Black Swan he goes about investigating obsession, compulsion, fascination, psychosis and jealousy under the cover of the world of ballet. More specifically, during a production of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Nina, and her quest to master the poetic contrasts of both the White Swan and the Black Swan. Surrounding Nina are her controlling and envious former ballerina mother, her ballet instructor, and Lily who is essentially a dark reflection of Nina's personality, or so she projects. <br/><br/>Black Swan is high art cinema, combining operatic age old themes of competition, and destruction in the quest for perfection for the arts. The film is a psychosexual thriller, I guess, and is claustrophobic and intense enough to delve into horror territory at times. <br/><br/>No review of Black Swan, however will provide a fair assessment if it omits to mention Natalie Portman... Her performance is breathtaking and intensely visualised. This was such a draining role to play - a ballerina, suffering the rigours of the process and the mental strains she undergoes. This is a masterful performance. If she does not win the Academy Award for Best Actress, it will surely be a tragedy.<br/><br/>If you want a truly different, engaging and fulfilling time at the cinema, which does not involve CGI Monsters or 3D superheroes, Black Swan is well worth your time. <br/><br/>Breathtaking, mesmerising cinema. <br/><br/>10/10"

Darren knows how to treats and transforms our inner feelings into images and Black Swan couldn't be different in his career and the more the movie improves more the images and the characters become stronger.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is mesmerizing. I'm impressed how that little girl from The Professional (1994) is becoming one of the best actresses of her generation improving her abilities and proving her capabilities on each new work. Black Swan comes to sum a list of remarkable works as on Closer (2004), V for Vendetta (2006) and The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). Being a 2011's Oscar favorite not surprises me and I will not be impressed if she wins.

"evileyereviews","6","3","6","18 January 2011"," Brilliant, Amazing, Splendid, and then utter disappointment
","Starting with an almost unpolished demeanor, Black Swan slowly builds into an amazing movie experience, but then it just... Let's start from the beginning.<br/><br/>The opening shots depict the confidence of Darren Aronofsky, rugged, almost washed out and without visual substance, luring the viewer into a false sense of security. Slowly and surely, Black Swan builds into an intense and believable depiction of the unappreciated and misunderstood dedication that this discipline requires. The underlying force here is the lure to achieve perfection, the bait that ensnares the perfectionist into thinking that such a thing is possible, where fate brings one to the brink, the precarious edge, and then whispers into the hopeful ear that to jump is to own.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is simply perfect in this role. Her fanatic drive for perfection would impress the most ardent of Nazis, a belief that life itself can be cheated through dogged preparation. The cracks of reality that occasionally slip through are splendidly ignored, and not until the end do we see just how bent this determination is. Mila Kunis chirps in a surprising good performance, the perfect counterpoint to Portman's Nina, dedicatedly unleashed and all the more perfect because of it. Vincent Cassel, what can I say? This guy owns every role. While he plays a rather unlikable character here, it is one that perfectly balances the ambiguity of his intentions. Is his core filled with ooze or is his love of the craft so intense that he will opportune any moment to drive artistic heights out of his dancers? Vying for top honors, the camera work goes head to head with Portman's performance. This is no surprise, but its dazzling effects, from the voyeuristic walking of Nina, a symbol of her journey that demonstrates her denouement through the camera's increasingly agitated ambling, to the agile capacity that the camera demonstrates, almost cavorting with the dancers themselves, was simply phenomenal.<br/><br/>The editing and direction was typical Aronofsky, his style an earmark of artistry, toned down when appropriate but ramped up to MTV speed for effect, as can be seen in the dance club scene.<br/><br/>The story was a superb take on the brutality that life has to offer this pursuit. These dancers are to both strive for perfection and yet must also live their lives; they live the perfect polar impossibility, for they must dedicate their every ounce of existence towards perfecting their craft but must also live life such that their performance is based on more than just sheer preparation. How these performers do no go postal is one of life's greater mysteries. As the story moves forward and to its end, as it builds up a momentum that is just barely tolerable, the viewer becomes strapped to the seat, electrocuted with anticipation as to how this thriller will execute its final moments, white knuckles all the way.<br/><br/>And then it ends, suddenly and without much fuss. This ending makes perfect sense, and I guess to some it might seem a brutal finality, but to me it was so lackluster that I could not help but feel cheated. I mean, really, that's it, that's the payoff? Maybe my expectations were too high, but in almost ever other moment of this showing I was suitably Wowed by the performance but then left unfulfilled, hollow even, as the credits rolled. Had I walked out just moments before the last scene I bet this would have been considered Oscar worthy, but instead I cannot help but feel spurned, and alone, a feeling that only a chocolate shake heavily spiked with Gran Marnier could fix.

","Creepy, Emotional, so Sexy, and Incredibly Intense. As I'm writing this I just got out of the movie 10 minutes ago and am just utterly blown away from this film. Aronofsky is on top of his game like never before, I think this may even be better than Requiem. Natalie Portman is just awesome as Nina the star ballerina ...of Swan Lake. From the beginning your right there with her feeling how much she wants the role and how much pressure she feels when she gets it, all through Aronofsky's direction. He utilizes the extreme close up on the cast's face so much you can't help but feel the emotions they are going through but this is especially felt with Portman. She plays the naive, almost childish girl so well as you watch her transform into the Black Swan its an emotional roller coaster that you can't turn away from. The supporting cast is great. Vincent Cassel is great as the creepy head of production, a character that everyone has seen before, yet he plays it so well its almost like watching the character for the first time. Then you have Barbara Hershey who plays a Hitchcockian mother to the T who is obsessed with her daughter (Portman) to get the role and succeeding. Mila Kunis would be considered the weakest role of the three supporters but that's not saying she's bad by any means, its just everyone else is that good. In my eyes she can't do anything bad, I may just be in love with her... and could use a little more of the scene between her and Portman and if you see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. Then running up the cast is Winona Ryder, who is really only on screen for a total of 15 minutes maybe but I will say she plays the crazy, sore loser very well and provides the film with possibly one of the most terrifying scenes in the movie. The story is so compelling and so freaking creepy at the same time. Aronofsky plays with the story of a girl training and performing the Swan Lake Ballet while at the same time telling a contemporary version of Swan Lake in the setting of NYC with a twist of the supernatural. It's an unbelievably well made film and worth seeing, seeing even multiple times. If your in the mood for something a little off the beaten path, unconventional and a psychological thriller/horror than do yourself a favor and don't wait for DVD/Blu-Ray to see this one. It will blow your damn mind."
"Marter2","10","3","6","30 December 2010"," Black Swan flies
","Like many great films, ""Black Swan"" uses something basic--something simple enough for the audience to grasp, to explore its characters in an interesting way. It uses this basic concept or idea as a backdrop, not focusing on it, and instead giving us a deep look at its characters. In Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"", this basic idea is the ballet, and more specifically, Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Chosen to play the lead role in the play is Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a woman far more obsessed with her career than anything else in life. She has to fight just to get the role, as the director of the ballet (Vincent Cassel) feels that she doesn't perform well as the Black Swan. This role requires freedom of body, something Nina doesn't have. She fits the role of the White Swan perfectly, having near-perfect technique. She practices whenever she has free time, always pushing herself harder and harder.<br/><br/>She has taken over the role from Beth (Winona Ryder), who is retiring shortly. There is also a new dancer arriving. Her name is Lily (Mila Kunis). Nina soon becomes paranoid that Lily is there only to steal her part in the ballet. Lily seems friendly enough, but Nina doesn't trust her. At least, she doesn't right away.<br/><br/>Nina has issues herself; paranoia is seemingly the last of her worries. She wakes up one morning with a rash, one that gets worse as the film progresses. She also suffer from hallucinations, or maybe they aren't actually hallucinations. We can't be sure, and neither can she.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the psychological issues that Nina faces and has to overcome are actually the worst parts of ""Black Swan"". The relationships between Nina and her mother Barbara Hershey, Lily and the ballet director are actually far more fascinating than any problems Nina has. Sure, the things going wrong in her head and with her body end up making these relationships more exciting, but when the film focuses solely on these obstacles, it gets less engaging.<br/><br/>As I said, the relationships are the most entertaining parts of ""Black Swan"", and this is likely due to the mystery surrounding the supporting cast. Nina is a character we get to know quite well, and we can sympathize with her. This is good, but when you combine this with the fact that you don't know the other characters much, if at all, the contrast between them makes their relationships the most entertaining part of the film.<br/><br/>Nina's mother is overbearing and overprotective. She treats Nina like she is 12 years old. (Nina actually mentions this at one point in the film). Nina's mother used to be a dancer, but for reasons we never find out, she gave up on that dream. She is now devoted to Nina's career, viewing it as she wanted to view her own. This brings into question if Nina was forced into ballet, of if it was her own choice. Is Nina as dedicated as she is to please herself, or to please her mother?<br/><br/>Lily is kept the most mysterious, and she works in direct contrast to Nina. If this was Swan Lake, Nina would be the White Swan, and Lily would be the Black Swan. Nina's pure, Lily isn't. Lily loosens up easily, Nina's uptight. Surprisingly, opposites don't really attract in this relationship, and the two, despite Lily's best effort, don't gel well.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that can be said about ""Black Swan"", it's that the acting is great. Natalie Portman does an amazing job in her self- determined role. Reportedly training for more than six months, both Portman and Kunis are great. They both seem to be good dancers, and we already know that both can act. Their roles are demanding, and you can tell the dedication that both actresses had to their roles.<br/><br/>Also requiring mention is the musical score composed by Clint Mansell. Mansell altered Tchaikovsky's original music into something more twisted and fitting to the nature of the film. The soundtrack brings more depth to the feature, and enhances the emotions that are felt within it. It isn't distracting, but it is noticeable. This ends up working fine though, as the soundtrack itself stirs emotions, and ends up setting the tone of the film.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" functions well as a companion to Aronofsky's 2008 film ""The Wrestler"". Both films are about one person so dedicated to their art that they are willing to sacrifice everything else in their life. The leads in both films wish to become perfect in their field. The cost of this is an imperfect rest of their life. Both films are similar in theme, with the only real difference being the fantasy aspect of ""Black Swan"".<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is a film that deserves a viewing. The contrast between Nina, a character who is pure at heart, and the rest of the cast is striking, and the relationship between each of the characters is intriguing and entertaining. The issues Nina has to cope with are actually one of the least interesting parts of the film, yet still serve an important purpose. The performances are amazing, the soundtrack is nice to listen to and the film is emotionally engaging. All in all, it's a stunning film that will amaze and affect you both during, and after you watch it."
"pyrocitor","9","3","6","26 December 2010"," The compromises of art and audience
","Given that ballet is generally associated more with beauty, poise and heroism within the realm of cinema, it might seem an unconventional choice of subject matter for acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky's latest exploration of obsession and inner darkness. Which, naturally, makes it all the more fitting, as pitting the stereotypical associations of the art form against Aronofsky's chosen approach and body of with provides the film an undercurrent of the same sort of contrast and duality that permeates the film throughout, serving to illustrate a hideous underbelly to an art renowned for its flawless aesthetic perfection. Nonetheless, evident familiarities with Aronofsky's prior drama The Wrestler aside, it becomes quickly clear that Black Swan is an entirely different beast, defying such superficial attempts at categorization and emerging as a gruesomely effective synthesis of genre and influence. <br/><br/>Ambiguities abound throughout, as even the film's seemingly simple framework (again suggesting a duality between protagonist Nina's early struggles to master the role of the Swan Queen and later losing track of the fabric of her reality) continuously defies expectations of causality and linearity. Even in the earlier, 'normal' scenes, there emerge off- kilter elements that appear so out of place with the film's composed, subtle feel, that the entire picture threatens to be derailed: 'overly obvious' moments of symbolism, eerily over the top secondary characters (particularly the guffawing guests at a prestigious gala event and an overzealously flirtatious restaurant waiter). These and more, coupled with the nauseating dirge of Clint Mansell's score, threaten to leave the audience with the interpretation of a more simplistic, simple psychological thriller. Nonetheless, such a simplistic dismissal would deny the picture its fascinating subtlety and sophistication, as all of its horror 'money shots' (an array of skin peeling and bodily metamorphosis impressive enough to disgust even Cronenberg enthusiasts) and moments of jarring strangeness prove merely trappings to the all the more disturbing psychological reality that easily extrapolates upon and deepens an age old 'art requires destructive sacrifices' message. With a pace that feels simultaneously uncomfortably slow and unnervingly propulsive and cameras continually creeping up from behind, Aronofsky retains a continual sense of uneasy voyeurism, as if every scene is an illicit and ill-advised bout of eavesdropping on a woman whose life is steadily crumbling, clawing forward yet scrabbling to pick up the pieces from behind. The feel of perpetual fraying proves repulsive yet magnetic, so that even when the film delves into the grotesque, the viewer, so entrapped by noxious fatalism, proves riveted. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, while the tension between the overt and the subtle provides the film with the same sort of perverse power and grace associated with ballet, it can become a touch excessive at times, with some of the more non-sequitar horrific touches and maudlin moments feeling a little too disconnected even for Aronofsky's fragmentary feel. To boot, the film must threaten to top charts of the highest quantities of least appealing sexual scenes filmed, nor are simple things such as fingernails and stage lights ever liable to be trusted again by audiences after having watched the film. Most poignantly, for all of its grandeur and intimacy, Black Swan leaves the viewer with a continuous sense of mild yearning, as if merely flirting with the psychologically warping masterpiece lurking within even when at its considerable best. Like the Black Swan itself, Aronofsky's film feels ever so slightly contained, be it by the expectations of genre, audiences or award parameters (despite its precise tailoring inevitably wooing all of the above), never fully spreading its murky wings to attain the sort of uninhibited, heated artistic passion that Nina doggedly strives for. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, to say Natalie Portman gives a career defining performance as Nina would be perfectly appropriate, as Portman appears to allow herself to blossom and wither within the role. With consummate control, Portman strings Nina along a continuous razor's edge of tension and focus, eerie enough to begin with, making her subsequent transition all the more horrifying yet gruesomely liberating. Her performance is in itself a masterpiece, and, like Nina, proves worthy of any critical attention extended in her direction. The casting of Mila Kunis feels entirely out of place, yet, consciously, all the more brilliantly appropriate, as her louder than life, flamboyantly unrestrained performance provides a perfect counterpoint to the brittle Nina, and in many ways Kunis' sly, calculating eyes deliver a performance nearly as impressive. Vincent Cassel feels somewhat overly obvious as the ballet director not above using sexuality to extract proper emotion, but, despite being plagued with many of the script's weaker moments of thematic exposition, Cassel delivers an entirely satisfactory, lived-in sensual confidence. Barbara Hershey packs a grimly horrific punch as Nina's disturbingly controlling mother, and Hershey is wise enough to play up her part while refraining from becoming over the top, her perpetually shadowed furrowed brow yet broad smile serving as both a chilling retread of the 'evil, repressive mother' stereotype and perpetual question of Nina's mental state throughout. Equally, Winona Ryder's uncomfortable scene chewing as the company's former star, pouting to a near adolescent extent, further provides a streak of stylized excess which further serves to question the veracity of the realism of each character's depictions throughout. <br/><br/>Disturbing, lingering, and assembled with the utmost precision and care, Aronosky's Black Swan proves a fascinating exploration into the grotesqueness of art and its fixation with perfection. That said, ironically, as if serving to illustrate the difficulties of melding an art- film approach with a mainstream oriented film, there does remain a faint but unshakable sense of lacking, as if Aronofsky could have pushed his film slightly further to the impeccable honing of 'perfection'. Whether this shortcoming was ultimately intended to emerge as the film's most self-reflexive thematic message about the compromises of art is up for debate, but if nothing else, Aronofsky's film provides the perfect fodder for nightmares, where the truly uncompromisingly horrifying Black Swan might freely take flight.<br/><br/>-8.5/10"

It all comes to a head on the opening night.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS!** Boring and disappointing ""thriller"" from director Darren Aronofsky. It was ridiculously obvious to me what was going on within the first 20 minutes! The rest of the movie just shows Nina slowly (VERY slowly) spiraling down to madness. The imagery was sometimes shocking but, towards the end, I was bored and couldn't wait for it to end. WAY too much ballet material too. Aronofsky gives plenty of clues to point that Nina is losing it--but then ends leaving a ridiculously large number of dangling ends. Even worse, I was never caught up in Nina's plight keeping me at an emotional distance from the whole movie. Good acting helps a little. Portman is kind of blank (but there's a reason for that) until the end when she breaks out. Cassel is just vicious as her director, Kunis is great as her best friend (or is she?), Barbara Hershey (looking TERRIBLE) is great as her mom and a virtually unrecognizable Winona Ryder throws in a small but strong performance. But the movie as a whole is too obscure, too slow and (frankly) too boring! I give it a 2."

","What to say... Well, this movie simply did not do it for me. Yes the performances and the accolades for Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are well deserved and all in high order: the dances, characters and the acting is spectacular and spot on. BUT the story + execution is what is at miss here and what really spoiled the movie for me. The whole movie you simply do not know what is reality and what is fiction of her imagination. So the whole movie you are stuck sitting there and thinking: ""Is this for real or is this her mind- yes it must be her mind because it is just so simply messed up..."" What is exciting about that? The art of the movies is to portray it in such a clever way that while you know something is a mind trip you still know who is having it and why, and you can still ""pretend"" or get into the role why they are having it - but in this movie there is nothing that the viewer can identify as reality vs the psychosis of her mind so everything becomes psychotic and fake. And that for me is a bad movie. Again, performances were spectacular but the storyline and especially the execution in my view was a huge flop and the reason for making this movie a sub far flick."

","Banal, pretentious and colossally over-rated.<br/><br/>As a big fan of Aronofsky's work I felt horribly let down by this tedious example of style over substance which appears to plumb the psychological depths of a paddling-pool while claiming it to be the Marianas trench.<br/><br/>Being positive, I guess the word I would use to describe the film overall is competent (which is of course also a veiled criticism), but lacking in the trancendence necessary to elevate it into the realm of being something special. The treatment of mental illness for example seems to oscillate between the agonisingly insufficient and the cleverly understated.<br/><br/>Portman's performance is likewise competent and effectively conveys a sense of growing fragility. In doing so however she breaks little new ground, the character portrayal is one I would expect any actress worth her salt to be able to pull off and is certainly nothing we haven't seen before.<br/><br/>All in all the story is one of a neurotic, obsessive, fairly repressed individual fraying at the seams and having a bit of a breakdown in a particularly anti-climatic fashion.<br/><br/>Not a bad film by any means but also falling far short of the brilliance for which it is being touted by salivating critics.<br/><br/>(Addendum: The Y chromosome in me insists that I mention the sublimity of Portman and Kunis' scenes together for obvious and massively chauvinistic reasons!)"

"Michael_Elliott","Null","10","33","27 December 2010"," Incredibly Effective Sexual-Thriller
","Black Swan (2010) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Brilliant sexual-thriller about dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) who must put up with her over demanding mother (Barbara Hershey) while at the same time preparing herself for the breakthrough role in Swan Lake. Slowly she begins to lose focus of what's going on due to the director (Vincent Cassel) of the show pushing her too hard and another girl (Mila Kunis) who might want to steal the part. BLACK SWAN, the latest film from Aronofsky, comes as a true tour-de-force and I really can't think of a better structured thriller in the past several decades. I'm sure had Hitchcock himself lived long enough to use the visual medium available today as well as the sexuality that you can get away with today then even he would have been impressed by the end result here. This is an extremely sexually charged movie yet it doesn't contain a single frame of nudity. Aronofsky has pulled off something rather remarkable because the film is like a big puzzle where if one small piece wasn't in the right place then everything around it would just crumble. A lot of credit must go to the director who wants against paints a visual nightmare but also the cast members who are downright eerie in how great they are. What really worked so well here is that you never quite know if what you're seeing is real or not. You enter one reality only to come out in a dream and then possibly continue to be in this dream for the rest of the picture. The way Aronofsky pulls this off is like watching a master working a piano because the director clearly has the audience in his hands and doesn't let them go.<br/><br/>As with his previous film THE WRESTLER, it's fair to say that this movie shows what countless others movies had in that it's about jealousy, fear and of course the hard work a professional must do in order to be perfect at their craft. What separates this film is the hellish vision from Aronofsky who uses all sorts of horror elements a lot better than the majority of films that actually try to call themselves a part of that genre. The torments that stalk Nina range from haunting visions to self-mutilation and the pain she feels is easily felt by the viewer. The director keeps the events in the film happening so fast that you can't help but feel like Nina as everything starts to spin out of control and Hell itself finally comes crashing down. The visual look of the film is superb as it ranges from some dark stuff like neo-realism to a beautiful ballet piece at the end. Portman delivers without question the greatest work of her career, which is saying quite a bit as she's always been very reliable no matter what she's doing. The obsession that her character struggles with is beautiful put to film by Portman and you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real dancer and of course someone who really is losing their mind. Hershey will certainly be seen by many as a villain but I loved the way the actress played it. She's not a cold-blooded snake of a villain but instead someone who tries to do good but by trying too hard they become bad. Kunis is so seduction in her part that she's the perfect opposite for Portman and you can't help but believe and feel the two's relationship as the movie goes along. Cassel also turns in a marvelous performance as does Winona Ryder in her small role as the former dancer who is on her way out. BLACK SWAN is a masterpiece of sexual tension and psychological fear. It's a hard film to describe and I'm sure you could show it to a hundred different people and they could all give you a different option of what the film is and what it was trying to do. The film is a real work of art and something that once again proves that Aronofsky is someone to keep an eye on."

And while Inception did match my expectation, Wall Street wasn't quite as good as I hoped for (though it's not a bad movie either). And while I do know of quite a lot of movies that will come out in 2011, there is a chance, that there will be a movie there, that will catch me by surprise ... like Black Swan did in 2010.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Aranofsky and I liked his other movies too. But I would never have guessed that Black Swan would have me caught up like it did. It is not a horror movie in a pure sense, but it does have quite a lot of moments of tension. And there is a sequence towards the end of the movie, that had me at the edge of my seat. Plus the goosebumps I am mentioning in the summary line (and the theater was heated!).<br/><br/>While ""true"" horror movies can make you ""jump out of your seat"", by a music cue, this really did have a strong vibe in the entire sequence. Of course boiling it down to just that (great) sequence would do injustice to the rest of the movie. And the great acting at hand. While the story is not new, the sound design, the editing, the framing, the acting and everything that got put into this movie, works excellent in favor of it.<br/><br/>If you had asked me in early December, I would have said Inception is my movie of the year 2010. But then I got the chance to watch Black Swan and I am truly amazed by this. Just talking about it, excites me and that has not happened in a long time. The Golden Globe Natalie Portman received is more than well deserved and only Fincher could have beaten Aranofsky (very clever script and a well earned Globe for Sorkin too).

Nina is the new choice to replace her. Beth is obviously very unhappy.<br/><br/>Beth accuses Nina of giving Thomas special favors to win the role. While this is not the case as the audience is well aware, Beth's accusations turn out to be more of a warning to the darkness she is heading into. Nina's emotions towards Beth are played out through the first 2/3rds of the film. About 1/3 of the way into the movie Lily (Mila Kunis) shows up & gets immediate attention as Nina's rival & then a part of her fantasy as well.<br/><br/>Veteran actress Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mom(Erica), whose main role is helping Nina & trying to keep her reined in so she does not get into trouble.

Between Lily, & Thomas LeRoy, plus Nina's warped reality, the film builds up to the only possible climax at Nina's performance of a lifetime.<br/><br/>This is powerful drama and while Portman looks a little too thin at times, her acting is right on. The supporting players are there but only for their interaction with Nina. The film is very focused which is it's strength. The eye candy of Portman (almost 30) and Kunis (28) reminds me that it is great that these actresses in their prime get a film in which women pretty much dominate the screen."
"doctorsmoothlove","6","4","10","3 January 2011"," Black Swan
","Watching Arronofsky's Black Swan is a bittersweet experience for me. After directing popular films like The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream, this new ""project"" of his was way over-advertised and exploited by Fox Searchlight. Disregard the trailer. There is no lesbian subplot, though the kiss actually does happen. I could posit that Arronofsky does fetishize the sexuality of his actresses, and you couldn't dismiss me. Nor could you dismiss my assertion that Black Swan isn't nearly worthy of the accolades it has received. Even on National Public Radio, Arronofsky describes meeting with Natalie Portman ten years ago to discuss producing this film. Adding more fuel to the marketing campaign, he recalls the difficulty in obtaining the paltry 13 million dollar budget to produce it. Perhaps he should have spent more time and less money.<br/><br/>For the moviegoer who has seen a lot of movies, Black Swan becomes a fun game of picking out influences from other directors. Arronofsky doesn't plagiarize Carrie, Mulholland Drive, or his other favorite films, yet he doesn't place them into a new context. The bad relationship the main character Nina (Natalie Portman) has with her mother is emotionally identical to the one in Carrie, for instance. The ideas are instead jumbled together within the context of a ballet performance, which is amusing but in no way innovative.<br/><br/>Enough of that, onto the plot: Nina Sayers is a respected dancer in New York Ballet Company who earns the dual role of white queen and black queen in a new version of Swan Lake. She devotes both her life and her mother's to training endlessly for the parts. Despite her technical skills, the director (Vincent Cassel) does not think she can portray the seductiveness of the black swan character. A new arrival from the West Coast, Lily (Mila Kunis), arrives and impresses everyone with her erotic performances. Nina becomes confused and starts projecting her insecurities onto herself, Lily, which results in her demise.<br/><br/>Nina's circumstance is idealized to the point of incredulity. Her room is entirely pink, her mother makes garish birthday cakes, and the screenwriter actually named her ""little girl"" (niña, get it?). This isn't to say the setup doesn't work, but it goes too far. This riff recalls the eerie look of Neil Jordan's fantasies minus the subtlety. Some of her hallucinations involve lights being shut off and inanimate objects coming to life. If you think I have described a mild horror film, then you would be correct. What saves me from dismissing the movie entirely is Portman's otherworldly performance. She trained in ballet for nearly a year prior to filming, and the movie happily shows her in close-ups. It's her non-athletic sequences that are the most meaningful. The permanently frightened look that seems stuck on her face was finally put into the right movie. By only facial movements, she sets the tone from sinister to calm, as we anticipate further distraction.<br/><br/>There are some memorable shots in Black Swan, including the final which directly references The Wrestler. Watching that last shot helped me realize how much of an anomaly Arronofsky's last film really was. He calls them companion pieces, but the two have little in common other than their shared focus on sport-related anxiety. The former doesn't (on paper) sound like the more interesting film, yet it is. At least it isn't as cobbled together.<br/><br/>Recommended"

Because this dark side is also a part of you, who cannot be denied or suppressed, and without which you are incomplete. And a person, especially an artist, cannot achieve greatness if he is only half a person. This is the powerful and somehow scary message of the movie. Scary, because it means to accept loosing control sometimes, which can be quite frightening if you're a control freak and a perfectionist (like Nina is). This is why ""the only person standing in your way, is yourself"". I'm sure Freud would have been in raptures over this movie! <br/><br/>Natalie Portman is brilliant, superb, natural and terrifying...if she doesn't win an Oscar for this then all those guys in Hollywood are idiots! She plays so well that you sometimes forget this is a movie, you have the impression this is like a documentary of a ballerina's life. Her frigidity, her stress, her fear of failure, of letting everyone down, her struggle to keep her dark side under lock and key like a beast, are perfectly authentic. Not to mention her relationship to her mother, the typical parent living through its child, putting thus a heavy burden on its shoulders. <br/><br/>A brilliant movie, but I have the impression that it needs a certain type of audience. Some people will take it perhaps only as a horror movie or some Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde variation...which is a pity because the movie is a small jewel of human psychology. <br/><br/>PS incidentally, I watched the ballet Swan lake a few weeks before seeing this movie...strangely, I had the impression that the prince was doing everything perfectly, but that he was superficial and lacked the ""feeling"" of his character..however, the dark wizard had such a magnetism about him and such a powerful presence on stage I was actually glad that at the end he defeated the prince!! Maybe the ballet dancer playing the Prince should watch this movie..."

","I had seen the commercial a few times on television and figured I would go ahead and watch it with the girlfriend as it was a nice and quiet Christmas evening at home. I thought this was going to be a chick flick more than anything and I was completely blown away. Natalie Portman's character was played tremendously and Mila Kunis has always been good at playing dark characters. The mother's part was a little on the obsessive compulsive side and the story could have been told without her but it didn't change the impact that the acting had on the movie as well as the storyline itself. The trailer does not justify the movie at all but at the same time if they showed any good scenes from the movie it would spoil the experience itself. Great directing as well as a good cast to support. Great job all around. I am sure that we will watch this one again. P.S. Feels kind of weird saying that about a ballet movie, lol."

","""I just want to be perfect."" This line illustrates the themes and hardships the main character faces in Black Swan. Fortunately, it also mostly tells of the quality of the film. Natalie Portman plays Nina, a gifted dancer who desires the role of the Swan Queen in a different version of the ballet Swan Lake. Right when she seems to have the role in the bag, along comes Lily, an effervescent dancer new to the company, portrayed by Mila Kunis. She reveals to be subtle, controlled, and free while she dances. These qualities are needed in order to play both the White Swan and the Black Swan in the dance. Shortly after, Nina is overcome with the desire to be perfect, and starts to hallucinate. She sees a double image of herself, drawings which become animated, and other shocking imagery as well. Black Swan is easily one of the best films of 2010. It functions well as a horror film, a psychological thriller, and a showcase of brilliant dancing. The chemistry between Portman and Kunis is seductive and shocking. Their performances convincingly reveal the power and eeriness of ""the dark side."" Both deserve to be in Oscar contention for their work, as does a scene-stealing Barbara Hershey as Nina's controlling mother. Black Swan will make you question whether the events and characters in this film are imaginary or not, and will leave you wondering for hours. This is a horror film for people who don't like horror films."

","Girl Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), full of promise, a ballerina of the New York ballet. Her life was entirely focused on dancing, and achieving success in their careers. Is largely due to her upbringing. Mama Nina's Eric (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina, not having achieved recognition, despite all his care, has a negative impact on the girl smothering control and imposing their own ambitions.<br/><br/>Plot of the story begins with the moment when the artistic director of Ballet of Nina Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) replaces the prima ballerina Beth McIntyre (Winona Ryder) to open the new season production of ""Swan Lake"".<br/><br/>In selecting the lead role, he seeks not a ballerina and actress who will be able to bring on stage two images: white swan and black swan.

""Fuel to the fire,"" she adds Lily (Mila Kunis), in which Nina sees the embodiment of that very black swan. Thoughts and close dialogue seems expensive to achieve the goal - to grasp the essence of assigned roles in the forthcoming statement, but is it true?

""Black Swan"" is a film, a variation on the same topic, but he has an original in its development and serve the audience on the screen. In a picture Aronofsky the dual personality is good suppression before harm, a white swan before the black swan, restricting self-checking before a freedom. Freedom to which so heroine Natali Portman for the sake of convincing game on a scene of theater of ballet aspires, appears for it secret defects destructive and at the same time captivating by realization, desires and own possibilities.

","A thrilling and extremely unsettling frottage across layered binaries, Aronofsky's Black Swan is likely to be one of the best and most powerful feminist films of the decade if not the (so far) century. Obviously the film is an important addition to a long tradition of dance films, mostly for and about women: it's clearly in conversation with Michael Powell's 1948 masterpiece The Red Shoes, whose hectic fevered eeriness it escalates. But half a century has gone by and the exploration of the way in which a rigorous and heavily stylized art form (ballet) both allows for and deforms women's sexuality has taken a drastically darker and more savage turn--although (and this will destabilize feminist claims for the film) we haven't managed to change the (spoiler ahead) ending. But what's new here is the way Aronofsky uses the jagged edge of each reflection / comparison, so that the tired tale of woman-as-commodity has the fast vicious bloody pace of an ugly bar fight. (That strobe light dance sequence in the club, all red and black, is the secret pace of the film as a whole--just what the choreographer, with his exquisite French impatience, is trying to hold his slow star to...) A strobe light might be, in fact, the secret method or measure of the film as a whole: good / evil, black / white, old / young, innocent / experienced, alive / dead, clean / dirty, whole / broken, hetero / homo--and so on (off / on / off...)--flash each against their opposite so quickly that, in my experience, the subject who watches comes close to knowing the situation of the subjectivity watched. In the bathroom, after, I swear I thought I saw a splash of blood where...it wasn't--and it took me awhile to stop shaking. (I'm not sure I've fully stopped.) This is a Director (and a writer) who knows something about what it means to lose body--and mind--in the effort to be perfect, as perfection appears to shrink to a brutally sharp (penetrating) point. But is the virgin / whore binary really complicated here or only (once again) exploited better than it's ever been before? ""Was I good?!"" One character calls out to someone who only dreamed of being loved: the answer is yes / no."

","After seeing the trailer for Aronofsky's latest release I expected nothing less than the usual fantastic uneasy viewing and a feeling of almost sickness, yet awe, at what I'd just seen, I've come to expect from his directorials. Disappointed, I wasn't.<br/><br/>The film encapsulates you instantly in the beautiful, albeit competitive, realm of ballet and the impressive aural accompaniment provided by the every present Clint Mansell keeps thing expectantly intense throughout.<br/><br/>Darren's usual chromatography style isn't lost in Black Swan although it isn't as prominent as in some previous releases such as Requiem For A Dream and The Fountain. Instead Aronofsky chooses to focus on attacking the sense with beautiful musical compositions and intense imagery.<br/><br/>The casting is superb all round but Portman is the stand out act in this screenplay, with a deftness to go from fragile to intense at a whim and the ability to make the audience care for her from the beginning, bring together an incredibly intense and consistent performance.<br/><br/>My only criticism of the film would be the over-use of far too obvious and blatant metaphors. It will become apparent upon viewing, but I believe Aronofsky may have chosen to take this route due to the under performance of some previous films i.e. The Fountain which are complex in nature, but understandable after repeat viewings, therefore making the film more accessible to the general public.<br/><br/>As a long time Aronofsky fan, it was always going to be difficult for this film to be a disappointment, yet at the same time I had very high expectations. But as with all of his films, the subject of the film can be irrelevant to most, you don't have to like ballet to enjoy this film, you just have to like beautiful, intense and incredible cinema."
"lam1979","6","4","10","19 December 2010"," Technical virtuosity, big ideas left unexplored. Good music though.
","I came into the theater ready to be impressed as all the reviews say I should be, but I left feeling like I had seen a movie that was more formulaic and manipulative than artistic. The commitment of Natalie Portman to her character was extremely impressive, but in the end I do not feel that the screenplay creates much space for her character, or any of the characters, to be moving. As I watched vulnerable Nina descend into madness, I thought how the screenplay could have been so much more interesting if it gave the audience a sense of Nina as someone who is initially strong, who then makes the conscious decision to risk her sanity for her art. We don't see that moment. Furthermore, the manner in which The Black Swan begins to emerge in Nina's life makes the concept of The Black Swan disconnected from The White Swan. How much more interesting it would have been to observe scenes where the two clearly overlapped, rather than existing in separate frames of consciousness within Nina's mind. When I realized at the end that the objective ""reality"" (a touchy word for any filmmaker to depend upon, but it still has its advantages)of what was going on would not be explained to the audience, since at that point we the audience were supposed to be on some higher level of subjective artistic experience with Nina, I felt cheated. That the pursuit of greatness in art can produce madness is no new idea. Violent passions have existed in ballet and classical music for a long time- that should really not count as a new artistic insight that the movie brings to the audience. Too much time and money were spent on mirror tricks and digital effects. Some more imagination with showing where The Black Swan exists in artists' lives would have been better than personifying it then oversimplifying it into a sort of Sapphic intrigue. Finally, the initial act that makes the director think that Nina has The Black Swan within her- when she bites his lip out of a sort of self-defense- is illogical. The Black Swan here is supposed to be sexually dominant, and commanding. Nina bit his lip because there were few other ways she could fight back a domineering ballet director. And yet this is the moment when he is supposed to sense her supernatural sensual depths? I appreciated the solid performances and the technical virtuosity of this film, but I think there are scarier ways to represent The Black Swan in artists' lives than with goosebumps and tricky camera shots."

","Aronofsky has proved himself by now to be a filmmaker of total and utter fearlessness, beyond brazen in his choices and the dazzling execution thereof, the innovative and consistently dependable master Shyamalan wished he could be, and with Black Swan, he takes Natalie Portman - and us - for the ride of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Any film which has the deliriously gorgeous - and also consistently dependable - Portman in nearly every frame is worth plunking down cash for, and if you throw in the fact that she plays a reality-challenged and sexually repressed ballet dancer torn between her loyalty to her mommy and her desire to please her ballet director, who needs her to access her dark side - starting with her sexuality - in order to portray both the White Swan and her alter ego, the Black Swan in his production of Swan Lake, you've got yer basic on screen goldmine, and Aronofsky mines this gold for every nugget it's worth and then some.<br/><br/>We know going in that Nina has a less-than-firm grip on reality - this is shown early on in a variety of ways - so by the time we're not sure anymore what's actually happening and what's delusion, it makes perfect sense. This is not a movie that skirts the issues - this is the full-blown, in-yer-face genuine article, with no holds barred. <br/><br/>Others have called it the female version of The Wrestler and I would say this is valid, in its brutal depiction of how far a person will go in order to achieve and/or preserve his or her life choices or artistic vision. In Nina's case, she gives everything - literally - for merely one night of glory, the price her split psyche has had to pay for 'perfection', and on this level the movie works as a parable, a cautionary tale of obsession, a theme which resonates in all the movies Aronofsky has given us, from Pi on. It also works on the levels of melodrama, horror, sexually repressed psychosis, fear of failure, loss of innocence, all this and more, and in the hands of any other filmmaker I can think of it would have been laughable. In the theatre I saw it in, today, at the end, as the credits rolled, nobody was laughing."

","Like many of Aranofskys films"" Black Swan"" is also about a very flawed broken character that is trying to achieve something that is larger than life. This film is a meditation on the world of Ballet and the competitive nature of the dance form. It is very cerebral and you walk out of the theater a bit dazed. There is no doubt it will have an effect of the viewer, whatever that may be for that individual, depending on you respond to the film. It's essentially the story of Nina (played by Natalie Portman with bravado and incredible vulnerability) and her quest to become the Swan Queen of Tchaikovsky's ballet ""Swan Lake"" and do justice to it. This role of a lifetime requires her to not only play the white swan but its antithesis the Black Swan which requires her to let go of her inhibitions and be free. Can she pull this off? Her mentor Thomas (played with gusto by Vincent Cassel) has doubts and pushes her in every way to the point where he comes off creepy and arrogant, but it ultimately helps her achieve her goal. This journey to become ""perfect"" proves to be a daunting task as Nina has pressure from all around. Her mother is vicariously living through her and won't let her little princess get sidetracked. It is also suggested that Nina might have some Psychological issues, which would justify some of the gruesome scenes in the film but it's never stated, keeping the audience guessing. There is also a rival dancer played by Mila Kunis who oozes with sexuality and is a big distraction for Nina and of course she has her own insecurities and hallucinations to deal with. Technically, this film is brilliant. The film mostly focuses on close up shots of Natalie Portman and everything she goes through. The audience really feels like they are living this world with her. It's a very intimate experience. One thing Aronofsky achieves with this is giving us a total immersive experience in to the world of Ballet, no 3D glasses needed. I felt like I had done a week of Ballet boot camp after watching it. The film eventually leads to a rousing conclusion and Ultimately ""Black Swan"" ends up being a very satisfying film. Portman spent 10 months preparing for this role and she very good in it. It will be an easy Oscar nomination for both Portman and director Aronofsky.

To be fair, there are those who enjoy this kind of thing....say, for instance, ballet and opera aficianados who, with respect to stifling pathos, seem to enjoy gorging on the stuff (it never ceases to amaze me how both opera and ballet manages the unlikely juxtaposition of highly evolved, raw physical talent with that of the ridiculous, often down-right silly, story line).<br/><br/>Pathos, perhaps for many, is akin to something along the lines of Beluga caviar...considered a refined delicacy for those who saunter in such circles...yet, for the likes of this simple-minded average Joe, can be nothing more than fish eggs...which may occupy the category of ""gustatory novelty"" within the first couple of mouthfuls, but which inevitably becomes salty, unpalatable mush shortly thereafter. Ergo the flight path of Black Swan, when the feathers started to fly. It was certainly interesting, initially, in its cinematic style, unusual risky/fringe-y setting and characters, with fascinating emotional contextual tension. But the novelty soon became buried in the gluttony of melodrama which only was elevated to absurdity when given a hallucinogenic inflection.<br/><br/>My wife and I were gracious at ""the party"", though...recognizing the rapt facial expressions on those sitting around us. We managed to somehow subdue overt laughter.

"jdkraus","4","3","7","25 May 2013"," Aronofsky+Portman=...I don't know what
","Two names drew me to this movie. Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman. Aronofsky has made some very unique films and Portman is a fine actress. But that does not mean both will be a great movie. The story is simple. It is about a ballerina (Portman) who is obsessed with being the best performer, or in this case, being the Black Swan. Full of out-there characters, strange camera techniques/special effects, bizarrely, disturbing hallucinations, and a character driven to self-destruction, this movie reeks as a masterpiece by Aronofsky. What could go wrong? The problem? There are many. For starters, it is too reminiscent of Requiem for a Dream. About a third of the movie is nothing more than the ballerina's crazy delusions of her flesh and nails peeling off, faces in pictures mocking at her, and even conversations with other characters that never happen. While I enjoy such off the wall stuff, it is in excess and feels out of place for the film's plot. It is as if Aronofsky wanted to throw in craziness as a means to entertain or rather shock the viewer. The artsy film fans will love it but it is a put off for the average viewer. I don't mind it. It is just overbearing. It makes sense for such bizarre delusions to occur in a film about drug abuse like Requiem for a Dream, but not about a ballerina dancer. After awhile, you cannot help wonder if Portman's character is a psychotic. <br/><br/>The second problem with this film is that it lacks characters we care to see succeed. Aronofsky pulled this off marvelously in The Fountain and even Requiem for a Dream to an extent, but this is non-existent in The Black Swan. Third, supporting number 2, the performances were not that encompassing. Portman won the golden globe, the BAFTA, the Screen Actor's Guild, and the Oscar for this film. In all honesty, she acted mostly with a tear-stained face that is as memorable as a girl about to killed in a b-horror movie. I am not a Natalie Portman basher. I love her work. But she was not that good in this movie. The fourth problem, it has many scenes that have no relevance to the overall plot. Among them is a love lesbian scene between Portman and Mila Kunis. While this might work in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it feels contrived for simple shock value (and perhaps maybe an excuse to get young male viewers excited to watch this movie). <br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I'll spare you the pain of reading anymore. It is not a complete disaster though. Like all Aronofsky films, it has a haunting score and exquisite cinematography. The dream sequence in the beginning where Portman dances with a male performer that morphs into a monster is a spectacular feat. It is only a three-minute scene, but it is something for me to remember about the movie. The choreography is also very beautiful. Vincent Cassel as the ruthless play director is also very amusing to watch as he grills Portman and the other girls to do better. He delivers as the chauvinistic pig very well. I tried to watch this movie with an open-mind, but it is not my cup of tea."
"Manal1987","10","3","7","26 December 2011"," The Pursuit of Perfection
","To really appreciate Black Swan, you have to have the soul of an artist to understand the psychological labor that true artists go through in order to produce a ""perfect"" piece of art. The movie depicts this process and succeeds in capturing the fine line between art and insanity. <br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman), an aspiring ballerina, gets the role of her life as the Swan Queen in the universally acclaimed ballet The Swan Lake. Being an inexperienced introvert and a stiff dependent, Nina finds it easy to embody the role of the innocent White Swan but extremely difficult to embody its evil counterpart: the seductive Black Swan. As a result, the show director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), pushes her to dig deeper in herself and discover her own sexuality. In the meantime, Nina is totally obsessed with the new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis), who joins the company and charms everybody with her spontaneity, playfulness, and sexual appeal. Lily becomes everything Nina is missing, everything she wants to be, i.e. the Black Swan!<br/><br/>At this point, the story of the ballet intertwines with reality, and Nina's daily life turns into a daily struggle to win the approval of the director by breaking the curse of the White Swan she is trapped in. Nina becomes completely indulged in the ballet that she loses the ability to distinguish between what's real and what's not. Such psychological conflict is beautifully symbolized in Nina's visions and role-giving to people in her life, and in her constant attempts to revolt against and break free from her mother and her meek self, so that she can let the Black Swan take control of her. All for the sake of art.. Perfect Art. <br/><br/>The movie is fraught with symbolism and psychological undertones, a trademark of any Darren Aronofsky work, that the average movie viewer probably will not tolerate. Nevertheless, I think this is Aronofsky's masterpiece and his finest so far. His ability to bring such dark and unreachable artistic desires on screen and merge them with visual beauty is stunning! Every scene in the movie is a painting to be studied and taught. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman's mind-blowing performance deserved every ounce of the Oscar she won for this role. This girl has it all: talent, charm, beauty, grace, intelligence and maturity. Kunis and Cassel were both playful and charming, being comfortable in their seemingly tailor-made roles. <br/><br/>And just to make everything perfect, and leaving me nothing to criticize, Clint Mansell adds his god-like touches to the movie's score turning it into a transcendental audio-visual piece of art."

True I have already read many interviews, reviews which covered the topic but none has inspired me to admit it to be a pure seldom work of art and I was not to fall for its grace prematurely. <br/><br/>But here I'm after watching 'Black Swan' helpless, stunned and mind frozen, not knowing where to start or how to explain the experience it delivered with full heart and soul just like non I have ever seeing. 'Black Swan' will trick your brain until it fry some nerves and thrill you till you pant and gasp grabbing your seat not knowing what will hit you next. It can scare you more than a horror movie and shatter you and leave you with despair more than a sad love story. You will not be able to tell this is what exactly you felt in those gruesome yet very touching 108 minutes of your life in front of the screen. 'Black Swan' is a peak of psychological thrillers and will eat the other so called movies for breakfast uncooked. Its strong and will make you so weak without your slightest knowledge.<br/><br/>Nina is a ballerina (Played by Natalie Portman- Star Wars, V for Vendetta) in a ballet company who has put all her mind and soul in to bringing perfection in to her performance. She completely engulf herself in desire to be one of the best dancers and gets the gem of an opportunity to perform as the Swan in the new version of Swan Lake ballet drama. Overjoyed and thrilled she instantly find new challenges which is physical and mental while preparing for this arduous role. While her art director Thomas (Vincent Cassel-Eastern Promises, Oceans Twelve) continuously puts more and more pressure on her rehearsals and in the same time awkwardly showing interest towards her makes her gets confused and troubled in mind. In the meantime a new dancer Lily (Milla Kunis- Book of Eli) who surprisingly convince Thomas as well starts to appear to be Nina's challenge in the role. Nina starts to feel like her role is insecure and build up her own fight within to grip. Struggling to juggle her person life and dance life Nina becomes a lost soul. <br/><br/>Nina's character cannot be explained that easily with few lines. It's complicated and fragile yet very emotional and strong. Natalie Portman plays this role so well that you will never be able to get her emotional filled face out of your brain. Starting from the very difficult ballet performances up to the very strong and heavy emotional scenes, Portman is exceptional. You don't need to second guess to understand her potential to grab all the best actress awards. Not only her but all the main cast in the show is very well played. If I say those are amazing performances I'm not boasting but expressing the whole truth only. <br/><br/>'Black Swan' at times is a ride filled with wonderful music, breath taking dance routines which flows like a calm river under the morning sun. And in the next minute it is so shocking and unbelievably loud and might stop your heart for a second. Darren Aronofsky has done a job which only very few might pull off at this age being the director of this masterpiece of cinema work. <br/><br/>There is a black swan and a white swan in us all. It's just a matter of unleashing.<br/><br/>My reviews at www.flickshout.blogspot.com"
"Philby-3","6","3","7","3 February 2011"," Gripping but nasty
","I'm afraid this movie falls within the brilliant but nasty class, or to put it another way it deals exclusively with the darker side of human nature. There is no light and shade, no humour, just a careering down the slope to inevitable disaster. We are very effectively put right into the mind of the principal character, a girl-woman who is an outstanding dancer but a very fragile human being in a tough environment. Her mother, a former dancer, has undoubtedly pushed her hard, but you can't put Nina's troubles down to Mum alone. There is Thomas the Svengali –like choreographer who is trying to arouse her dormant sexual feelings to get a better performance, and jealous other dancers. Plus, I suppose, the bitch-goddess success, more evident in New York than just about anywhere else.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky succeeds only too well in putting us inside Nina's mind. The loud soundtrack makes even the subway's clatter sinister and Tchaikovsky's music (played backwards apparently) menacing. The shaky hand-held camera adds to the claustrophobic malaise, though the grey concrete of backstage Lincoln Center (not the actual place) is pretty grim as well. A ballet movie for masochists, I thought. Even so, Natalie Portman puts in a brilliant performance. She is absolutely convincing, as are her delusions. It is certainly difficult to distinguish between what is actually happening and what is merely the product of Nina's addled imagination. I also liked Mila Kunis as the over-eager understudy/competitor and Barbara Hershey as Nina's controlling but anxious mother.<br/><br/>Classical Ballet is normally a refined form of theatre, and the production here follows the conventions – and then trashes them. There is too much suffering and not enough art, it seems. I don't know whether the original writer was trying to make a point about the suffering required to produce great art, but Aronofsky certainly makes Nina suffer. He also makes a mess of Tchaikovsky's work, which is conveniently out of copyright and unacknowledged except in the very small print. I don't think I'll be rushing to see his next film."
"bobsgrock","Null","3","7","22 January 2011"," Commands your every bit of attention.
","Black Swan is the type of film most moviegoers won't want to see until they hear from a select few how good it really is. On the surface, it appears to be a simple overwrought, art-house wannabe that strains to be important and ends up being self-aware and arrogant. Oh, how people can be wrong.<br/><br/>Everything you may think this film is, it very well may not be. From the opening sequence, a beautifully crafted, unbroken shot of a young woman and man dancing the White Swan from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, Darren Aronofsky's bold and insatiable tale never lets the audience's attention go. This is not simply a story about the pressures of professional ballerinas and their tendency to get caught up in their work. This is a thrilling, engaging psychological drama that plays with POV and omniscient narrator. We don't know what is happening because Nina Sayers doesn't.<br/><br/>So much can be said about this film, what it represents and how those themes are addressed. Yet, perhaps the best way to review this film is to simply try to encourage potential viewers to leave their logic and reason at home and try to get wrapped up in this story through its bold acting and wildly arresting visuals. Natalie Portman is the odds-on favorite to win the Best Actress Oscar next month and though I haven't seen the other potential nominee's work, I can certainly see why she might. Her screen presence is astounding; very few actresses can convey so many different emotions and feelings at once. She begins as an innocent, child-like dancer completely dominated by her mother (Barbara Hershey) and the theater director (Vincent Cassel). Both demand the very best of her and push until, they hope, she performs with no restraint. This pressure pushes Nina to the brink, and to watch her journey there is the true aspiration of this film with Portman boldly leading the way in a style all her own. Supporting her are Hershey doing a nice, subtle job as the ex-ballerina now attempting to find success through her daughter, Cassel as the sexually domineering director who uses sex and other forms of seduction to get the best of his performers, and Mila Kunis in yet another great supporting role that hopefully pushes her through into the realm of lead actress. Playing the dichotomy of Nina, Lily is a free-spirited, charming and loose dancer not so concerned about success as living. The interaction between these two is mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has been known for most of his career has a visual master. Films like Requiem For a Dream, The Fountain and The Wrestler all dealt with harsh imagery that stays with the audience after the film ends and Black Swan is no different; it might be his best work yet. Shot in the same style as The Wrestler with a lot of extreme closeups, grainy quality and hand-held camera work, Aronofsky gives the film an off-kilter feeling that is all the more stunning and surprising at the climax. I could continue trying to conjure up words to describe the awesome and enthralling power this film has, but that would be futile. Black Swan is a dazzling, incredibly provocative and mind-bending tale with powerful performances, glorious sets, vividly dark cinematography and breathless direction that brings it all to its rightful conclusion. Hopefully the success of this film ensures Aronofsky for years to come; he is a bright spot amidst the darkness that enshrouds American cinema today."
"secondtake","7","3","7","18 January 2011"," As constrained and striving and talented as the leading character
","Black Swan (2010)<br/><br/>There are some thrills and some beautiful elements to any movie about the ballet, and to any Darren Aronovsky film, so ""Black Swan"" is wired for success. Add hardworking veteran Natalie Portman to the mix, and in a nutshell you have the movie.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" has all the feelings of a bold, epic opera, a melodrama with psychological arrows, and fairy tale about being a girl and wanting to make it as the swan, as the ballerina. Us guys can get that, too, even if we don't pirouette so well.<br/><br/>Sadly, if not unexpectedly (I've never seen real depth to Aronovsky's universe), there is a constant exchange of sensation for penetration. The writers almost willfully give us plot devices we've seen before. The idea of a person (Portman's Nina the ballerina) who is too uptight to be successful and just has to be less perfect to be more perfect is an appealing but well worn idea. The characters are mostly cardboard clichés, like the bitter and controlling mother and the womanizing and aesthetically superior super-male director, neither of whom we really get to know. <br/><br/>Come to think of it, we don't really learn anything about the character of our leading female. Nina is a richly played stereotype. I don't mean she doesn't have a range of emotions, and certainly Portman makes the most of the emotional and physical pain in her memorable performance. The one force-fed diversion from the straight and narrow world of New York Ballet is when Nina steps out and goes nightclubbing, and her disorientation in that world only reminds us of what she is not. But surely her young adult life has had some shaping influences, some quirks of real personality, something besides the apparent trap of being a little girl forever.<br/><br/>And then, in what did surprise me for Aronovsky, the filming itself is awkward. The camera-work was really nice, strictly speaking--lots of moving camera, lots of anxiety in the unsteady image. But the light, the lighting, is painfully unexplored, unexploited. Once I noticed this, I couldn't help see how many of the scenes were filmed with a deliberately plain, almost ""ordinary"" light. Many movies are of course enhanced by being real world and even ""badly"" lit, the characters falling into shadow, the color of the light unappealing. But this is not story about the ordinary. Some of the scenes are even completely imaginary, and others are on the stage, with theater lights. By the last scene, the great performance, with Tchaikovky's music throbbing in the background, there is some sense of light and drama, and yet, amazingly, it is relatively withheld.<br/><br/>There are many movies that this one draws on, or draws up next to for comparison, from ""The Phantom of the Opera"" which is truly disturbing to any number of Zeffirelli productions which seem to have the same intention to wow the audience above all else, and do so with amazing visual and sonic excess. ""Black Swan"" has the intention common to Aranovsky's work to be profound, and this might be the big flaw in his career. That is, I don't think you succeed at trying to be profound. Instead, you succeed at doing something with perception and originality and subtlety, and then you might, as a product (but not a direct goal) discover, or uncover, something that is in fact profound.<br/><br/>So, this movie will make you think a little and it is very enjoyable. I found myself laughing out loud a few times when the effort to impress the audience became ludicrous, but at other times I was engaged and impressed. Go with reasonable expectations."
"lacatro","9","3","7","6 January 2011"," Spellbinding movie about the cut-throat and sometimes unstable world of a ballerina
","Ballerinas appear on the stage: graceful, strong, beautiful, and above all, simply effortless. This movie jolts you into the real world, the real work, the very real insecurities of these fairytale dancers. The harsh reality of being a prima ballerina being replaced through no fault of your own; your body just won't take the constant abuse, the long hours, and the mental strain of trying to grasp perfection. The pressure of being the new ingénue. Work harder, be stronger, DO NOT crack under the pressure of trying to be perfect, yet trying with all your heart to make this dance uniquely your own. Never trusting your comrades because even though you are the up and coming star, there is always someone waiting in the wings to fill your slippers. Push push push have to be the best no matter how much it hurts no matter how tired I am, I WILL BE the number one prima ballerina! This movie gave a very real sense of the pressures professional ballet dancers go through. They may not hallucinate or go crazy as in this most excellent movie, I am most delighted that this movie did not candy coat the profession. Bravo and I gave it a 9 star rating. Would have liked to see Winona Ryder a little more, then it would have been a 10!"
"akaplan716","9","3","7","3 January 2011"," Fast-pace thriller that artfully explores the mind's labyrinths and the origins of artistic ingenuity.
","Black Swan is largely about dualities. Throughout the movie Aronofsky asks us to question what is real and what is a dark dream; who is to be trusted and who is villainous; and who, in the end, is Nina Sayers. The fact that Nina must personify both the white swan and the black swan shows that one of the most significant, symbolic splits we encounter lies within the self — in the mind. Which of her experiences should we believe? Is she the victim of others' machinations, or is Portman's character herself the perpetrator? Does she love or loathe Beth, Lily, her mother, and her director? Is she timid or strong-willed?Is she the black swan or the white swan? <br/><br/>Aronofsky skillfully builds narrative tension by emphasizing the film's many dualities, a feat that he accomplishes through visual cues (this story depends little on dialogue). Note the strategic juxtaposition of white and black wardrobe (particularly in scenes that don't depict ballet), Nina's constant visions of her double, the ghostly and often gruesome reflections in the mirror that seem to defy reality, the way innocuous acts of grooming, dancing and training suddenly turn bloody and destructive. Because we see through Nina's eyes, we share her confusion and must view her world in its strange thematic binaries. The cinematography amplifies our bewilderment; Aronofsky aligns the camera with his protagonist and moves it frantically to communicate Nina's jostled perspective and mental disarray. The only certainty we have is that our heroine's vision is an untrustworthy guide to what is real or fake.<br/><br/>But to focus only on Nina's paranoid schizophrenia would be to overlook this film's more elegant argument about art. Nina's quest to master Swan Lake represents a constant struggle between her controlling desire to refine her technique, and her overarching need to liberate her spirit and embrace her fallibility. What she seeks is a kind of artistic immortality: the equilibrium between precision and passion, the Apollonian and the Dionysian, the scientific and the emotive. The fact that Nina seems to achieve this equilibrium during her performance as the Swan Queen explains why she must die in the end: In reconciling her warring artistic impulses — the black swan and the white swan — she obtains something no mortal can. Perfection."
"jpwhitehead","9","3","7","2 January 2011"," you should already know what this movie is about
","It was visceral, truncated, reminded a lot of Harold and Maude; please don't ask me why. The film flew about the topics of awareness and psychological and professional adventitiousness but it did not dwell for too long. I saw 'Nina' as having an exacerbated and untreated DID (disassociated identity disorder) or what we used to call an MP (multiple personality). But then again, maybe not; maybe its all exegesis. The film was brilliant and my first Aronofsky for the most part. I realize the budget was low but I lost a little in the digital image. The sound for the film made it up in a big way. I enjoyed the film on a gut level and the characters became like caricatures in a certain respect which I attribute to the image and screenplay. As far as being a psychological drama, it didn't really offend my sense of people with mental illness. In conclusion I applaud Aronofsky for not hamming up the titles which follow people with mental illness their entire lives, the subtlety was necessary and appreciated. It screened like a dream to me, albeit a nightmare, but a well wrought stripped down visceral dream."

","Darren Aronofsky really achieved something this time in the form of an exquisite masterpiece, Black Swan. Natalie Portman really does give an outstanding performance.<br/><br/>The film's tone is very similar to the dark psychological tones of Roman Polanski's films (e.g. Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant). Portman's performance defines a generation of actresses and gives it her all. <br/><br/>The whole psychology of the film is very disturbing. The film is very strange, as to where to fall under, genre-wise. It's considered a drama but in the likes of psychological horror or psychological thriller. <br/><br/>The shaky camera-work also distills a terrifying look into Portman's character's psyche. My recommendation is to watch this film under stress, because at the end, all the weight will be lifted off your shoulders and you will be liberated."
"MalcolmJTaylor","10","3","7","1 January 2011"," High-brow horror hits you in the gut
","The ""Black Swan"" is perhaps one of the most highly-stylized and incredibly subtle horror films ever made. It appears to disguise itself as a drama but is in fact a surreal nightmare--an extremely claustrophobic one. It is incredibly brutal and horrific on a much deeper level than any genre film. Here the horror is psychological and emotional. Yet still impacts you with real ""jump-in-your-seat"" fright. I'm glad I did not see the trailer before I saw the film. I was expecting a story about an ambitious ballerina...so glad I got something much more complex and layered with lasting resonance.<br/><br/>It is an outstanding film in all aspects of craftsmanship and deserves its accolades. It is tightly paced and never lets up from start to finish. Whatever the quibbles are about this film, it cannot be denied that it grips you hard and you are not on steady ground until you leave the theatre, much like the haunted house at an amusement park. Except with the ""Black Swan"", the horror is high-brow. It cuts through your faculties of reason and hits you right in the gut. A stunning achievement."

","The little girl in ""Leon: The Professional"" (1994) has grown up now. Natalie Portman is at her peak performance so far. Team up with heavy caliber Director Darren Aronofsky, they made a beautiful story but horrifying at the same time. Aronofsky is invincible, especially when he explores human desperation, like in his previous films ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000), ""The Fountain"" (2006) and ""The Wrestler"" (2008). For about 100 minutes of the movie, I felt like I was experiencing the theater performance, not just like a common movie. It's filled with beautiful images and great orchestra. Nina (Portman) is a chosen ballerina to fulfil her dual roles all at once, to be irresistible innocent white swan and also to become seductive evil black swan. Slowly but sure, the darker side of black swan absorbs her real life. I love the brilliant cinematography. Aronofsky seems to use two techniques of camera work. The first is for the long shot, he uses steady conventional method. And the second for the close up, he utilizes shaky hand-held camera. I have ever said before that hand-held camera is modern technique in today cinematic world. Not only for action, but recently for drama as well, hand-held camera is able to effectively drag you into the middle of ongoing situation, if you are not using hand-held camera, you are outdated now. The performers are effectively suitable. Vincent Cassel is fit for provocative and ambitious ballet instructor. Mila Kunis is fit for seductive and ambitious Nina's colleague. Barbara Hershey is fit for authoritarian and ambitious mother. And even a brief but impressive appearance by Winona Ryder as anxious and ambitious competitor. Yeah, it is all about the ambition and you can see it in each character. All of them have their own ambition. However, the star of all stars above is Portman. She shows her darker side successfully, you could literally feel her pain, pressure and paranoia situation. The movie becomes more mysterious with some unusual sex scenes. For the last half hour of film duration, she drives us into beautiful but ironic condition, sometimes absurdity become the part of it. Those last scenes are extremely terrifying, with broken fingernail, peeling skin and fractured bone for the elements. I almost could categorize thiz movie as a horror movie. The movie emphasizes in every beauty of ballet, there is a dark side that we never know before.

","Maybe Arronofsky's best work. Better than The Wreslter and comparable to Requiem For A Dream. The film is dark, symbolic, outlandish, beautiful, striking, and successfully stylistic. <br/><br/>Finally, Portman gets the recognition she deserves. Her presence in Black Swan is magical. The conclusion I draw in her method approach to the role and the very method upon which Arronofsky exhumes from the transformation of Nina Sayers into the Black Swan is the very embodiment of Heath Ledger's process in becoming The Joker or De Niro's earliest work with Scorsese. It gives the audience a chance to understand the deep and genius nature an artist must succumb to justify their work. It is the very portrayal of Van Gogh and others. Are they ahead of their time or are others stuck in the past? Something to ponder......"
"jasonpb","9","3","7","28 December 2010"," A Beautiful Nightmare
","One would not put the phrases ""psychological thriller"" and ""professional ballet"" in the same sentence, but Darren Aronofsky's newest film, Black Swan, allows us to do just that, and a lot more.<br/><br/>Aronofsky, director of Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, and The Wrestler, once again creates an experience in Black Swan that is visceral, emotional, and captivating from beginning to end. The plot follows a young ballerina, Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) in her quest to win the role of the Swan Queen in director Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel) production of Tchaikovsky's famous ""Swan Lake."" Leroy has no doubt that Sayers can play the white swan, who is nubile and innocent, but doubts her ability to play the black swan, who is darker, more sexually charged, and less refined. When Sayers wins the role, she feels pressure from her overbearing mother and the demanding director Leroy to enact the ""perfect"" performance. Added to that pressure is Sayers' suspicion that her alternate, Lily (played by the lovely Mila Kunis of That 70's Show fame) is plotting to take her place and is in fact preferred by the director.<br/><br/>Black Swan takes the viewer inside the often depressing world of professional ballet dancers, where the pressure not only to perform ""perfectly"" but also to look ""perfect"" seem to reach incomprehensible levels. Sayers, who is bulimic, another underlying problem in the world of professional ballet, is played wonderfully by the beautiful and ever-maturing Natalie Portman. It should also be noted that Cassel (whose appearance in mainstream cinema is long overdue) and Kunis (who deserves and will likely get more prominent roles in the future) are both perfectly suited for their roles as well. Aronofsky's use of light to depict good and evil is both obvious (at its most basic, contrasting the white and black swans) and subtle (lighting of various scenes, use of mirrors, clothing, etc.) and most importantly serves to clarify Nina's psychological turmoil.<br/><br/>While Portman and Aronofsky serve up a thrilling and troubling final act, the most disturbing character in the film is Nina Sayers' mother, played by Barbara Hershey. The bright, happy, mother-daughter relationship depicted in the first act of the film are nothing more than a guise for what lies just under the surface between these two characters. Hershey plays the role of the over-protective mother to perfection, but her character indeed goes beyond that. By the second act, the viewer has the sense that the mother has also established firm psychological control over Nina, and is living her own (short-lived) ballet career vicariously through her daughter, placing additional pressure on the already deeply troubled Nina.<br/><br/>Despite the outstanding performances by Hershey, Cassel, and Kunis, and perhaps the year's best directing by Aronofsky, the film, and particularly its final act, belong to Natalie Portman. Portman's real talent here is her ability to portray an incredibly wide range of human emotions in a relatively short period of time. The viewer not only sees but even feels her obsession, her pain, her loneliness, her sexual repression, and ultimately her pursuit of unattainable perfection. The viewer can see the pressure on young Nina building from all sides, but one clearly senses that the greatest pressure is that which the ballerina places upon herself. Her descent is thus rooted in this internal struggle rather than on the external pressures, making the final thirty minutes all the more terrifying.<br/><br/>Overall, Aronofsky has succeeded once again at using his medium to create a visceral experience that allows the viewer to see and feel a wide variety of human emotions. His use of light and symbolism are without compare, at least among this year's crop of films. Aronofsky allows a glimpse into the human psyche that probably follows more closely along the lines of Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain, rather than The Wrestler, but may be a better overall film than all of the above."

","After the awesome Requiem for a Dream (also one of my all time favourites) he had a small misstep with the somewhat obscure, ""The Fountain"" but is most certainly back on his a-game here with Black Swan. Director Darren Aronofsky has crafted a film so perfect, so visually stunning, so intense that it brings to mind the work of some demented artist from a time gone by.<br/><br/>Every frame of this film is so perfectly constructed and each performance so pitch perfect that it goes without saying that this has become my favourite film of 2010. Portmans performance deserves every accolade that it receives and Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis also deserve special mention.<br/><br/>The editing, the pace, the score, everything this film has on display has been so meticulously crafted that it defies explanation.<br/><br/>This is undoubtedly the most beautifully crafted horror film I have ever seen. Deeply disturbing with thematic elements that can be discussed ad nauseum post-film.

","This movie has 2 outstanding, almost perfect elements: the poster (it has a bit of ""hauntingly beautiful"" to it) and the idea. And while the storytelling is not perfect it does deliver and near the ending all it has been built up bursts in a crescendo of action and emotion. While most of the movie Natalie Portman acts like she is made of wood, you know like in Star Wars, this time it actually fits as she is supposed to be somewhat stiff and just mimicking emotions. However her transformation into the black swan at the end really surprised me and leads me to think she can actually act. And pretty well too. <br/><br/>Now jumping on to the supernatural elements some of them seem very well in place like an unexplained rash and bleeding of fingers, through impressions of seeing a familiar face on the street, to hallucinations while on drugs and an actual transformation into a black swan on stage some others like hallucinations in the hospital and before the show could have been handled subtler or more masterfully. For example in the cabin as I didn't understand what exactly was happening anymore it ruined immersion and made me not care anymore. Fortunately the beautiful performance follows that rescues and finally manages to create a nearly perfect ending. <br/><br/>However, there is one fault I find in it... the fact that watching the trailer or reading a two-line review basically renders the first hour of the movie useless, it adds surprisingly little. Fortunately it didn't get actually boring."

In this case, it consumes her sanity and explores some of the deepest archetypes in our minds. The film felt very similar to The Wrestler, but achieved a level of beauty that was stunning. The exploration of human sexuality was also ultra-realistic and was brilliantly interwoven with her central goal. Really loved the ending too. What a beautiful tragedy. There was only one period (albeit brief) where I was pulled out of the story ever so slightly.

But try as she might , she finds it very difficult to evoke the sensuality hidden deep within oneself. She is afraid of letting go of her deep dark feelings. Vincent Cassel as Ballet group director tries to evoke her dark side and gets impatient when he sees dead pan expression. Having been emotionally oppressed by her mother , Erica sayers (Barbara Hershey , known for the movie Beaches) she lets her emotions surface when she sees Lily ( from 70s show Mila Kunis)the girl with seductive look and openly flirtatious personality. Nina is seductive, gets into a lesbian relationship with Lily and boldly tells her mom to stay out of her bedroom...Nina gets in touch with her inner dark self ...only because she is a perfectionist. Nina wants to be the swan queen . Nina does not want to be the dying swan like Beth Macintyre ( Winona Ryder)...reminds one of Gloria Swanson in the sunset boulevard.. Nina is too focused on being the swan queen...the perfectionist who combines the white swan and the black swan.. Natalie Portman deserves the Oscar. She is graceful and has both pure, oppressed look and the seductress look in her eyes and in her movements. She is the perfect swan queen. Director Darren Aronofsky (loved his other work: requiem for a dream)is superb again."

","This film is about an artist's quest for perfection and the glass caged hell she creates, while striving for the impossible goal of that fleeting perfection. It would be far better, this film says, for the artist(dancer) to find some piece of imperfection which she can hold on to, and claim as her own personal and unique stamp on the world.<br/><br/>As Winonna's character says, ""I am not perfect"" This acknowledgment is perhaps her key, her path to her own redemption. Sorry to say Nina never finds her own path!<br/><br/>Also this film pays major tribute to the 1948 hit ""The Red Shoes"" which sent generations of ballerinas back to the dance floor... I can only imagine that this film will do much the same! They are both equally spectacular.<br/><br/>This film is very modern, and asks a lot of its viewers, but if you are willing and able, it will pay you handsomely for your suspension of disbelief!<br/><br/>BRAVO!"
"Hellmant","9","3","7","18 December 2010"," Has a very nightmarish dream quality to it, which is one of the highest compliments you can pay a film (in my opinion)!
","'BLACK SWAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky, the mastermind director behind such classic films as 'THE WRESTLER', 'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM', 'PI' and 'THE FOUNTAIN', brings us another masterpiece, this time revolving around the world of ballet. It's written by Andres Heinz, John J. McLaughlin and Mark Heyman (a buddy of Aronofsky's; co-producer on 'THE WRESTLER' and writer of his upcoming film 'MACHINE MAN'). It stars Natalie Portman, my favorite actress, who turns in an amazing performance and is the Oscar front-runner for best actress this year (which will be her first win and long overdue in my opinion). It costars Mila Kunis (who is also expected to pick up a best supporting actress Oscar nomination), she's came a long way from 'THAT 70's SHOW' and it might be interesting to note that Portman's co-star in her next film is Ashton Kutcher (Kunis's bf on the show.). Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder also co-star.<br/><br/>Like 'THE WRESTLER' this film is another story about one's obsession with their given art form. Instead of wrestling this film centers on ballerina but they kind of play out in strikingly similar fashions, if you think about it, especially the ending. Portman plays Nina, a ballerina in New York City who is obsessed with dancing. When the top dancer Beth (Ryder) is retired due to her age Nina is the director's top choice to replace her for the next production of 'Swan Lake'. The problem is that Nina fits the role of the innocent White Swan perfectly but is unable to lose herself in the performance enough to play the darker more sensual Black Swan. So when new dancer Lily (Kunis) represents the talent needed to perform the dark role the rivalry becomes bitter between the two and warps into a weird friendship. To top it off Nina has to deal with her over controlling mother (Hershey) who gave up her dancing career when she became pregnant with Nina.<br/><br/>The movie above all has a very nightmarish dream quality to it, which is one of the highest compliments you can pay a film (in my opinion). It's a great throwback to the classic films of decades ago, almost Hitchcockian in style. It's very dark and disturbing and although it's a dramatic character study it's also a lot like a horror film in many ways. It's not as emotionally charged and inspiring as 'THE WRESTLER', in my opinion, but it's technically perfect on all other levels; an artistic masterpiece. Some critics of the film argue that it's so over the top in melodrama that it's unintentionally funny in many ways but I didn't find that to be the case. It's dark and dramatic and maybe a little too melodramatic to really resonate emotionally with the viewer but it's still a stunningly beautiful and captivating film to watch. Highlighted of course by Aronofsky's brilliant directing and Portman's Oscar worthy performance, probably the best of the year!<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVckRO-OANw"
"cathie454","10","3","7","18 December 2010"," Great psychological thriller
","Half way through seeing this amazing movie, I was convinced Natalie Portman should win Best Actress at the Oscars and Golden Globes. This is an intricate, disturbing and fascinating look into the psyche of a young woman who has been molded by an over-protective bitter mother, and who lives more in the space of a week than she did in the rest of her life. The screenplay, cinematography, music and costuming should all be at least nominated for Golden Globes and Oscars. It gives a realistic glimpse into the hard reality behind the beauty of the ballet, and the soundtrack is perfect for the story in every scene. The action jumps back and forth between reality and the main character's fantasy life, and it is often impossible to separate them. Natalie Portman's fragile beauty is perfect for the sheltered innocence of her character, and her transformation into the Black Swan is a fascinating glimpse into madness. I'm sure this movie won't get the audience it should, but I'm hoping that it will get the recognition and honors it deserves."

","I watched Black Swan from director Darren Aronofsky starring Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey last night. I jumped and screamed like it was Friday the 13th. It's not really a horror but more of a suspenseful thriller. It's about a New York City ballet company that is producing Swan Lake, and the pressure Nina (Portman) puts on herself for reaching the lead role. Nina lives with Erica (Hershey), her overbearing mother and a former ballerina. Nina finds competition in new dancer Lily (Kunis). Swan Lake requires a ballerina who can play the innocent White Swan, which fits Nina, and the sensual Black Swan, which fits Lily. The dancers' rivalry changes into a bizarre friendship, and Nina begins exploring a dark side of herself. Nina's obsession with the role transforms her, not only on stage but also in her life.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky floods the screen with images of mirrors and reflections. Is Nina portraying the Swan Queen or has it become a reflection of Nina? Aronofsky's choice for hand-held also adds to the realism of the action.<br/><br/>Your not going to be screaming in fear, but definitely at the edge of your seat in suspense at the lengths Nina will go to be perfect. Also Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis totally do it, which makes the movie perfect."

","A couple of the other reviews mentioned that this film belonged in the horror category rather than the psychological thriller. For starters, it's probably a combination of both, and the confusion might originate from the fact that once again there are too many cooks in here. In my opinion, to remain focused in a film like this is the key, and at times, it does lose its way, but thank God it remains entertaining throughout, and this is the result of the acting and directing talent. As the nightmare evolves and personalities as well as egos are shattered, we remain glued to the screen to see how bad the wreck is going to be. The conclusion might start a debate, but I doubt it will reach the heights of movies like ""Fatal Attraction"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" In general the film has a very good premise, reality mirrors art, and art's intensity benefits from an overactive mind, or maybe a few minds. Everyone involved has something to contribute, and at the center there is the, way too tortured performance by Portman, who does a decent job, portraying the Swan Queen, but who could have added a bit more darker shading to her role. She is truly mesmerizing for about five minutes in the last third of the film, but there was a time when I wished the Lily character could have dispatched her, so we could have a more interesting film. It might not be Portman's fault that her character doesn't quite reach the expected heights, but we have Hershey and Cassell pulling the strings, and those two can certainly throw some curves and keep us guessing. We know they have a direct effect on Nina's behavior and ultimate fate. Their acting is spellbinding, and only if those lines were a bit sharper, then even Hitchcock would have a problem finding fault here.<br/><br/>In the film, the main character is seduced, haunted, stalked, tortured, abused, and possibly every sort of evil action is either done or hinted at. For a while we don't really understand who or what is doing, and the question is where does reality begin and end? Pressures grow, deadlines near, jealousy flares, and for a while even, a dash of sex adds some interesting perspective to the mix. Things become darker, paranoia grows, and we know one way or another, the end results aren't going to be pretty.<br/><br/>So, come in and expect to be entertained, and watch as the seeds of jealousy and resentment can poison even the best of us, and how some technical virtuosity can almost save a weak script. Sometimes getting the right actors and directors does make a big difference. It certainly does here."

","I liked this film's straightforward treatment of the demanding and treacherous world of the ballet and for many of its technical elements, such as the use of color, light and shadow. However, some of the camera work seemed amateurish; e.g., panning across the semi-circle of ballerina faces felt like a weak attempt at Hitchcock. Also, I found the script to lack cohesiveness ... too many bizarre events didn't seem connected, even for a woman who was losing her mind. In my opinion, Portman - even when ""released"" - did not show the brilliance with which many are crediting her. The repeated close shots of her face with the same anxious and tormented expression served to show a limited range. Like many young actresses, she is still learning and maturing her technique. This role was a stretch for her and we say ""bravo"" for attempting it."

","Words cannot describe Natalie Portman 's exceptional performance which in turn won her many awards including the well deserved Oscar and the Golden Globes to name a few. Not only did she portrayed the naïve childlike character Nina but at the same time excelled in her graceful performance as a ballerina as well for which she lost 20 pounds to look the part. Apart from her ballet dance classes she had when she was young, a dedicated Portman did ballet training for one year prior to shooting Black Swan. The 40 seconds long scene where she went into the toilet to call her mother with good news places her in a league of her own and did her justice as a top A Lister. <br/><br/>Looking back at Portman's career, the dark challenging character she played in V for Vandetta does not do justice when you compare it with the character Nina. Portman told broadcast journalist Charlie Rose in an interview that one of the most difficult challenges was her childlike voice in the film which was one of the most outstanding aspects of her character performance. <br/><br/>Mila Kunis and Wynona Rider added brilliant performance to the picture with their different characters and provided a much needed perspective on Nina's deteriorating sense of reality. Barbara Hershey provides a perfectly calculated performance as an infantilizing mother. <br/><br/>Hats off to Darren Aronofsky for pulling a masterpiece together with his signature style shots that shows shots taken from behind the subject. There are certain aspects of Black Swan that can relate to his powerful film ""The Wrestler""(2008)which also portrays the lead struggling for excellence in his field."

"AverxgeJoe","9","2","4","23 January 2015"," Amazing film
","Black Swan was a chilling film. Natalie Portman gives an amazing performance as a young ballerina named Nina. She is given the desired role of Swan Queen in the Swan Lake ballet. However she starts to lose her mind under the pressure of the playing the part. The film gives us an behind the scenes look to the life of a ballerina. And from what I've heard about ballerinas, the film is fairly accurate. The rivalries between the dancers are bitter and the pressure is really hard when competing for the best roles.<br/><br/>Black Swan is well directed and edited, with a good score. As Nina descends more into madness and starts having hallucinations I felt like I was watching a horror film. I thank director Aronofsky for his kind direction and warning us about jump scares in advance. Beyond the jump scares the film was a terrifying experience. Nina's whole story arc is a nail biting experience.<br/><br/>The film's whole story acts as an allegory for the Swan Lake ballet, where likewise in the film the main protagonist descends into the darkness of her own mind. The foreshadowing isn't very subtle, but the film stays suspenseful and intensive till the end. Black Swan is definitely one of the best films of 2010."
"john32935","3","2","4","20 January 2015"," Just a mess
","I do not understand Black Swan's receipt of so much critical acclaim or box office popularity. To me the film is a mess and not worth seeing.<br/><br/>The story is about a competition between 2 ballerinas for the lead role in the production of Swan Lake at a prestigious NYC ballet company. Fine so far. I am not a big fan of ballet, but I can appreciate the rigor of the dancers' training, the competition among the performers for the spotlight, and the grace and athleticism of their performance. What I cannot appreciate is director Darren Aronofsky's muddled approach to this world's presentation, including the representation in the psychologically disturbed world of one of lead characters (Natalie Portman in an Oscar-winning performance). The characters are two dimensional, the script is a hackneyed jumble of film clichés, and the plot is obvious. If you love dance and want to see films about it, there are far better ones to see, including the seminal, The Red Shoes, as well as Julia, to name just two.<br/><br/>The only good thing I can say about this film is that it better than Mr. Aronofsky's followup project, Noah, which is even worse."
"williampsamuel","10","2","4","6 December 2014"," The Most Beautiful and Spellbinding Film of 2010
","On the first day of 2011, I saw the best movie of 2010. Black Swan is an incredible artistic achievement. It is one of the most beautiful, most engaging, and at times scariest movies I have ever seen. It's like The Shining meets A Beautiful Mind meets Basic Instinct filtered through the splendor and precision of the ballet.<br/><br/>The story involves Nicole (Natalie Portman), a dancer with a prestigious ballet company, who dreams of getting her big break. This comes when she is cast as the swan queen in Swan Lake. She is perfect to play the pure, fragile white swan, but the sensuous, seductive black swan comes to be her downfall. She begins to lose all self control, falling into a world of drugs, alcohol, and wild parties. Worse, she comes to identify too closely with her role, until she can no longer tell reality from illusion. And her fears and insecurities develop into full-blown paranoia, centered on new girl Lilly.<br/><br/>Nicole's descent into madness is both frighteningly real and unreal. Some of her hallucinations are as fantastic and surreal as anything in a Salvador Dali painting. Others blend so seamlessly with reality that I am still unsure whether certain scenes actually took place or were all in her head. And this is part of what makes Black Swan so stimulating, the inability to trust the veracity of even the most explicitly laid out scene. The way she is sucked into her role is also strikingly like the true story of Jeremy Brett, who after four seasons of playing Sherlock Holmes came to believe that he was the great detective.<br/><br/>Black Swan also makes clear the pressure to excel and the jealousy that pervades the world of ballet, and the strain this places on the dancers. Nicole's cracked and bleeding nails, and stiffness and popping of her joints bear witness to the physical toll her profession takes on her. Harsher is the psychological and emotional impact of constantly striving for perfection. Gossip and sideways glances abound in the dressing room, much of it directed at whoever has the best role. And even more intense is fear of losing your position, and utter despair when this day comes.<br/><br/>This movie is also stunning to look at. The costumes, the sets, the photography, and the editing are all gorgeous. It also doesn't hurt that the screen is graced by Natalie Portman, who besides being one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation is also, based on her performance here, one of the most talented. She portrays the earnest, frigid good girl and the obsessed, hyper sexualized diva with equal convincingness. We in the audience sympathize with her plight, and mourn what is happening to her. It will be a shame if Portman does not win best actress for her work in this film.<br/><br/>I must caution you that Black Swan has earned its R rating in every way possible. There is strong language, disturbing images of blood and injuries, and some drug use. There is also pervasive sexuality, perhaps more than is needed, as in the explicit lovemaking between Nicole and Lilly.<br/><br/>But there is no denying that Black Swan is a truly great work of cinema, an absolute masterpiece of tension and paranoia. And the ending, with Nicole's tragic performance as the swan queen, is simply beyond words. If I live to be a hundred I will never lose the images of what happens in those moments. It stirred something inside me that I have not felt since watching the final shootout in Taxi Driver. As the screen faded and the credits rolled, I was completely blown away. And as I left the theater and got into my car, I realized I was trembling. If you care about great cinema, you must see Black Swan."
"rasmushelms","9","2","4","27 May 2014"," Technically Perfect
","""Black Swan"" is an excellent example of a film that succeeds both in being commercial and artistic. The film's subject matter of a woman's fears causing her to descend into a state of paranoia, as well as Darren Aronofsky's direction are both clearly influenced by Roman Polanski's 1960's psychological thrillers ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" However, while ""Black Swan"" is also primarily a character study of a female protagonist's deteriorating mental state, the faster pace and more melodramatic dialogue makes ""Black Swan"" a more commercial film. That isn't to say that ""Black Swan"" is a lesser film, because I think it just about as good as Polanski's classics, and possibly deals with more relevant themes. It's simply that the style will probably not shock the audience as much as Polanski's. <br/><br/>Having said that, I consider ""Black Swan"" a perfect film. The story follows Nina, a young ballerina (Natalie Portman), who gets her dream role of the Swan Queen only to find herself becoming paranoid of losing the role to her double (Mila Kunis), as she is pushed to the extremes by her director (Vincent Cassel) to ""let go"" of her obsession with technical perfection in order to become the darker side of her role: namely, The Black Swan. The way Nina begins to embody her role of The Black Swan, while being paranoid of losing her dream part, is what constitutes the ""horror"" of the film. It also builds up to an operatic climax that wraps up the film beautifully. Aronofsky's direction brilliantly captures Nina's paranoia, making for a hallucinatory viewing experience, and the musical choices elegantly complement the great camera-work and choreography. It's a beautiful and thrilling film, although I did not find it particularly scary. <br/><br/>The performances here are excellent. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey (as Nina's overprotective mother) all put in convincing displays in their supporting roles. Nevertheless, the true star of the show is undoubtedly Natalie Portman. Doing the majority of her dancing scenes without a double, Portman delivers a virtuoso performance that demonstrates the full spectrum of her acting ability from the subtle, nervous glances she gives to the tears of heartbreak and torment.<br/><br/>Artful, thrilling, and powerful, ""Black Swan"" is a technically perfect film. Ironically, however, ""Black Swan"" might just suffer from the same problem as its main character, in cementing itself as a classic: it is so perfect that it fails to deliver the final punch by letting everything go."

It is an accessible, entertaining, crowd-pleasing film. This isn't a flaw, I wish more blockbusters did the same. In fact Black Swan works excellently as a portkey for art-house cinema virgins - Persona is an obvious recommendation for anyone who liked the Black Swan's themes of identity and the dissolution of identity.<br/><br/>Oh yeah by the way too, I wouldn't watch this with anyone else.

"pmrouse","10","2","4","11 January 2014"," My Opinion
","This movie is known to be a movie where you either love it or hate it. It's a very interpretive, powerful and symbolic film. Personally, I love it. The director does an incredible job playing with the plot and the characters to lead you to certain conclusions, but then misguiding you, tricking you..etc. The entire story leaves you hanging, shaking or wanting more. He also uses black and white to symbolize generalized good vs. evil. He is very direct with this symbol, yet seemingly indirect. His entire approach to the development of the plot and characters is so peculiar and different that it is nothing but intriguing. It can be classified as a physiological thriller, so it really toys with your mind. People argue that this movie was confusing and contradicting, but I believe that Aronfsky did that on purpose. And that his intentions were to make the watchers question themselves on what was reality and what was fantasy."

"matt-hirons","10","2","4","24 May 2013"," Aronofsky's finest
","Every time that I see 'Black Swan' again, I succumb to its beautifully dark and sinister spell some more. I cannot pick any fault with it, and every aspect - be it technical or narrative-based, doesn't only make me fall in love with Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece a little bit more, but it makes me fall in love with cinema a lot more (I didn't think it was possible).<br/><br/>Because a masterpiece, a cinematic tour de force and a pure example of engaging storytelling is exactly what 'Black Swan' is. Much of the plaudits note Natalie Portman's excellent performance as the highlight of the piece, and rightly so - she hits all of the right beats and captures all of the torture felt by her ballet star 'Nina Sayers', whose decaying mental state is worsened by ballet rival 'Lily' (an exceptional Mila Kunis), one of the most overbearing parent characters in film history (a sinisterly creepy Barbara Hershey) and her somewhat sex obsessed director, 'Thomas' (a captivating Vincent Cassel in his best performance in an English-spoken film).<br/><br/>But as mentioned, Portman is the star of the show, in a career defining performance - a role that she will probably never match, let alone top. She is perfect in every sense, and imperfect at all of the right moments. Portman firmly established herself as one of the best actresses in the world by showing her dedication by learning ballet and becoming a pro by training with Kunis non- stop for 6 months prior to filming.<br/><br/>'Black Swan' exists as a film students dream, a perfect text to analyse for an essay; be it how each of the characters mirrors a role from 'Swan Lake' with psychology battering effect or the exquisite way that the film is edited, making it so you notice something new every single time that you watch it, as faces change, inanimate objects move and senses are assaulted.<br/><br/>Matthew Libatique's cinematography is also a stand-out motivation to watch the film, even if the story doesn't appeal. His long duration tracking shots following 'Nina' walk around bleak locations are only bettered by how the dancing is framed. As someone who has never been interested in ballet, I was completely transfixed by the dances and how the camera moved flawlessly to track the perfect movements for long takes at a time.<br/><br/>The music combines with the visuals fascinatingly as well, with music from the 'Swan Lake' production being used as a repetitive motif to astonishingly wonderful and uneasy effect, never making the audience feel comfortable. The music is one of the main reasons that the final act of the film stays with me; the editing of the sound is powerful, rising and rising and rising as the shocking climax descends into more and more chaos - all with that beautiful and frightening music thundering around you.<br/><br/>The time that I saw 'Black Swan' in the cinema was one of most memorable cinema experiences of my life. It was full of old women who were clearly there expecting a nice film about ballet, only to filter out bit by bit as the crazed narrative unravelled. Other notable members of the audience included men being dragged by their better halves, looking catastrophically bored at the beginning and increasingly becoming more and more hooked as the film went on (I'm almost entirely sure that the infamous lesbian sex scene had nothing to do with it).<br/><br/>But the fact that a film like this reached such a wide audience is a testament in itself. It has no easy answers, each viewing will potentially give you a different interpretation and the closer you watch the more rewarding the experience will be. Definitely not the ingredients for a mainstream success, but genius like this cannot be rightly ignored by anyone."

All the violence, blood and nightmarish scenes were from the intense pressure under which she toiled. Thomas was an arrogant S.O.B., who hoped to awaken Nina's repressed sexuality, but this passage was marked by Nina's imagined lezzie-wet-dream. This ""dream"" propelled Nina to get into the black swan personality, and IMO her eye makeup as well as costuming were stunning, not to mention the black wings and bow/curtsey she takes as the triumphant Black Swan.<br/><br/>I do love dance movies. If the principal actresses were not technically lifelong-trained ballerinas, this is the movies, folks. Yes, professionals did the actual long-shot dancing. Yes, the facial closeups were of the principals. This is ""movie magic"". Stuntpersons have long had a corner on this market.<br/><br/>Nina's descent into madness was painful to watch. Was this further exacerbated by the drug pills, or was this part just another foray into Nina's troubled psyche? I even thought Nina would commit violence against Dear Old Mama. Exactly what was that big dark club for? Surely Mama's big mouth could have been shut up permanently; Mama was just itchin' for a big slammin' in the pie hole.<br/><br/>The Red Shoes: Vicky becomes #1 Cheese when Russian ballerina storms off to get married. Vicky is loved by the director, but he is gay. Vicky has replaced the prima ballerina, and Nina smacks of this. Nina has won the prize of Swan Queen, but is greeted by ""WHORE"" written in lipstick on the bathroom mirror. Is this real, or in her mind? It's hard to tell, in ""Black Swan"". Nina has won this big prize, but we are soon set up for the jealousies and nasty comments to follow. Nina has to look over her shoulder a lot...... Was one of the bar guys the Mad Hatter from ""Once Upon A Time""?<br/><br/>More Red Shoes: Vicky puts on the red pointe shoes, in the play within a play, and all of a sudden the shoes control her outside life. The shoes make her dance to her death, as she falls off a parapet onto the tracks of an oncoming train. Nina is obsessed; Swan Queen controls her life. She will kill, to keep her part. At least, we think so. Maybe the one she killed was herself, because in the end a shard of glass in her abdomen has caused tons of bleeding. She lies on the mattress underneath a white ceiling. Is she dead? Is she in Heaven? Is she going there soon?"

","Black Swan is a magnificent film led by a performance-of-the-ages by Natalie Portman and outstanding direction by Darren Aronofsky. This is not a movie about ballet as some people think, but it is a film that is more about a ballet dancer and her inner demons. This movie is almost a borderline horror film but it's a thriller that works at a very high level.<br/><br/>This film is about a ballet dancer, Nina who wins the role of Swan Lake. This role turns out to be giving her a hard time as she battles her inner demons, a rival dancer, a stern but caring mother, and a not-so-impressed ballet teacher.<br/><br/>This is Natalie Portman's best role she has ever done. She deserves her Oscar win one hundred percent. I really felt bad for her character, Nina and all what was going on with her. The supporting cast gave brilliant, chilling performances.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the better recent melodramatic thrillers I have seen. After the first ten minutes, I did not know whether I would like this or not. But the rest of the movie made up my mind for me. I rate this film 9/10."

","I kept thinking whether I would rate this film with a 9 or an 8. I picked 9, for the best performance of an actress I have ever seen and for the Aronofsky specific directing skills. I will admit that this is probably the most intense movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I could have never rated this movie with a 10, because in my views it is not a work of art. Art should not create intense emotions of panic, depression... I believe I couldn't rate it with a 10 because it was actually a horror movie even if officially it is not a horror. But it is, and it is only depressing and spooky and it brings together all the creepiness you can find in this world of ours. Art should be encouraging, full of hope, should bring joy to the world, not creepiness, not fear, we can easily find these in the real world. Me, I prefer Roberto Benigni, whom I would love to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>I would never watch Black Swan again, and if I would turn back the time, I wouldn't watch it for the first time. I would only want to see it again and rate it with a 10 if I were a fan of depression and panic attacks! As I already said, only for the huge, genius effort of Natalie Portman I rated it so high!"

","Nina Sayers wakes up in the morning and shares the marvelous dream she had with her single mother, Erica. She was on stage, performing the lead role in Tchaikovsky's ballet masterpiece, ""Swan Lake."" Other hard- working female ballet dancers also dream of this role, and with great reason. To star in an event of this magnitude is not only to share your love for this art. It also provides an opportunity on the grandest scale to finally show the world the passion that you, for so long, spent years to perfect.<br/><br/>The ballet company that Nina occupies is starting a new season, and its director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), is looking for a new star. Nina is eventually chosen, but the preparations will not be easy. She is required to play two characters of opposite nature, the White Swan and the Black Swan. Disciplined, controlled, and performing according to technique, Nina is a candidate who is more than ideal for the White Swan. But she lacks the qualities that are essential to embody the Black Swan, which demands her to follow feelings, and not methods.<br/><br/>Nina's responsibility indeed asks much of her, but ballet in itself is a grueling practice. It's ironic how the graceful gestures and elegant movements that ballet creates are achieved through continuous punishment of the body. Those who master this craft withstand tremendous pain until they adapt to actions the human body was never designed to do. Such training could damage the mind as much as it could hurt the limbs, and we slowly and fearfully learn how badly this has affected Nina herself. Things are only about to get worse.<br/><br/>Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/black-swan-movie-review/"

","Aronofsky has not lost his touch, since the days of 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'The Wrestler'. BLACK SWAN is, like Wrestler, one hell of a movie featuring the ups and downs of a person in an arts career.<br/><br/>I like the fact that this was different to the natural approach of The Wrestler in that it incorporated fictional inner demons into Portman's character to represent the low parts of her ballet life. Cinematography and editing were excellent. But the awesome part of this movie would not have existed without Portman's breathtaking performance as a fragile, controlled girl who was slowly but intensely getting caught up by the stress and the 'black swan' within herself, all in the name of 'letting go'.<br/><br/>I have not seen all the nominees yet, but would be damn surprised if Natalie did not win the Oscar for her phenomenal role. Interesting to note that the Black Swan's first physical appearance was when she stole the lipstick And her mother is probably as crazy as her too"

","Such a big surprise for a year of just disappointments, Black Swan is a beautiful film, thrilling and at the same a little scary. It is just amazing the way the director worked with the elements he had on his hands: a unique actress (Natalie Portman), beautiful photography, nice sceneries,..., ... etc. More than just that, he built a refined atmosphere that shows perfectly how was Nina's non-discovered inner soul, and how that took over her body. Nina was a ""grown up"" child, her body could be in the 20s but her mentality was still 12, and when everything she didn't developed throughout her years of life, will at once, wake up at some point of her brain. And that's where the big plot of this drama will start to uncoil. Brilliant, this movie reached all my expectations."
"andrj908","10","2","4","25 June 2012"," Where does reality begin and dreams end?
","Black Swan is the dizzying, intoxicating hallucinatory masterpiece that swept critics and audiences away alike in 2010. It recalls a similar film released a decade earlier, ""Mulholland Drive"", in that it is a dreamlike tale of achieving perfection, madness and two beautiful women with opposing personalities (i.e. good vs. evil, introverted vs. extroverted). If you want to go back further, Black Swan is akin to the work of Polanski, mostly ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"". It even has some parallels to a 1997 Japanese anime thriller called ""Perfect Blue"". But it still succeeds as a work of its own thanks to a tour-de-force performance by Natalie Portman, who won her much deserved Oscar for her role as Nina, a ballerina hell- bent on mastering her turn in The Swan Lake ballet where she plays the dual role of the White Swan and the Black Swan. The situation is complicated with the arrival of an uninhibited new dancer who seems to have no trouble attaining the sexual, dark side of the black swan that Nina seems to lack and need so desperately. Things get quite creepy, dark and weird fairly quickly from that point onwards as Nina loses her tenuous grip on reality.<br/><br/>Black Swan succeeds, like I previously stated, from its excellent performances, but also from the direction of Darren Aronofsky, who shoots New York City as a menacing, claustrophobic city and makes Nina feel particularly small amongst the monolithic skyscrapers. The cinematography is icy and beautiful, and the deep blacks and whites are contrasted by the beautiful, rich pinks, reds and blues. Detractors have attacked Black Swan for being unoriginal and clichéd. Pulp Fiction was not entirely original now, was it? Every film borrows elements from other films, and it's quite clear that Black Swan is borrowing, not stealing, because it stands on its own two feet with a highly original premise. Dopplegangers, femme- fatals, body metamorphosis and other such themes are not unique to one particular film, and that's why Black Swan isn't a knock-off. It may use familiar tropes but it still does them in a refreshing, entertaining way.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film. It contains many elements that help propel it from being good, to great."
"axsmashcrushallthree","3","2","4","7 February 2012"," I keep thinking of Roman Polanski...
","I saw this film fairly recently, and was excited because the material is a real treasure trove that could be mined for quite a haul, particularly in the hands of someone like Darren Aranofsky.<br/><br/>However, for me, it's Aranofsky's worst film by far, and I've seen them all. As a technician and stylist, he's one of my favorite current directors, but the story and performances were hammered home with so many clichés that the venture was just laughable.<br/><br/>I mean, Darren's singular approach of blurring space and time worked well with ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""The Fountain"" because of the inherent reality/unreality that is the central focus for the main character. Here, it's played out in the dichotomous relationship of TWO characters, and it's just plain silly - there is no granularity to it at all. The impresario and mother characters come off like crap - Anton Walbrook must have been turning in his grave. And of course, Mila Coon-Ass really kills it - a better actress with more allure, more subtlety, a better ability to convey passive-aggressiveness - now that might have helped a bit. Ultra-bad casting decision, but you have to give some credit to Natalie Portman, who turns in an agreeably flamboyant performance that, while probably not Oscar-worthy, is worth attending to.<br/><br/>But this thing is a turkey for me - it is ponderous and flat-footed rather than brooding and potent. This guy is a wonderfully talented director, but I hope Darren doesn't think that he's John Ford now after the Oscars of last year. Ford built his legacy through craft over time - so far, Darren has distinguished himself with techniques more akin to Roman Polanski. I'd love to see Aranofsky tackle something like ""Othello"" or ""Macbeth""! <br/><br/>And frankly, I'd rather see Roman Polanski tackle THIS material - shades of ""Repulsion""! Overall, I get more out of balletic conflicts like ""The Red Shoes"" and ""The Turning Point"" than this thing - I'd suggest that viewers at least see these as a source of comparison - heck, see ""Repulsion"" as well. I'm afraid that this isn't worth more than 3 out of 10."

","Beautiful nightmare You can't describe the elegance of this movie with words, it will touch your feeling where you have never touched before. Yes I'm talking about another masterpiece of Darren aronofsky (director of wrestler, requiem for dreams) Story: Nina has toiled for years in New York ballet to be a perfect ballet dancer.<br/><br/>The company has been falling in hard financial time and Thomas (head of this company) wants to save his company with performance of new rendition of swan lake .He puts Nina in hard mentally situation by choosing her as a lead dancer and this choice brings out the other side of Nina's personality, the side which Nina has been hiding for years.<br/><br/>Characters: Nina(mybeloved Natalie Portman), sexually squelched and repressed, DID (dissociative identity disorder), fragile, adult girl which is trapped in her childish issues(she has inherited mental disease from her mother)which wants nothing but pleasing her mother and being perfect at her career, by trying so hard to do this role perfectly, changed herself from naive angel to the magnificent beast. <br/><br/>For the better understanding next part of my word you'll need to remember this dialogue. Thomas says to Nina: (( in four years, every time you dance I see you are obsessed getting each and every move perfectly right but I never see you loose yourself ))<br/><br/>She tries to fight with her childish side by getting rid of her dolls and by self abusing she wants to reduce the stress and live for a while (as Thomas told her to do so). Nina for loosing herself puts herself into imaginary situation which is real for her, like imaginary fight with Mila kunis or seeing the devil side of herself into the mirror and at the end of her marvelous performances of black swan , she even stab herself for the white swan death scene.<br/><br/>The supporting actors are very good. Harshey plays Nina's mom Erica and she made this character a care giving mom which claims that she gave up her life to raise Nina and she does whatever it takes to keep Nina at home and treat her as child and because of her depression Nina can't argue with her.<br/><br/>Thomas is obscure character which until the end of the movie you'll never know what is his truly intention and is he trying to seduce Nina or he want to help him.<br/><br/>Soundtrack was also great in this movie, Clint mansell (the composer) makes you sympathy with the character and feel what they felt and soaked us in the extraordinary horror and excitement feelings throughout the movie.<br/><br/>In the end as I said before this is masterpiece from beginning to end and it's memories will haunt you at least for a while. Natalie Portman which couldn't get the Oscar for her first nomination (closer) earn the Oscar at this time. I suggest to all of you to watch this movie."

","This film was something Ken Russell would have knocked out in the 70s and probably done a better job;(cf 'The Music Lovers). I've waited a long time to see it and can only say it was over-rated and hyped beyond belief. The only saving grace was the music. It didn't seem to know what it wanted to be, soft porn (ie the lesbian scene); schlock horror (cgi spooky mirror and random dripping blood scenes); serious art house; who knows, it's a complete mish-mash of ideas. If you want passion in music and dance, go no further than Carlos Saura's 'Carmen', a flamenco interpretation of Bizet's famous opera, where jealousies and rivalries consume all, and life begins tragically to imitate art. So sorry, Peter Illych Tchaikovsky, you've been better served on the big screen than 'Black Swan'."

Apart from Portman there were plenty of other good actors.

The film starts off slow and it builds up throughout the film, this helps the movie a lot it helps build character, and makes you actually care for them.

There's one scene in the movie that truly disturbed me and now I will never get the image out of my head, it's a scene in which the main character masturbates, I'm not going to give away to much but, the scene is truly a disturbing moment that even for people, who aren't easily disturbed like myself, will be disturbed by this scene.

There were some good effects, such as SPOILER her morphing into the Black Swan Queen, and the moment when her childhood drawings started to move, but overall it was tedious, hard to believe, and hard to know whether it was all a fantasy or if we were supposed to learn something about the character's life and the world of competition among ballet dancers.

","Black Swan, a Darren Aronofsky film, is simply amazing. No film in 2010 affected me like this. So without further ado, here is my review of Black Swan.<br/><br/>The film has a very interesting way of portraying all of the aspects of Nina, the main character. Nina is a ballet young lady in New York who dances Ballet in a company. She auditions for the role of the Swan Queen, gets the role, and it slowly drives her mad. This role is played to perfection by Natalie Portman. She has a perfect, and I mean perfect, performance in this movie. She won the Oscar and deserved it more than anybody. The thing is, in the movie, Nina's role of the Swan Queen requires her to embody the White Swan, a innocent kind girl, and the Black Swan, the evil sister of seduction. She is all ways under the watch of Nina's mother, played by Barbra Hershey, is a crazy woman who is all ways on Nina's case. The co-star is Mila Kunis, who plays the role of Lily. Lily is one of the other dancers in the company, a young woman who embodies the Black Swan to Nina. Lily and Nina get off on the wrong foot but slowly, Lily embodies the Black Swan to Nina and Nina loses her mind in the process.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is perfect, the acting, the writing, the lighting, the cinematography, the plot, the movie is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I beg you to see it. It's one of the best movies in a while."

","Dominatrix mom + unstable girl + sexual inhibition + a pathological desire for perfection = psychiatric disaster.<br/><br/>I was left with an undecipherable feeling after watching this movie. I took about two hours for me to define this feeling: pure annoying, with some gloomy tint. The movie itself is kind of well crafted, and definitely well acted, but the way in which story unfolds is just annoying, and the main character's descent into madness, although linear, is ... (can I use the same word again?) annoying. There is something about this movie I don't really understand. Why is the story embedded in the context of ballet? The same story could easily fit in any other context: a scientist's descent into madness, a student's descent into madness, a security guard's descent into madness, a cop's descent into madness, a painter's descent into madness, a musician descent into madness... you name it. In some way, this movie is not compact, but glued, I mean, the ballet thing is kind of gratuitous. I get suspicious when I see a story glued to a context, when there's not natural unity. This kind of movies usually have a cocky message. ""Hey, we know about ballet, about art, about philosophy of art, we are an elite, we have been in art school, and we know what peasants don't know"". ""If you don't like this art-tinted movie, you are an ignorant"" ""If you like it, then you know about art"". What is the point anyways? Do you wanna make a movie, or you just wanna show your knowledge about ballet? You can throw art commentaries in the story, you can embed the story in an art context, but does this mean that the movie itself is art?"

Sitting down expecting ""Oscar material"" and getting this was disappointing.<br/><br/>The actors all preform well together and they could not have done a better job.

"lasttimeisaw","9","2","4","16 March 2011"," Black Swan
","I watched twice this film in three days, after the second view, it still fascinates me so much, which makes it easily crack into my top 3 list of 2010.<br/><br/>The film is the twin of Darren's last feature THE WRESTLER (2008), the quasi-identical path of a person pursues perfection in his/her life which requests huge sacrifice which he/she doesn't expect until the last moment of the finale. The tour-de-force performance by Natalie Portman is so magnetic insofar as to keep audience stick to their seats for the entire show and when the curtain falls, hailing her as the best performance of the year! I don't want to exaggerate how wonderful she is in interpreting two opposed role with perfect precision. Numerous BEST ACTRESS AWARDS cannot be wrong. The supporting cast is excellent as well, and Mila Kunis stands out distinctively as the imaginary black swan and the scintilla between her and Natalie slowly gives off as the film goes on until the peak moment. Also Barbara Hershey returns with a mighty and slightly creepy role as Natalie's control-freak mother and Vincent and Winona use great effort to become existential in their own ways. <br/><br/>Another important merit of the film is its Darren's mastery as a director, the shaky-cum- close DV style captures every inch of the emotional turbulence of our swan queen and conveys to us a vividly on-the-scene wallop. Plus who could resist the elegant ballet choreography? The final showdown on the stage is done marvelously without any letup.<br/><br/>The film is glutted with many nail-broken, blood-leaking, skin coming-off scenes, and by all means it is not an easy film suitable for everyone, but I recommend to anyone who would like to experience some mind-blowing brainwashing, this film will not fail you."
"kaylaure","4","2","4","15 March 2011"," It wasn't THAT good.
","I have to say I slightly enjoyed the movie but I think this was due in part to Tchaikovsky, and also due to my ability to fast forward through scenes of Portman's face and pointless gore. This movie was just ridiculous. I watched it on recommendation from my boyfriend who said ""It's just awesome, oh my god, so awesome. The ending will blow your mind!"" Well I guess the lesbian sex scene was why he felt that way, but what do you expect from a guy? <br/><br/>I found myself laughing through most of it - most especially the part where she pulls feathers out of her back in horror! Oh no! That was the cheesiest thing I have ever seen. And then to top it off, her legs snap back into an avian orientation. Thats some symbolism people. Then she has an E trip which was just an absurd part of the movie which I fast forwarded. Also, if you have half a brain, you can figure out the ending about 10 minutes in. My mind wasn't blown. It's still quite intact. <br/><br/>As a psychiatric nurse, I deal with schizophrenics constantly. The portrayal of the illness is accurate enough, though I'm not sure how Natalie Portman developed it in a day - the trigger being obtaining the role of the swan I guess. I raise my eyebrow. The weird people chasing her around reminded me of Perfect Blue - a Satoshi Kon movie which is slightly similar but much better. I don't know, I feel that many critically acclaimed American films are cheap knock off's of old Japanese masterpieces *hem hem* Avatar. I really don't understand why people liked this so much. I guess it's one of those movies people watch to seem pretentious by saying they liked it. <br/><br/>Redeeming qualities of this movie are: The dance director was great, the art direction was great, the music was beautiful. Tchaikovsky, man.<br/><br/>IF YOU HAVE A PHOBIA ABOUT FINGERNAIL MUTILATION AS I DO - be cautious. I warned you. It's nasty."

","""Black Swan"" is one of the most effective movies dealing with issues of and about mental health I have seen. It is so effective because it does not directly deal with that subject matter, instead wrapping itself in a surreal and hypnotic environment, where its main character flounders between reality and paranoia, with the line between both blurry at best and none-existent at worst.<br/><br/>When watching this movie, one can cut the tension with a knife. It is as palpable as anything in the movie. It is also one of the reasons why I think the film is not a candidate for repeat viewings. Not for me at least, not anytime soon.<br/><br/>However, the movie is truly an excellent piece of cinema. Darren Aronofsky is once again brilliant, a fact which seems to have escaped the Academy this time around, just as it did with ""The Wrestler"".<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is supreme in the movie, and deserved every bit of the critical acclaim and success she has garnered, including the Oscar itself, she was that good. I am glad the got recognized for her work, unlike Mickey Rourke, who last year got completely railroaded from his Oscar, an award he definitely deserved, as his was an astounding performance, one that Aronofsky is very capable of getting out of his actors. I am glad on this occasion it worked for Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, Vincent Casell and Winona Ryder are all great in the movie and were a treat to see.<br/><br/>But ultimately this movie belongs to Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman, a creator and his muse."

The most scary thing is how real it is in depicting the stress and ambivalence a career-driven dying-for-success girl suffers, which finally leads to her disillusions and even self-mutilation.<br/><br/>I assume Nina's mother influences Nina a lot, or even pins hope on Nina to realize the dream that she has failed to achieve, to become the swan queen of the Swan Lake.

","Darren Aronofsky originally intended to make a single film about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. That didn't work out as planned, and so 'The Wrestler' (2008) was made first, with 'Black Swan' following two years later. Despite being divided into separate stories, the films remain as companion pieces. The ring and the stage are entirely different worlds, but the films examine a common theme: the destruction of oneself for the sake of performance. Aronofsky tackles the idea with a more edgy approach this time round, but there is no doubt that the two films are opposite sides of the same coin.<br/><br/>Ballet dancer Nina (Natalie Portman) is determined to land the leading role in her company's production of Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake'. Her innocence, elegance and delicacy make her a perfect candidate for the White Swan, one half of the character. The same traits prevent her from playing the titular Black Swan, which is aggressive, seductive and dark. As Nina struggles to embody both halves of the character, she begins to lose her grip on reality. Things are made worse by an oppressive mother, an imposing director and a talented rival who threatens to snatch the role away.<br/><br/>Portman does a phenomenal job as Nina. She plays her emotions and her frailty with such conviction that her mental disintegration feels natural and credible. Her dedication to the role is obvious – shrinking down to unhealthy proportions and training tirelessly for a year transformed her into a proper ballerina. Even more impressively, she manages to act and keep up with the crazy choreography at the same time, doing both so flawlessly that an Oscar is inevitable.<br/><br/>The camera-work by Matthew Libatique perfectly communicates the frantic nature of the story. Mirrors are used creatively, and the liberal use of the close-up, especially during the dancing, creates a claustrophobic atmosphere that compliments the film's sinister nature. Clint Mansell's score is a brilliantly creepy reworking of Tchaikovsky's pieces. It is an effective composition, perfectly reflecting the film's mix of beauty and menace.<br/><br/>Somewhat disappointingly, the first half of 'Black Swan' is a little slow, with an over-emphasis on setting up the story. There is also perhaps slightly too great a focus on the dancing. However, the pace allows for the mood to build and build until a truly insane final act that delivers a satisfying payoff.<br/><br/>The works of Cronenberg, Polanski and Lynch - all of them masters of uncomfortable cinema - echo throughout. 'Black Swan' combines the body horror of 'The Fly', the paranoia of 'The Tenant', and the surrealism of 'Mulholland Drive' in a blend of menace so varied that it keeps the audience genuinely uneasy throughout. Yet Aronofsky does not rely on others to hold up his film. He has taken the tools crafted by others and created for himself a refreshingly demented film. In his own way, he combines beauty and perfection with madness and paranoia. Ballet is meant to be graceful, but the mood that Aronofsky creates is one of frenzy. There are scary films, and there are are beautiful films, and it is in the juxtaposition of the two that Aronofsky triumphs.<br/><br/>Over the years, Aronofsky has built himself a solid reputation for making films that are difficult to put in a box, and 'Black Swan' is no different. It doesn't know if it wants to be beautiful or ugly, so it is a mash-up of both. It aims to seduce and repulse at the same time, and it succeeds. Never has a film been so simultaneously elegant and vulgar. It is uncomfortable and occasionally nasty, and yet it is one of the most exhilarating in recent cinema."

","I saw this movie only after its nominations in various categories for Oscars, till then I was unaware about what a masterpiece I was going to miss. This movie is a splendid blend of darkness, music, passion and a little horror. The direction is so good that u find yourself living with the this character 'Nina' which is spectacularly carried out by Natalie Portman. My mind sometimes went on the way of the lead character's while watching the film, this shows how skillfully this film has been made. The director seems to be very, very clear what he wanted to show and how. The best part of this movie is that, it is highly unpredictable. Unpredictable in every sense. While watching you will think that, though for sometime, the movie is actually a horror movie, but as the movie proceeds, you will get clear idea of what is actually happening and how effectively it has been portrayed in front of you. You will get the actual blow of fresh air at the last shot of the movie, where the character Nina says ""I was perfect"". I bet, at that shot you will say that ""Wow! This movie is perfect ""."

","Director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) has done some offbeat films but has always elicited strong performances from his leads. Perhaps his greatest achievement is getting an Oscar worthy performance from Natalie Portman in Black Swan, a film that does an impressive job of depicting a psychological downward spiral of a competitive ballerina in the role of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Portman) works hard at her craft and gets the coveted starring role in Swan Lake. Doted on by her mother (Barbara Hershey in an unusual role) and pushed to extremes by her ballet director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), she begins to feel threatened and becomes delusional and loses touch with reality. A new arrival, Lily (Mila Kunis), understudies her and becomes not only her friend and night scene companion, but also her main competitor and threat. Is she undermining her on purpose or is Nina just imagining it all? As opening night approached, the visions become even more disturbing to the point that Nina is at the brink of her sanity and the curtain opens on the most important moment of her life.<br/><br/>Portman projects a complex series of conflicting emotions including anxiety, jealousy, and even guilt as if she does not deserve the lead. Guided by Aronofsky, she soars as she has never done before. Not only does she perform a substantial amount of physically demanding ballet, but we see things through her eyes and feel her pains. Does she really commit the horrible acts she thinks she may have done or is it all in her warped mind? It's not a pleasant journey. There is extremely disturbing use of mirror images that reflect Nina's face and become Lily in the next instant in jarring and unexpected fashion. Is Nina seeing Lily or is it a reflection of her own self? A moment that shows the various pieces of wall art at her home coming alive in nightmarish figures is truly unnerving.<br/><br/>Kunis as Lily brings enough menace to her role. Winona Ryder has a supporting role of a retiring, vindictive ballerina, Beth MacIntyre, who ends up in the hospital. A scene where Nina worships Beth is reminiscent of Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in the dressing room scene of All About Eve. Beth is bitter and even self abusive which kind of foreshadows what awaits Nina. Cassell is effective as the ballet director whose sexism and unusual methods are suspect but never his quest for the absolute best for his production. Hershey registers as an overly concerned, controlling mom.<br/><br/>The film does a good job of showing the mental and physical toll that rehearsal and practice take on a performer, and to make matters worse, the angst exhibits itself seemingly on Nina's body in distorted and grotesque manifestations. The physical mutations would probably amuse and please the likes of David Cronenberg and David Lynch. As Leroy demands more than what she shows in technique, she knows she has to give everything in her soul and more to satisfy the ballet's demands. There is an interesting dichotomy showing two sides of a ballerina's psyche with the repressed, uptight Nina whose frigidity is counterpointed by the free spirited and sensual Lily. Lily evens brings out her sexuality and inner yearning that seems all too real, or is it a dream? Something that is never mentioned or shown is if Nina is a virgin or ever had a real boyfriend. Then there is the duality within Nina of White and Black Swans in which the dark side must emerge if she is to fully inhabit the lead role.<br/><br/>Much of the film recalls other memorable films that bend reality like The Fight Club or Affliction, and Nina's descent into madness has striking similarities to Roman Polanski's classic Repulsion whose woman descends into psychological delusions and paranoia.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's use of camera work is startling as it works in concert with Portman's performance, and when you see the change in her eyes near the end, it is stunning. The film employs lots of hand-held shots with cinematographer Matthew Libatique to visualize a subjective viewpoint for Nina. The score by Clint Mansell is well done with a touch of foreboding. Both of them are Aronofsky veterans. The final scene as Nina readies to perform the last act as she morphs into the Black Swan to complete her transformation is haunting. The final shot is unforgettable. Some viewers may be turned off by its repellent imagery but others will be astonished by a powerful depiction of madness at any price."
"vincent_loy412","9","2","4","25 February 2011"," Superb psychological film with Natalie's breakthrough performance
","At first, I don't have any interest on watching this film. 'Black Swan' looking at the title made me thinks of a boring movie on ballet performances on Swan Lake. However, as this movie received critical acclaim, and the main cast, Natalie Portman getting praises for her role, and the movie received nominations for best picture, best actress, etc in Oscar, and so I decided to watch it, after listening to my friends' feedbacks on it. Everything is just good! So off I go!<br/><br/>It is a movie about a production of Swan Lake that requires a ballerina to play both the innocent White Swan and the sensual Black Swan. One dancer, Nina (Portman), is a perfect fit for the White Swan, while Lily (Kunis) has a personality that matches the Black Swan. When the two compete for the parts, Nina finds a dark side to herself. Natalie Portman's acting in the film is brilliant and natural. Her performance really bring us, the audiences into the film until it is like we shared the same feeling as she does, and get fully affected by her character. If the Oscar doesn't give her the Best Actress, I'm going to seriously boycott the awards. She truly deserved it. Her acting impressed me a lot, the best of the year for a female cast. I would like to praise her for her commitment to this movie by learning ballet dance which is very difficult.<br/><br/>I heard that there are a number of scary or frightening scenes in the movie. After I have watched it, this movie is not a horror-based film, but it is a psychological-thriller one. It plays with mind, just like the movie 'Inception' (on dreams) but in total different approach, this time being targeted to the only leading character, Nina by Natalie Portman. The first half of the movie seems a bit boring to me, with plot gets dragged, but as soon as the dark side of her prevails on the second half, everything goes interesting and exciting, fast-paced and I can consider 'epic' especially when she finally performed the Black Swan very well.<br/><br/>The story goes a bit complicated, which I already expected once a movie is about dealing with mind. Nina is fantasizing a lot (or I should say hallucination) of her friend, Lily, her director, Thomas, her predecessor, Beth and even of herself which she is definitely frightened of it. So in the middle, I am even blurred by which scenes are real, which are not. Finally, at the end, I understood the whole thing, and well, it ended beautifully, for me even though we do not know the fate of Nina who is injured (sorry for a bit of spoiler). The last phrase she said is immensely breathtaking; 'I felt it. Perfect. I was perfect.' before the screen goes black.<br/><br/>There are also quite a number of disturbing scenes in the movie as Nina has to be dirty-minded and be seductive to perfect her role as Black Swan. I'm already expecting some parts will be cut out of the movie in Malaysia, but I'm happy with it as only a bit of these disturbing scenes are removed (the middle process removed with the beginning and end process still shown) The audiences would still know what the scenes are intending to tell us. There is one foreigner (quite an old lady) sitting beside me, and she is like really disturbed with those scenes. Finally, it's a great piece of work, by the directors, producers and the casts. Out of 10 points, I would rate this one 7.9. It is a very good movie, but sorry, it is still not best enough to get Best Picture in Oscar or even in my opinion."
"BennyDeus","10","2","4","23 February 2011"," A Schizophrenic Dreamcape.
","Black Swan is schizophrenic dreamscape about one girls drive that causes descent to madness. Whether it reflect Kubrickian horror or the visceral style of Aronofsky, all points of direction are tight. Natalie Portman is best role of career and shreds each scene with unbalanced convinction. <br/><br/>Fighting and praying for the role of the white/black swan, an already troubled girl embarks of a nightmarish, hallucinogenic journey that ends in her own demise. The role that would make her is the role that kill her. <br/><br/>Every moment of this film makes one uncomfortable. From the clipping of her fingernails, to the bitch-slapped circular movements of the camera, to the inability to decipher reality from the imagined. This movie is open to interpretation and will quickly rise to be considered a new-aged modern horror classic.<br/><br/>10/10"
"dvc5159","7","2","4","21 February 2011"," Sublime. Sensual. Sinister. Superb.
","""Black Swan"" opens with Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) performing as the White Swan, as the triumphant orchestra bellows behind her while the camera rotates around her frantically, to capture her elegance and grace. Minutes later, she awakens from her dream. She goes to a ballet academy in New York City to try out for the play ""The Black Swan"", and hopefully win the lead part of the White Swan, but doing so also means that she will have to play the part of the Black Swan as well, the White Swan's evil twin.<br/><br/>Such is the case in the latest drama by Darren Aronofsky, fast becoming one of the most sought-after and talented filmmakers of modern times. The film's tale of sought-after perfection and its consequences is a plot that, honestly, has been tried one too many times by many films, most of them used as family-friendly plot-lines by mainstream studios. Aronofsky, however, bravely shows the stark consequences of this, and boldly shows the raw consequence of perfection to its brutal honesty. We ask ourselves, eventually, should we work hard for what we want, or should we only strive for what we need? And should we go down that hard road, is it too late to turn back?<br/><br/>With that, we come to our star, Natalie Portman, who delivers a tour-de-force performance, a career-making one as Nina. For an actress to play such a challenging role which requires a various cocktail of emotions, and for her to pull it off so brilliantly, it takes true, raw talent, and she commands every scene with her stark performance. It is a mesmerizing performance that will engage and floor those who see it.<br/><br/>Coming to the other actors, Vincent Cassel is terrifically slimy yet charming as the artistic director who seduces Nina to bring her darker side out. His aggressive and fierce persona gave a lot of power to his character who (un)intentionally took Nina to a downward spiral. Mila Kunis, gorgeous as ever, exhibits a wild, youthful charge as Lily, as she constantly ""challenges"" Nina she displays a sinister vibe to her character, and then back to being happy-go-lucky again. Barbara Hershey also strongly plays a character who shows hidden tendencies, and while not exaggerating it, Hershey underplays her character so well that it's near impossible to find out that she has issues concerning her daughter, at least during the first quarter of the film. Finally we have Winona Ryder, as Leroy's ex-lead Beth, disgruntled and angry at him for firing her and replacing her with Nina instead.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's usual crew returns here to work on the film, and they work wonders with what they have. Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin pen the screenplay with care and crafts a balanced and coherent tale. Using their script, the crew puts it to fantastic effect: Cinematographer Matthew Libatique captures the dancers by frenetically using his camera to follow the dancers from the backstage onto the stage itself, and then revolving around various dancers as they perform on the stage in order to thrust the audience directly into the action as an experience. Editor Andrew Weisblum paces the film accordingly without it being too fast or shot, and with some of the shots so perfectly placed together it makes the story better. Clint Mansell's music in the film is a brilliant piece of work. Production design and art direction utilizes full use of the State University of New York's Performing Arts Center at Purchase, from the ballerinas practicing to the main event during the film's exhilarating 20-minute finale.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is Aronofsky himself, who crafts the film with a detailed eye and a strong visual sense. He knows how to utilize Libatique's camera and use it to bring out the full effect of the scene he's shooting, be it from the simplest of static shots to the complex choreography of the ballerinas. His huge passion and dedication to the film can be seen through the actors, and not just particularly though Portman herself.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky continues to prove himself as a tour-de-force filmmaker who can make effective and engaging quality films, ever since his extremely depressing but superb magnum opus ""Requiem For A Dream"" a decade ago. With ""Black Swan"" he brought out the best in Natalie Portman, and continues his streak as one of the most brilliant directors working today. See this movie, and may the Academy reward Portman for her work. She deserves it. After graduating as a child star, and after a reasonably well career in between, Portman has grown into a beautiful young woman and a fantastic young actress, and this movie is the result of plenty of hard work over the years. Well done.<br/><br/>Without a doubt one of 2010's very best films.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 90/100"
"eonbluedan-1","9","2","4","1 February 2011"," My favourite Aronofsky to date
","It takes the terrestrial story of a ballerina desperate for the role of the Swan Queen in ""Swan Lake"", a part requiring her to dance both the white and black swan, and turns it into a psychosexual, brooding and horrific descent into a personal Hell. Aronofsky does clearly have a taste for the theme of a personal descent or journey; in some way or another the idea has been the subject of every film he has made so far. This could be a complaint about him being ""samey"", but he does it with such verve every time, each film so vivid and unique an experience on its own, it is impossible to moan.<br/><br/>Upon seeing ""Black Swan"" the first time through, I found myself rather numb; the film is so vivid, I knew what I had seen was good, but it was hard for me to discern whether I had actually enjoyed it. Having seen it twice now, I can confirm it is a masterpiece; it moved me far closer to tears on a few occasions the second time through, and is my personal favourite of Aronofsky's work so far.<br/><br/>What is fascinating about the film is that a lot of the ideas are long-held penchants of foreign art house and horror. Indeed, I take a rather sadistic pleasure, as a fan of the director, from the thought that a lot of people walking into the film, believing they are getting an average thriller, might be rather shocked by the unexpected elements. Once over the standard setup, the film rapidly takes you on a trip into a world of competition, obsession, self-harm, duality, sexuality, violence, psychosis and body-horror....oh, and overbearing mothers! We watch the whole thing through the eyes of Nina, played with ridiculous dedication and power by Natalie Portman, whilst the pressure of the role and obsession with being perfect ruins her mind, splits her personality, and drives her to ever-worsening degrees of paranoia. On the point of performances, I also give praise to the always-overlooked Vincent Cassel, whose acting I recognised, on second viewing, to be far more precise and thoughtful than I first gave credit for.<br/><br/>Anybody familiar with his previous efforts, ""Pi"" and ""Requiem For A Dream"", will already know how well Aronofsky can put the broken psyche on screen, and anyone who has seen ""The Fountain"" and ""The Wrestler"" will understand how ambitious, daring, and emotional a filmmaker he is. With ""Black Swan"" he manages to inject all of those elements into one piece of cinema; it is intense, emotional, dark, upsetting, intimate and beautiful, haunting and bold. The colour schemes, the staging of scenes, Clint Mansell's original score, the editing and sound; everything is so well-orchestrated, with nearly every scene being essay-worthy, that although not always hugely original in his techniques with this one, Aronofsky has made a film so startling, so hard to forget, it is impossible to not be in complete awe by the time the credits role"
"lewiskendell","9","2","4","28 January 2011"," Dark. Uncomfortable. Unrelenting. Amazing.
","""I felt it. Perfect. It was perfect.""<br/><br/>Some directors make movies that are ""experiences"". Darren Aronofsky is one of those directors. <br/><br/>Black Swan is a combination of the unbearable descent into hallucinatory madness featured in Requiem for a Dream, and the unflinching pain and physical drive to be one thing and one thing only, as seen in The Wrestler (and those just happen to be my two favorite Aronofsky movies). The marriage of those two elements is a fascinating movie that's frightening, uncomfortable, and tries its hardest to make it difficult for you to keep your eyes on the screen, even as you're riveted by what you see.<br/><br/>Portman is amazing. The camera is almost always tight on her, just as the pressure of her mother, her ballet director, and her rivals is always pressed oppressively close against her. This is not the story of a normal woman coming unraveled. Nina is frayed from the first moment we meet her, both physically and mentally.<br/><br/>I've never been a massive Portman fan, but I always thought that she was a nice enough actress. Here, she impresses with not only her ballet skills, but her ability to communicate fear, frustration,  obsession, and psychosis. <br/><br/>Mila Kunis puts in another solid performance in the string of good movies that's she's been in the last few years. She's simultaneously threatening and endearing. Vincent Cassel is suffocating and terrifying (from Nina's point of view, which is also our point of view) as the ballet director. Barbara Hershey is overbearing and disturbingly motherly, as Nina's mom, and puts perhaps the greatest burden of stress on Nina's shoulders.<br/><br/>Black Swan feels like an Aronofsky film, through and through. His fingerprints are all over it. His camera style, the way he brings the audience in and makes them feel a part of the character, and experience in a way what the character is experiencing. This is not a movie for everyone. It's horror, but a psychological kind of horror that puts us directly into the fractured, overwhelmed, frustrated mind of a person. <br/><br/>After only one viewing, Black Swan hasn't quite replaced The Wrestler as my favorite Aronofsky movie. But, it is clearly his most interesting film by far, as well as his most artistic and his most technically spectacular. <br/><br/>Black Swan crawled under my skin, and I can't wait to see it again."
"erin_osullivan","7","2","4","28 January 2011"," A very good film, but definite room for improvement.
","Half an hour ago I finished watching this movie and was left with the same feeling I had after watching Requiem for a Dream: pretentious director makes another pretentious film. However, now that I have thought about it and had time to analyse it in my head I can appreciate that this film was actually really good.<br/><br/>I find Aronofsky's films to be fairly pretentious and unbelievable. As a photography student, my teachers are always stressing how important it is when you're trying to produce a series or a single photo that you don't want to spell out the meaning behind your work and that you want the audience to do a bit of guesswork, and I think that is what Aronofsky has done in Black Swan. He didn't leave enough to the imagination. The part towards the end where Portman's arms are literally morphing into the wings of the black swan made me think 'well duh', I mean did he really have to put that in there? I just thought that Portman's portrayal of the evil swan was definitely enough for the audience to see that she was becoming that character. What I'm trying to say is that he made things too literal, this film was meant to be about Nina's obsession and her growing insanity, what is real and what isn't, and everything was being spelt out to the audience too literally in my opinion.<br/><br/>I also didn't think the way he went about making it a thriller was very UNoriginal, one minute she sees things the next she doesn't, a very overused horror film technique. I'm just glad that he didn't go and make Mila Kunis' character a figment of the imagination, then this movie would've got a 3/10 from me! Also the whole mixing up of reality, one minute she has killed Mila Kunis' character, the next she is alive was fairly stupid, and I was left feeling confused about whether the director wanted the audience to be as confused and messed up as Nina, or if we were meant to know what was going on. Some of the horror scenes (Winona Ryder's in particular) I felt were a bit ridiculous as well. The movie had potential to be stellar I just think the plot had quite a few flaws.<br/><br/>The pros: the acting was literally amazing, Portman and Kunis blew me away, although I have always thought that Portman is a fantastic actress. The build up of tension between them was fantastic, and both of them were really suited to the characters they portrayed. <br/><br/>The reason this film gets a higher rating for me is basically for the acting, if that had not been so good I probably would've given it a 5-6/10. It is definitely worth seeing the film, just don't set your standards too high based on all the rave reviews it is getting."
"dipesh-parmar","6","2","4","27 January 2011"," Black Swan is an interesting but flawed film.
","Natalie Portman plays a dancer, Nina Sayers, struggling to play the role of a lifetime as the Swan Queen and her evil twin in a new adaptation of the ballet Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Nina is perfectly cast as the Swan Queen, but not as her evil twin. Black Swan is a story about the fear of transformation, fear of her love for perfection, fear of her body, even the fear of her own mother.<br/><br/>The first of many transformations occurs with her supplanting the previous star, Beth Macintyre played by Winona Ryder, who has been cast aside by the New York ballet company. The company's director is Thomas Leroy, played by Vincent Cassel. He chooses Nina, but has already forewarned her that although she may be technically gifted she needs to consume herself in the darker, more sensual evil twin of the Swan Queen. Thomas instantly realises that although Nina is a beautiful woman, she is sexually naive. He asks her to find herself sexually, with him, herself or any way possible. He also instructs her to watch Lily, a free- spirited newcomer who would fit perfectly into the role of the evil twin.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a study of the psychological trauma of coping and adapting to change, of a woman growing up. Nina has a demanding mother, played by Barbara Hershey, who herself was a ballerina until she became pregnant and had to retire to bring up Nina. Nina becomes more anxious the further she goes into rehearsals, hallucinations and anxiety attacks worsen the more stressed she becomes not just from performances but from the continued overbearing interference from her mother.<br/><br/>Scenes are shot close-up, to heighten the sense of claustrophobia, whether in her mothers small apartment or when she is performing. The opening scene is a brilliantly shot close-up of the demands and dynamics of ballet. Throughout the whole film we are blessed with a stunning score from Tchaikovsky, used with great effect not just in the dance sequences but to underscore the changing tensions in Nina's transformation, especially near the end of the film.<br/><br/>I was full of apprehension before seeing Black Swan. I've seen all of Darren Aronofsky's films and much like Wes Anderson's films, I've always left feeling short-changed and wondering what all the fuss was with the director. Thankfully, there is much to admire and this is Aronofsky's best film. But i am still not convinced. There are just too many clichés in the plot; the jealous mother, the bitter deposed star ballerina, the lecherous director. Some of the scenes were laughable, such as 'that' scene with Nina and Lily. Barbara Hershey is excellent, suitably unhinged and psychotic in equal measure. Vincent Cassel was wasted as the Director, his part was too muddled and as fine an actor as he is, he looked every inch the stereotypical cartoon villain.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's character baffled me, this was a woman who's only desire was to dance but there was no genuine love for ballet, her drive seemed more of a compulsion. Perhaps, she is merely a vessel to act out her mothers dreams. Any warmth for Nina's craft was only ever realised at the end. Much like the film itself, Natalie Portman's performance was good but not as great as the critics are saying. She just wasn't as convincing in her part as Barbara Hershey was in hers as the mother, Portman's lack of range is quite evident. And yes i noticed it as well, Portman plays the part of 'Nina the Ballerina'! Come on Darren, what were you thinking!?<br/><br/>Aronofsky does make an interesting reference to art and obsession, is the obsessive drawn to art because of its relentless search for perfection, or does the artist become obsessive simply as a function of their 'profession'? He also highlights the age old question of whether art and perfection can exist without instinct, for me it doesn't but i am sure many would disagree. But I don't think Aronosfsky has said anything new in this film.<br/><br/>Once the credits appeared and i got up to leave the cinema, i noticed the majority of the audience were female. Perhaps women would appreciate this film more than men, perhaps? Black Swan is an interesting but flawed film."
"freemantle_uk","10","2","4","26 January 2011"," What happened to my sweet girl?
","Wow is the one word reaction I had to Black Swan, a truly dark and surreal tale about the world of ballet from Darren Aronofsky.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a talented young ballerina who get her technique down perfectly, but has a very meek personality. She has a controlling mother (Barbara Hershey) who does not allow her daughter to grow up, with Nina ending up having a young personality and there is a possible history of self-harm. Nina is up for the role of a life time, playing both the White Swan and the Black Swan in Swan Lake. The ballet director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) believes Nina is perfect to play the White Swan but too nice to play the Black Swan. Despite this Nina is cast in the role, but she has to explore her dark side, having an affair with Thomas, have dark images of herself following her and herself bleeding and worrying about another dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis) wanting to replace her.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is of course a skilled director and after playing it safe with The Wrestler took a risk again with this ambitious film. Black Swan is a really crazy film, many thinks are going off in this film and it was a schizophrenic experience. Aronofsky has shown with both The Wrestler and Black Swan that he can take something that is light entertainment and turn into something dark and seedy. Aronofsky is not afraid to look at the darker side of life and what it would take to be a ballerina, discipline, staying thin (by any means possible), having affairs, etc and Aronofsky is able to mix dark fantasy with real life. I personally love Aronofsky's use of hand-held camera, giving Black Swan a more intense feeling, using close up and it was great when the camera spins around the actors when their dance. It gives the audience the feeling of what it is like to dance and being in the studio. As the film become more surreal it reminded me of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, a film that become very confusing by the third act. A scene I really like is when Nina and Lily are in the club with a coloured strobe light, making the characters look like they pictures as they jerkily move when the light goes on and off. It is very much what it is like in a nightclub and the Chemical Brothers music was fitting.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is great. Of course Portman is a talented actress and it is likely that she will get the Oscar, Jennifer Lawrence will be considered too young by the academy. I like how her character was pretty much like a 13-year-old girl who still needs to grow and get out of her shell. Kunis shows that will the right direction she can be a good actress (she was much better then to her role in The Book of Eli). She was a strange, bad girl, smoking, drinking, taking drugs and acting almost like a femme fatal. The story and relationship between Nina and Lily could have worked if the characters were teenagers, Nina being a naïve young girl being led astray by a more experience girl. Hershey too was good as Nina's mother, a woman using her daughter to live out her dreams and treating her as a doll, dressing her and controlling her life. The relationship is almost like Norman Bates the early years. This follows a long running theme in Afonosky, dysfunctional relationships between a parent and their child, but this time Nina's mum does love her, but goes about it the wrong way. Cassel is effectively creepy as a man who seduces dancers, touches them inappropriately, yet silver tongued.<br/><br/>Clint Mansel is a great composer and he has worked with Aronofsky before. He gave Black Swan an incredible, booming score. He composes his own music with the music of Swan Lake to great affect and my God was it fantastic.<br/><br/>But I do have a problem with the film and that is why the filmmakers did not know which direction they wanted to go. They did not know where to focus it as a grounded tale of a girl going mad, living in her mother's shadow, as a dark horror of someone going through metamorphosis, a tale of a girl being followed by someone trying to take own her live or any of the other themes and ideas in the film. Black Swan needed more focus."

","I can't understand the hype of this movie and the flood of perfect reviews. It's mediocre, and it drops some absolute clangers. Some of the basic premises are flawed - like a seasoned ballerina could have got to her position, spent 5 years in a dance company, and been awarded a lead role without ever experiencing sex, drugs or passion. The Dance Director never seems to find his stride - he makes a poor decision for his lead and compounds it with lack of direction, seemingly hoping that Nina will find her ""black swan"" with nothing more than a grope and an instruction to masturbate. Their screen relationship suffers as a result. We could have seen a smoking chemistry between sadistic teacher (and they are all sadistic!) and prima ballerina who doesn't know if she's coming or going. We get some swearing and lots of rolling eyes.<br/><br/>Portman was hard to believe in the lead role, and I have to say that seeing what we did of her performance, I'd feel short changed if I had gone to see that production of Swan Lake! She lost a bit of weight and physically looked the role, but I never saw the passion for her art that drives real dancers. She was a parody of a ballerina.<br/><br/>That said, some of the performances are good (I thought the mother was excellent) and the camera work at times is very good. I particularly liked the subtlety of some of the special effects work, but it's marred by cheap shots and over the top direction at other times.<br/><br/>The field of Professional Ballet, and dance in general, is ripe for an expose of the grim realities of those who choose, or are forced, to suffer for their art. This film isn't that. It is an interesting film though, and I agree with a previous reviewer that it's best taken as high camp. With tongue in cheek, it's a pleasant way to spend 110 minutes."

","Black Swan is the story of Nina Sayars (Natalie Portman) a professional ballerina struggling to come of age when she fulfils her lifelong dream of landing the lead part of her company's latest production, Swan Lake. The thrill of this accomplishment is tarnished by the fact that she is unable to deal with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey), questionably ethical director (Vincent Cassel), taking over the throne of the former star lead (Winona Ryder) and competing with free spirited newcomer (Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky displays the story on the back of Portman's character that is originally plain and innocent, allowing the viewer to observe firsthand the pain and effort she endures to obtain the role, and the impressive skill of the performances that result. On top of this, the viewer experiences Nina's psychological breakdown, her bulimia, gross obsessions, paranoid hallucinations and out of body experiences. Kudos for Portman for learning the ballet moves, but I have seen her act better than this, the innocence and naivety was overplayed for a character who has survived a cutthroat dance company. <br/><br/>The movie has a pretty basic premise and therefore the build up doesn't take very long. The first two acts rely on the gratuity of Nina's obsessions and her quite unerotic exploration of her sexuality (Wild Things this ain't!). Apart from a few ""Am I crazy or not"" moments, the actual substance of the first two thirds of the movie is quite dry and ridiculous which is a bit disappointing. <br/><br/>However when all seems gone with this movie, it packs a real punch for the final act. Blending the breakdown of Nina's psychosis with her first on stage performance is brilliant and well worth the wait.<br/><br/>I left this film feeling that it was made for the ending and the blank first two acts were filled in on the way. It tries to shock you for entertainment with gross obsessions, but results in being gratuitous. And clothed-erotica is damn unsexy and ridiculous and insults the viewer. Unsure if it is worth the Oscar buzz, but who knows with the best quality movies coming out these days being CG cartoons."

","Did you ever wonder what Marilyn Monroe was thinking while she climbed nude out of the swimming pool for photographers, or Kurt Cobain when he wrote Smells Like Teen Spirit? What about when someone who goes off the rails, over the top and round the bend? What goes through people's minds when they beat out everyone for a coveted role and see the faces of the people they beat? How do you feel when you are experiencing something for the first time when you are afraid to feel it, when people around you are feeling things about you and for you and for themselves because of what is happening––and it's not all that balanced? The Black Swan is about things like that: the thoughts inside the head of the one facing the crowd, facing a world of expectations and need, and making art, desiring it and repulsed by it all at the same time. Nina Sayers is a young, ambitious and talented ballet dancer surrounded by people with needs. She is beautiful and delicate but can she play the sensuous and strong Black Swan? Thomas, the artistic director, needs a star to bring his company success. Erica, Nina's mother, needs someone to nurse and project her fantasies onto. The other dancers project their envy and dreams onto her. It's a lot to take for one so young, and maybe not so balanced. The genius of Aronofsky and the screenwriters is that they reveal these pressures and fantasies from inside the mind of Nina. Nina, the exquisite and amazing Natalie Portman, is our surrogate on this journey of darkness and light, and Aronofsky uses his camera to tell us so. Our emotions are her emotions. We open first with anxiety. A jittery camera follows closely behind Nina, wearing a ballet perfect bun and powder pink coat, as she hurries to the theater. On the way, she recognizes a new dancer, Lily, on the subway—a possible threat. She sweats as Thomas chooses who shall be considered for the new role of Swan Queen and who will not. The fine script builds the pressure on Nina. She unwittingly offers congratulations to a girl who won nothing. Nina, herself, is chosen. We feel the rush of cortisol and adrenaline when she realizes her mistake, and separation from her peers. She rejects her mother's sugary sweet celebration cake, the wrong thing for a nervous ballerina, and suffers guilt. Lily is wild and free and she is envious. Nina sees a dark female figure approach from the shadows, and is shocked to see or imagine that it is herself dressed in black with long, loose hair. Thomas comes on to her, or does he? Lily comes on to her, or does she? Her mother is a lunatic, or is she? Every shock, or fantasy, we experience is also Nina's. The Black Swan is about fantasies of power, lust and fame and the fears and nightmares that go with them. Change is never easy, especially great change. When Nina masturbates, she realizes to her great shock that there is no barrier between herself and her mother. Her mother is in the room! When we realize it, we are shocked by it, too. Waking up, she sees she is surrounded by teddy bears and music boxes when what is needed is black lace and red lipstick. These psychic and physical changes are messing with her head, our head, where there is no one else to talk to, only mirrors and fantasies and fears. The film climaxes on opening night. Nerves and fear lead her to a disastrous fall in the second act. In her dressing room, where she must change into the costume of The Black Swan, she has a final confrontation with her fears. She breaks her mirror and with a shard of it kills Lily, her understudy and competition. Then she dances and finally, magnificently transforms into the fierce and dangerous Black Swan. The camera tells us so as it glides smoothly, gracefully, capturing her strength and confidence. But, Nina didn't actually grow black swan wings and she didn't actually kill Lily. So, did she actually kill or injure herself? Maybe. Or is this Nina's unique mix of fear and fantasy pushing her to the heights to accomplish a great performance-and our realization of what it can take to make a work of art? We all have fantasies, but not everyone is an artist. Jared Loughner, Mark David Chapman and Squeaky Fromme had fantasies. Not everyone will go from ballet pink to The Black Swan, but for those who do, or want to, this is a movie for you. Aronofsky, Natalie, et al, take a bow. My final thought: Have you ever wondered what someone was thinking who went over the top and around the bend–and back again; what kind of movie they will make, what kind of book they will write, what dance they will dance? Once you've become The Black Swan and the Swan Queen, then what?!"

","Awe-inspiring is one way to put Aronofskys masterpiece of the sublime.<br/><br/>Making the actual Swan Lake storyline the scenario for the actual movie is a clever move, as life soon imitates art, for Nina.<br/><br/>She is a relatively isolated girl, living in a world of pink with her mentally ill mother. Desperate for the lead in Swan lake, she becomes obsessed with the story, and as the film unfolds, we learn that it has taken over her life and her rational thought.<br/><br/>She starts to hallucinate, and sees her friend/adversary Lily as her alter-ego, the black seductive swan to her innocent white swan.<br/><br/>This is shown many times throughout the film. Lily IS a real person, but the narrative makes you question this several times throughout the movie, when Nina begins to hallucinate scenarios that are not happening. aronofsky plays with the audiences subconscious throughout, many scenes involving Portman and Kunis have them sitting in a mirror image profile, as in Kunis is in a position as if she were Portmans reflection.<br/><br/>There is much emphasis on mirrors. nearly every shot includes one and the mirrors show the darkness that is waiting to over take Ninas life.<br/><br/>Many people who view this, may think they will get the 'twist' early on in the film. The truth is, there is no twist, the film is just showing Ninas psyche slowly breaking down, due to her living with her mother, and getting used to her erratic behaviour (which to her would be the norm, we see on many occasion that Portman is the oddball in the group, especially when Veronica comments 'why does she keep staring at me?).<br/><br/>The cinematography is exquisite, and some of the best i have seen, and the editing is perfect, along with choreography and the score.<br/><br/>The film focuses on loss of innocence and Cassels character could well be the Black Swan, trying to delve into Ninas past, and encouraging her not to be so....sheltered with her inhibitions.<br/><br/>All the cast are excellent, and this movie is one of the most perfect pieces of cinema i have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>See the film for it's beauty, and how society and trying to be the best at what you do can lead to your downfall."

","Another Oscar hopeful is Black swan, the visionary new film from the genius visionary storyteller himself, Darren Arronofsky. Like how Christopher Nolan is the only person who could've directed Inception, Darren Arronofsky is the only person who could've directed Black Swan. Both films are my favorites of the year.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, giving her best work today, is Nina, a veteran ballerina. Nina has a lot of problems. But they all mainly unfold when her new production of ""Swan lake"" arrives, and she is chosen as the Swan queen.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the plot, I don't dare spoil this terrific film for you. Black swan is flawless. The acting all around is terrific. This is the best cast i've seen since ""Crash"". The performances from everyone are just stupendous. Vincent Cassel is terrific as Nina's instructor, Mila Kunis is brilliant as Lily, the rival, Winona Ryder is briefly in it and is brilliant also, and as a comeback, Barbara Hershey is terrifying as Nina's mother.<br/><br/>The performance of a lifetime is given by Natalie Portman. This is the finest work i've seen all year. Portman gives the best performance of her career and of the year, in what I think is one of the best films of all time, and nearly the years best.<br/><br/>Black swan is dazzling when it comes to visuals. It's brilliant, trippy, scary, and you won't be able to go to the bathroom, or even take your eyes off of it. Once Black swan gets going, it never stops. It flashes with eroticism, and terrifying sequences.<br/><br/>But it's really much more than a horror film. It's sad to see Nina drastically fall apart. It's sad to see a woman so determined. That in the glorious climax, you can't help but root for her. Even if she is, well, a little deranged.<br/><br/>Black swan, as entertaining as it is, is a powerful film. Arronofsky has a real talent. He's been a film director for over a decade and it's about time the academy showed him the respect he deserves. Same thing with Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>Black swan is his finest work to date. I've enjoyed all of his works. I very much enjoyed Requiem for a dream, everybody hated The Fountain, but I went for it, The Wrestler, at the time, was one of my favorite movies. But, do to the arrival of Black swan, it has been knocked off. But it still has a place in my heart.<br/><br/>If Portman doesn't win the Oscar, the academy needs Inception performed. Inception is my favorite film of the year, and one of my favorite films. Black swan is my second favorite of the year, and also one of my favorites. Arronofsky and Nolan both have won me over again.

","While from a distance ballet may look like it is filled with elegance and grace, in reality ballerinas must possess incredible strength, flexibility and unwavering dedication if they wish to succeed in such a physically demanding profession. It is therefore not so surprising that the latest film from director Darren Aronofsky focuses on a New York ballet company and their performance of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. From washed up wrestlers to reclusive mathematicians, Spanish conquistadors and Coney Island drug addicts, all of Aronofsky's films – π, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain and The Wrestler – have been centered around characters who become dangerously, singularly obsessed. In Black Swan, the character is Nina, a shy, timorous young dancer played magnificently by Natalie Portman. Her fixation? The leading role of The Swan Queen. Filled with nightmarish intensity, gripping melodrama, steamy eroticism and occasional camp, Black Swan is a captivating tale of a woman consumed by her quest for perfection, and a visceral cinematic experience from one of the true visionary directors of today.<br/><br/>Swan Lake, the story of a princess transformed by an evil sorcerer into a beautiful white swan, is one of the most famed ballets in history. It's most interesting aspect is that its lead ballerina is required to dance two parts; the graceful white swan, as well as the sultry black swan, the seductress who steals the white swans love. For Nina, the role represents her shot at stardom, as well as the chance to finally prove herself to her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey), a woman whose overbearing personality has trapped Nina is a state of perpetual childhood. Nina's innocence however, is soon to be shattered. Forced to contend with the jealousy of her fellow dancers, the sexual advances of the company's lecherous director (Vincent Cassel) and the enormous pressures of perfecting her technique, Nina grasp on reality begins to slip. Haunted by terrifying hallucinations, her paranoia is given form in the appearance of Lily, a beautiful and uninhibited new dancer who represents everything the obsessive, sexually repressed Nina is not.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman has always been a solid performer, but her work in Black Swan is indisputably a career best. The feelings of fear and pain that Nina experiences – both mental and physical – are palpable in this all-encompassing performance, one that demands of Portman both the utmost emotional expression and a physicality every bit as straining as Mickey Rourke's in Aronofksy's previous film, The Wrestler. Once again, this masterful pulls back the curtain to reveal the hidden agonies of performance as entertainment; in Black Swan, ballet is portrayed not as art but as near torture, the excruciating physical feats Nina attempts depicted with a sickening, gut-wrenching realism. The emotional abuse Nina suffers at the hands of her coworkers, director and psychopathic mother is similarly horrifying, so much so that even at the beginning of the film, her psychosis is already beginning to peek through. Portman's transformation, through fear and madness, from the quiet and dainty dancer Nina was – her mother's ""sweet girl"" – to the furious, powerful, sexually eruptive creature she becomes by the films end, is utterly enthralling to behold.<br/><br/>The technical prowess Aronofsky displays in this film is quite simply incredible. The use of stark digital cinematography irritated me at first, but as the film progressed I soon reevaluated my initial impressions. This is a gritty, claustrophobic film, and the inelegant visual aesthetic is an essential part of the movies tone, be it in its portrayal of dance, sex or paranoid dreams. As Nina's mind begins to descent further into madness, her disturbing hallucinations, full of images of self-harm, bodily transformation and erotic decadence, all feel graphically, often frighteningly real. The film's production design is also terrific; a single look at Nina's bedroom tells you everything you need to know about her character and home environment. Likewise, in almost every scene a mirror is present, reflecting the dual nature of Nina's role and personality, both of which threaten to destroy her. These and other motifs did strike me as a tad obvious, but ultimately Black Swan is less concerned with avoiding clichés as it is with the establishment of a dark and thrilling atmosphere; in this regard, it is almost perfect.<br/><br/>Speaking of atmosphere, the use of sound in Black Swan is absolutely astounding. Clint Mansell has scored every one of Aronofsky's films, and between Requiem for the Dream and The Fountain has crafted some of the best and most iconic film music of all time. Compared to his work on those films, the Black Swan score is far less bombastic; instead, Mansell reinforces moments of fear, triumph, eroticism and despair with precise classical pieces, often incorporating themes from Tchaikovsky's magnificent ballet into his own original tracks. Indeed, by the films frantic and operatic end, it is impossible to tell where Mansell's work ends and Tchaikovsky's begins – the main theme from Swan Lake is used to spectacular effect in the movies climax. Even better than the score however is the film's incredibly evocative sound design. Aronofsky incorporates the noises of cracking bones, heavy breathing, rustling feathers and shattering glass to create an air of constant unease and occasional terror; the subsequent blend of music, sound and striking visuals is heady and intoxicating.<br/><br/>In the hands of lesser talent, Black Swan could easily have been a total mess. There are elements within this script, and even within some of the performances (most notably Barbara Hershey's), that would have fitted easily into a day time soap opera or cheesy eighties horror film. Instead, under the technical precession of Darren Aronofsky, and lead by a flooring performance from Natalie Portman, this film is a near masterpiece, one that draws you in with its dark sensuality and twisted, uncontainable energy. This is ferocious psychological filmmaking at its finest."

","Darren Aronofsky's films have remained among my favorites since I first saw ""Pi"" at the 1998 American Film Market, after its much-lauded success at the Sundance Film Festival the same year. What Mr. Aronofsky winds us into with ""Black Swan"" is a darkly-mirrored glimpse not only into the world of ballet, but the world of the artist in general. While extreme and demented, Nina's perceptions and experiences, both real and imagined, help the viewer to recognize and understand the triumphs and sacrifices involved in the pursuit of one's creative dignity and self-expression, at moments, at the cost of one's family, health and well-being-- even oneself. Perfection, or its striving, like all other endeavors, comes at a price. One must transform. Merci, Mr. Aronofsky, you've provided us with a legacy devoted to passion, creation and destruction, and the relationship for us with all of these. Were it not for virtues, we would be lost."

","Disturbing story of a ballerina who wins the role of Queen of the Swans in the New York production of Swan Lake scored by Tchaikovsky. The role requires the prima ballerina to embody polar opposite personalities. The white is pure and virginal; the black swan is dark and a seductress.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays the dancer who must undergo the theatrical metamorphosis. The dancer so assimilates the character that she undergoes a personal metamorphosis with tragic consequences.<br/><br/>I have been smitten by her work ever since she played the child who lived with the hit man in The Professionals. I have thought that that performance was so perfect that she might not ever reach a similar level of excellence again in her career. She was stunning in Closer where she was on the same stage with Julia Roberts, Clive Owen and Jude Law. She stole that film from some of our finest actors. The film itself was not as fine as Black Swan.<br/><br/>The Black Swan is great because Ms. Portman was great in it. The film is quite disturbing and dark. Ms. Portman is entirely convincing as a ballerina; her features and physique are flawless. Her classic beauty, her youth and innocent demeanor are a natural for the white swan. The difficult transition, for the dancer, is to become the dark twin. This transition is painful for her, and it is the subject of the film. The film has a Kafkaesque quality as she begins to literally grow black feathers.<br/><br/>The Black Swan is one of the great performances by an actress ever in film.

","A ballerina (Natalie Portman) finally gets the big break in Swan Lake as the swan queen. But she starts having mental breaks where her personality shifts more from the white swan to the black swan.<br/><br/>The way this film has been hyped as an Oscar film is unfortunate. I just do not see that level of power here. Natalie Portman (playing Nina Sayers) is deserved of a best actress nomination and probably a win, and deserves one for her devotion to the role and the injuries she took during training and filming.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder absolutely deserves a supporting actress nomination for her role as Beth Macintyre, and perhaps even the win. Ryder had her glory days in the early and mid-1990s, but I do not think she was ever taken seriously as an actress. While her part in this film is small, I think it is her best work to date.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis plays Lily the understudy. I have a personal love of Kunis, and think she is gorgeous. How strong her acting is, I do not know, and I hate to say it, but she may have been the weak point of the entire film and one of the reasons I cannot see giving it a ""best picture"" nomination. How she is getting supporting actress nominations from various organizations is beyond me.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky has a respectable career, starting with such critical successes as ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"". Both of these films I feel is better than ""Black Swan"". Some people love ""The Fountain"" while others find it pretentious. I lean more towards the latter. And even here, with ""Swan"", I think he borders on the pretentious. There is a fine line between making art and making high-minded bull, and this film teeters on that line.<br/><br/>Although I do not think it is as great as some see it, at least I do not hold some sort of intestinal hatred for it like Steve Erickson, the critic for ""Gay City"", does. He says the film has ""over-the-top combinations of bombastic music, shakycam, and quick editing"" with ""all the soul of a Skinemax exercise"". He finds the film ""not very enjoyable to watch"", in part because ""Aronofsky has no gift for eroticism"" and ""seems to see sex as a necessary but degrading part of human experience."" Erickson is quite wrong, but this becomes obvious the moment he admits that he finds ""Requiem"" to be ""irritating"" and never saw it all the way through. What sort of critic can judge a director whose works he has no stomach for?<br/><br/>If you do not see this film, I do not think you are missing out. However, it has some strong points and anyone who is a fan of Aronofsky really needs to check this out. That, or if you want to see an emaciated Portman being a sexual creature... but if that is all you watch it for, you are missing the point."

","The film, Black Swan directed by Darren Aronofsky follows the life of the character, Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). At first Nina is depicted as a woman who is very fragile as well as reluctant to believe in herself. Nina is a ballerina who wins the lead role in the production of Swan Lake. But as the film progresses, she losses her mind and slowly evolves into the evil twin sister of the white swan, the black swan. A character such as Nina would not be complete without her fair share of flaws. There is quite an extensive list. Having a mother such as Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey), it is assumed that Nina was forced into becoming a ballerina at a young age. Erica was not able to have her moment to shine as a ballerina so she is living out her dreams through her daughter. Given this fact, it is not surprising that Nina has obsessive compulsive disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, an innate desire to mutilate herself, and split personality disorder.<br/><br/>Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the role of the white swan perfectly, but the new dancer as well as the competition in the New York dancing troupe Lily (Mila Kunis) embodies the black swan's persona. As the film progresses, these two commence their bitter rivalry as well as a warped friendship.<br/><br/>The further the training for the production continues, the further Nina sinks into madness. She starts having these delusions in which she envisions herself in these situations where she would not normally treed. Whether it from embracing her sexuality when she has the delusion of her and lily making love or when she kills of f her white swan persona to pave the way for her black swan counterpart these methods of characterization are just one of the elements pertinent to this film. However, symbolism, acting, soundtrack, and theme play a large role as well. As mentioned before, theme is one of the key elements that attribute to this film's success.<br/><br/>There are many themes present throughout this film; however, the theme that I would like to center my attention towards would be the one of duality. For being a film that pays homage to the story of Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I found that this theme was the most important.<br/><br/>Instead of having the option to consume a strange elixir, Nina has to choice to succumb to her dark desires. Even though she perceives herself as this embodiment of perfection, sub –conscience desires something more. When Nina is not picked right away for the role of the white swan, she confronts the director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) to plead her case. Once she does this, Thomas forces himself on Nina. When this transpires, her sub-conscience breaks through and bites Thomas lip. By doing this act Thomas reconsiders his decision and picks Nina as the lead. Later on in the film, when the production of Swan Lake is playing, Nina most act fast for her moment to shine as the black swan is arriving shortly. AS she is overcome with anxiety and fear she has a delusion of her stabbing Lily for fear that she may take her place as the alternate. Right before Nina does this though, Lily's says that Nina should take a break and that it is her turn. Once she does this, Nina's eyes turn bloodshot and she stabs Kunis while exclaiming, ""No, it's my turn!"" Once this whole sequence of events transpires, Nina goes out and performs here role as the black swan; however this time she does not miss a beat. Right before she goes onto the stage her transformation into the black swan starts to progress further. Wings and weather begin to protrude out of her body. Towards the end of her dance as the black swan she completely losses herself to her evil counterpart and rushes over to the side of the stage and gives Thomas a passionate kiss.<br/><br/>After this, she goes back into her dressing room to prepare herself to go onto stage as the black swan. Concerned about the body of Lily she goes and checks on it and is shocked to find that it is nowhere to be found. She sits back down and realizes that what she stabbed was not Kunis but rather herself. Overcome with emotion, Portman begins to cry. But she comes to the realization that the show must go on, she must complete her performance. The story of Swan Lake ends with the white swan committing suicide so one can only surmise what is going to happen next. With tears running down Nina's face and a fatal wound slowly taking her life away, Portman jumps of the ledge and plunges to her death with the a rain of applause following her. Thomas then rushes to her side ignorant of the fact that Nina is slowly dying and exclaims, ""You were perfect!"" Overcome with relief Nina whispers, ""I faked itI was perfect..."" After these last words, Portman looks up to the stage lights and drifts off to her death."

News flash: If you want to be prima ballerina or the next Picasso or Concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra or President of the United States or any other position of prestige, then you have no life outside of striving for the unattainable perfection required to achieve that goal.<br/><br/>There are no friends. There are no video games. There is no gardening, or reading for pleasure, or dating, or Saturday afternoon relaxing at Starbucks. In fact, there is no watching of movies like Black Swan. There is only rehearsal and improving your craft. And that life can destroy pretty much anyone. Which is the entire point of this film. Too bad you missed it."

Director Darren Aronofsky, no stranger to plumbing such depths, brings his usual grim, unflinching perspective to the scene. It's a good thematic marriage. Aronofsky's work is almost always oppressive and exhausting, which is why it took me ten years to get around to watching this one.

","Take a philosophical idea of the film ""Black Swan""<br/><br/>Azad Jafari<br/><br/>The confrontation of good and evil, one of the most important issues of philosophy and thought, whether as absolute or as mixed (eg, ethics) - which has long attracted the attention of thinkers and theorists, and everyone according to their understanding of its sphere of human existence Paid. The movie ""Black Swan"" director Darren Aronofsky one of the films nominated for the Academy in 2010 was the argument that in view of the special issue of the categories of intellectual and moral philosophy. But ""Black Swan"" is really a film about the conflict between good and evil?<br/><br/>So we must first clear definition of good and evil on which to judge the content of the film's look. Certainly in this article, a venue to discuss all that has been said on this subject in the history of philosophy even be quite brief and unavoidably short and after a particular conception that is more fundamental and more authentic. With the exception of determinism, all agree on the principle that man is essentially autonomous, and therefore his action is preferable to operate freely and autonomous compulsory and imitate him. What a man thinks and if the other person does not. Man is the only creature that has a so-called time, Because it can build the future and the next day. The reason for this is the future of both the authority and discretion, the effect force human beings to utilize longer. The next day like today like yesterday and today he is human, not coming because yesterday and today and the next day one. He is just like all the other vegetable and animal organisms. Like a pine tree or branch wheat. Like bees to a lifestyle that is millions of years, and have historically inevitable algebra parent. Other creatures of their time but they are inscribed in the earth. But when the man except for his own time because he thinks and chooses and why that define the sound of the distinguishing characteristics of the animal he believed. Angels are timeless because they lack the authority and if your good you have not picked well.<br/><br/>Now back to the main theme of the movie ""Black Swan"" and the first question is whether the subject of the film is the conflict between good and evil? Fortunately our videos to rule on this matter closed and they can cite clear evidence that it did any good in there, and said that he is opposed to evil. The film ""Black Swan"" is opposed to evil with evil! But look at the film ""Black Swan"", real good as black and white as the real evil.<br/><br/>Good or white in Aronofsky film is being Angel. The moral act without any choice, choice, and freedom. In contrast, black or evil is the human being. That is His will, and will complete, immoral act out. The film ""Black Swan"" is a film in praise of evil (because evil is necessarily arbitrary and based on freedom knows) and condemning No Natalie Portman played Nina, a person is innocent despite the desire to sin, but not because they themselves are kept clean, but because they do not sin willingly to the wishes of its drive to prevent it. His little girl's eyes and ears closed as a result of his strict upbringing if he can not be guilty. Is this ignorance, and this transformation unfolds in the film, as whiteness is really good? And whether it is freedom, self-aware, and it is going to happen to him in the search results black swan is really evil? In the film Black Swan, changed the word good times instead of good and evil, negative and positive word evil. But what's the problem? Do you truly not right with Darren Aronofsky?<br/><br/>Immanuel Kant's ""Critique of Practical Reason"" wrote: ""Knowledge to give"" voluntary ""Will the law, with restrictions that the only reason we inevitably imposes on all desires, the same respect for the law. Obviously, the law requires and implies that respect, but not a moral law (because nothing else can exert any direct influence on the will of all tendencies to stop). The action according to the law and the terms of any origin tend Apr rejection, ostracized objective practical terms, ""task"" is read. ""(Critique of Practical Reason, Immanuel Kant, the translation of mercy, God willing, page 135)<br/><br/>The words ""will"" and ""duty"" are emphasized in this expression is directly related to the arbitrary will of the moral duty and it is integral. However, in the film ""Black Swan"" We no longer see the good will and without the knowledge and authority and against the evils we see a direct relationship with the ""optional determination to give awareness to the law"" is. But the moral law is not the law but the law is immorality.<br/><br/>So it must be said in the movie ""Black Swan"" comparison is not a fair comparison between good and evil because evil weighs heavily on the available platform built on the platform whether it is empty. Suggests that this comparison is unfair, incorrect result will follow. What this erroneous result, deliberately and with the intention to be the creators of what is unconsciously and unintentionally. In any case, ""Black Swan"" suggests leaving one evil for evil other. There is no good here."

","Nina Sayers is a tragic heroine through and through. And by that I mean that besides that she possess a flaw that leads to her downfall, which she must accept with honour, we, the audience, shouldn't expect to be surprised by the ending; it's often kinda predictable. With that being said, we must know that Aronofsky's task is that of filling the movie with a sense of dread and macabre atmosphere in order to forebode the tragic ending, while pushing the envelope as much as he can in order to make everything seem original, and hence unexpected.<br/><br/>The first thing is actually what Darren Aronofsky excels at. And in Black Swan, Aronofsky created a nightmarish surrealistic ambiance; using some of the most effective, if not the most violent, graphic gory images he ever used in his movies, and utilizing the sound almost as perfect as he did in Requiem for a Dream, only this time not just to disturb, but also to scare and daunt. In doing so, Aronofsky went far beyond foreshadowing Nina's dreadful inevitable downfall, making us feel Nina's pain as if we became her; Aronofsky made my feathery skin crawls!<br/><br/>Alas, Black Swan's visual imagery sadly lacks creativity. Most of the symbolic imagery I felt that they are quite familiar, and that I had seen many times before. That said, the visceral and bold direction of Aronofsky made up for that with genuine intensity.<br/><br/>The vague and mysterious nature of the characters and their actions adds up to the uniqueness of the movie, especially as they don't tarnish the drama, nor reject the logic for the sake of surrealism. I enjoyed interpreting the characters' motives, actions, and even purposes and roles in the story. The way they are represented can feel a bit messy sometimes, though. I think that what made me believe that the movie is a bit convoluted for its own good, and that Aronofsky tried too hard to give us as many reasons as he could to persuade us that Nina deserves her tragic fate while Nina's ""hamartia"" is crystal clear from hundred miles away in a most play-like way.<br/><br/>The performances are all truly outstanding. As for Natalie Portman, she delivered what is indisputably her fantastic career's best performance; she was simply Perfect!<br/><br/>(8.5/10)"

The big scenes spin too frequently into hysteria to be effectively chilling, for me. It's hardly subtle, but it does work well if high-camp and grandiosity is what you're after.<br/><br/>What it does do is confirm that Aronofsky is always willing to take risks and do interesting things with the projects he chooses to make.

","When you watch a movie like the Black swan writing something about the movie is an impulse, a requirement but most of all a medicine. You have to get rid of the feeling that nefarious, black winds of madness are suffocating you; the graphically presented notion that perfection is something formidable and lethal exactly because it applies to the non-human, to the godlike. That's why trying to embrace it by denying your originality, your fragile and yet uniquely powerful human nature turns you into a dark reflection of your fantasy and ambition. <br/><br/>But the reason why the movie is a masterpiece is that, apart from being elevated by glorious performances and ingenious directing, it is based on an imaginatively conceived irony; the subtle, graceful and elegant swan transforms into a battlefield where the black and white facets of human nature fight in a sick way and where there is no place to hide, to protect because nothing is innocuous ; the white side, which is expected to denote purity and innocence, represents repressed feelings, no self-esteem and the mechanization of a person. Consequently, the black side is only a climax where the madness of white is combined with dark impulses and all-consuming fear leading to death, which in a pathetic way resembles salvation and dramatic completion of one's personality. Anyone with a preference for well-made movies regarding serious and challenging topics will benefit from this experience as it definitely deviates from our common perception of psychological thrillers."

","I will admit up front that I am no fan of ballet and failed to appreciate the pains that Natalie Portman endured to become a convincing dancer for this role. But it didn't matter. She absolutely earned her best actress award through conveying three metaphors behind the wrapper of a ballerina's quest for perfection:<br/><br/>1. Perfection requires balance. You cannot appreciate the beauty in light without darkness. There is no sunrise without sunset, no day without night, no good without evil. Nina's struggle to understand this was the focus of her conflict with Thomas.<br/><br/>2. Personal growth happens when you expand beyond your comfort zone. Nina had mastered the white swan because the role was so consistent with her daily life; continuing to practice it was a waste of time. Only when Lily inspires her to pursue the black swan does she unlock the path to perfection.<br/><br/>3. Once you've stretched outside your comfort zone you can never go back. Personal growth changes you forever. Nina, in her quest for perfection, loses her innocence forever.<br/><br/>Yes, perhaps the story could remain powerful without the gratuitous gore that hurled a dark drama into the horror genre. But this film is worth watching just to see Natalie Portman shatter all the boundaries of her acting career up to that point. A powerful performance, particularly memorable in the final scenes in which she successfully transforms into the black swan."

Rather than becoming frustrating, this instead becomes a gripping look into the damaged psyche of the perfectionist protagonist.

","I really enjoyed this movie it is the first of Aromofsky's films that I have seen and it was near perfect. The score and cinematography is perfect using many tracking shots. I really liked the sparing use of color since most of this movie is black and white. The one gripe I have with this film is Natalie Portman's preformance which is just all right up until about the last twenty minutes where she really starts to come into her own I did really like a lot of the preformances surrounding hers such as Winona Rider, Vincent Cassel, Barabara Hershey and Kseina Solo. My belief in the transformation of Nina Sayers from innocence to insanity is still beleivavle to me despite Portman's preformance because of the amazing diecting and visuals. All in all Black Swan is a thrill that I would recomend to anyone looking for something different."

","""Black Swan"" is a brilliant combination of Darren Aronofsky's gift for psychological thriller and influences from ""The Red Shoes"" and ""Perfect Blue."" These combined with prestige editing, breathtaking cinematography, and haunting direction make for an unforgettable and strongly rewatchable psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Nina, played wonderfully by Natalie Portman is a gifted ballerina who lands the role of the Black Swan in a take on Swan lake directed by a tough and driven director and coach. As her work in the role progresses, she gradually embraces the role of Black Swan and simultaneously begins to see the darker and more dangerous side to herself. The viewer, along with the character, goes insane and loses their grasp on reality and what's imaginary. <br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest strength ""Black Swan"" has going for it is its ability display a variety of meanings within its scenes. It's not uncommon to divulge different meanings and interpretations from different viewers and that makes it fun to discuss and re-watch. From the beginning inferences to the ending's climax, I pull different interpretations from that of friends I have. <br/><br/>The film beautifully blends its tones and has wonderfully smooth pacing throughout. No wonder ""Black Swan"" was nominated for best film editing. Not for one moment was I bored or anxious. Instead, I found myself riveted from beginning to end. <br/><br/>If I have any negative criticism for ""Black Swan"" it would be length and duration. It's quite rare for me to want a larger run time but as the film ended, I thought to myself, ""Not only do I want more, but I think more would have taken the film to greater heights."" In several scenes in Act I and II, further development of where Nina comes from and her relationships with other dancers could've have better impacted some already solid payoff in Act III. <br/><br/>Criticism aside, this is an incredible piece and my personal favorite Darren Aronofsky film. It's riveting, beautiful, and haunting with something profound to say."

","I also watched this movie when I was in a low mood period and this is one of my most favorite movies! I even want to have a black swan tattoo on my body!
Sometimes, people show affection on things or people are alike themselves. Back then, I feel Nina is like me. She wants to be a perfect dancer and meanwhile she is too fragile to handle some situations so she feels painful and questions herself all the time. The outside and inside both make her feel unsafe so she is trying hard to get rid of it and the chains from her mother.
This is a sad story but I think it has a perfect ending. All her emotions are being poured out and she let dream come true.
I love her evil and satisfying smile when she turns to black swan!
I also love the music when Nina having sex with Lily. The tattoo on Lily's back makes her look like flying! That's awesome!

","This film definitely kept my attention. The score of course, was lush and beautiful. The visuals did the audibles justice. Beyond that ... (SPOILERS coming. ... I guess) ... I am not sure what happened during this film. There were rivals for the coveted starring role in one of the classical ballet's most renowned works. Our hero, catches a once in a lifetime break and is in the position to take that role. She competes with the remaining rivals, performs the role, and either kills her rival or commits suicide. Or maybe she never got the chance because the woman ahead of her... It's all quite fuzzy.<br/><br/>Of course her Mom (really her only support system, near as we can tell, at the beginning of the film) is living vicariously thru her, having sacrificed everything so Nina (the protagonist) could get this role. None of this sounded too ground-breaking to me either, right?<br/><br/>I think the attempt was to make this a film about artists living out the story line of the very story they are trying to tell artistically, like Carlos Saura's ""Carmen"" for example. Unfortunately for the makers of this film, the plot for a ballet need not be as descriptive as that for an Opera, and this film reflects that.<br/><br/>Also, I've seen Natalie Portman & Barbara Hershey do much better work in other films, while Mila Kunis, IMHO, should definitely keep this one (deservedly) on her highlights real.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me (I love dance: from classical to hip-hop but am not very educated about it) but ... Nina (Natalie Portman)'s movement seemed ... ungraceful & amateurish to me. That surprised me, but maybe that's what good ballet looks like shot so intimately and up-close."
"classicsoncall","8","0","0","9 October 2017"," ""Ready to be thrown to the wolves?""
","Knowing only that this movie was about an aspiring ballerina vying for a role in ""Swan Lake"", I wasn't prepared for a largely dark tale about said ballerina's severe issues with inferiority and the self mutilation that came from the challenge of competition. That theme was further reinforced by the dancer she replaced, Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder), who virtually committed suicide, even if she didn't die walking out into the middle of city traffic. What a mess these people were. At virtually all times, the picture is an intense psychological thriller that eventually descends into horror when Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) succumbs to her delusions and her mind begins to slip away under the stress of performing. That she quite literally becomes the Black Swan of the title by committing suicide to achieve her career zenith makes for a stunning finale, and the cheers of the crowd may have just as well heralded Portman's Oscar Win for Best Actress among a respectable field at the 2011 Awards. For potential viewers, be aware of more than a share of shocking scenes, with one in particular approaching, if not actually achieving, a level of undisguised pornography."

","There are only about a dozen of films I vainly hope to watch again for that unmistakable first time. This is one of that superb dozen, but much less comparable.<br/><br/>It's probably needless to say, but Natalie Portman is exemplary in her lead role and is largely why Darren Aronofsky's film is so wonderful. Despite her character initially being a clear archetype, Portman did excellent with portraying her character's inner turmoil and self- doubt that distinguishes her role magnificently. That's the word to best encapsulate this story, but I haven't even touched on Aronofsky's exciting director's eye.<br/><br/>So Aronofsky's imprint on this film is *almost* equally compelling, which isn't meant to downplay the value or importance of competent directing. It really shouldn't be that great of a surprise to most moviegoers though that Aronofsky's films dwell on some usually engrossing noir and -- especially in this film's case -- thinly disguised animosity which engulfs the protagonist's world. It's all to the betterment of the protagonist and storyline though, so don't expect it to disrupt the theme or narrative drive. <br/><br/>Also, the vastly demented mother character in this movie may actually come to surprise you by the end, so don't dismiss her as a half-developed antagonist. It's more influential than that.<br/><br/>If there's anyone still in doubt if a movie centering around a ballet dancer can be at all likable, Natalie Portman and Darren Aronofsky are the two primary, terrific contributors who'll illustrate why such an attribute may be strongly undervalued in movies today. I try to watch this twice or three times a year to fully enjoy it, but first-time viewers: I can't implore you enough to give Black Swan an honest viewing."

The plot is good, directing is good, the narration and story line are a bit weak.<br/><br/>***spoiler***<br/><br/>The main character interpreted by Natalie has hallucinations, her obsession to be perfect for an IMPERFECT ROLE killed her by herself. That's the spirit of the movie. The message is that goodness doesn't match technical perfection. The goodness or evilness are independent from perfection. So the character obsessed to play the perfection about the other evil role decides to kill the good part of her killing herself because of the fear to be not able to play the bad role. The fear she feels, generates hallucinations where both environment and people can represent menaces to her aim although the real enemy is herself.... so killing her opponent she kills herself.

"Gideon24","6","0","0","10 April 2015"," Imaginative premise with too many plot holes
","Natalie Portman finally won a long overdue Oscar for her performance in Black Swan, a 2010 psychological drama set against the world of ballet about a dancer who is cast in the role of the Swan Queen in Swan Lake, despite the fact that the director has doubts about her ability to pull of the Black Swan, but then the Black Swan starts to dominate her personality to the point of actually losing her mind.<br/><br/>Screenwriters Mark Heyman and Andres Heinz have come up with a strikingly original idea; however, there are plot holes you can drive a truck through, gaps in logic and continuity, and the story takes WAY too long to get where it's supposedly going. For instance, it appears that the black swan starts appearing initially when Portman's Nina Sayers starts seeing her doppelganger everywhere she goes, but this starts happening even before Nina gets the role. It's also revealed early on that Nina has an issue with self-mutilation, but it's difficult to tell which mutilation is real and which is going on in Nina's mind. <br/><br/>There are even simpler problems that I had a hard time getting past. Nina is observed actually going to the director of the company and asking him for the role of the Swan Queen and then has the nerve to be shocked and offended when the man comes on to her. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, this is one thing in the film that does ring true, the director of the company, Thomas, brilliantly played by Vincent Cassell. Cassell and Aronofsky perfectly capture the ego of the ballet choreographer, his God complex and a somewhat stereotyped method of using sexual analogies to get what he wants from his dancers onstage and then putting them to practice offstage. Love the scene where the director and Nina are rehearsing a scene with the black swan and he actually starts kissing and fondling Nina and then abruptly stops and explains to her that he just seduced her but in this scene she should be seducing him...this scene is brilliantly acted and directed.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis turns in the performance of her career as Lily, the personification of the Black Swan whose manipulation of Nina leads to one of the most erotic sex scenes I have ever seen between two women, again, brilliantly directed by Aronofsky.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is already a proved commodity as a director with The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream under his belt, I just wish he had a better screenplay to work with.<br/><br/>Portman works hard to make Nina believable and I'm OK with her Oscar win, though I think Portman has done better work. Mention should also be made of Winona Ryder, surprisingly explosive as the diva that Nina replaced and Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother, even though Hershey's apparent plastic surgery was a bit distracting. The film is an interesting idea that almost works, thanks to the artistry of Aronofsky and Portman."

","I guarantee, at least twice during the movie you will find yourself screaming the line in the title of this review. Oddly enough, it perfectly sums up the effect the movie had on me.<br/><br/>The movie is powerful, without a doubt. It is very effective in unsettling ways. At times it will make you cringe & squirm, and at times it will challenge you like a good murder mystery. Like all Aranofsky films I've seen, it will warp your perspective and take you to an unreal, shadowy world where nothing seems quite right.

But if you read between the lines and consider unspoken issues of mental illness, personality disorder, anorexia, bulimia, incest, child abuse, etc, then the film is great. If you haven't guessed, it takes you to some dark places.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is a shadowy, perverse thriller that reminds me of the works of David Lynch (Mulholland Drive, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet) except that director Aranofsky has a more lucid approach than Lynch has, in my opinion. Aranofsky's films seem more deliberate and mathematical, whereas Lynch is more arbitrary and sometimes just plain weird.<br/><br/>My only real criticism of ""Black Swan"" is that certain things occur that are so far-fetched it may be hard to swallow. But if you accept this as a mindbending dark fantasy, I guess anything goes. To properly enjoy this film you can't be too critical of small details. Instead you should just go along for the ride, always thinking of the significance and symbolism of events, rather than cause. I guess not everyone has a pair of nail clippers... Ugh watch the movie and you'll know what I mean."
"MichelleAudrey","8","0","0","25 November 2011"," Intriguing but a little over-hyped
","My lateness in watching Black Swan is due to two things; a) a tendency to stay away from anything that garners so much hype and b) an uncertainty about Darren Aronofsky's direction in previous work. This turns out to be a film that everyone should see once without a doubt, if only to see the excellent case study of the doppelgänger.<br/><br/>While Portman is commendable, it is easy to see how the film could anger those in the dancing profession. With so much media attention paid to the fact that Portman trained for several months to perform the dancing segments, the film is still very much an actresses movie as opposed to a dancer's one. This is inevitably Aronofsky's goal as Portman's character Nina, a perfectionist and ballet obsessed young woman, is ultimately performing her way through life right from the beginning.<br/><br/>Without ruining it for anyone who has yet to see it, the basic story surrounds Nina living with her mother (Barbara Hershey) in New York where she is attempting to become the Swan Queen in a new production of Swan Lake. The role is problematic as Nina only knows how to embody the innocent character of the White Swan. To become the Queen she must also embrace the sensuality and danger of the Black Swan, a point that her dance instructor Thomas (Vincent Cassel) fervently points out. Whilst practicing routines at home, it becomes evident that Nina is dangerously unbalanced mentally as she appears trapped between a dream that her mother once had (and gave up when she became pregnant with Nina) and her own insecurities, including a disposition towards self-harm. Interestingly, the scenes involving Nina's mother reveal a lot about how the two have lived together, especially since the viewer is given no background information on the characters. The mother's demonstrative and combatant attitude provides a rocky foundation for Nina and her desire to see her daughter accomplish what was not to be for her, only adds to Nina's self-destruction.<br/><br/>Portman plays the self-conscious but talented dancer very well and her performance is echoed by strong supporting actors. Vincent Cassel provides an excellently creepy performance as the dance instructor whilst Mila Kunis' Lily is a perfect foil for Nina's perfectionist qualities. Also featuring in the film, albeit briefly, is Winona Ryder as Beth MacIntyre. Ryder's understated appearance as Beth, or the Dying Swan, (the former principal dancer in Thomas' ballet whom Nina is replacing), is remarkable for its effect upon the story. Although she is not largely present in most scenes, her descent from popularity begins to mirror Nina's loneliness and descent into madness, quite early on. Thus, Beth functions as a forewarning of Nina's peril and ultimate mental unraveling.<br/><br/>A friend pointed out the significance of mirrors in Black Swan and without watching for them, it is noticeable how there is a mirror of some description in almost every scene. This attention to detail is one of the fabulous things about Aronofsky and is present in all his work and in this film, it is what keeps the theme of the doppelgänger present throughout. Nina's distrust of everyone around her is shown through reflections of evil imagery and characters, which relays the fragmented state of her mind. Towards the end of the film she constantly sees reflections of herself as the Black Swan, a twisted and disturbed version of herself that is beginning to emerge from her innocent exterior.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Thomas tells Nina that in order to portray the Black Swan she must lose herself in the role rather than be so structured and concerned with perfection. Consequently, Nina does lose herself in the role and in her first and only full performance of the ballet on stage, her transformation into the Black Swan becomes a form of self-immolation. Anyone who is aware of the myth of the Black Swan will see where the film is going as soon as it starts, but it is definitely worth the watch. Overall, there are some subtle surprises that keep it interesting and some unsettling moments that are very well captured. Definitely makes an impression.

","As an idea, Black Swan is quite interesting. As a film it is a huge disappointment, even failing to make it as a camp classic. Here is what should have happened: brilliant director meets creative writer, choreographer and actress to illustrate how dance can evolve into something thrilling, as characters paradoxically find and lose themselves simultaneously. Unfortunately those talents were not available, but, rather four sows' ears, who, falling well short of silk, delivered an embarrassing, lumpen mess. We will not even go into the movies that get it right, as this after-school effort is not worthy of that association. The sensibility of the director is the antithesis of what was required. Why he would have taken on a project so far beyond his capabilities is a puzzlement. The hubris is as risible as that of Jack Buchanan's character, the great Cordova, in the movie the Band Wagon. (Cordova hilariously tries to turn a simple-minded vehicle for fun-loving Broadway hoofers into Faust.) Unlike the creators of the Band Wagon, the director of Black Swan was dead serious, though unfortunately out of his depth. In like manner, his lead actress could not pull it off, armed with only two expressions in her thespian arsenal: the placid vacuity of someone selling beauty products at Saks and something more complex, part smile, part horrified sneer (with a touch of flared nostril) as if she just caught a glimpse of her own, pre-rhinoplasty face. These have gotten her through many a film, including Thor. The surgery certainly gave her voice an annoyingly nasal timbre, if not the honk of a swan, nor the ability to take flight in the role. Moreover, six months of working out were apparently not enough to give her the grace and energy required to embody her character. Prominent neck tendons aside, she is simply too dumpy to be a convincing Nina. If you disagree, have a look at pictures of this season's ABT lineup. The writer had no previous credits of distinction and it shows. The choreographer was a French provincial import with no ambition to outdo Reisinger or Petipa, from what we know of their work. And that is truly the biggest disappointment of all—the movie does not portray the genius and excitement of dance. In fact, the only enjoyable moments of Black Swan are scenes featuring the wonderful Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey, prompting one to think that there might be a much more interesting story to tell about a stage mother and her alcoholic, has-been daughter."

When you come to the end everything makes senses but I kept asking why it took that long to arrive there. And I found the film quite predictable. The Ballet company it's similar to Verhoeven's Showgirls.<br/><br/>The use of the camera is horrendous. It has that shaky feeling that makes me dizzy, which could be clever in some situations (when Nina is running away in panic, but not when she is walking on the NY's streets in the first part of the film). When Nina is the only character on screen (a that happens lots of times) the camera is too close to her and in some shots looked pretentious. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman is impressive. Nina is a challenging role and she give us an acting lesson and gets a well deserved Oscar. She is the true reason to watch the film.

This actually weakens the film's connection to its target, which is a ballet production, however, which seems a waste, although eventually it becomes clear that all of the other characters must gradually become mere cogs in the grinding wheel of Nina's egoism. <br/><br/>In the end we are left with only one character, the hero, and her death, as the perfect consequence; and as death sublimates the existence of all, not just its victim, the movie neatly resolves all of its many conflicts.<br/><br/>It is as if Aronofsky, the creator of The Wrestler, is bragging to us, ""See how easy it is to end a movie with death! You can dissolve every conflict at once, no matter how poorly constructed it was, and the audience will never realize how it happened in their grieving!"" To his credit, he has taken care to reconcile the other characters with Nina before or at her death, yet the I find the notion that the snuff ending has become the new panacea of film making repulsive."

","Natalie Portman in a film about ballet, directed by Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler) with a strong psychological almost surreal streak, might not be considered your usual multiplex draw.<br/><br/>$327 million worldwide box office and a best actress Oscar would suggest otherwise and whilst certainly not for everyone, this is undoubtedly top quality entertainment of the disturbing kind.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Portman) is a ballerina with a prominent New York ballet company, demure, innocent and driven by mother vicariously living out her own past 'glories"" through her daughter.<br/><br/>Nina is good but not yet a star, until an opportunity presents that finally gives her the opportunity to shine in the eyes of company director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) and hopefully the ticket paying general public.<br/><br/>There is a problem, in fact several of them. Outgoing diva Beth (Ryder) is not going to go quietly into the night and whilst Nina is perfect for the part of the White Swan Princess ""Odette"", she is much less suited to the complex flawed Black Swan ""Odile"".<br/><br/>To add yet more Greek tragedy to the mix, we have a newly arrived ballerina ""Lily"" (Mila Kunis) who personifies everything Nina is not. A natural dancer, prepared to take risks, let go, be bad and clearly very sensuous without even trying.<br/><br/>Nina is classically beautiful, a perfectionist, striving for the ideal and realizing perhaps too late that she, like all of us, is doomed to fail. Attempting to embrace the dark side of her character, at the prompting of Thomas, leads Nina to very dark places indeed.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the ""Swan Lake"" story is clearly outlined for us on several occasions, so even those of us philistines with no clue, have some idea where the play within the play is heading. As you will have guessed by now, most Opera's and Ballet's never appear to end well.<br/><br/>Whilst not a horror film, this skirts dangerously close, touching as it does, on self abuse, psychosis and for a mainstream film, some reasonably graphic girl on girl sex scenes. Perhaps as an indication of her transition from a girl to woman, capable of giving and receiving pleasure. This is not what the film is about but there are certainly occasions where the tension is ratcheted high and with a classical score underlying the point, Nina gets close to the edge and steps, perhaps knowingly, over the line clearly marked, ""madness"".<br/><br/>Aronofsky knows how to photograph his leads, edgy, close and following the action from differing swirling points of view. This is a standout performance from Portman, taking real risks in pursuit of her art. Not only training enough to give a very fair approximation that she can classically dance but portraying a very fragile girl, in every sense of the word, in a world that is way more brutal than most of us would realise.<br/><br/>Whilst Portman did study ballet at an early age and trained hard for the film, there have been arguments as to how much dancing was done by the star. Arguably, does it really matter, Portman is a movie star not a classically trained ballet dancer at the highest level, does Tom Cruise do all his own stunts? Portman is helped with some sterling support from both Cassel, Kunis (with some notable ballet training) and her screen mother Barbara Hershey.<br/><br/>There are a couple of missteps, two ""effects"" in particular jar with the scene, taking you out of the film for a moment or two, hint legs and pictures. These are small points and are balanced out by a very effective CGI sequence as Nina finally ""becomes"" Odile and marks her transformation, from which she may never return.<br/><br/>The film portrays the loneliness and lack of support Nina has from those charged with her care and the juxtaposition of the beauty and perfection of the ballet scene, with the dirt and ugliness of the graffiti strewn subway is a neat touch. There is a lot of stark lighting, bare walls, mirrors both broken and whole, featuring prominently, which as any movie buff knows is a clear sign, ""here be madness"".<br/><br/>Incidentally, filmed on a budget of only $13 million, which for a mainstream movie is cheap indeed.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Disturbing, yes but in a good way.<br/><br/>A film that is mostly definitely not ""about"" ballet, with an excellent central performance from Portman, in a film that may not be to all tastes but is well worth putting in the time.<br/><br/>Recommended <br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

","I was excited to finally see this film, I had a mild desire to see it in theaters but never got around to it. I rented it at Redbox and am happy I finally got around to it and to see what the buzz was about.<br/><br/>In my years as a very big movie fan I have seen a lot of very good movies and a lot of movies while good aren't particularly moving for whatever reason. Either it is because of poor direction or a script or acting it just doesn't always come together for me. This is one of those times.<br/><br/>First off, let me say that this is not a bad movie, it is however not a great one either. It is however technically very sound, the cinematography is fine, the score is effective and the lighting is good. Editing is not an issue here but what is the issue for me is an overall lack of soul that I continue to find in the work of Darren Aronofsky's work. The parts are all there to be good and overall product just doesn't seem to come together for me. Maybe it's his use of the camera and it's bouncing around that is intended to make the viewer feel like they are with the characters and in my case did the exact opposite.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman does a fine job in this role. Her character is so stunted from her overbearing mother and her obsessive need to be a great dancer that she has no friends and no life outside of her self made shell of a life. Mila Kunis in a very interesting role plays Lilly the yang to Portman's Yin and representation of all of the repression that that overwhelmed her, a physical embodiment of all that Nina has chosen not to experience.<br/><br/>I found the most interesting character to be the role of the ballet director Thomas. He is self assured, cocky and a great manipulator, both professionally and personally. His role is well acted by Vincent Casell and is the most entertaining character in the film. Watching him try to pull the vigor and emotion from Portman's Nina and his attempts to seduce her are the most interesting thing in the movie.<br/><br/>The film ranges from melodrama to thriller and almost borders on horror in a few parts. It goes from straight forward storytelling and as the film progresses it attempts to show the loss of sanity of Nina becomes more and more surreal and the effect is uneven at best.<br/><br/>My thoughts have always been that Aronofsky is a sound director but never very moving. Good but not great, he doesn't elevate the material he touches but I don't feel he brings it down either. A fine movie but once the credits roll it is not haunting and not all that memorable."

","And, so Aronofsky makes yet another film.<br/><br/>Fans of the director went orgasmic with this one, and it's not surprising that it really is a good picture.<br/><br/>The story centers on ballet dancer Nina and her obsession (which might be an understatement) with obtaining and mastering the role of both White and Black Swans in a new and innovative production of Swan Lake. The parallels between the Swans of the ballet and Nina's own personality are quite obvious, making it really tough for someone not to get it. To its credit, the script features two opposing views on the ballet, with Vincent Cassel's experienced and learned perception that it's ""been done to death"" and the two everyday guys that have never even heard of it. This helps the movie stay away from appealing exclusively to the elitists connoisseurs.<br/><br/>The movie does have some flaws. The almost horror tone of the hallucination scenes seems tired and unoriginal, the music being accessory to this. The big shock stingers with the music seem out of place, making Black Swan sound more as a terrifying story rather than the depressing one it really is. The Tchaikovsky original pieces are, not surprisingly, better and, surprisingly, produce a much more interesting effect with the scary scenes.<br/><br/>Given the psychological nature of the story, Aronofsky focuses exclusively on the perspective of Nina, which lends to innovative and very interesting shots, however, they make it rather difficult for viewers interested in the choreography to actually appreciate it.<br/><br/>This makes the movie center 90% on the psychological and 10% on the music and choreography. Yet, an obvious and clear Aronofsky piece.<br/><br/>The performances were solid. Natalie Portman nails the part, really reflecting her innocence and confusion with sincerity in an award deserving work. Vincent Cassel, as usual, delivers, and Mila Kunis not too far behind. Still, a surprise performance by Winona Ryder in a small role and Barbara Hershey's role are more interesting examples.<br/><br/>The lesbian scene seems a little bit out of place, but it becomes quite interesting once you understand the small twist at the end, which is not too original, actually.<br/><br/>The visual effects with Nina's hallucinations are well done, especially considering that most of the shots were done with hand-held shaky cameras. The scene that steals the show is Nina's definitive transformation during her presentation as the Black Swan, where she has red eyes and starts growing black feathers. An actual triumph for the artists. On the other hand, a particular scene where Nina is much more aware that she is turning into a swan with her legs crooking to the back may seem over the top and, let's face it, a bit laughable.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is depressing, though not as much as Requiem for a Dream, of course. It's a delight to appreciate, and to some extent to enjoy, but not worth watching countless times. It is a noble contender as best movie of the year, but not really a winner. Either way, it's intellectual food and a standout example of good art film."
"EUyeshima","6","0","0","2 April 2011"," Portman Rises Above an Intensely Kinetic Psychological Thriller That Challenges Coherence
","It has taken me a while to see Darren Aronofsky's acclaimed 2010 psychological thriller probably because the marketing campaign at the time of its December release focused more on the film's sensationalistic, horror-film elements. In the meantime, Natalie Portman collected a truckload of awards for her searing portrayal of Nina Sayers, a talented ballerina whose mental state declines as pressure mounts around her starring performance in a new staging of Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"" by a prestigious New York City ballet company. She is quite good, although I am less relatively enamored by the film itself, especially toward the end, which beyond recalling Aronofsky's earlier work, 2000's ""Requiem for a Dream"", comes across as an intensely kinetic albeit derivative hybrid of ""The Red Shoes"", ""Carrie"", and ""Single White Female"".<br/><br/>Co-written by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin, the screenplay melds Nina's reality, dreams, and hallucinations into quite a ripe melodrama. Nina has long dreamed about playing the lead in ""Swan Lake"", and her fantasy comes true in a moment of pure bliss before her descent into madness. The ballet troupe's manipulative director Thomas Leroy picks Nina to replace aging prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre to play the Swan Queen, which is two roles in one – Odette, the virginal White Swan awaiting a kiss from the Prince, and her heartless twin, Odile, the sexually predatory Black Swan who lures the prince away. Leroy knows Nina is fully capable of playing the former but remains unconvinced she could exude the sensuality needed to play the latter. While she has trained her whole life for this opportunity, she remains an insecure, emotionally bruised woman still living with her overbearing mother Erica, a former ballerina who never reached the rarefied heights her daughter is about to enter.<br/><br/>Complicating matters is Lily, a new arrival to the company from San Francisco and as liberated a free spirit as Nina is sexually repressed. Meanwhile, as Nina performs to the demands of the role, she crumbles in hidden ways that have her start imagining herself transforming into a swan. Present in almost every frame of the film, Portman is terrific conveying Nina's tentative nature in a way that makes her dedicated training all the more haunting for the sacrifices she makes to achieve her goal of artistic perfection. Within the confines of his predictable role, Vincent Cassel is malevolent enough as the autocratic Leroy, and Barbara Hershey really excels in her few scenes as Erica, showing why Nina's self-esteem has become practically nil. With her haughty manner and skeletal frame, Winona Ryder has more of an extended cameo as Beth, but she makes her fatalistic sense palpable. As Lily, Mila Kunis is almost effortless as Nina's saucy, distrustful competitor.<br/><br/>Compounded by Matthew Labatique's constantly moving camera, Aronofsky's florid direction works on an almost surreal level for about the first three-quarters of the film's 108-minute running time, but his lurid horror-film approach gets excessive toward the end when Nina's confusion between reality and fantasy signals an inability to deal with the life she thought she wanted. The 2011 DVD/BluRay offers an extensive, 49-minute making-of documentary, ""Black Swan Metamorphosis"" which includes on-set footage and interviews with cast and crew. In addition, there are short featurettes focusing on the ballet sequences, the production design, the costumes, Portman's preparation for the role and Aronofsky's creative process. There are also interviews of the principals from Fox Movie Channel Presents, as well as the theatrical trailer."
"grayner-2","5","0","0","30 March 2011"," Visually stunning, great acting, thin plot & motivations
","As a whole, I think Black Swan is worth seeing because it does deliver some really good acting performances and an interesting work which cannot be easily classified into a single genre. But, in my opinion, it does not warrant some of the reviews as the most amazing thing ever or even in 2010. Basically, these premises are simple: the ingénue who must go through internal hell to perform her role, the possessive stage mother from hell, the pr**ck choreographer who manipulates the players and wants to be Svengali, the rival who threatens to steal it all away. All of these forces are backdrops to the drama playing out in Nina's mind. Arguably little of anything that is seen in the final third of the film is real. <br/><br/>The good: The film is a visual treat. Aside from the obvious black/white contrast, the use of pink/red and green is also very interesting. Each frame is perfectly filmed so that colors, textures, reflections all play a role. All of this play's into Nina's black/white world where everyone is there to study her every move and even every part of her body is invaded by her prying mother, the manipulative choreographer etc. Aronofsky does a good job at avoiding the pat stereotypes: Lily is never a direct rival to Nina except when Nina starts to self-destruct, Thomas is never the seductor he would like to be. This is NOT All About Eve. It is a visualization of the very difficult process and artist goes through and embodies all of the fears and nightmares that performers have. The film brings out some great performances by Portman, Kunis and Hershey and Ryder. <br/><br/>The bad: The motivations in the film are completely not credible. We are to believe Nina has been in a professional ballet company for several years. Yet she comes off as a psychotic Marsha Brady afraid about the school play. She would have had experience being on stage, probably has lost/gained numerous other major roles. As part of an ENSEMBLE company, different people would play leads at different times. There is not just ONE big star. So we have Nina going completely insane over this role which she would not have been given anyway. And the Black/White swan thing? Um, you could have 2 dancers play the 2 swans. It's been done. But she goes completely off her rocker and then at the end claims, ""It was perfect."" Well, it really wasn't. If she did fall in the first part, the performance was not perfect. Most of all, being a performer means doing a great performance night after night and also showing up at parties for the business end of it, but she supposedly killed herself, so in this way too, she was not perfect and failed. <br/><br/>Aronofsky really goes overboard with all of the special effects. She's nuts and crazy, we get it. No need for her to pull her finger off 5 times or bleed out of various orifices or see herself in the mirror. Every hackneyed CGI horror movie trick is tried. And that famous lesbian scene? It wouldn't be that that would generate a huge buzz and drive up box office, right? <br/><br/>There are other ridiculous plot points, like the 2nd is named the day before the big show? Nina's the big star, does all her make-up, supposedly murders someone, and hops onto stage with 1 minute to spare? Or she's sick on opening night, but no one bothers to call her and find out what is going on? There is zero emphasis on the other characters in the ballet. Worst of all, we see very little actual dancing in the movie. We see bits and pieces of things, but never a whole piece. We never see her in a rehearsal to be the black swan. Not a very good homage to ballet. <br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that you leave the theater not particularly satisfied: either it is about the unbalanced woman who kills herself over a role or it is all an allegory about the artistic process and the ""death"" of a woman's vulnerability and innocence. So you walk away seeing something visually stunning but don't take away much more. There is really no big lesson on the human condition, just the tragic story of a tormented girl who failed under pressure."

","I know, I know, this is the big movie this year, and everyone must have seen it. After so many years Darren Aronofsky finally started getting the recognition that he deserves. But that recognition is gone too far with some people, and he became trendy, which means that every douchebag is going to check out is opus and then yak about him and how he is great. That is annoying, and has nothing to do with him, but still something had to be said.<br/><br/>Back to the movie, it is about ballerina Nina, and her life full of sacrifices and questionable rewards. With the new season approaching along with the new production of Black Swan Nina finds herself in a position to take the lead role. But she will have to make some tough decisions in that process. Again the artistic vision of the director made all the difference and this movie can be watched many times, and still be very interesting. The visual impact is not that strong as in his previous movies, but the story is the key here. It is interpreted and played out very carefully and with great precision, but still it is not too mechanical. Now, I did not like the movie that much, but I guess that I am currently not so much in the artsy mood.

","Black Swan is an interesting watch. You never know exactly where the film is going or what the point is. All you know is that this one girl wants to be the lead in this one production called Swan Lake.<br/><br/>That's basically all you need to know, then just sit back and watch the film work it's magic, which is what it does. It veers off in to many unexpected directions pulling you along for the ride, your brain trying to piece together what has just happened while it's trying to stick with the story trying to work out whats going to happen next. It's not predictable , even when you second guess it you are only ahead for a moment as something else blindsides you leaving you aghast and making you rethink the film entirely again.<br/><br/>It's not complicated either, it's not full of dialogue or a complicated story line, it's more akin to walking through a really good house of horrors where when you get to the end you have a sad feeling as you realise your trip is over and you have to leave."

","With ""Black Swan"" Aronofsky presents the other side to his ""Wrestler"".<br/><br/>While ""Wrestler"" is a male, linear, lucid story of a guy struggling to get away from his everyday hell, ""Black Swan"" is a female principle, dreamy, artistic, about a girl trying to set her dark side free.<br/><br/>For me, the biggest asset of both movies are amazing performances of relevant leading actors, Rourke and Portman. Just amazing casting.<br/><br/>As for the content, like every Aronofsky, this one is worth seeing. For me duality with ""Wrestler"", ballet on screen, actors and directing are what makes it good, I could live without explicit sex scenes and occasional gore, but guess that wouldn't work with younger audience.<br/><br/>Watch, but unless you're already a D.A. fan, don't get into theater expecting to be blown away."

","Anyone thinking this is just a film about ballet is dead wrong. This is a pyschologically mind-bending film that really makes the audience feel the transition within Natalie Portman's character. Portman gave an incredible performance, really going above and beyond in the role of prima-dancer; actors(actresses) like these literally become their characters. Portman captured the screen and kept this writer entertained throughout. Mila Kunis's performance was well positioned in relation to Portman's; not overacting, but rather feeling natural on screen. This is a film for anyone who doesn't mind a little discomfort, and likes their mind bent"

","To understand this, you have to be somewhat familiar with the plot in the ballet ""Swan Lake"". There you find a woman with two different characters, although on the surface two different persons. Often, those parts are danced by the same ballerina.<br/><br/>This is what Natalie Portman does here and this may be the performance of her life. There's a struggle inside her, between black and white, and she gets more and more confused about what's reality and what's not. The same goes for the audience.<br/><br/>But anyway this is a movie which has, so to say, seen Polanski's ""Repulsion"" a couple of times too much. Or maybe a couple of times too little.

","BLACK SWAN (2010) **** Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's masterful fever dream of a dark drama explores the highly competitive world of professional ballet and what it means to be an artist at any cost necessary. Enter prima-ballerina-to-be Portman (just give her the Oscar already!; her career best) an identity crises at full tilt as she prepares for her greatest achievement and biggest hurdle: dancing the lead titular performance with only her haranguing mother (Hershey also top-notch and award worthy); a sexy younger rival waiting in the wings (Kunis equally excellent oozing sex appeal); and their commanding, sleazy instructor (Cassel in aging bo-hunk mode). What follows is a downward spiral only Aronofsky can capably achieve thanks largely to a woozy-inducing head-trip screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz & John J. McLaughlin. Think of ALL ABOUT EVE meets a borderline TWILIGHT ZONE horror episode. One of the year's absolute best. A stunner!"
"bsaisham","10","3","8","29 December 2010"," Psychologically and philosophically surreal
","My most favorite film of the year. Top notch acting by Ms. Portman and the supporting cast. Excellent directing by Mr. Aronofsky. Good editing (sound and picture wise). Good cinematography. From the very first frame I was hooked. Prior to this I had only seen THE WRESTLER. When I saw that, I knew that Mr. Aronofsky was a force to reckoned with.<br/><br/>Reminiscent to THE WRESTLER, BLACK SWAN explores the world of a performing art that is (in its own way) rough, mean, and demanding of both body and mind. Another echo from WRESTLER, is obsession. Of course the last echo I'll note is the first person storytelling. Imparitcular by way of the use of the steadicam walking behind our protagonist.<br/><br/>Unlike WRESTLER, SWAN is a surreal mix of reality and hallucination. ""...is this the real life? Is this just fantasy..."" (Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody). So this leaves us to de-cipher the character for ourselves. So yes, Nina is more of a cipher versus Ram.<br/><br/>Now to analyze the character of Nina. Like Ram (from WRESTLER), she is in a performing art that challenges her mentally and physically. Both have ""personal"" lives are in shambles because of their dedication to professions. Both have a challenge to overcome.<br/><br/>Ram's obstacle was his age and worn body. Nina's was her body being pushed to limits, her mind being pushed, her wanting for acceptance, and (what leads to my view of the theme), needing to break out of her shell to be at peace, so to speak.<br/><br/>I believe that the film's over all theme is breaking out of one's shell. Nina lives a very sheltered, restricted life. Just looking at her bedroom and seeing how she and her mother interact, you can tell that she lives some kind life where she can't seem to break away from her childhood. I'd like to note how well Nina's past is well explained by imagery. Upon getting the role of Queen Swan, does she embark on her journey.<br/><br/>Like THE WRESTLER, Ram's character echoed Mr. Rourke's career as a kind of comeback to a given profession. With that is mind, Ms. Portman is in a role that is really her big breakout leading role as an adult. So Nina's journey from child to woman on the stage can more or less mimic Ms. Portman's move from renowned child actress to accomplished leading lady. Also like the Swan Queen, Nina in herself found to be very schizophrenic.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also very crucial in this story. Vincent Cassel gave a very convincing performance of the production director. Maybe he's a metaphor for some director. Mila Kunis has indeed come a long way since That 70's show and Family Guy. Her role was just beyond words. Since she was viewed by Nina, her role was also schizophrenic, as was Ms. Hershey's role. It's hard to say whether Nina's mother was just doting or overbearing. This can be open to interpretation.<br/><br/>In all of Mr. Aronofsky's vision I myself sense influence from Alfred Hithcock, Stanley Kubrick, Brian DePalma, and (to a degree), David Cronenberg. If this is in fact the case, Mr. Aronofsky, you have good taste.<br/><br/>One last thing I'd to interpret is that I think this film can serve as a metaphor for the dark side of vanity. Nowadays to be well known equals up to vanity. I sometimes wonder how far some people take their vanity and if it's all worth it in the end.<br/><br/>So to wrap this up, I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind to pick up on all the metaphors and philosophies and drawn your own conclusions. Like I said before, I think the overall theme is breaking out of one's shell. Do what it takes even if it means breaking through your oneself. The old saying is that we are our own worst enemy."
"andy-933-696608","10","3","8","25 December 2010"," Black Swan Movie Review
","It's more engaging than ""The Wrestler"", both invoking, sexual, and psychological elements to heighten the suspense of the film. Viewers here will witness both the nature of obsession, as well as the very damage it can cause, especially when the individual craves nothing less than perfection. ""Black Swan"", is more than a simple ballet story, or even more erotic than to beautiful women making love towards one another, but it is more of a comparison between the reality of the film's story, and the story of the swan queen. Nina(Portman) no doubt represents the White Swan, or Swan Queen , the innocent and apparently pure victim of the tale. Lily (Kunis) on the other hand is the less than prominent Black Swan, who is both more free in her mind and her personality, although not as dark as the Black Swan is described. That doesn't go to say Nina doesn't consider her to be a threat. Viewers can tell after seeing the trailer, that the movie is dark suspense film centered around a competition between these 2 characters Nina and Lily. Well, at least to Nina it's a competition, while Lily is just like another person, both relaxed and collected, never obsessing, nor going for perfection. Nina is the very person who lives for her obsession towards Ballet. Basically that is all that matters to her. Lily takes drugs, partys, and even laughs while performing her ballet, meaning how simple she is towards ballet as something she basically enjoys. When comparing these 2 chicks, the plot becomes very clear. The story is for viewers to watch as Nina's obsessions and insecurities take the best of her and drive her to achieving a dark side far more than she can handle, as it destroys her mind so much, that in the very end she herself truly becomes the black swan, only to end the movie with a death as sad as her paranoia. Director Arnofsky gives us all a masterpiece of both art and the dedication of very prominent actresses. I wish to congratulate both Portman, Kunis, as well as Cassel in their roles, and I'm hoping for this film to receive several Oscar nominations, because it would not only be an insult to the hardwork Portman has given to this role, training 5 hours a day, while losing 2 pounds, but it would also show a total form of disrespect to the artistic beauty that is Ballet. I'm no dancer, Hell I even hate it, while still seeing the beauty it represents when observing the very significant expressions it releases as it unfolds. In ""Black Swan"" Darren Arnofsky is displaying an art in the very darkness it's specific tale represents, the innocent victim loses the man she loves to someone more dark, free, and honest to God more tempting. I have to say ""Family Guy's"" own Mila Kunis, a girl that can really make any mans woman Jealous, in the case of her character Lily, she is all Nina wishes to be, no longer feeling either restraints, as well the lack of confidence brought down by her more than controlling mother (Hershey). Her transcendence into the very dark creature is beyond her control, as she not only exhibits the mental breakdowns leading up to her own demise, even uncontrollable responses of anger towards experiencing this paranoia. It is truly remarkable how much film's can express in the human psych, especially when diving into its very darkest parts. ""Black Swan"" does all this, while maintaining it's focus on the overall story, and not only reyling on just the thrills of Nina's downward spiral into the very madness that makes this film worthy of being remembered as a classic of true horrific insanity."

This movie takes the story of dual personalities to a whole new level of unknown, which is beautifully portrayed by Natalie Portman, taking her to a spot where ""The Oscar"" doesn't look like just a dream anymore.<br/><br/>It's a touching story, based around a small group of characters, and that's a place where Aronofsky is at his best (i.e. Requiem for a dream). Also, it would be unfair to forget Vincent Cassel, who showed himself in a totally different manner creating a strong, patriarchal character. <br/><br/>In the end, this work of art is worth every single dollar and minute you spend on it. It's a guaranteed classic!"
"montera_iulian","9","3","8","22 December 2010"," ""In order to exist, beauty needs an evil possession"" and Aronofsky offered us plenty of both.
","This is not just a drama but also a horror. This is not just a horror but also a film noir. This is also an erotic monument to perfection. It's a clash of desire and obsession. This is easily one of the best movies in the last couple of years.<br/><br/>Living inside her own beautiful but terrifying world, this young ballerina named Nina (Natalie Portman), tries to find perfection by portraying the duplicitous swan queen in the play ""Swan Lake"". Perfection though, cannot be achieved only by sacrificing your body so she takes it one step further by letting herself go and choosing to sacrifice her mind also. Guided through her evolution as a professional dancer by her artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), she finds herself pushed over the limits and she jumps from her fragile and innocent look to a lusty and provocative shadow of herself. Problems occur when both her faces have to face Lily (Mila Kunis), another ballerina who finds herself in a violent competition for Nina's role in ""Swan Lake"". The powerful display of these two sides of the same coin is taking proportions when other factors like the authoritarian methods of Nina's mother to support her daughter through her career are revealed. ""Black Swan"", however, it's not just about some ballerina trying to find perfection by sacrifice but it's about the innocence and the lust, the confusion and the clarity, the strange and the usual, the chaos and the order, the manifest and the acceptance. Darren Aronofsky chose to explicitly explore an intriguing, erotic and passionate story that might both shock and please you at the same time. You will find yourself lost at one moment but all the answers given close to the end will reveal the harsh truth about the artistic behavior and sacrifice.<br/><br/>Few days ago I stated that Nicole Kidman in ""Rabbit Hole"" is a strong contender for the leading role at the Academy Awards but I must admit I might have rushed a little bit. Natalie Portman's dazzling and haunting performance as Nina is one of the best ""back-to-back"" portrayals I've seen in a long time. Her technique and bold approach of her characters is really inspiring. Every tear and every smile, every moment of relax and panic, each line she delivers makes you encourage her but also doubt her. Her mesmerizing portrayal is the result of not only high acting skills but also of a visionary direction. Mila Kunis as Lily delivers more than I expected. She's natural, honest and brutal, exactly what her character needed to look like. To complete this amazing cast you add some bohemian charm by taking Vincent Cassel to be the artsy director, Thomas Leroy.<br/><br/>The execution of this art-film is hauntingly perfect. Each scene, each close-take and each moment means or reveals something important for the denouement of this movie. The sound was terrifying. The ""horroresque"" show put on film by Darren is really scary at times and might change your perception of the surroundings in this movie. One little sound might change your mind about what's really happening or what the character is going through. Speaking of the sound, you must recognize the beautiful music added. The play is beautifully revealed at the end of the movie, backed by a gorgeous cinematography and you will not understand what hit you.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is possibly Aronofsky's new masterpiece. I said new because I think ""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of the rare things in cinema also. ""In order to exist, beauty needs an evil possession"" and Aronofsky offered us plenty of both. We should thank such directors for being so passionate about their projects, we should thanks such actors like Natalie Portman that devote themselves entirely to the characters, we should take the whole team put together by Aronofsky in order to create such a tremendous work. This is definitely not a movie for everyone, like any another film crafted by the hands of Darren, but this is what we, cinephiles call, a uniquely cinematic experience. If it's not perfect than it's close to perfection."

","Its hard to think any words can really do this movie the proper justice. Darren Aronofski has made himself a true masterpiece, that when finished, leaves its viewer completely astonished at what just unfolded before them. From the opening scene to its conclusion, the movie is brilliant. The film entrances you with its story, and like a ballet, elegantly dances your mind down the rails of a dark, twisted, psychological roller coaster. You will leave the movie astonished at what you just saw.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman offers a transcendent performance with her role as Nina, the quiet, hard working ballet dancer; a perfectionist who believes she is qualified to play the lead in her ballet company's new rendition of Swan Lake. However, her chase for perfection becomes halted with the entrance of a new dancer to the company, a young woman named Lily (Mila Kunis). Nina sees Lily as competition, and therefore little reason to trust her. The rest of the film then becomes a psychological thrill ride. The viewer witnesses Nina's paranoia begin to undo her as she must out perform her new competition, win the eye of her ballet director (Vincent Cassel), and continue to please her ballet-obsessive mother (frighteningly well played by Barbara Hershey) - all in the chase for perfection.<br/><br/>Leaving the Theater, I immediately wished to view the film again. The director's inclusion of the ballet's harrowing music, his keen eye for the colors of black and white, and his constant inclusion of mirrors, all add to the chilling, psychological uncertainties the film has to offer. <br/><br/>Truly amazing, 10/10"

I found this film to be depressing and filled with what amounted to an adolescent crying and pouting about her inadequate performances. Portman plays a psychotic quite well but it does little to hold my attention. We are transported back and forth between the delusions of her character and what might be reality.

"griffolyon12","4","6","22","21 December 2010"," Technically Good, But Too Racy for its Own Good
","Few movies can make you question your own sanity, and Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is such a movie. The movie is a loose adaptation of the ballet Swan Lake. The film follows the story of ballerina Nina Seyers (played by Natalie Portman), her own tale mirroring that of the White Swan in the ballet that she is performing in. But in the film, the Black Swan lurks in the wings in the form of a rival ballerina at the company (played by Mila Kunis), everything that Nina is not, and could she be trying to steal Nina's role from her? <br/><br/>Black Swan paints a picture of an obsessive art form. A strive for perfection and emotional release, and if you can no longer perform, you are washed up and no good. Black Swan fires on all cylinders and technically works. The direction of Aronofsky is engrossing, drawing you into Nina's claustrophobic world of paranoia, the performances from the actors are daring and immaculate, and the cinematography is stunning, in particular the beautifully photographed dream sequence that opens the film and is the highlight of this psychological thriller. Where the movie slips for me, is its racy material, where in the middle of the film it seems to lose itself in this odd perverted journey that is close to soft core porn. While it works to fit into the story, was it necessary to go as far as they do? I think no. These moments seem more a detriment to me, and hindered my enjoyment, seeming as if they were pure grabs to try and make some bank. <br/><br/>This is a film that is so well made, it is a shame to see it dip into such waters that lose it much credibility in my book.<br/><br/>I give Black Swan a 4 out of 10!"
"bobt145","5","4","13","17 December 2010"," Swan Diva
","Natalie Portman's performance in ""Black Swan"" reminded me a bit of Isabelle Huppert's magnificent job in Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher."" The self-destructive parallel's between the two roles, coming from opposite directions (Black and White Swan?) are startling.<br/><br/>What's also startling is the effect of both overall movies.<br/><br/>I would never recommend the Haneke film. Why would you want to obsess over a woman who's sado-masochism ranges from breaking glass in a young girl's coat pocket to hysterical sex on a men's room floor.<br/><br/>With Portman, why would you want to watch, even in horrific fascination, this obsessive creature with such a masochistic core. She literally hurts herself repeatedly and succumbs to the fingering of the ballet director in seconds after rejecting him at first.<br/><br/>There's one scene where Portman is in a tub of water. She immerses herself. The Baptism reference is obvious. From underwater, she sees blood dripping into the tub, first from her rival whose face appears, then from a cut on her own hand.<br/><br/>She has lived her frigid, ultra-disciplined live as a slave to her craft for so long, when faced with success and the demands of a manipulative director, she begins to go mad.<br/><br/>I can think of only a couple of viewpoints from which one would appreciate this study. Either as someone who sadistically enjoys seeing her unravel or from the viewpoint of someone who identifies with her masochism.<br/><br/>As I can't come up with either viewpoint, my only question is 'Why would anyone want to watch this all-encompassing pain?' Huppert won best actress at Cannes, Portman will win at the Academy, but that still doesn't answer the question."

"simon-1620","3","7","28","20 December 2010"," Haloween Lake
","Aranofsky provides us with the first 'slasher/drug' ballet movie. Unique, yes!. Meaningful, no! Obviously still rooted in his drug fuelled visions from Requiem for a Dream, the story follows young Nina as she applies herself in trying to achieve the lifetime ambition of being the Swan Princess in a new version of Swan Lake. An arch rival rears her ugly head and goes about drugging Nina and getting her drunk like on a date rape. To make matters worse Nina 'self harms' throughout the movie just to add salt to the wound. Her mother, an ex ballet dancer of some note seems to hold a deep inner grudge against her daughter simply for 'having her' in the first place. She plays a part that Bette Davis would have relished as the evil mother who pretends to carebut does she? Every character including her choreographer has an evil core. We are meant to see this both in reality and/or through Nina's somewhat warped mind as her world spins out of control. One moment she has scars, the next moment they are gone. Her big toe nail is split in half, hours later she is on point spinning around like a battery operated spinning top. Her nails are cut with ensuing blood, both by her mother and herself on separate occasions and the healing process is remarkable. The line between what we are meant to believe and what is in her head are as clear as mud. This girl has deep rooted problems. At this point one has to put all of the blame on the pressure her mother has put her under to be the star turn at this American ballet company. Sex rears its' head time and time again as Nina is seduced firstly by the choreographer and then by her arch rival. Her choreographer suggests that she 'plays with herself' as tonight's homework in preparation for playing the dark half of the swan. Nina masturbates at home, only to find her that her mother has been asleep in the chair next to her bed throughout this ridiculous scene, only put in the movie to cheaply sell the new naughty Natalie to her male admirers. Having won the coveted role of Swan Princess, Nina is asked to go for a drink with her arch rival who then slips her a drug cocktail, gets her hammered and then 'feels her up' on the way home in the cab. At this point you have to remember that Nina has been trying for an awfully long time to achieve this once in a lifetime roleSO..why oh why would she go out with someone she does not trust, see her drink tampered with, have this fact confirmed by her arch rival and still drink it-and most incredibly ask if the affects only last for two hours. Gullible or what? ....and all only hours before her appearance in front of a sold out house to see her perform Swan Lake. On this basis she should not be aloud into the Ballet school, let alone perform as it's star turn. Where were we? Once home, we move into a trademark Aranofsky drug fused moment as Nina dreams of making passionate hot love to her rival-or did she? Every piece of this so called ballet thriller/killer ride is littered with screen moments we have seen many times before. It cannot be stated enough to say that the beautiful music that is 'Swan lake' totally elevates the final scene of this very lightweight movie. As the music soars along with Nina as she is lifted into the air and dropped by her male lead, we hear him utter those immortal words ""what the f..k"". If the substance of the movie had been half as good as the music then we may have had a performance worthy of note. Unfortunately in this case we do not. The press release reads "" Natalie Portman spent 12 months preparing for this role, having been taught ballet from the age of 4 until she was 12"". Wow. That is so impressive. This reminds me of another dreadful ballet move made by the late Robert Altman. That was really bad, but this? Oscar pay day, just around the corner for this Swan dive."

","CAVEAT: HERE THERE BE SPOILERS. Mild ones. The functional failure here was the pattern of giving facts and taking them away, then ending by giving us a fact that isn't taken away. As a device to show a character is losing her mind, this technique has one large pitfall: seeing the finale through her eyes rather than those of a trusted observer. We don't know if we can trust what we've seen. The movie creates a pattern of physical wounds, personality conflicts, violence and death occurring, then being nullified -- not being healed or overcome, but going away ab initio, every single time. When the last act ends with another death, who's to say the victim won't pop up and be fine? After all, that's what happened every other time during the movie. Why shouldn't this death be reversed as well?<br/><br/>The actors did a great job, and the tech was excellent except for sound quality (but they may have had location problems; no big deal.) My complaint is strictly with the writer, or whoever owns that ending."

","Darren Aronofsky is certainly a talented director. PI was an intriguing debut, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM capitalised on that promise with astonishing clarity, THE FOUNTAIN was deeply flawed, but THE WRESTLER was back on track, a heartfelt, faux documentary-cum-character study of a broken man. The good news is that BLACK SWAN is another winner, a creepy and intriguing little movie that's all about the mystery.<br/><br/>Although the film is ostensibly about ballet, in reality this is one of those 'slowly losing their mind' type films a la THE MACHINIST. The type of film where the protagonist is plagued by weird visions, delusions and nightmare, a generally subtle effort punctuated by grisly little moments of wince-inducing violence. The screenplay is intelligent and mature, focusing on the characters throughout, and the movie is equally viewable in both the dialogue and dance sequences.<br/><br/>I've never liked Natalie Portman, but it's a credit to Aronofsky that she's captivating here and precisely chosen as the porcelain figure leading the show. There are some fine supporting parts as well, particularly from a spiky Mila Kunis, a suave Vincent Cassel (seriously, this man can do no wrong) and a where's-she-been? Winona Ryder. BLACK SWAN is a familiar, if great little movie and well worth a watch for film fans in that it portrays a gripping journey into the dark reaches of the human psyche."

","Many call this a psychological thriller, sometimes even a horror film. I believe it is those two, but it is mainly a psychological drama film at heart. A psychological drama with abundant symbolism and ambiguity. It is one of the most artful and beautiful films I have ever watched, and it has honestly blown me away.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays her role to sweet perfection, as do the rest of the actors and actresses. They all, especially Portman, seem to actually become the characters, and lose themselves in their roles.<br/><br/>The direction is spotless, and the camera-work is stunning. The colors and visuals are breathtaking, and the story is quite the marvel. Not everything is fully explained throughout the film; one must interpret it. The merging of the story of the film and the story of Swan Lake was flawlessly done. Also, contrary to popular belief, the film is not actually about ballet; it is about diving into the depths of insanity in order to produce perfection. The result is not pretty, but depicted very adeptly. A second viewing is recommendable.<br/><br/>A passionate film, it can be very unsettling and at times goes into horror territory, but this is just one of the things that makes this film such a delicious piece of mysterious, ambivalent, and intelligent art. Again, it is a psychological thriller, but one should look past the scary scenes and become immersed into the beauty and the message that lies beneath the surface.<br/><br/>The message that lies deep inside the water, that becomes warped and blurred, and can be read in many different ways in time. The message is still there, but not clear. Yet that makes this film so fascinating and charming.<br/><br/>Definitely 10/10 stars"

","Black Swan is a story about realization and how we discover ourselves when in new environments. Swan Queen is the role, and it takes its toll on Nina (Natalie Portman) as she struggles to release her inner darkness. Playing the lead role in this production requires both innocence and spontaneity. It is certainly not for everyone.<br/><br/>The transformation of a sweet girl into a monster is the real hook in this film. How different settings can change people is a fascinating theme, and Natalie Portman certainly delivers in portraying how good becomes evil. The plasticity of our mind; how our behaviours are so volatile at times really reflects true human nature. <br/><br/>I enjoyed Black Swan not for its acting (it was mediocre overall except for good performances from the leads), but because the story delved into the true essence of how we are all moulded by external factors. We all evolve over time, whether it be mentally or physically. And whether we accept this fact or not, Black Swan does an exceptional job in proving it."

","Black Swan is a movie about a ballet dancer who has been chosen for the role of the prestigious swan. Her instructor tells her that she is perfect for the white swan but that the black one doesn't need perfection( which she has) but feeling and losing of control. So as you might have suspected she starts to change mysterious into the black swan.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Daren Aronofsky whom you might know from ""The Wrestler"" or the superb ""Requiem for a Dream"". What anyone could see here is his confidence in handling the material. He uses lots of shaky camera work which kind of irritated me at first but I can see the importance in the long term. It gives the movie an unpleasant and daunting mood which the movie needs.<br/><br/>The movie is also very literal(but not hard to understand) which makes you admire the apt script writers. As for the acting, Natalie Portman is nothing short of breath taking. This is the kind of movie you would call a directors movie but Natalie pulls it to the other side and almost makes it an actors movie. I just couldn't imagine anyone else in this role. <br/><br/>Part of the reason i called this a directors movie is the ending which couldn't have been made better. Movies like this usually fall in to two categories by the end, she either gives a good performance or she doesn't, bur Aronofsky takes it to a whole new dimension.<br/><br/>I always say if a movie has a great script, wonderful acting and exhilarating direction it deserves to be seen. But if these three don't do it for ya, their is a sex scene between Portman and Mila Kunis......what more could you want from a movie!!!"
"Tweekums","9","2","5","30 December 2012"," A disturbing paranoid thriller
","Nina is one of the best ballerinas in the company so it is understandable that she hopes to be selected to dance the part of the Swan Queen in an upcoming performance of Swan Lake. Director Thomas Leroy has told her that she is perfect for the role of the innocent White Swan; the problem is it is a duel role that also involves playing the seductive Black Swan and he believes she just can't let herself go in the way that part demands. She is further stressed because rival dancer Lily seems perfect for the Black Swan. As the pressure builds Nina starts to lose her grip on reality in a way that could ultimately lead to her self-destruction.<br/><br/>If you sit down to watch this expecting a delightful film about the world of ballet you are in for the shock of a life time there may be plenty of dancing but this is very much a paranoid thriller about somebody losing their grip on reality in a way that is sometimes highly sexual and at others quite gruesome certainly it is one of the more disturbing films that I've seen. We see the world as Nina sees it so like her we frequently see things that aren't really happening and it isn't until later that we learn whether what we saw was real. This sense of paranoia is further enhanced by the way the camera almost constantly follows Nina around. Natalie Portman is brilliant as Nina; I'm not surprised that she won an Academy Award for her performance here. Mila Kunis also puts in an excellent performance as Lily and Vincent Cassel is good as the somewhat domineering director. The film's director, Darren Aronofsky does a great job keeping the sense of paranoia high until it peaks during the finale."
"t-filipkova","10","2","5","26 December 2012"," Beyond the metaphors
","Egocentric but amazing ballet teacher Thomas Leroy ""cursed"" young and fragile ballerina Nina Sayers into secret depths of her own soul, to find her dark, sensuous and self destructive ""I"", which is needed for dancing Odille, the Black Swan in Tschaikovsky's Swan Lake. <br/><br/>Numerous personifications, symbols and metaphors in this movie (tuning into black or white colors, the mirrors, Nina's hallucinations, turning into a Swan...) are just telling the story about how fragile can be human's psyche in unstable world like ballet scene is.<br/><br/>This is destructive journey into the soul of a young ballerina, who (I believe because she never known something more valuable than her work and her desire for perfection, and that's all she has now) decides to give up everything for perfection. And what is the price? You will see...<br/><br/>Nina's character and her change throughout movie is perfectly plotted. For example: at the beginning of the movie she wears mostly white/rosy clothes, but more the movie's coming to the end - she is turning ""more black"", it is a sign that her destructive ""I"", her psychological disorder showed up and dominated her. Her neurotic mother literally tied her as the way SHE wanted, created from her, at first sight, the perfect, fragile, decent girl, who hides inside the hurricane of repressed sexual desires and feelings of insecurity (that's why Nina's scratches herself, that's why she needs to be perfect, that's why she is obsessed with it - because that's the only thing that she is good in, that she can feel passionate about - without any feeling of guilt), which are put in the light, while she embraces the Black Swan's character. Then - the mirrors creates almost active part of the movie - they don't only complements the scenes, but also tells the story - in every scene there is a mirror or reflecting surface - except one scene - when Nina dances Black Swan. It is not accident, it is intention - Nina is watching into the mirrors, into her soul, while her reflection is often doing something else she does. Her reflection is her dark alter ego, getting out of the hidden place, getting our of the mirror - to completely dominate her. <br/><br/>Before the conclusion, everybody unconsciously knows, how it's going to end. Maybe you didn't like Nina's character, so you didn't feel sorry for her at all. But for me, the ending was really touching. <br/><br/>What more to say about this movie? Well, it's beautifully shot, well directed, well played, the screenplay is brilliant, as is the music and the composition. This is not commercial movie, but it's also not one of those ""too artistic films"" that's nobody really gets... I can call this real art (I mean real audiovisual, smart at storytelling art which are movies meant to be) for wide range of people. And, oh, it's Natalie Portman life's role, Darren Aronofsky's best film, best movie of 2010... and my second favorite. <br/><br/>The last note - if you don't like heavy psychological thrillers with self - destructive main characters, better don't watch it. But if you like it - you definitely should watch Black Swan. It's, at least for me, perfect movie."
"joaquin-olaverria","10","2","5","10 October 2012"," Excellent symbolism
","WARNING: DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPOIL A GREAT MOVIE. <br/><br/>The Black Swan is a very thought-provoking movie that shows the mental collapse of a young and stunning ballet ballerina; slowly transforming into her character in the play, Black Swan, requiring her to be a twisted, dangerous and sexual persona. The producers and the staff of this movie delivered an admirable and brilliant way to give the public an inside view into Nina's mind; therefore, giving a slowly and detailed build up until her final collapse. One of the very interesting and main techniques that they use is symbolism. Symbolism means a visual clue that foreshadows what is coming up, and has a double meaning to it, to really transmit the overall subject of a piece of literature. In this case, they want to portray the transcendence of a shy and fragile woman into an immoral and manipulative person, which eventually forces her to lose herself and attaining death. ""Perfection is not just about control. It is also about letting go. Surprise yourself so you can surprise the audience. Transcendence. Very few have it in them."" Some of these symbols are, for example, the mirrors we see Nina looking at herself and seeing someone else in her body. The purpose of this method is a repeating reminder of Nina's other 'reality'. They portray an image of Nina that seems to have ""life of her own"". Over the movie, they slowly take over Nina's self and turns her into an evil character. Lily shows the evil side of the entertainment industry, coping with a world that is able to drag people into misery by consuming their own person. In one scene, as Lily starts touching and feeling Nina, one can see the black tattooed wings on her back. In other words, showing how her role in the play makes an impact on Nina's insanity. This part shows how this sexual act penetrates Nina, giving her orgasm, but also taking her life away. One of the most remarkable scene is when Nina is about to get on the stage to perform her so wanted role in the play, she finds attacking her reflection in the mirror, and making it shatter all over her, and showing her full transformation into the Black Swan. This scene represents the final collapse of her mental stability, and the devastating take of her old self. There are many other symbols throughout the movie that shows the insanity of the character. This is truly a masterpiece that delivers a fascinating whole new outlook into the dark side of entertainment."

","I believe that this film, with little hyperbole, is quite simply an exceptional piece of film-making. So I find it necessary that I marshal my words carefully to explain why I justify such an exuberant statement. It's very important to me. <br/><br/>Upon viewing 'Black Swan' for the first time, the immediate observation was the striking resemblance to 'The Wrestler', most likely, if not undoubtedly, a companion piece. The opening prologue ignites a searing and visceral cinematic style that strides through the entire feature, much the same as in 'The Wrestler'. The whirling mix of music from Tchaikovsky to The Chemical Brothers, layered with a complex array of harrowing whispers, reversed laughters and bird noises. It generates an accomplished soundtrack that compels a melodramatic story to rise to the musics grandeur.<br/><br/>And speaking of melodrama. The story. An unnerving tale of anxiety, rebellion and fear. The narrative is based on the frail 'wall-flower' and brand new prima ballerina, Nina (Portman) in the New York Ballet Company. Who's lead in the upcoming Swan Lake is challenged by the confident and sensual 'new girl' Lily (Kunis). As the opening production looms large in the mind of Nina we see her spiral into paranoia and strange occurrences start to invade her life, a tangible inter-winding symbolism questions what is real and what seems to be delusions of an unraveling mind.<br/><br/>This dark and twisted narrative accompanied with such an emotive soundtrack could be overwhelming for a less experienced Director. But Darren's ability to create a visually breathtaking feature is unquestionable. A true feast for the eyes. The story and music seem to uproot and crystallize the mise-en-scene. The beautifully crafted choreography is captured in a lose, hand-held, style that accentuates the strength and skill required to perform in such a way. <br/><br/>It becomes evident just how remarkable Natalie Portman's performance is. Her physical appearance exaggerates her haunted mentality, her willowy form is symbolic of her frailty to corruption by the Machiavellian rival Lily (Kunis), the obsessive Mother (Hershey) and the predatory Artistic Director of the Ballet, Thomas (Cassel).<br/><br/>These antagonists shake Nina to the core during her pursuit to tread the thin line between her White and Black Swan. Metaphors for her oppression and ascendancy. The story twists, turns and crescendos throughout, and we eventually draw into a dramatic and fittingly poignant conclusion.<br/><br/>Bravo."

It's certainly not a film for everyone, as displayed by the polarizing reviews on this site. But, I find the reason that most people dislike the movie is because of its ambiguity and its refusal to give the audience clear answers. People who prefer simplicity, as well as more light-hearted fare, will finish this film feeling cheated. However, for those who can fully appreciate the intellectual and psychological aspects of the subject matter will find 'Black Swan' a treat that gets increasingly richer upon each viewing.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film is about the struggle of Nina (Natalie Portman) to play the dual role of the Swan Queen successfully, while also dealing with outside pressures from her manipulative director (Vincent Cassel), smothering mother (Barbara Hershey) and her mysterious new friend/possible rival (Mila Kunis). During this struggle, she seems to simply lose her mind and all touch with reality.<br/><br/>However, the film can be taken on many different levels: as a study of mental illness, a modern retelling of Swan Lake, a piece on the struggles and triumphs of being a performer, a cautionary tale of perfectionism, or a Jungian-flavored story about the importance of integrating one's 'shadow side'. 'Black Swan', no matter how many times you watch it, remains refreshingly open to interpretation. There is always some subtle detail or some piece of symbolism that was once undiscovered and that allows you to see the film with new eyes. When a filmmaker can achieve this, especially in this terribly predictable age of cinema, it's worth an enormous amount of respect and admiration.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent. Natalie Portman is, of course, phenomenal in her performance as Nina. Nina's inner conflicts are what arguably drive the story and Portman drives that point home, exuding an intense combination of nervous energy, insecurity, and a dormant volatility waiting to be awakened. She completely deserved her Academy Award, without question.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis is a dynamic force as Lily, giving dimension into the 'wild child' role that could've easily become a stereotype. Her character is the most enigmatic, due to Nina's distorted perception of her. Kunis plays with this ambiguity brilliantly, packing her performance with so much nuance and contradiction that it's possible to see a different Lily each time you watch it, depending on how you look at her.<br/><br/>Vincent Cassel is also pitch-perfect as Thomas, a role that could've also become caricature. But, instead of chewing the scenery, he gives us just the right amount of sliminess. Barbara Hershey is captivating and downright creepy at times as Erica, Nina's controlling mother, and Winona Ryder has a small but powerful role as aging ballerina Beth.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot by Matthew Libatique and with a haunting score by Clint Mansell (which is a modern and demented twist on the original score by Tchiavosky), 'Black Swan' is the kind of film that stays with you for days after."
"swilbor","10","2","5","10 June 2012"," Best Film of 2011?
","The first time I watched this film I didn't really know a whole lot about it, I just knew that Natalie Portman won an Oscar for her performance and that the film was set in the ballet world. Being a fairly big fan of Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman I thought you know what even if it was a ballet film I'll give it a chance it might just surprise me and when the credits started rolling I was physically shaking from how amazing and breathtaking this film was. I'm not going to go into great detail on the plot (as you can read the summary on this page) but the film follows Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) a ballet dancer who has just won the role of the Swan Queen in Swan Lake however the role starts to take over her and she begins to lose her mind and she starts to have strong hallucinations which include seeing herself in other people, this is when the film stops being a ballet film and becomes a seriously intense psychological thriller. I should point out this is not a film for everyone as there is a lot of sexual content, disturbing scenes and straight up horror that may leave some viewers with a couple sleepless nights but nothing too troubling as you will be so invested in the story it probably won't bother you. The performances in this film are brilliant the lead of which is Natalie Portman who gives the best performance that I have ever seen an actor give and fully deserved her clean sweep of best actress awards. The supporting actors also stepped up with Mila Kunis playing Natalie's alter ego in the film and giving another Oscar worthy performance. Other standout performances include; Vincent Cassell, Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey. As far direction goes I strongly believe that Darren Aronofsky should have won the Oscar ahead of Tom Hooper but hey you can't have them all. The way Darren shot the film was astounding however I have heard people complaining regarding the sex scenes and the scares but without them the film would have felt restricted and you wouldn't feel the mental insecurity that Nina is suffering so I compliment Aronofsky for having the balls to go there. Overall this is probably one of if not the best film I have ever been lucky enough to watch and I highly recommend to anyone who feels they have the mental strength to cope with it."
"christopher-colliers","10","2","5","21 May 2012"," Black Swan is not a movie it is a flawless performance ingeniously captured on film.
","This movie deserves two thumbs up, ten out of ten stars and a standing ovation. This is a work of art driven by the exploration of the human as a whole, mentally and physically, that will make you rise to the edge of your seat as you not only question yourself and reality but it will also cause you to feel a spectrum of emotions: sadness, hope, confusion all at once. This movie has the power to bring its viewers to tears because it can trap one in deep thought and leave them in admiration of the beauty and art of film, ballet, and the human, both body and mind.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman puts on the performance of her career. Her character Nina Sayers is delicately stitched together into what can be summed up as a true virgin: pure, innocent, naïve, and beautiful. Nina is the epitome of a hard worker. Nina will do whatever it takes to achieve perfection and is more than willing to put her love of ballet before her own wellbeing. The only thing Nina loves more than reaching perfection in ballet is her mother. This love has forged the way for what is truly an unhealthy relationship between a young, confused, and innocent adult and her overbearingly, obsessive, and protective mother.<br/><br/>Nina is like a helpless child at home thus making her interactions with others somewhat awkward. Nina's mother has always protected her and now more than ever, she longs to break through this protective barrier and live and experience life for the first time as an independent adult. Her mother catches on to this and she will stop at nothing to prevent it.<br/><br/>There are many reasons as to why Nina's mother is so overly protective. The one that drives the others is that when Nina's mother was around her age she had freedom. Through an unrevealed series of events, this freedom led to Nina's conception. Because of this, Nina's mother who at the time was a renowned ballet dancer, had to give up her dreams and aspirations to take care of her. This caused her to promise herself that she would never let her daughter make the same mistakes in life that she did. If she were to allow Nina to make a mistake that would put her career in jeopardy, she would no longer be able to live vicariously through her career. In her eyes, it would be a failure on her part.<br/><br/>Nina on the other hand does not see things in the same fashion. She merely thinks that her mom is jealous of her and is willing to do anything to prevent her from succeeding through achieving perfection. This becomes a form of paranoia in Nina's life that is not only present in her personal relationship with her mother but also in her daily life and relationships. This paranoia of sorts directly affects her work as she attempts to transform herself into the role of her dreams: Swan Queen. This role poetically defines Nina because it incorporates both the White Swan and the Black Sawn. Because of Nina's odd childhood and upbringings, she is more than prepared for the role of the White Swan. She already lives her life as the White Swan: pure, innocent, naïve, and beautiful. The challenge arises when she finds out that being just the White Swan is not good enough. She must become the Black Swan. In order to accomplish this she must first discover the Black Swan within and therefore discover a darker side of herself. This discovery is the only way for Nina to truly achieve perfection as the Swan Queen. As the audience, we get to see the development of the darker side of the human mind.<br/><br/>Nina spends the duration of the movie embracing The Black Swan in her life in fragments. These fragments are different aspects of her life including self-exploration, sexual confusion and desire, interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships, desire for freedom and for perfection, the gain and loss of innocence, and the gain and loss of mental stability and or reality. These aspects are also different reoccurring themes in the movie. As the movie progresses these fragments become sections or parts that when finally pieced together form Nina. Nina's completion occurs at the end during what may be her final performance ever in which she preforms flawlessly as both the White Swan and the Black Swan thus encapsulating and embodying them into one, making Nina the perfect Swan Queen."
"TheFamilyBerzurcher","9","2","5","11 March 2012"," How Far Will You Go?
","Oh, the melodrama! Oh, the self-indulgence! Oh, the decadence! Oh, the bare assumptions!<br/><br/>BLACK SWAN tells us little more than we already know -- art is difficult, (absolute) perfection isn't possible, and pressure can kill you. Despite these cliché's and the indulgent, Romantic segments, BLACK SWAN is intense. It harnesses a type of psychological depth of which only Aronofsky is capable of achieving. First of all, he makes anxiety palpable. In scenes where Nina is among all of the dancers warming up, the editing shifts in rhythm; not too quickly, not too slowly. It is like our brain switching direction. We are changing our minds with her. We are seeing our competition and knowing we are inferior. Aronofsky has a unique gift to pass stress on to the audience, especially when they're in the dark. This transferred anxiety is the price of creation. The price of beauty. In fact, what is BLACK SWAN aside from the question -- how much does perfection cost? It isn't an indictment of eating disorders and aggressive teachers, but it is an intimate document, albeit fictional, of creativity and hard work -- and what that combination is capable of. Is it in opposition to all creativity? Is Aronofsky telling people to stop working so hard? Those are all the wrong questions. The real question is: are you willing? How far are you ready to go? BLACK SWAN is ultimately a celebration, in bright white bliss, of creation and having a fatal devotion to it. The mirror. Her vanity. Her incessant desire kills her. Not work.<br/><br/>Aside from the thick thesis of BLACK SWAN, it is right to commend so many components. The camera motion is some of the best in recent history. It is as choreographed as the dancers, moving with precision and beauty. It is also a psychological unit. The camera is always on the fringe of Nina's head, a bird of prey ready to abduct her sanity.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman performs with humble brilliance. The role is an impossible one. A child. A genius. A masochist. So sheltered. The scene in which she masturbates on her bed only to see her mom sleeping close by is a nugget of gold. It shows such profound loneliness. It illuminates her sexual need for her mother because her father is gone. Was she imagining her father? It is a cinematic moment that makes movies the thing that they are. It says a million words in thirty seconds. In addition to Portman's career best, we have an encouraging performance from Mila Kunis, real or not.<br/><br/>BLACK SWAN and Aronofsky understand how much we need to understand ourselves. And how destructive that can be. Nina meets fate in the form of a mirror. It is nothing but her own vanity and obsession that kill her. Not hard work. Not looking for perfection. Nina dies for her inability to be both black and white.<br/><br/>83.8"

"peteranderson975","10","2","5","14 July 2011"," A perfect Hit
","This film has been reviewed so much I really don't think I'm going to bring anything new but I need to give it try.This is about Nina Sayer (Natalie Portman) a young ballet dancer who dreams of dancing the role of the Swan Queen in the ballet Swan Lake. It seems her dream is coming true when Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) the director of the ballet company chooses her for the role - the problem is that his production calls for the dancer dancing the Swan Queen to also dance the role of the Black Swan. Nina's obsession with technical perfection as well her withdrawn personality are gets in the way of convincingly dancing the primal seductive role of the Black Swan. Another dancer Lilly (Mila Kunis) is more fun, relaxed and sexually mature than Nina and is also the alternate choice for her role which makes Nina nervous. She also has a mother who treats Nina like a little girl, gives her no privacy and wants to know where she is every hour of the day. The pressure takes it toll on Nina who starts to hallucinate seeing fleeting glimpses of a doppelgänger.<br/><br/>Near to opening night Lilly takes Nina out drinking in defiance of Nina's mother. Lily gives Nina a drug to relax her and introduces her to a couple of men they go out for a wild night of clubbing This opens up Nina to her sexual nature and we see the Black Swan coming out in Nina more and the line between dream and reality is shattered. This builds up to the opening night where Nina opens herself up to the darkness and obsession inside herself to perform.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this I was totally floored by the last act. Nina's breakdown is subtle at the start of the film, but it builds in intensity until the neurotic dancer who started the film emerges on the stage as a complete maniac. Nina has no idea what is real any more and nor do we. I am not really sure why I got so drawn into this story. I liked that there was no sub-plot and the film concentrated on Nina allowing us to empathise with her all the way on her journey into madness right up to the last scene which was perfect. <br/><br/>Rating 10/10"
"TheHrunting","9","2","5","27 June 2011"," She's a maniac...dancing like she never danced before
","Like the ""The Wrestler,"" this is a deeply woven character study that paces as a dark drama with a young woman named Nina (Natalie Portman) at the center attempting to push herself at the expense of personal relationships and her own physicalities when a once and a life time role comes her way. You get an intimate look at the behind the scenes of a ballet dancer, from routine stretches, make-up, feet taping, auditions, music rehearsals, to the make-it-or-break-it competitive inner circle that surrounds it. The bigger the role, it's stress and then some. Some have the strength of character to make it happen, while others let the make-believe character take over too much of their personal lives.<br/><br/>Nina's self-conscious and emotionally fragile when confrontation and criticisms come speeding at her. She ducks, hides and is afraid to express how she really feels in front of others with the exception of her live-at-home mother who is a shoulder to cry on but is overprotective of her to the world at large. To Nina, the world is Ballet and nothing more. It's on her mind when waking in the morning to conversations on the phone and when meeting outsiders. She's a woman who's partly still a little girl due to her tunnel vision and this causes her to cower away and misinterpret actual meanings as something else. She was riding on a thin slope to begin with and now with the role of Swan Queen--where she has to pull off both of the opposites of White Swan and Black Swan on the same stage when it's normally just one--being presented to her she loses all perspective and starts to slowly dream up and hallucinate.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis plays Lily, which represents a wild card amongst the conformity that usually comes from the traditional background of stage dancing. She's the rebellious, spontaneous one that's able to rebound from the unexpected. Nina is a perfectionist who practiced exclusively for the role of the delicate White Swan and now that she has to learn how to also play the dark and seductive Black Swan without a hitch in between characters, she starts to look at Lily's temperamental personality as both an inspiration and a threat due to the Black Swan coming to her naturally instead. Winona Ryder's character Beth--who was a former lead who stepped down--was impressionable to Nina but now can see the after effects of how much it takes a toll. Though at that point she might have traveled too deep on a downward spiral to turn around.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" takes an artful, niche subject and etches a darker shade onto it. There's no glamor here and you have to wonder if anybody is having fun or they're just doing it compulsively due to losing the spark but still having the talent left over. It uses ballet as a backdrop for a character expose and how something can be taken so far without seeing the forest through the trees. With the exception of a few exaggerated hallucinations that nail the point home, the film was subtle and not so direct, though without being vague either due to its progressive nature. A balance was struck without analyzing the character like a garden variety lay-down-on-the-couch shrink session, but rather an unhealthy breakdown that a viewer can see unfolding before their worrying eyes. The flow is gradual, the cinematography only comes with so many effects compared to other modern pictures, and the traditional stage music is frequently used to get the feel and atmosphere of the world they've encapsulated you in. This eventually builds up to a thrilling finale to show the final act of lost innocence during the big opening night that everyone's been anticipating.

","Great start, great tempo, great tension, great acting, great development, great camera movements, and ""almost"" a great finish... . One of the best about the film is that you really feel as if you are Nina (Natalie Portman) in there actually practicing and playing the swan lake in the stage, fantastic camera angles with enough music. Aronofsky leaves the best part of the swan lake for the finish and it has a much better meaning to those who know the swan lake of Tchaikovsky because as one of those i waited for the main melody during the film and i got the best satisfaction at the very end (not considering some short passages like mobile phone melody etc) No need to criticise Natalie Portman, as she overcomed a very difficult role full of schizophrenia and sexual trials, her acting when she calls her mother about her winning the role of the swan is a forever generic. i could not forget the film even if 3 days passed and i still feel it. The only thing negative for me is that maybe -only maybe- the finish could have been more touchy, it is really simple comparing all the process. Anyway, even the finish affected me so much after some seconds of hesitations. . This is what people call ""A masterpiece""...Worths watching couple of times, simply the best of 2010."
"guy-372","2","2","5","17 February 2011"," Drug induced script writing
","If you are stoned or enjoy depraved hallucinations, this might be your kind of movie. This is a twisted script of which the story typically seems more induced by drug use than by unique imaginative writing. The script constantly strays from reality into hallucinations similar to ""Mulholland Dr."" and the end of ""A Beautiful Mind"". We follow the daily life of a ballerina being chosen for the lead ballerina part at the company's new rendition of Swan Lake. The movie includes titillating scenes of drug use, homosexuality, murder and self-mutilations, based on the main character's mental problems and drug use. We want to feel empathetic for the character's mental problems, but unlike the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"", this story never gives us a reason for the character's non-drugged hallucinations. It is presented so we naturally assume that what we are viewing is camera reality, only later to learn that it was tragic mental dysfunction-based hallucinations. We are tragically expected to believe that the character fatally stabbed herself and then twice perfectly danced ballet parts on stage before the blood showed and she collapsed with instant blood spread. The dancing artistry was enjoyable, aside from the hallucinations, the script was uncreative, but the acting was solid. But solid acting doesn't fix a sick script. Had this movie given us a reason for the woman's dysfunction and built it up, turning the movie into a tragedy, instead of an ""acid trip"", the movie might have had a society strengthening reason to exist."

","Wow. Where do I start? This is a masterpiece. The actors are great, the story is great, the visual effects are BRILLIANT, and for once, I was not bored by the ballet! <br/><br/>Natalie Portman was the perfect choice for this role as Nina, a ballerina who strives for perfection as the Swan Queen, and she deserves Best Actress. She captures the naivety and youth of the White Swan perfectly, and watching her slowly slip into madness as she is consumed by the need to be absolutely perfect as the sultry and sexy Black Swan (a role that her character REALLY has to work at) is a disturbing, unsettling, yet amazing film-watching experience. I also must mention Mila Kunis, who played Lily, a fellow ballerina (and a bad influence) who is more experienced and sexy, the perfect choice for the Swan Queen.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has proved once again that he can do no wrong. What truly makes this film a masterpiece is not Natalie Portman, but Aronofsky. Subtle foreshadowing and motifs (like a mirror being in almost every shot)and the very dark and sexual tone/theme of this film truly make it one of Aronofskys finest. I cannot recommend it higher."
"alexbrough888","10","2","5","10 February 2011"," Mesmerising
","'It was perfect'... the final words spoken in the film and you will be hard pressed to disagree. You will walk out of the cinema knowing you have just seen something special. Everything from the sound effects of the toe-cracking and the nail-clipping to the mesmerising performance from Natalie Portman just illustrate perfection from start to finish.<br/><br/>A lot of 'Requiem' can be noticed throughout; the roller-coaster of emotion that descends into insanity at such a variable rate - sometimes easing and slowing down, and then suddenly plummeting into a deep ocean of complete despair, you live it and feel it in the same way Nina does. The gradual blurring of reality and Nina's dark fantasies is a real triumph for the director.<br/><br/>Overall I think what grips you the most is the erratic pace throughout the film, much like the movements of the Swan in the ballet sometimes assured, sometimes deeply confused, often desperate. Strong themes of duality with so many layers - so much could be analysed on so many different levels, in this respect it is almost Shakespearean.<br/><br/>Truly one of the greatest films I have ever seen."
"daniel-968-134260","10","2","5","4 February 2011"," Haunting portrait of obsession
","It is not always possible for us to get close to a world we admire, or fully understand the art of obsession. As a supreme storyteller and ultimate visceral visualist, Darren Aronofsky gives as a unique opportunity to step into the shoes of a tormented ballerina in Black Swan. His intimate and haunting portrait of an artist consumed by passion and fueled by obsession, is magnificently realised by Natalie Portman, who delivers the performance of a lifetime in a role she vividly brings to life. The unison between director and performer is electrifying and sets the screen on fire. This powerful cinematic experience takes film to an exciting new level, allowing us to be fully emotionally immersed and really share the experience of the characters with sincere and brutal honesty. Aronofsky never wallows in sentimentality, rather allowing the vulnerability of his characters to take us on an unexpected and meaningful journey. It is not a film about ballet, but a film about the dance of life, delicately exploring the confrontation between the good and evil that makes us human, and exposing the fragile vulnerability of being human. Aronofsky lures us into a haunting, fractured world of delusions, doubles and paranoia in his first psychological thriller. He spins a sensual and chilling tale of a prima ballerina locked in an obsessive battle with dark impulses that slowly engulf her. It is the story of Nina (Portman), a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance."

","There isn't much new I can say in my review that isn't already said here, but I just want to add to the chorus of amazing reviews for this film because I think it deserves it.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman alone is so amazing in this film, it deserves a 10/10. As the movie progresses and she descends further and further into her internal struggles (both in her general life and in her taking on her role as the lead in the show), she embraces the role with a fervor like no other. And I simply was blown away by so many actors in this film - Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder - they all add to the dark atmosphere.<br/><br/>Lastly, from a technical standpoint, the camera work maneuvering through the dance scenes was quite an amazing spectacle to watch, and I loved the shooting style and cinematography through the whole thing, but especially when they danced. The final scenes during the play were astonishing!<br/><br/>It is also a film to watch more than once, because there is so much going on and so many little things that can be missed upon one viewing.<br/><br/>Amazing! 10/10"
"lloyd-constable-1","10","2","5","4 February 2011"," Something very special
","Black Swan is simply mesmerising.<br/><br/>From the dark dance opening sequence, this film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let you go until the bright white light at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>You many think Black Swan may be ""a movie about boring ballet"" but it is far from it. This movie is about transition, control, losing control; and questions reality and of course what it is to be perfect.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives the greatest performance in movie history as an aspiring shy ballet dancer with high ambitions. She totally engrosses the audience in her world by taking them on her journey from her humble beginnings to the heights of what it takes to become the Swan Queen in Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away the scene where she dances the black swan is simply orgasmic, such grace, power, beauty leaves you feeling like you have just experienced something never seen. <br/><br/>It's great seeing Winona Ryder in this small dark role with a nice line of ""you stole these from me?"". Also the Hershey also gives a very chilling performance as an over protective mother, something along the lines of Carrie's mother in Carrie. Also the use of CGI in this movie was really brilliant. Really subtle and adds perfectly to Nina's decent into madness.<br/><br/>I urge everyone to go see this movie. Throw away any preconceptions about ballet and prepare yourself for something very special."
"Jonathon_Natsis","8","2","5","1 February 2011"," Ballet: No longer just for girls
","It's good to be back. After going the entire holiday season without posting a single review, my timing has been lucky enough for me to return at just the right time. Yes, it's awards season again, and regardless of how I personally feel about the Academy (cough, ScorseseandDicapriogotscrewed, cough), they have selected, for the most part, ten quality films as this year's Best Picture nominees. One of these ten is Black Swan, a well-crafted psycho-erotic thriller from Darren Aronofsky, whose impressive resume includes Requiem For A Dream and The Wrestler.<br/><br/>Black Swan follows Natalie Portman's Nina, an ambitious ballerina who has just received the lead role in the company's production of Swan Lake. Of course, she couldn't earn this role without knocking off former top seed turned has-been Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder). Seeing what Beth has become having had her career inadvertently swept from beneath her, Nina begins to grow increasingly paranoid and insane herself when director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel, perhaps best known as the Nightfox from the Ocean's trilogy) selects Lily (Mila Kunis) as Nina's 'understudy'.<br/><br/>Portman is virtually flawless, and thoroughly deserves her recent Golden Globe win and subsequent Oscar nomination as Best Actress. While Kunis, as one of Hollywood's up-and-coming actresses since the end of the hugely successful That '70s Show, shows just as much poise, she is given a much smaller workload than expected. Cassel's performance became all the more impressive when I learnt that he based his character on George Balanchine, the co-founder of the NYC Ballet School and 'a control freak, a true artist using sexuality to direct his dancers'. This is a trait his character possesses in spades, and shows the actor's admirable dedication to developing his character past the mould set by the screenplay.<br/><br/>Many people cited many different directors as an influence upon Black Swan. One friend was impressed by the Goddard-esque techniques constantly employed from a cinematic perspective, while the emphasis on a single character driving the plot, rather than the other way around, was not lost on this Scorsese tragic. <br/><br/>At any rate, Aronofsky's multitude of adapted skills converge seamlessly, all working together to form a persistently suspenseful, anxious tone. Indeed, there are some moments in this film that require more brain straining than even Inception, but don't be misled. Where Nolan's masterpiece required constant attention so as to not lose track of the plot, Swan demands the same respect because we, as the audience, are found frequently questioning whether or not what we've been led to believe did in fact happen, or if it's building to something more sinister.<br/><br/>More so than the concepts of artistry, horror or psychology, this is a thematic film. To become perfect in her role, Nina is encouraged to not only personify the delicate and vulnerable White Swan, but also embrace the raw sexuality and primal fear associated with the Black Swan. Instantly, one can recognise how these polarised fictional figures represent what Nina is, and what she is slowly becoming. More importantly, the film acts as a monstrous depiction of how the pursuit of perfection can drive a normal person to utter madness.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
"missyh8997","10","2","5","30 January 2011"," Simply Stunning!!!!!!
","Most notable for films such as The Wrestler, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, Director Darren Aronofsky, has delivered a powerful film that leads you down the rabbit hole of madness. This fanciful drama pushes the boundaries of normalcy, desire and the destructive pursuit of perfection; leaving you questioning your definition of insanity.<br/><br/>Black Swan was released in 2010. It stars Oscar nominated actress Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis (That 70's Show) and Vincent Cassel (Ocean's Thirteen). The story follows a Ballerina named Nina (Portman) who has won the lead role in a performance of Swan Lake. Nina is the personification of the Swan Queen; Princess Odette but she lacks the passion and intensity of Odile, the evil sorcerers' daughter. Thomas (Cassel), the director of the performance, see's that Nina can perform both roles and pushes her to let herself go; by any means that he sees fit. He keeps his eye on another dancer in the company, Lily (Kunis). She is everything that Nina is not. She's seductive, impulsive and dangerous to Nina's ambitious yet fearfully controlled life. Consumed by the idea of perfection Nina slowly begins to unravel and descends into an abyss of insecurity and uncertainty.<br/><br/>Aronofsky, has used his trademark directing skills to make you feel like you are apart of the film. Whether it is his use of sounds being heard but not seen on the screen or shooting scenes in fast motion, the direction was executed exquisitely. Visually breathtaking! The score was tearfully beautiful yet unnerving all at the same time. The music undeniably enhanced all the emotion and suspense created by all the talent that went into this film. Every performance in this film, in my opinion, is flawless. Every emotion that I can think of was invoked by this film. Each character was believable and intriguing. I was pleasantly surprised at Mila Kunis's performance. Only having seen her in ""That 70's Show"" my expectations were not very high. She was amazing and I look forward to seeing her in future films.<br/><br/>The only thing that I'm going to say that is negative is my own personal pet peeve. I felt that in the first half of the movie, the plot was playing out a little too slowly for my taste. With that being said, I would still give two tremendous thumbs up for this film. It's a must see and deserves any and all nominations it receives."
"mcsuedois","10","2","5","29 January 2011"," A beautiful and clever masterpiece
","I tried to find a reason to give this film anything less than a full 10, but failed. We must celebrate the making of films like Black Swan.<br/><br/>The drama revolves around the young ballet dancer Nina (Portman). Through her, we are invited to follow the physically and mentally trying life of a professional dancer, through repetitions, auditions and - finally - performance. The director and the cinematographer very cleverly brings us close to Nina - both emotionally and visually. (The cinematography is in itself a worthwhile reason to watch this movie.)<br/><br/>This closeness is sustained throughout the film, keeping the audience on their toes as the plot unfolds - never really knowing what to expect. The psychological credibility of the characters furthermore makes it almost impossible not to be drawn into the drama.<br/><br/>Those things would not have been possible, however, without nothing less than outstanding acting on all parts. Reading about Portman's preparation for the role just confirms the feeling you get when watching the film - that this is a work of great skill, professionalism and passion.<br/><br/>Last but not least the beautiful soundtrack of the film is worth mentioning. It is - of course - Tchaikovsky's original music, which has been altered to some degree to fit the feature, albeit in a clever, tasteful and unobtrusive way.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this beautiful and intelligent film."
"dromasca","9","2","5","29 January 2011"," a study in perfection and madness
","'Black Swan' is about art and obsession, is about sanity and madness, it's about perfection and genius, all this described in the world which can be so mistakenly perceived of classical ballet. A world in which the spectator is supposed to get the feeling of fluidity and lack of gravity, of lightness and perfection of movement. However these are acquired by years and sometimes a lifetime of pain in which everything needs to be put aside for the seek of the unique moment of art on stage. Including ones own self.<br/><br/>The film starts as a very tightly told story of the art and rivalry in the ballet world. While it develops as a story that without becoming really boring seems to focus too much on the technical issues of the profession and the personal challenges of a young woman who needs to sacrifice all to get on the top, it plants in its first hour the elements of incertitude and build-up of the final segment. Aronofsky plays permanently with the viewers the game of mixing and swapping perceptions between objective and subjective reality. It is not easy viewing and this is on purpose. There is a lot of suffering on screen and most of it is not physical. In order to reach the peaks an artist needs to master the dark side of its art and personality. But when darkness is awaken can it still be kept under control? The balance between art and obsession, between perfection and madness is the ultimate theme of this film. Reaching the peaks of art may demand the descent into the abyss of insanity.<br/><br/>Unless a colossal misjudgment intervenes Natalie Portman will hold a statuette by the end of the Oscars night. She deals with an extremely complex role which demands a permanent balance between ingenuity and ambition, fragility and strength of character, loneliness and dedication to art. Of her partners I enjoyed mostly the performance of Vincent Cassel who provides to Portman the mirroring context of her ambition to reach the top of art.<br/><br/>When I was a young kid I used to love the animal numbers in circus. Then I read one of Jack London's novels which described the behind-the-scenes of animal training in circus. I never could watch such a show in the arena with the same eyes. I am afraid that folks who love ballet may go though the same risk after seeing 'Black Swan'. They may have seen also one of the most unusual and best films about ballet ever made."

"Jerique","9","2","5","25 January 2011"," A masterpiece for 2010...
","I will say this, Natalie Portman deserves her Golden Globe and (if she gets it) an Oscar too for her performance. I've been watching Natalie for years. I first came to notice her in Star Wars: A Phantom Menace, and have seen her become a serious actress with V for Vandetta and The Other Boleyn Girl.<br/><br/>However, I wasn't inclined to see Black Swan because I thought she was a sure-fire candidate for a Golden Globe or Oscar. The fact she won surprised me, and thus with all the hype, I had to see the movie.<br/><br/>Black Swan is an adaptation of the story ""Swan Lake."" Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers and her female opposite is Mila Kunis (from Family Guy and That 70's Show fame). They chose two actresses that look devastatingly alike and at times it's very hard to tell them apart. Nina gets the role of Swan Queen in the new Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) ballet of Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder has a small cameo as the retired ballet lead Beth Macintyre, but takes a backseat to the plot of Kunis and Portman's rivalry. As far as cinematography goes, it's not the greatest of films...but it's not the worst. I sincerely hope it doesn't win Best Picture nor Best Cinematography at the Oscars. It's not that it doesn't deserve awards...it's just not the best of 2010 in my eyes.<br/><br/>I did enjoy it a lot more than expected. I think the score is unbelievably great and the lighting does a great job of building a suspense in a few key scenes, but basically this is a showing of Portman's acting skills.<br/><br/>It's got a lot of thrilling parts, almost like a horror, but it plays out as more of a drama. There is a sex scene that may not be suitable for anyone under 14. But, overall, it's quite an amazing film. Definitely a top five film for me for 2010. It's going to be one of the best films of all-time for me. Don't miss it."
"Eternality","9","2","5","25 January 2011"," Black Swan secures Aronofsky's position as arguably the most formidable American filmmaker working today.
","If Stanley Kubrick ever made a film about a ballerina obsessed with perfection, and as a result, she suffers physically and psychologically, that film would probably look like Black Swan. But having said that, Black Swan is very much Darren Aronofsky's own work, a film that is so intoxicatingly beautiful and such an immersive, and I dare say, hallucinatory cinematic experience that it is difficult to leave the theater with all your sanity intact. A cross between Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes (1948) and Kubrick's very own The Shining (1980), Black Swan is a psychological horror-drama that will leave viewers floored.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Nina in perhaps her most demanding lead role to date. She rises up to the task in a tremendous performance of grace and vulnerability. Nina is a ballerina seeking for a chance to succeed. She gets the part of Swan Queen in a new-age reworking of Swan Lake. She plays the White Swan with utmost elegance. But it is the role of Black Swan that troubles her. Her ballet coach Thomas (Vincent Cassel) tells Nina to let herself go, to feel her own body, and to surrender herself to the darkness of that role.<br/><br/>Sexually repressed and living with an overbearing (and possibly) incestuous mother, Nina is haunted by the increasing frequency of dark thoughts. The arrival of Lily (Mila Kunis), her alternate to play Swan Queen, threatens her mental well-being. After all, Lily is everything Nina is not; the former eases into the role of Black Swan effortlessly too. It is very easy to sympathize with Nina, who is externally pressured by her mother, Thomas and Lily, and internally tormented by psychological insecurities, but Aronofsky's wildly imaginative and occasionally detached directing style allow ample room for viewers to be engaged intellectually as well.<br/><br/>Like Nolan's Inception (2010), and Scorsese's Shutter Island (2010) before that, Black Swan is a trip down the deepest recesses of a character's mind, except this is a near psychedelic one. With scenes of look-away violence, non-arousing lesbian intimacy, and fantastical horror imagery, Aronofsky does not pull back on the punches as he conceives a visceral film of such frightening power that it hits viewers straight in the gut. There are moments that would make even the most seasoned horror fan jump in fear.<br/><br/>Black Swan also features an astonishing score by the underrated Clint Mansell, who rearranges Tchaikovsky's music and fuses it together with his own, providing the film with a unique sound design that aptly accompanies Nina's descent to madness. The unpredictable nature of the film, and the nightmarish approach to what is essentially a simple story about a woman losing her mind not only make this one of the most special film experiences of the year, but also secure Aronofsky's position as arguably the most formidable American filmmaker working today.<br/><br/>GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."
"shamsee","8","2","5","24 January 2011"," Runaway Tragedy
","Exhilarating! That says a lot about a movie about ballet, about done to death ballet, and about a tortured mind of an introvert girl.<br/><br/>I suppose when I do get to see a ballet, I would have much greater appreciation of the hard-work and dedication to their craft that goes behind the scenes.<br/><br/>As for rest of the movie, it is brilliantly made. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, because the character of Natalie Portman is a good person, so it is our natural inclination to wish a positive and happy outcome for her. However, since she is descending into madness, the suspense arises from the fact, whether she would hurt herself, or would she make it, and resolution of this fact is what gets your full attention.<br/><br/>Since she is called upon to perform a role that is complete opposite of her entire being, and the fact that only if she successfully transforms herself from a completely noble Swan Queen, to her diametrically opposite character of completely evil Swan swine, can she successfully make it, the audience is almost drawn into rooting for her to embrace darkness, so the real her can succeed.<br/><br/>There can be endless discussion of what went behind her psyche and caused complete breakdown, but it is safe to say, there were plethora of reasons. A Mom who is living through her vicariously, and to whom she doesn't want to disappoint, a Mom who has unintentionally sheltered her, and her normal development as a woman has not taken place, her limited world of home and studio, her lack of any real friends, her lack of sexual maturity, her fear of failure, her self-imposed trauma of achieving perfection, and lack of any helpful or consoling voices.<br/><br/>The Director of the ballet clearly lays out what Swan lake is about, and how it ends in suicide of heartbroken innocence, and it is clear to everyone, that this ballet would have no different ending. You go in expecting tragedy, sadness and self-destructive behavior, and still the actual suffering and pain shown in the movie, far exceeds your expectation. As an audience member, you feel helpless, as there is not even slightest hope of positive outcome.<br/><br/>The most beautiful and exhilarating sequence is when Portman's character is actually transcends her pure nature, and is able to touch the darkness. She makes it clear to her Director that whether she is late or not, and whether she is feeling good or bad, it is her role, and she will do it, unless he wants another controversy on his hand, like the retiring ballet dancer, character of Winona Ryder, who he knows jumped in front of a car on purpose. This is sort of a blackmail and it actually gives hope to people rooting for her, as you believe now she can successfully play the role of black swan.<br/><br/>The filming of the actual scene of black swan for the first show is just beautiful and brilliant. They show how she transforms, growing one feather at a time, and how her eyes dilate and become read, her snake like movement of her head, the force of negativity she exudes, is all brilliant. Then of course we find out, that our choice are either dead heroine or a fallen heroine, who has committed a murderer. It is better that she did not become a deranged murderer and the hurt she inflicted, was on herself.<br/><br/>Since this is a runaway tragedy, one wonders what can we salvage from this movie? I suppose that a moment of peace that she felt, right before her demise, knowing she reached perfection in her craft, to which she devoted her life, is something positive that one can latch to. Yes it is grasping at the straws, but the only way her tortured mind was going to find any peace, this might be her happy ending."

Natalie Portman has shown what a truly great actress she is going to be and Mila Kunis has come so far from her role as Jackie (that 70's show) aside from the acting the writing was phenomenal hats off to Mark Heyman The direction by Darren Aronofsky is somewhat like The Wrestler but much much more matured Barbara Hershey did a fantastic job as Ninas mother and it has been good to see Wynona Ryder back working I rate this movie higher if the rating went higher"
"markgorman","10","2","5","23 January 2011"," Wonderful. An Oscar certainty.
","Black Swan is the most visceral cinematic experience I've had since maybe Raging Bull. So, it's about ballet? So what. Ballet is merely the structure on which this tragedy about mental breakdown, maybe schizophrenia is played out.<br/><br/>Using the metaphor of black and white (the swans) to portray, good and evil, right and wrong, strength and weakness director Darren Aranowski paints a picture of what's going on in the head of Natalie Portman as she gradually falls apart under the pressure of preparing to dance Swan Lake; with a backdrop of a doubtful choreographer, an ambitious understudy, a jealous mother and a fallen Prima ballerina; all exerting pressure of one sort or another on the poor little virgin that is Portman.<br/><br/>Portman delivers a tour de force (Oscar certainty) performance as she wrestles with the devils in her mind and tries to prove all the doubters wrong. It's a remarkable performance in so many ways, so vulnerable (which could just have been fey) and yet so strong. Surely the Academy can look no further.<br/><br/>But the real star of the show - notwithstanding powerhouse performances from Barbara Hershey (wonderful as the mother), Winona Ryder in a Mommie Dearest descent into her own madness, Vincent Cassel (as the unforgiving choreographer and philanderer) and Mila Kunis as the threat from the Corps de Ballet - is director Darren Aronofsky. My God, another huge contender for Academy recognition. His direction of Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler was eye opening, but this moves him onto yet another level. He is garnering a reputation for bringing mental instability to the screen in a way that is eye opening and shocking.<br/><br/>And that's another thing about this move, it's a quite thrilling shock fest. There's a bunch of ""gotcha"" moments that have you ducking for cover (quite a few shrieks were let out in our relatively small audience) as he makes the most of the ability to confuse and wrong foot his audience.<br/><br/>And then there's the sex. I'll not go into detail here, but it is a central motif of the film (starting from the premise that Portman is a 24 year old virgin) and is certainly worthy of debate, but I don't want to spoil it for you here.<br/><br/>All I'll say is that sitting next to my 16 year old daughter as it played out made for a degree of discomfort! All in all this is a truly outstanding piece of film-making. In Darren Oronofsky we have one of America's next great directors really cementing his claims for greatness and Natalie Portman never has, and never will, have a part this great again.<br/><br/>Go see.<br/><br/>Do NOT wait for the DVD, it will not be the same."
"siderite","9","2","5","23 January 2011"," To hell and back
","Hard to discuss the subject of the movie without giving it away. I suggest anyone wanting to see a powerful, tenseful movie to watch this, without reading any reviews. However, it is one of those films that remains strong even when you know what its subject is.<br/><br/>Ironically enough, it is about a great performance and it is expressed cinematographically via a great performance, that of Natalie Portman. I can't imagine how it was for her to actually play the role, but it must have been a little terrifying. The transition from ballet role to real life role and back again is shattering the actual person inside, the one that only wants to feel perfection and become complete through art.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it is a frighteningly beautiful film, one that expresses the inner hell of a person that everyone around puts pressure on. It might be too hard to witness, but it is a great movie."
"reedsligar","10","2","5","22 January 2011"," Absolutely Brilliant
","Darren Aronofsky is by far one of my favorite directors. I saw ""Requiem for a Dream"" about a month ago and I was thoroughly impressed. When I saw that he had directed Black Swan, I had to go see it. I saw this film in December when it first came out on limited release. I was once again blown away by Aronofsky's unique style that is unlike any other director's. The premise of the film is something that everyone can relate to, which is the pursuit of perfection. Aronofsky portrays it in such an dark, eccentric, brilliant fashion that the film becomes alive like no other. The acting was incredible, so you were able to get inside the minds of the characters. Everything in this film was flawless. I hope to see much more work from Aronofsky in the future. Reed Sligar"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","2","5","22 January 2011"," My pick for the best film of 2010
","Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" is a psychological thriller concerning a ballet dancer who is awarded a challenging dual role in a production of ""Swan Lake"". She's ideal as the innocent White Swan but in order to successfully portray the Black Swan she must tap into her dark side. Soon, the stress begins to take its toll and the line between fantasy and fact becomes blurred.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman has gotten rave reviews for her performance here and rightly so. She adroitly handles her character's transformation, from initial fragility to increasing neurosis. She recently won a Golden Globe for her performance and I suspect that an Oscar will soon follow. Mila Kunis has also received some attention but I found her performance pretty unremarkable next to those by Barbara Hershey & Vincent Cassell.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's direction is expertly handled and, like ""The Wrestler"", it's not overly showy like his earlier efforts. He'll undoubtedly be in contention for an Oscar and, while I doubt he'll win, he'd be a deserving winner. Meanwhile, the quality cinematography and special effects help to bolster the film's attractiveness. Clint Mansell's bold score also deserves mention since it's an essential part of the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Black Swan"" will probably not appeal to everyone but I found it to be an absorbing, thought-provoking movie anchored by a standout performance from Portman. In my opinion, ""The Social Network"" and ""The King's Speech"", while good movies, are no match for this one as the year's best."
"TOMNEL","9","2","5","20 January 2011"," This is a very well done film in almost every respect, except for the story.
","Director Darren Aronofsky knows what he's doing, as does actress Natalie Portman, and pretty much everyone else in this film. These people are artists who take this material and transform it into something beautiful. The script is good too, when it comes to dialogue and character development. But, the real question is, does this plot need to be told? The story of a woman becoming mentally unhinged has been told numerous times before, and in some films (Mulholland Dr.) the story actually was quite similar. Now, I'm not saying we need all original films, because at this point, that's near impossible to find, but the question this film raised was ""Why was this made?"" Perhaps to show the beauty of the dance, or maybe to show how stressful dance is on the dancers...hard to tell. The simplistic nature of the plot layout bumped this down a notch for me, but it still stands as one of the best of 2010 for every other aspect of the film.<br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman) finally is able to live her dream out and play the Swan Princess in her dance company's production of Swan Lake, but she isn't tapping into her dark swan enough. The movie follows this character's descent into darkness, and into insanity. <br/><br/>The performances here were fantastic. Natalie Portman definitely should be a front runner for the Oscar for this one, because she comes off as very believable. Many good actresses would play the role well, but not be able to pull off gaining empathy from the audience. Portman is walking a tight rope here playing a character bordering on irritatingly passive, and then frustratingly aggressive and uncaring, and she still can pull in the audience to care for her, and that's a skill. Mila Kunis gave a fine performance, and Barbara Hershey was good, but the other standout performance was Vincent Cassel as the dance instructor. He's another character that is hard to figure out. Is he a complete jerk, or is he doing what he does for a legitimate reason? Either way, Cassel was great.<br/><br/>The direction was stellar. The staging was excellent, and the camera felt like an actual player in this film. Never did we get static and boring shots. Everything was alive, and the camera-work, staging and direction was a large part of that. In it's own grungy looking way, the film also looked beautiful. It was more gritty than most nowadays, but it gave it an atmospheric style that only worked to help it. <br/><br/>Now, the problem arises in the writing, but not in the dialogue, or the character motivations, or any kind of logic flaw. The dialogue was all natural enough, and the pace flowed nicely. This film just felt like there was nothing to get out of it. Nina wanted perfection, and she was going crazy, with interludes of ballet and talking...that's what this film is. There's very little to it, and perhaps more could have been done with the mental breakdown itself, because here, it just made it look like Nina was crazy from the start, period. And she really had no reason to go insane. She was doing all this to herself. I'm not one who believes films should all have a message, but at least this film should have had a purpose to tell this story. The story itself had very little new in it, though certainly many elements were fresh in it. It's almost like the purpose of this film is to show dancing, and a woman going crazy, and nice choreography along with good music. It's hard to place what makes this film not as great as it could be, but it definitely lies in the plot. It lies in a lack of subtlety in the breakdown itself, and a lack of motivation in the plot. This same plot has been told, and why should we care more this time? Other than this underlying feeling that there needed to be something more, this was an excellent film.<br/><br/>The Black Swan boasts excellent direction, performances, choreography, and an interesting look into our protagonist's very disturbed little mind. The problem with the film is the familiarity of this plot layout, and the lack of anything new to the ""woman's mental breakdown"" plot (other than the ballet aspect). But, if one can forgive that aspect of the film, then this film does indeed reach near-perfection.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 105 mins. R for sexuality, violence, drug use and language."
"timeformime","9","2","5","19 January 2011"," Lovely, chaotic masterpiece.
","Critics who don't get this movie or old prudes need not apply. This is one of the most beautifully chaotic yet intelligent movies I have ever seen. As long as you have good taste and a functioning brain you'll like it, and especially so if you are an artist yourself because it gives you, not so much a comment or exploration (fast becoming a cliché in the critical world), but a feeling of art and the excesses to which artists willingly go for their art. This is why I have a feeling some critics didn't ""get it."" Critics too often calculate and add up too much to recognize their own feelings about a movie, and frequently judge a movie based on its adherence to a particular formula, but this movie tosses away a formula and creates its own impressionistic view of a situation, much like Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream.<br/><br/>There is an added bonus if you are an artist who has given themselves to a project and sacrificed something for it, because this movie shows you the extremes to which you can go for that feeling of having done your job to perfection. As an actor I sympathize mostly with Nina's desire to be perfect and to successfully fulfill her director's wishes, and I'm sure it would apply to so many other fields of creative art.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, it is a melodrama, and I would compare its tone to the books of Dostoevsky, only with less dialogue and more chaotic dance. It's really quite Russian, as ballet was embraced by the Russians more than many other countries, and let's face it, no one else has matched Fyodor's skill for introspective melodrama in any medium. The end result is that the tone and the subject seem made for each other. Nina is consumed by one zealous focus similar to Alexei Ivanovich, and the style added by Aronofsky's direction makes it totally his. The fast editing, mesmerizing dance choreography, and excellent score made me dizzy, and that was exactly the point.<br/><br/>But the one thing that made it truly great as opposed to a beautiful disaster was Natalie Portman. Good God, she gave herself to this role and jumped into the deep end. It's a lovely thing to see an actress these days with talents to match her beauty, and as evidenced in Leon, Natalie has always had talent, but she seemed to have left it at home for a while. Well, all her other roles were warmups compared to this. Paychecks to make it to this script. So haters gonna hate, but you will love or at least appreciate this movie if you let it take you away to another world, or in the case of this one, into someone's eff'd up but utterly fascinating mind. All who love art and good movies go see this now!"

"adaringdo-1","7","2","5","17 January 2011"," What I don't like about films like this.
","The acting is superb and the music enchanting. BUT If you want to read about further praises of this film, there are many good reviews. The problem I have with this film is very extreme and it's something many artsy films end up doing that I find very cowardly: SPOILERS FOLLOW: The logic of this film would lead some (like me) to believe that Nina (the main character) wasn't cast as the lead dancer at all. When the director told her he gave the role to someone else... well, he did and all the rest that followed was her delusional state.<br/><br/>How can I say that? In the opening sequence Nina is dreaming she has the part. How do we know all that follows isn't a dream as well? Because the director didn't have the consideration to give us something solid to determine what's what. In the end he leaves us with this confusing ending that couldn't possibly have happened. The ending must have been a delusion since you can't dance with a gaping stomach wound. So we must invent a reality on our own. That is a cruel joke to play on an audience. At the very least the ending needed to show some clue as to what was real and what was imagination. That is what great movies do and that is why this movie falls short.<br/><br/>An artistic person might be able to dismiss the illogical and accept the ""feelings"" of distress the movie portrays, but in the end there is no way to determine the world (or the actions) of the film. This is unacceptable to me and it shows a careless intent by a director who isn't willing to make his narrative clear.<br/><br/>With that I give this a 7, but by no means is this a best picture award film. Best acting... perhaps."

Like a breath of fresh air. It plays with your mind at the highest level and in the end, gives you a great satisfaction. This one is surely one of the films of the year. A certain nominee for Oscars.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is my cherry on top of the cake here. Whether it's a comedy, a drama, a thriller, she always wins my heart. So cute and so likable. She shines throughout the movie. I knew she's great, she proved that again. Mila Kunis was a big surprise. I felt like I was loving two women on the screen same time. Oh man, she was so hot. But not only sexy, she gave a great performance as well. Vincent Cassel seemed like he is not an actor. More like a real life artistic director.<br/><br/>The movie makes you think how hard it is to live in the frames. When you finally are able to get out of these frames, you could be a different person. Like your other side comes up and takes over. This a a mind stuff."
"ilovelctr","6","2","5","12 January 2011"," Visually exciting and offers real horror, but over-scripted/directed and may seem contrived
","First let me start by saying that I didn't like the film much, but didn't dislike it much either. Rating a movie 7 in my benchmark means that I think it's worth watching for many other people, while certain people like me won't like it.<br/><br/>While being labeled as a psychological thriller, the film has some horror and fantasy elements, which however, won't be that horrifying for any thriller fan. So it means any average audience is good to go and see this. But as I judge it from my personal view, the film's probably not going to appeal to those who don't like Shutter Island or Muholland Dr. However, it doesn't mean that Black Swan shares the same kind of twist as they do, by which I mean, the story's surely different.<br/><br/>The overall feeling that I got from watching this film is that, the director and the script writers put tons of efforts to reflect the main character's psychological inner world. However, it falls flat for some reasons: First, the trick is pretty much a cliché. It's like old wine in a new bottle. The majority of shots telling her psychological responses are a depiction of what she thinks, which don't interact much with and affect the ""real"" outside world or real persons out there, and this brings about little true substance to the movie itself and the idea it tries to express. Second, Black Swan sure has got its emotional content but from time to time it seems to be overdone. Though I don't deny the fact that Natalie Portman delivered a good performance, the acting itself seems rather overdone due to the overdone script. And her switch to the black swan that she's been longing for seems kind of tacked on only for the benefit of offering some visual excitement.<br/><br/>While looking it on the bright side, many would love to see the inner spirit of a struggling soul. Black Swan did it deeply with a large amount of dedicated scenes. It'd be good as long as you didn't mind the trick being old. The music and shooting are both great, and the final dance sequence is enjoyable, both technically and artistically. Speaking of this, shooting the sequence could be a real tough job, which the crew handled flawlessly. Also, on the whole, the film has a very dark tone, which gets you glued as long as you are inclined to.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an emotional journey that might drive you on, going for the film will never be a wrong choice. But if what you prefer is a clever story with witty twists, or something that's truly trying to EXPLORE rather than SHOW the so-called psychological stuff, you have to have a second thought before going to the cinema."

","This movie gets into your head right from the start and stays there - for days after. The dynamic and character development between Kunis and Portman (besides being super-hot) is deep and makes the film worth seeing on its own. But Portman - this may be her best effort yet. I rarely forget when I'm watching a famous actor play a role, but in this case I really did. Her transformation is not only convincing, but both disturbing and fun at the same time. That's not an easy combo to imagine, let alone pull off, but she nails it. An exceptionally well-produced film, the Oscar talk is absolutely warranted. I would highly suggest seeing this one in a good theater - the cinematography, ballet choreography and music deserve the giant screen and killer speakers. On a side note, I can't wait to check out executive producer Tyler Thompson's follow-up effort - a remake of a the classic 1989 UK ghost story, ""The Woman in Black."""

","I must say I first became a Natalie Portman fan from her film The Other Boelyn Girl, and after viewing this film I do not regret it. I was only impressed with her before but now I am absolutely convinced that she is a star in the making. I also must say that Natalie Portman is in a position to earn an Oscar for her outstanding performance in this film. Everything about this movie was just absolutely superb, the acting, the dialogue, plot I MEAN EVERYTHING. The transition she made from being the white swan to becoming her ruthless, dark alter ego the black swan was simply amazing! I can ramble on for days at how great this film truly is and how as an actor she captures every moment and demands the spotlight. Mila Kunis as a co-star was also simply amazing to watch on screen. Together they made this story both compelling and engaging. I am a huge fan of psychological thrillers and this film helped to remind me why, I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. I do not want to give away to much information, just letting everyone know that this is a great night out and a DVD I do one day intend to own........"

","OK, I can accept the fact that this had excellent acting and an excellent score, but why in the world is it on IMDb's top 250 # 48? Natalie Portman deserves the Oscar for her nearly perfect performance as the disturbed ballet dancer. I really thought it was even frightening to see her self-destruction for the 2 hours of the film, but I don't think this film should be in the position that it is in this moment. Better films this year include Social Network, Tangled, Toy Story 3 and Inception. It is a very dark film too, I don't recommend it for anyone who can't stand films with similar topics. Anyway, I'll give it a 7 out of 10. Good job, Natalie Portman."
"anachronaut","10","2","5","31 December 2010"," It's about a dancer with metaphors to convey emotions.
","This would be my vote for the best movie of 2010. Nothing else I have seen even comes close.<br/><br/>The movie concerns a dancer, Nina, who has done nothing but dance her entire life. This is partly the doing of her mother played very well by Barbara Hershey. Nina's mother is very protective and controlling were her daughter is concerned and seems to have little else in her life. It becomes clear during the movie that she is somewhat living vicariously through Nina, and her success. The relationship that Nina has with her mother is very important because it is as narrow and single minded as Nina's pursuit of dance. Nina's mother has so controlled and narrowed her life that Nina is completely innocent in the ways of the world. This ""stage mother"" has created the ""perfect"" dancer.<br/><br/>Nina is happily dancing in a very professional dance company when the opportunity comes dance Swan Lake. She has dreamt of becoming the white swan before she knew that the company was planning this production. This is the first important — and the only really obvious — metaphor in the movie announcing her profound innocence. Nina ends up getting the role of the swan queen, but learns that in this version she must dance both the white swan and the black swan.<br/><br/>The remainder of the movie is about Nina struggling to dance the role of the black swan. To no one's surprise, the white swan role is easy for her. To live her dream of becoming a prima ballerina, she must be able to dance this role. She succeeds wonderfully, dancing better than she has ever danced, or was capable of dancing until this point. Her mother, who shows during several scenes, that she does love her daughter and is trying to help, is very pleased.<br/><br/>Many people will misunderstand the portrayal of Nina's struggle to mature into this role. She must reject the complete control of her mother, but not her mother's love (very tricky). She must learn something about sexuality, both within herself and with the male dancers that she must seduce on stage. She must learn to assert herself.<br/><br/>How to you show emotional turmoil and angst on a movie screen? How do you show the maturing of a girl into a woman? The writers and director of this film chose to convey this with a metaphor of psychosis. It is difficult at times to separate the metaphors which convey Nina's emotional awakening and maturing with actual events. We all have strange and random thoughts at times inside our own heads, and seeing Nina's portrayed so viscerally can be disturbing.<br/><br/>Please see this movie, or see it again and realize that it has a happy ending. In the end Nina has become what her and her mother most desired, the prima ballerina. Don't be fooled into thinking all the blood and other things are real. These are metaphors which should allow you to see into Nina's emotions. I am a very emotional and empathic person. I cried at several points during the movie and was absolutely sobbing at the end. Not because it was sad, but because it was so happy. The communication of emotional content by the movie was more than I could easily handle, and much more than any movie I can recall seeing in a very, very long time."
"Vitarai","10","2","5","29 December 2010"," Perfecting the Dance
","One of the best films of 2010, and for that matter the past few years. ""Black Swan"" is dark, disturbing, and beautiful. It is a focused film about one of the most demanding art forms: ballet. The ballerina, especially the prima ballerina must be in the most fit of physical conditions, and because it also demands so much expressive emotion the mental state of the dancer must always be affected by the stress and rigorous preparations necessary for a bravura performance. All of this is so artfully conveyed by the director Darren Aronofsky it seems almost effortless.<br/><br/>The film conveys the physical ordeal the dancer goes through, and literally represents the mental transformation of the main character who is tasked with playing both the White and Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's masterpiece Swan Lake. Natalie Portman is mesmerizing as Nina. She is virtually on screen throughout the film, often shot from behind to emphasize the first- person nature of the story. Aronofsky could not have chosen a more appropriate actress to portray his Prima Ballerina in the making. In fact the casting in this film is impeccable all the way around. Even the small roles give us a sense of authenticity from the other chorus girls, to the instructors, and massage therapist. Barbara Hershey as the cloying mother, Mila Kunis in a breakout performance as the ""other girl/swan"", even Winona Ryder's minor role as the deposed ballet star stands out in this strong ensemble piece.<br/><br/>It is as if each of the primary women in the film are different representations of the same psyche, so it seems clear the director needed a strong troupe of actors capable of giving and playing with and off each other in ways that would keep the audience on edge and at ease with how the story would be told. Vincent Cassel portrays the proto-typical arrogant ballet director, and yet somehow seems understated in doing it. This is a gifted actor we should see more of, and the director did a magnificent job keeping the tensions right at the edge. He and the other men all seem to have designs on Nina, and just like the women in the film seem to meld into one another.<br/><br/>The film is about mirroring, performing, becoming. Much of the film is shot either from behind the actors, or through mirrors, so what we are seeing is always but a reflection of reality. We are never quite sure if what we see in ""Black Swan"" even happens. Even in the last shot we are left to wonder if what transpires is real, or imagined, but we are sure that what we have seen is the perfection of art."

","First things first: Aronofsky's directing in Black Swan reminded me of Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"". Certainly one could argue that this impression stems from the delusional nature of both female protagonists, but I would argue that it's the undertone that makes them similar. <br/><br/>Apart from this, perhaps coincidental, likeliness Black Swan raises the bar significantly. For it is not only a story of a person so much obsessed with their work that she would die to become perfect, it is an allegory of art itself. <br/><br/>Nina maintains her struggle throughout the entire movie. The discipline she shows in getting closer towards her goal ends with her being in frustration about getting further away from expectations, especially when she struggles the hardest. Only when she gives up her perfect self- containment she can experience her tormented self to the fullest. <br/><br/>Her nature is one of a solitaire. She stands alone, has no trust or feelings for anyone and all that counts is perfection in an imperfect world. For everybody else this is just a ballet piece after all. The Swan Lake - which becomes really clear in the end. To Nina this is war. A battle raging inside her, forcing her to battle elements she had hidden away, pretending, or even believing herself, that the life of the white swan is her choice in life. <br/><br/>The duality of nature displays in everything that surrounds us. Opposite pairs make up our entire life and we are never just one or the other. But oppression of one side may very well lead to the other side taking over for good. Chaos reigns and order retreats. <br/><br/>This movie is so much more than I expected and it gives me hope for future movies. Hope that movies can be more than entertainment and that they can touch upon the very foundation of what makes us human. <br/><br/>I can see why this is a movie that people, who want to believe just half of the truth will despise. There is no black and white in Black Swan, there is only black or white. This fine piece of art can be an allegory to everyone, who gives in to hatred and single-mindedness. Nina is not a heroine in the end. She is a victim to the injustice of artistic life, which demands everything and gives back only a glimpse of happiness. Looking around in the theater after the movie, I find this is more than most people can expect from life.<br/><br/>Bravo Darren Aronofsky! You showed that great talent is a work of the mind. While the audience will just applaud the performance, the artist will have experienced both sides of a truth most can never expect to see."
"nathanschubach","8","2","5","28 December 2010"," Finally, ballerinas have their ""Fight Club""
","All I can say is, Darren Aronofskyyou've done it again. And what he's done is manage to guide the audience of ""Black Swan"" down a rabbithole of self-realization and graphic, symbolic obviousness. I've been watching his works since ""Pi,"" but it seems he's transformed his goals to answer one question, ""How can I completely confuse an audience while making them want more at the same time?"" Even his self-released commentary for ""The Fountain"" was shrouded with vague mystery, attempting to describe the process of filming the movie without giving away the full story, yet hinting at clues throughout the film. If the audience is Watson to Aronofsky's Sherlock Holmes, Watson would've turned in his 2-week-notice by now. Getting back to the film, the cinematography was brilliantly stark and remarkable, even though most scenes were shot during ballet practice with no scenery. When there was scenery -- the devilish artwork, the club scenes, the dressing-up of Natalie Portman's character's room – it was like visiting another world. Portman's acting really shines through along with Mila Kunis as they perfected several months of vigorous dance-training and dieting to achieve these character's mindsets, and that's before adding all of the psychological damage Portman's character goes through in this film. Clint Mansell makes a return to do the scoring in the film, which is traditionally-based around the ballet themes but with a modern, low-key twist. Cheers to the Chemical Brothers for making a fantastic track during the club scene, by the way. I do think the addition of the Kronos Quartet would have been an awesome choice to fit into a ballet recital, but one can't have everything, I suppose. Overall, the film will keep you enthralled to figure out what's really going on with these characters in the same way ""Fight Club"" held so many's attentions during that film, but it's up to the viewer to decide what her outcome really is."

Even the graphics looked too real to be anything but, and it deserves a lot of credit for its color coordination throughout its entirety and it dark spin on human emotion Overall it was a fantastic film and well done, yet another great film to add to the Darren Aronofsky's works of greatness!

Both of then deserved their Golden Golbes nominations and i believe that Natalie Portman will be the winner of the Golden Golbe for an actress in a leading role. Vincent Cassel , Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder were also very good in their supporting roles. The direction of this movie was also excellent , Darren Aronofsky gave us a great result. But this movie is so good because of its marvelous story by Andres Heinz.

"wschao","10","2","5","25 December 2010"," A review of Black Swan
","Beware! Spoiler alerts abound! <br/><br/>Let me start off by saying, the concept for this movie is not original at all. I've seen this concept in movies like the anime movie Perfect Blue and the Bette Davis starred film All About Eve. However this is not a reason to dismiss this movie altogether. If anything, I felt that the concept strengthened the film. <br/><br/>Concept: Main character is a ballerina, and has worked her butt of all her life to land a starring role in a show. She finally gets a starring role, slowly goes crazy due to stress and pressure, and has a jealous/paranoid rivalry with the new girl that spirals into a downward finale. <br/><br/>Sound familiar? That's because this is a tragedy, one of the oldest (if not the oldest) genres in human history. Someone still practicing this form of storytelling will definitely receive a tip of the hat from me. Not just any hat but THE hat.<br/><br/>The strongest point of this movie? Themes. Themes of loss of innocence, paranoia, sexuality, jealousy, perfection...it's hard to keep up with the variety of themes this film has to offer. This blending of themes creates a very compelling story that deserves much attention.<br/><br/>Second strongest point is atmosphere. This movie is dark and creepy. It builds this insane nightmare from the viewpoint of the main character that sneaks up on the audience when they're least expecting it. Very well executed!<br/><br/>The score and the sound also add to the subtly creepy mood to the movie. The striking of stringed instruments accompanies the insanity processing in the main character's mind. <br/><br/>So what happens when you work with a concept as old as time itself? You make it into your own interpretation, which director Darren Aronofsky succeeded in doing. I've seen his films Pi and Requiem for a Dream and they usually have a main character or several characters that obtain something and slowly decline into madness or unfavorable circumstances. Black Swan is no different. The main character obtains something, this something changes the character, and the character falls into tragic circumstances. In the way Aronofsky presents this method of storytelling, this movie would be his Magnum Opus. It doesn't even take that much brain activity to really ""get"" the movie. It relies more on action than words to drive the story, not like Inception where you need to pay attention to really understand it. This movie is by far the creepiest film I've seen all year, creepier than Human Centipede, which I thought was an effective horror movie. A movie like Avatar had an unoriginal concept and relied too heavily on visuals to really make it a good movie. This might break some people's hearts but I liked this movie better than Inception just because it felt like it wasn't trying too hard to tell a story, not to mention that the concept is much more accessible to the average moviegoer. Also a nice touch I've noticed is how anything seemingly ""heavy"" or ""extravagant"" is quashed by references to masturbation and drugs, almost as if Aronofsky is telling audiences and critics alike to just ""take the stick out of your ass"". Since this year is almost over, I feel very confident to say that this is the best movie I've seen all year."
"danjakubik","9","2","5","25 December 2010"," An exciting and engaging psychological thriller
","* * * 1/2 Very Good<br/><br/>Effective, lively, hand-held camera technique, creative writing, spirited direction and Natalie Portman's passionate performance, all come together beautifully, in this impressive psychological thriller-drama. Portman portrays a New York City ballerina in heated competition for the lead role in a local production of the famous ""Swan Lake"" ballet. <br/><br/>It's a compelling portrait of an artist driving herself too hard and mentally falling apart, in order to achieve perfection in playing a role. Portman's character (Nina), lacks the good/bad duality required to most effectively play the role of this version of the Swan Queen of the ballet. Nina has excellent technique and is naturally good portraying the White Swan, but lacks the passion and raw emotion required of the Black Swan character. <br/><br/>Nina slowly undergoes a dark, violent, psychological, hallucinatory transformation, where the boundaries of reality, fantasy and dreams become blurred and begin blending together. Winona Ryder, in her 2nd comeback film of the year, does well in a dark and disturbed supporting role.<br/><br/>Portman dominates her role and the film. Physically, she fits the role perfectly. Portman is definitely more than just a pretty face and has shown signs of serious acting ability (emotional depth) before, since her 1994 feature film debut in ""The Professional"". <br/><br/>Portman was nominated for an Academy Award for acting in 2005 and I believe she is deserving of being nominated again, for her lead acting role in ""Black Swan""."
"maloveci816","9","2","5","19 December 2010"," A Thinking Person's Film
","Black Swan is Indy tour-de-force art nouveau at its best. I guarantee that this film will get inside your head and make a home there. You won't be able to shake it, and you'll want to talk about it with others. Darren Aronofsky is of course a master of the mind; he is among the best at allowing us to truly get inside a character's head while shifting from the real to the imaginary. This is a film that will not be for everyone. But, go into it with an open mind if you decide to see it. <br/><br/>We all know the plot by now, so I will leave that to the other reviews of the film. I have seen this film 4 times now; the first time, I came away from it feeling exhausted yet exhilarated.<br/><br/>Black Swan is dark, brooding, relentless and unapologetic. Some parts are completely absurd and impractical. Some parts are so loud that your ears will ache. The score is absolutely beautiful and fits every single scene. The direction and cinematography are excellent--sometimes shaky and sometimes rigid, but I particularly enjoyed the dancing sequences where Aronofsky used the camera as another dancer. I'll address the sex scene between Portman and Kunis since it is so talked about. It's just that--a sex scene, not a love scene in any way. There's nothing gentle or romantic about it, it is Nina's F-you to her mother and Lily just happened to be there. It is a very sexy and graphic scene, so be prepared for it. But, Black Swan should not be belittled by ONLY mentioning this scene. The film is so much more than that.<br/><br/>The performances were the best part of the film. French actor Vincent Cassel is excellent as Thomas Leroy, the horny company director. Is he trying to actually seduce Nina (Portman), or is he just trying to get her to delve deeper? Either way, he gives no apologies. Barbara Hershey is fantastic as Erica, Nina's overbearing mother, who gave up her own career to raise Nina. Nina can barely dress herself without the presence of her mother. Mila Kunis is refreshing and funny as Lily, a new dancer to the company. Although it never seemed to me that she was actively after Nina's role in Swan Lake, NINA perceives it this way; her paranoia, stress and Leroy's harsh criticisms lead her to the brink of insanity, if not actually to it. Winona Ryder is respectable as Beth, an aging prima ballerina who is forced out of the company, much to her disdain.<br/><br/>The real kudos, however, go to Natalie Portman. She has always been a go-to actress if a director needs someone who will fully commit to a role, but in Black Swan, Portman envelops the character of Nina so well that her life as an actress will surely be changed forever. She deserves this. Portman commands the screen; not only is she beautiful to look at (even at a skeletal 95 lbs), her acting skills in this film could not be matched by any other. In fact, I can't think of anyone else in this role. We easily see her as the White Swan--fragile, innocent, delicate and shy, but even I wasn't sure she could pull of the role of the Black Swan. The third act of the film is a no holds barred roller coaster ride, and it's here that Portman truly shines. The opening night scene where she becomes the Black Swan (figuratively and literally), is Portman at her best. Her performance during this particular scene was intoxicating. Nina owns the stage as the Black Swan and she prowls around backstage--sexy as hell, confident, almost omniscient. It's at this point that we realize the White Swan within her has subsided and perhaps even conceded.<br/><br/>The last scene is tragically glorious, sad and so beautiful. Nina had that one moment of perfection, but paid the ultimate price to achieve it."
"erik-anderson-804-424385","9","2","5","18 December 2010"," Breathtaking account of a ballerina's summons to perform
","I am a huge fan of Darren Aronofsky, based solely on my profound appreciation of ""The Fountain."" So, it was with great hope that I entered the theater to watch his latest effort, ""Black Swan."" My wife and I agreed (as we spoke and gesticulated passionately about the film all the way home from the theater) that ""Black Swan"" is a stunning, heart-rending, and masterful piece of art. It accomplishes its goal brilliantly: to allow the audience to sit in front row seats to watch the unraveling of a professional ballerina who, out of a sheer desperation to achieve a long-sought perfection in her craft, must contort herself to a psychotic degree to match the requirements of the role in which she is cast. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives perhaps the performance of her lifetime as Nina Sayers. Although she is exceptional as well in ""Where the Heart Is"" with Ashley Judd, this role is simply at another level of brilliance. One huge thing aiding her: Aronofsky's deft direction. The man simply understands how to let the actors and the camera do all of the work. I love this quality of his films (I have not seen Hugh Jackman or Rachel Weisz in better form than in ""The Fountain""). He puts the camera on their faces, and the magic happens. Aronofsky is able to direct the camera to carry us straight into the intimate and subtle layers of feeling that the film is trying to convey while ever remaining invisible. Portman's portrayal of Nina as the fragile, frigid ballerina is all the more excellent because she also shows Nina's aching desperation to find warmth and satisfaction in her own dancing – from wherever it might come. So, when the opportunity arises to portray the White Swan and Black Swan simultaneously in a new production, she sees not just the opportunity to become a star and the center of praise and attention, but also, as the film progresses, the much more dangerous opportunity of letting a part of herself breathe and come to life which for too long had been suppressed. Nina's struggle to find and then manage the inner fires of sexuality and aggression are at the heart of the film. And so exquisitely rendered. There are graphically violent and sexual images in the film, but none are gratuitous. Each carries a purpose and a weight necessary for the film's effectiveness. Portman is in front of the camera for a lion's share of the time, and the nuance that she brings to each scene is nothing less than remarkable; a pure treat.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, notably including Vincent Cassell as the director of the ballet company, and Mila Kunis as Lily are also very good. The soundtrack (how can you go wrong with one of the greatest pieces of music ever written, Swan Lake?) and the editing, and all of the technical elements are all as they should be: support for the main thrust of the movie, which is Portman's interpretation of self-sacrifice for the attainment of greatness. <br/><br/>In the end, the movie leaves you in a stunned speechlessness. The final scene brings together the confusing and unresolved events that preceded it, without cliché. Instead of simply ending, as most movies do (and most movies do it badly), ""Black Swan"" ends like a fantastic piece of music at the height of crescendo, and you are left sitting there, struggling for a time to comprehend the greatness of it."

","Black Swan, the latest from Darren Aronofsky is a twisty-turny psychodrama in the vein of Roman Polanski with aspects of The Wrestler through in for good measure. The film constantly pumps itself through with menace, leaving the audience increasingly jolted until the sweeping conclusion.<br/><br/>The story is hard to explain without spoiling anything. Nina (Natalie Portman, at her restrained best) is an earnest ballerina hoping for her big moment. She is potentially foiled (or is she?) by Lily (Mila Kunis), a more striking figure.. all the while under the auspices of Thomas (Vincent Cassel, channeling plenty of smarminess). Along for the ride is Nina's overriding mother (Barbara Hershey) and an dancer on the skids, Beth (Winona Ryder). As these characters collide the plot becomes less and less coherent.<br/><br/>And this does not pose any problems for Aronofsky who along with his capable collaborators in both aural and visual realms works to stir a striking environment. The New York city streets are constantly empty, leaving Nina to face off against unknown forces. Her overdone apartment speaks volumes about her childlike state. Aronofsky, like what he did with Mickey Rourke, hovers behind Portman constantly with his camera creating a sense of constant alertness. Rather than shooting dialogue in two shots, he cuts in front of both actors to convey a volley of emotional drama. Like Polanski's Rosemary's Baby or Repulsion, Aronofsky tries to stir up as much menace as possible. Every frame feels tense, especially when the story becomes more splintered.<br/><br/>The visceral impact of this works because it serves as the driving force behind the film. It's practically impossible to isolate a singular aspect of Black Swan; the sound design, the performances, the writing, etc. all coalesce under Aronofsky's commanding vision. Here he has fully matured as a director, confident in his constantly stylistic protrusions. Consequently the film, like Requiem for a Dream, leaves the viewer gasping for air. By the time the ending credits begin there is a definitive response-but to what, exactly? Are Black Swan's pleasures all sensory? Is there something more intellectually engaging underneath the strong exterior? <br/><br/>These are questions like to divide viewers. But it is a film that works, thanks to Aronofsky's direction, and one that leaves an impression throughout and immediately after. What happens after remains to be seen."

I could handle the parts where the ""Director"" of the dance troupe tries to get the prudish woman who's mother is totally overbearing to loosen up. He even tries to help her get in touch with her sensual nature, to become a woman who is capable of seduction, so that when she dances the part of the Black Swan she won't be so ""stiff"" and dull, but when it comes down to it and Natalie and Mila start going at it, it's just too much. That's why I say it's porn, thinly disguised as a ""thriller."" Overacted, over-hyped, and overdone."

Mila Kunis is wasted, as i feel is Winona Rider, the whole crazy bitch thing has been done numerous times, see ""GOTHIKA"" with Halle (black catwoman WTF) Berry or Leo Dicaprio in that Scorsese movie that made not much money. I would honestly have given this 0 if i were able. Sad that this will probably get best Picture over films as great and ORIGINAL as Social Network or THE KINGS SPEECH. Strongly do not recommend!"

","Talented young ballet dancer (Oscar-winner Natalie Portman) is awarded the leading role of The Swan Queen in a big, new production of ""Swan Lake""...but the advice given to her by the impresario--to completely immerse herself in the dual role of the doomed girl and her evil doppelgänger--is, unfortunately, taken literally. Director Darren Aronofsky is known for his dark bravado and penchant for ugly physicality; he's an often-brilliant filmmaker who burrows himself into the twisted, downward spiral of a hopeless human condition, taking the audience with him as his prisoners. But here, what with an already-thin screenplay to work from, Aronofsky weakens the picture with his onslaught of visual tricks and shocks. There's certainly potential in the narrative, however the schizoid psycho-drama (which Aronofsky was no doubt attracted to) takes over in ludicrous fashion. Portman wretches and cries and snips her fingernails down to bloodied nubs--it's an exhausting tour-de-force--yet her strongest personality moment is a subtle one (having drinks with the lascivious Mila Kunis in a bar). Written by Mark Heyman, Andrés Heinz, and John McLaughlin, from Heinz' original treatment, the picture is a horrific potboiler; it looks good, and gets off to a very strong start, but dissipates due to the general overkill. The finale is a grand-scale build-up to nothing, with confusing behind-the-stage action and interrelationships, while the actors themselves come off looking rather silly. ** from ****"

","First of all gave it a 5 because I only give 4 or less to ""amateur"" movies.<br/><br/>You start the movie with high expectations from the reviews and the critics, you read something about a character that has to find her ""dark"" side to play a role, and change her personality, even though you're not a big fan of ballet, you see the reviews and Oscars, and you give it a try expecting at least, if not something of your type, something of high quality, or some emotionally strong drama.<br/><br/>Let me tell you what I saw in this movie, a (pretty) woman with the same expression the entire movie, throwing up every 5 minutes, bleeding, ripping some skin or showing her rash every 2 minutes, and having hallucinations every 5 seconds. Thats how amazing this movie is. ""Her facial expression never varies from sad, purse-mouthed and leaky eyed. I got so tired of looking at her face and it is shown just about all the time."" said another reviewer (in words I hardly understand), well I hope this is not a spoiler, but basically thats what you will see the entire movie: her face! and even thou she is pretty it can be very annoying and at some point you might feel some desire to slap her.<br/><br/>So basically for me, this movie has hardly any positive points, besides keeping you waiting for some interesting moment that never comes, it is a succession of confusing, meaningless scenes, that sometimes resemble a horror movie, very based in all the clichés and as the movie goes on starts becoming more like a comedy. No substance, no emotional depth, no strong/well-built characters, no point. Even visually this movie fails.<br/><br/>Like i read somewhere ""pretentious garbage"" is a nice way to describe it, but of course, you add some classical music mix it with some ballet, wrap it all up with a lot of cheap sex, and all the so called ""intellectuals"" can only call it a sublime masterpiece, or else they will probably be expelled from the so-called-intellectuals club. This movie shows very small traces of intelligence, and I don't mean to sound arrogant.<br/><br/>Avoid it, either you into ballet or not, in all honesty it is not a terrible movie, is decent, but is definitely a waste of time, and the most overrated movie of 2011 along with Inception (no wonder I saw both on the same list of the best 3 movies)."
"barnabyrudge","8","2","6","18 February 2011"," A surprising, full-blooded audience teaser set in the world of ballet.
","Black Swan is a film which defies your expectations. It is well worth coming into the film cold, knowing as little as possible about the plot. I was half-expecting some sort of character study about a young girl struggling to cope with the demands of the ballet. I thought perhaps we would follow her on a journey through her trials and tribulations in the industry, leading to either an uplifting or downbeat conclusion. I certainly didn't expect the film that Black Swan actually is – a dark, frightening, edgy tale of madness and all-consuming pressure, with strong elements of horror and erotica.<br/><br/>Dedicated ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is given the prestigious lead role in the ballet Swan Lake. Nina has been with the same New York company for several years under the direction of the talented but perpetually moody Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel). She lives at home with her over-bearing and obsessive mother Erica (Barbara Hershey). The role is a dream come true for Nina, who believed her years of dedication and hard work would go unnoticed as in previous seasons. To her joy, Leroy is willing to give her a shot at the greatest role in ballet. He knows Nina will be amazing as the White Swan, but is worried that she lacks the dark energy and sinfulness needed to pull off the dual role of the Black Swan. Soon the pressure of the role begins to take its toll on Nina, and she finds herself experiencing terrifying hallucinations and growing paranoia. When a new arrival named Lily (Mila Kunis) joins the ballet troupe, Nina's state worsens further as she convinces herself that Lily is some sort of doppelganger or rival out to steal her role. And her mother's non-stop interference just serves to suffocate Nina even more, pushing her beyond the edge of sanity <br/><br/>Black Swan is certainly not for all tastes. Some of the gory, grisly imagery is as unexpected as it is stomach-churning. Similarly, some of the sex scenes are surprisingly graphic. If you come to the film expecting something subtle and civilised set in the world of ballet, chances are you'll be taken aback by what you see. However, if you're in the mood for a deliberately excessive and disorientating thriller, this really delivers. The film has an over-the-top approach which starts somewhere near the point of hysteria and just works its way up from there. Portman is wonderful in the main role, with strong support from the alluring Kunis, sleazy Cassel and stifling Hershey. Their performances are supremely polished and help disguise some of the film's more ludicrous moments. This is a bold and enthralling movie which delights in whisking its audience away on a head-trip that is alternately bewildering, nerve-jangling and exciting."

","well don't get me wrong. Natalie Portman's acting was OUTSTANDING. You barely see someone can be so into her role and acted so well that makes me deeply cheer for her performance.<br/><br/>BUT, NOT the movie itself.<br/><br/>Yeah I know every single technique about this movie was great, well and beautifully made. The dance, the characters, etc. BUT FOR WHAT? For getting disturbed by those horror movie like twisted psychopath scenes? This movie is literally like an artistic version of Saw series, kept getting people upset and disturbed and then, end of the story. This movie degraded my impression about Darren Aronofsky's work, although I did like his The Fountain and The Wrestler very much. Of course showing a human being's wanting and desire and all those suffering caused by those things IS a necessity of to be categorized as a 'good movie', but it is NOT enough. Without creating at least a tiny bit of peacefulness or showing a way out of these sufferings is just like a beautiful picture frame hang in an art gallery without a picture in it. It will ONLY demonstrate how disgustful this world is and we are here not to live through the sufferings but to self destroy without a purpose. This is not why we are here, isn't it?<br/><br/>And THAT's what makes a massive difference between those great and SOLID movies in the history such as The Gladiator, Titanic, Terminator 2, The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond.<br/><br/>If you like to be disturbed, go watch the Black Swan. If you are looking for a great movie experience because you just saw the impressive IMDb scores, my suggestion, NOPE."

","Remember when Ronald Colman copped an Oscar for going berserk as a Shakespearian actor in 1947's ""A Double Life?""

Did anyone see the similarity between her Natalie's movie mother and Anne Bancroft in ""The Turning Point?"" Both gave up ballerina careers to pursue families. Of course, this 'Swan' is certainly no 'Turning Point' either.<br/><br/>As the conflicted ballet star, Portman turns in a credible performance which will probably be honored on Oscar night, Feb. 27th.<br/><br/>As viewers, we are ourselves conflicted. What did ballet director, an excellent Vincent Cassel, and fellow ballerina and rival, Mila Kunis both do to add to Portman's madness? Kunis, at the beginning of the film, acts as though she is a young tough right out of the gangs in ""West Side Story."" Cassel, as the driving choreographer, is excellent in the role.<br/><br/>Portman's downhill descent into madness occurs too quickly. True, that Cassel wanted her to be more devilish in the twin role of the evil Black Swan. It's as if Portman has become the Norma Desmond of ballet.

And just in a snap, two hours goes flying by and at the end, I wanted more.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman deserved her Golden Globe.

But just because you deserve it and put in the hours doesn't mean you will get it in the crazy world of dancing!

"Reel_starz","8","2","6","5 January 2011"," Dancing the fine line between beauty and horror
","Black Swan should not have worked. It mixes so many different tones and genres - it's a sports-movie-like tale of an underdog fighting to achieve the seemingly impossible, a twisted psychological thriller about deception and paranoia and a dark coming-of-age story about a young woman discovering her sexual and emotional limits - that on paper, it looks like a disaster waiting to happen. Even many of the film's admirers admit that it is, to some extent, campy, B-movie trash. And yet, in large part due to the indie/artistic sensibilities of director Darren Aronofsky, it is also one of the most intriguing and haunting films of this year.<br/><br/>The film unfolds like an extravagant ballet, relying more heavily on visuals to entrance the viewer than plot or dialogue. Many of the movie's most memorable sequences have little, if any, speaking, instead using a kaleidoscope of striking images as well as Clint Mansell's beautifully sinister score to create a suspenseful, dream-like atmosphere. With breathtaking dexterity, Aronofsky manipulates every technical aspect of his medium - from the murky lighting to the elegantly designed costumes and sets - in order to reflect the film's themes of appearance verses reality and self-discovery. Notice, for instance, the abundance of mirrors or the frequent use of black and white clothing or even the sleek cinematography, which conflicts with the more grisly subject matter; such painstaking attention to detail transforms Black Swan into an intricate maze of metaphors and hidden implications that any ardent film critic could spend hours dissecting.<br/><br/>Even the actors exude mystique and ambiguity as they all portray characters that, at least ostensibly, consist of a baffling medley of nuances, contradictions and riddles, their true natures disguised under a perpetual veil. The supporting players are especially enigmatic: as Thomas Leroy, Vincent Cassel emanates both sophistication and a quiet depravity; Barbara Hershey portrays the protagonist's mother as amorous yet overbearing, driven to the brink of hysteria by the need to protect (or control) her daughter; lastly, Mila Kunis is pitch-perfect as Lily, a mysterious new ballerina, embodying her with the correct balance of charisma and menace. Nonetheless, the star of the show is inarguably Natalie Portman, who, in a luminous, career-best performance, fully embodies the obsessive ballerina Nina Sayers and the numerous paradoxes she exemplifies – her ruthlessness, her vulnerability, her passion, her innocence. Together, the actors play a cast of characters who feel real yet somehow elusive, and like the movie itself, we never quite know whether to trust them.<br/><br/>However, the debate at the heart of the movie – or at least the one most likely to spark controversy – is the way in which it totters between art (as in an ""art film"") and exploitation. Even knowing beforehand about the much-hyped lesbian sex scene, I still found myself disgusted, shocked or simply confounded by many moments in Black Swan, especially those involving Leroy's none-too-subtle attempts to seduce Nina, and at my screening, some scenes provoked laughter from the audience; whether this was intentional or not, I couldn't tell. How much is too much? As directors seek to expand their boundaries and experiment, the question of how much violence/sex/profanity constitutes too much comes up more and more often. At times, the gore depicted in Black Swan verged on sickening, something that seemed more fit for ""torture porn"" like the Saw franchise than a highbrow indie film, and no doubt many critics have denounced it as little more than second-rate horror disguised as ""art"". Nonetheless, there is something beguiling about Black Swan, something that separates it from countless other pretentious art-house films that take themselves too seriously. This is, after all, a movie about contrasts and boundaries and the ambiguous nature of reality. Even from the opening scene, the viewer senses that beneath the glamorous surface, darkness simmers, and Aronofsky does a masterful job of gradually heightening the tension, bit by bit revealing the film's grotesque soul, until by the climax, the viewer is entangled in a tumult of deceit and fantasy. It is a testament to Darren Aronofsky's talent that we can always sense a purpose behind the madness. Although graphic and disturbing, like a gorgeously rendered nightmare, Black Swan lingers with you long after its last image fades."

His depiction of Nina's struggles as she succumbs to growing pressures from her director, her mother, her rivals, her physical ailments, her personal need for a perfect performance.. it is intense, thrilling, exhausting, and truly gripping throughout.

","""Never cheat on a person with fragile mind, you can destroy her (him)"" That's my personal conclusion about this masterpiece. Natalie Portman shows to us with true mastership the slow and deep fragmentation and distortion of the personality of the main character. This performance about the obsession in the pursuit of a goal (in this case, the perfect incarnation of a role), is actually her best (we still remember the little girl of Leon the Professional, and other memorable roles in Closer and V for Vendetta). Mila Kunis and her inquiring eyes shows perfectly a strong, secure mind, in opposite of Nina's crystal-like one. She is both seductive and intimidating. Barbara Hershey fits perfectly in her role as the obsessed mother. (She does right, like the real life, not evident at first). Winona Rider is also great in her brief appearances, always in key points of the history. ""Never confuse homosexuality with ego"" Perhaps is my second conclusion about Black Swan. The so-called sexual scene is absolutely necessary to show the point. Without it, the statement may lose deepness severely. Vincent Cassel also convinced to me with his interpretation of the Balanchine-like choreographer. Darren Aronofsky deserves also the credit of showing everything from the point of view of the distorted mind of the main character, specially using the camera ""back of the head of the subject"". Specially remarkable is the scene with Nina breathing excited after her outrageous performance of the Black Swan, taking a long time to get rid of the character. It's literally (deliberately exaggerated) what happens in the reality when someone puts the whole of his(her) body and heart to do the best. It's like the after-race walking of a marathon-racer. I read dozens of reviews of this motion picture. I wanted to be as informed as possible before watching it for the first time. And what I saw surpasses everything I expected. It's a masterpiece that shows to us the real meaning of film making. 10/10 score is short to qualify this movie, as the Oscar is not enough to celebrate Portman's performance. Go and see it. You will not be disappointed."

","Black Swan is a cinematic triumph, bringing a modern day twist to the well-loved Grimm's Fairy tale style of story telling. Darren Aronofsky, director (Requiem for A Dream, The Wrestler) will have you holding your breath as he takes you into the fascinatingly beautiful and complicated world of prima ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman). Natalie Portman holds nothing back as she slowly reels you into her startling, repressed, emotionally charged inner world. Aronofsky has skillfully interwoven the very sensual world of the ballet with the passion of the individuals who inhabit it.<br/><br/>Beautifully designed, photographed and acted the movie is stylish and full of powerful images and intense emotions, my main criticism is that a movie like this needs to be centred around the lead character's relationship with the people around her, but her relationship was mainly to the character in the ballet. What was her fear about? Why was she so afraid of exposing her inner self? What demons lived there? You never find out.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" leaves audiences with all sorts of questions and debatable points, which can be cumbersome, but it really makes for a fascinating discussion. You'll probably be internally at war over questionable little bits and pieces of the film, but it's those little moments that really make the film what it is. The performances here by all the actors are mesmerizing, as is the art direction and the general storytelling itself— this is truly a fascinating, off-kilter piece of cinema, and a true 'black swan' among recent films. It may leave you scratching your head in regards to some of the material that is hinted at and thrown toward us without full explication; but ultimately it won't matter, because ""it was perfect"". 10/10."
"eytand94","10","2","6","25 December 2010"," Black Swan: A Beautiful and Frightening Bird
","Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of Darren Aronofsky's previous film, ""The Wrestler."" So, I was at first hesitant to see Aronofsky's latest film, ""Black Swan."" But as soon as the praise started tumbling in, I decided that I HAD to see it. So far, I'd call ""Black Swan"" the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>The film is about Nina Sayers, a young ballerina living with her mother Erica, a former ballerina herself. Nina strives to be the best in her New York ballet company. Her director, Thomas Leroy, announces his production of Swan Lake(a classic ballet), and since legendary Beth McIntyre is retiring, Nina is given the role of the Swan Queen(aka The White Swan). However, she must also portray the Swan Queen's evil twin, The Black Swan. As of now, Thomas knows that the Swan Queen will be no problem for Nina, but she struggles immensely with the Black Swan. In comes competition by the name of Lily, a woman who is strong, carefree, and very sexually expressive. As Nina strives for perfection, she experiences pain, sexuality, paranoia, and obsession that slowly drives her to the edge.<br/><br/>Now, here is a story that could have been riddled with clichés. But no. The script, written by Mark Hyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLoughlin, is extremely well-written and filled with surprises. At times, we aren't sure if what we see through Nina's eyes is true. Of course, her slow loss of sanity is visible. But is Lily really out to get Nina? Is Thomas really exploiting his dancers sexually?<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is definitely a horror film, and that may be hard for other people to view it as such. Nina's descent is nightmarish and truly horrific. When I watched the film, I recalled the styles of early Roman Polanski(i.e. ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby""), David Cronenberg(i.e. ""Shivers"" and ""The Fly""), and even Dario Argento(""Suspiria""). Nina's paranoia is like that of Catherine Deneuve, and her bodily horror certainly brings to mind that of the early Cronenberg films. Several horror fans will think of ""Suspiria"" right away when they watch ""Black Swan,"" knowing that Argento's film is also about ballet. But Aronofsky's film is also beautiful and lavish, like Argento's style. <br/><br/>The character of Nina fascinates me. In our eyes, she is a frightened little girl in a woman's body. She is afraid to express any sexuality, mostly because of her controlling mother. She wants to be perfect, and reach higher than those of her cutthroat partners. Perfection and pressure leads to her madness, and it is heartbreaking as well as shocking.<br/><br/>Of course, the script and the direction are key to the film's effect, but it is the cast that, to me, makes the movie. Natalie Portman's performance as Nina is absolutely stunning. Portman has done many roles that never allow her to grow as an actress. ""Black Swan"" shows that she can do anything, and she has grown into her own. Thomas is played by Vincent Cassel, and he gives a very memorable performance. Barbara Hershey is also outstanding as Erica. It is told to us that Erica gave up ballet to have Nina. Nina has grown a bit, and Erica is afraid to see that. So when she sees her daughter struggle for perfection, she represses her a lot of the time. Hershey captures that to a T. You will also see a nice performance from Winona Ryder as Beth. For the time she has on screen, Ryder is quite good. But the big surprise here is Mila Kunis as Lily. Known more for crude and light-hearted fare(TV's ""That 70's Show"" and ""Family Guy,"" and the hit film ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall), you would never expect Kunis in a role like this. She is not the voice of little Meg Griffin anymore. She is an actress, and her performance here equals that of Portman.<br/><br/>Director Aronofsky has given us what could be his most ambitious and beautiful film yet. He has worked with a flawless script to form a truly amazing film. ""Black Swan,"" in itself, is an intense drama about the pressure and struggles of the ballet art. However, it is definitely, and maybe not to some people, a psychological horror film, and a great one at that. If anybody deserves the Best Actress Oscar this year more than anyone, it's Natalie Portman. ""I just want to be perfect,"" says Nina. Poor Nina's pressure makes her suffer, but the movie sure doesn't. ""Black Swan"" IS perfect."
"Avwillfan89","10","2","6","24 December 2010"," Scary, heart-pumping and beautiful
","There's no doubt, people who like horror movies will have a great taste for this one. The psychological side of this film is the horror side of things, even though ballet perfection drives the motive of the story. <br/><br/>Nina is a workaholic, constantly rehearsing her ballet moves to be the best. But her perfection tactics go out of control and become more and more damaging to her soul and mind. This is due to several people in her life: Her slightly overbearing and overprotective former ballet dancer mother, who, like her, is also over dramatic. Her ruthless and even more overbearing ballet professor, Thomas who uses sex as a way of getting his dancers to perform at top perfection, therefore creating emotional problems for them. And finally her rival and friend, Lily, whom she believes is out to get her part. Nina is utterly paranoid about Lily, but also remembers from Thomas to use sex as a way of staying in control of her perfect body and mind skills.<br/><br/>You don't often get psychological thrillers (or horrors) that are as good as this one. The interaction between Nina and Lily (played to stunning perfection by Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis) is so believable and powerful, as well as Nina's seemingly out of control behavior, you actually believe some of the things you see are really happening. <br/><br/>Frightening and stressful it may be on the entertainment side, but it's a damn good piece of filmmaking that deserves some Oscars."

","A beautiful actress could decide a movie. Sounds exaggerating? Then, you shall see ""Black Swan"", the 2010 thriller about a ballet dancer, and then check how affirmative the statement could be.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is amazing. But I bet she, instead of the technique reflected or emotion revealed by the movie, became the reason why so many people rated the movie almost 9 out of 10. For me, cinematography and editing were actually more wonderful, and these are quite independent from how Natalie Portman was doing. But I know other audiences will not separate Natalie Portman from the movie. They loved her and then they forgot viewing the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>I just felt there was not anything really so special about the movie. The struggle between dual persona, the absent father (uh...clichés, clichés...), and the lesbian sex scenes, though ""strong"" enough, have already been repeated in a lot of movies else. Again still, when I was forced to see them, I still couldn't help but wonder why they have to be a part. Or, have we got so used to them that movie makers tend to believe that we cannot live without them any longer? Oh, if that's the case, why were we moved to tears by a movie like ""Forest Gump""? Why did we feel so much saved by a movie like ""Shawshank Redemption""? Why were we so intoxicated by the eloquent ""Shakespeare in Love"" and so much thrilled by the music in ""Dancer in the Dark""? None of these masterpieces took pride in shedding blood or semen...(forgive me), but they did open our hearts and lived rent-free there...<br/><br/>Another approach to leave a good impression is to be truly intelligent, like Charlie Koffman. He had a good idea of analyzing human being's brain, and then he was being honest enough to share the ""process"": how he did it, what he did, and what could be the consequences...But Darren Aronofsky was not that patient or scientific. His cinematographer and editor were being kind enough to sew pieces of impulse into a complete story that made sense. Without them, I wonder what the movie would look like...a collection of horror pictures? It is totally agreeable if Natalie Portman got nominated or even awarded because of ""Black Swan"". Her performance was truly impressive. It is not exaggerating to state that she has made another breakthrough in her career. But I will hardly consent to any idea of crowning ""Black Swan"" the best picture or best directing, for it pretended to be new when it was totally old, indeed trivial when it tried to be big. It is not the first time for me to see a young perfectionist struggling with the imperfection engendered by her natural inclination, her absence of father, her depressing self-discipline...let alone when here lives one."
"cooldude_675","9","2","6","22 December 2010"," ""A Scanner Darkly"" meets ""Pi""
","Darren Aranofsky is a rare vintage, this one gets better with age. And starting out with a movie like ""Pi"" he sets the bar high. With each of his films he looks into the life (or lives) of people whose sanity and lives are on the edge. The general theme here does not change but what we get is a beautifully shot fine piece of art-house film. I wont bother spoiling any of the story or the plot twists but needless to say that this movie puts pedal down in the beginning and does not let up until the last shot. I can see why people won't like it, but if you enjoyed any of the previous movies of Aranofsky you will enjoy this. One of my favorite aspects of the movie was the dancing, I am no ballet fan but it was beautifully laid in and kudos to Portman for obviously having to painstakingly learn some very technical dance moves (she may have a ballet background I am not sure about that). The theme of duality is also incredibly fleshed out as it was in another of my favorites ""A Scanner Darkly"". The struggle that Portman faces from the identities of the black and white swan is ever present and slowly drives her insane just like a certain math genius is driven mad by a number in ""Pi"". All in all a great watch and a great piece of art-house by the current king of the genre."

","Most of us, live our lives, just for the sake of it. Even more than most of us don't even know, what is driving their existence. But there is a minority in us, who actually live for a reason. That reason, can be anything. But when that reason is PASSION, it can transform us. Natalie Portman is just another sweet, pretty , soft ballerina who wants perfection in her passion, and that is the role of Swan Queen. Then, we saw, one of the most powerful leading performances of modern day cinema. There actually was a point, when we are practically floating in the air with Natalie and shedding a tear or two when she sees her mother in the crowd with tears in her eyes. <br/><br/>Its very rare, when, you don't really notice the sound track of the movie, don't really care about the direction, or the lighting, or the acting of side actors, or even the movie itself, but the only thing that has captivated you is that one lead actor, who has lost him/herself in their role in such a way that your own emotions are swaying with his. (since ledger's Joker)<br/><br/>Brilliant and i will not be surprised one bit, if Natalie Portman takes home the Oscar.<br/><br/>10/10"
"ktelliman","8","2","6","21 December 2010"," Lovely black swan!
","One word comes to my mind when I try to define this movie. The very same word she (natalie Portman) uses in the film: ""Perfect"" This hyper-sexual film has a very dark plot with very impressive scenes and a very good casting. However, there's one reason for me to consider it as ""unforgetable"" and is the fact that it makes you hate the poor, sweet and harmless white swan and makes you fall in love with the black swan instead. There is where the real poetry of the film is present. Is not the fact that she will become the black swan (everybody knows that from the beginning!).<br/><br/>The scene of the black swan transformation is astonishing. An instant classic for me.<br/><br/>Great performance of the cast. This movie is a ""don't miss"" at all.<br/><br/>8/10 Because of the obvious plot. The rest is very impressive."
"scarletminded","9","2","6","19 December 2010"," My favorite Aronofsky since Pi and the two are a lot similar...
","Black Swan goes back to where Aronofsky began. It's very Pi-like. Isolated, urban, with romance or sexuality hoisted on the main character like a threat, leading to psychosis and digging at the skin for salvation. The lead of Pi picks at his head like Nina picks at her back. Plus the old man subway guy that was in Pi seems to return here. The pace of this film is much like Pi, with the actors wearing camera, so their walking sways from side to side. My boyfriend was nauseous from seeing this in the theater and he loved Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain and The Wrestler. There was something in this movie that made him sick. That is the magic of it, you are thrown, just like you were into Maximillian Cohen's mind in Pi. The camera work, lack of a soundtrack at parts (toes on pointe and feathers rustling in a disturbing way make up a lot of the non-ballet dancing scenes) and Nina's hallucinations (which some may be real, others not) make for an amazing ride into the subconscious of a ballet dancer and her insulted world.<br/><br/>I was surprised with the amount of sexuality in this film, which makes me believe it won't get Oscar nods because of the lesbian and self-loving imagery, but hopefully the Oscars aren't prudish. I felt the sexuality was dead on as Nina becomes the Black Swan. Her relationship with Lily is both real and fantasy, as Lily ends up a doppleganger of Nina in Nina's mind, the person she needs to be in order to be ""perfect"" as the Swan Queen in Swan Lake. Her world is a harsh one...she is cruel to herself, her ballet producer is a crude man whose teaching includes a healthy dose of sexual harassment and seduction, the only person who reaches out to her over her controlling mom is the person who becomes her understudy and the woman who is ""retiring"" or the Old Swan (played awesomely by Winona Ryder) calls her a whore and drives her further into psychosis.<br/><br/>I tend to think of the movie as a feminist diatribe. It seems that when a woman is ""perfected"" as Sylvia Plath put it in the poem Edge, she is dead. I feel this movie stresses how women punish themselves for perfection they can never achieve, unless in death. Though you aren't quite sure if Nina dies in the end, it ends like Pi does with a white out. But the world seems to beat ballerinas into a strange submission though those in the outside world, like the guys Lily and Nina meet in a bar, wouldn't even go see if they had free tickets. Even if they succeed in dance, they only have 15-20 years to prove themselves until they ""retire"", meaning they are forced to make way for the young girls because the ballet show producers needs some fresh meat to romance. The whole world of Black Swan is much like the fairy tale in the ballet. Nina is seduced by hopes of a career and then her life crashes down around her when she thinks her understudy has seduced her and is trying to take over. Again, you aren't very sure what is real and what isn't. The special effects are very subtle. A blinking painting there, the Black Swan face for a second on a club dance floor...then they get fantastic later on as wings spring from the Swan Queen herself. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this film. It does have some highly sexual content but it is wonderfully shot and very female orientated and ends up being very beautiful. Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis shine in this film and if they aren't given awards for their acting, then the world is as sad as the world Black Swan exists in. Yet that world is a lovely dark place."
"howard.schumann","9","2","6","15 December 2010"," A powerful experience that leaves us limp.
","Normally, emotional breakthroughs lead to an enhancement of one's sense of self worth and a greater sense of personal power. In Darren Aronofsky's super-charged melodrama Black Swan, however, such breakthroughs do not lead to satisfaction but only to madness. Yet the film is such a riveting and unsettling experience that, regardless of its psychological incongruities, it is hard not to succumb to its visceral power or fully admire the beauty of its direction and photography, or the brilliance of its acting. With a screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin, Nina Sayres, in an Oscar-worthy performance by Natalie Portman, is a 28-year-old New York City ballet dancer who, in spite of her grueling routine, is committed to ballet as a way of life. She is sexually repressed, however, and plagued by a lack of self esteem to the point of self inflicted injury.<br/><br/>Like many a driven performer, she is a perfectionist whose worst fear is to come in second. Her experience with men seems to be severely limited and her entire life is devoted to perfecting her dance technique. Unable to fully express herself as an adult, she is controlled and emotionally dependent on her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), while living at home in a room that probably hasn't changed since she was a child with stuffed animals and a music box to listen to every night when she goes to bed. Her mother, though kind and caring on the surface, secretly harbors resentment over the fact that she had to give up a promising ballet career when Nina was born.<br/><br/>Striving for artistic perfection, Nina is searching for the key role that will define her career and is thrilled when she is chosen by ballet impresario Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) to perform the lead in his new production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake in which the heroine achieves freedom only in death. Leroy, who looks like a cross between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Werner Erhard, is a relentless taskmaster who will not settle for less than 100 percent. Although perfect for the White Swan, he notices that Nina lacks the passion and sensuality to play the seductive Black Swan, a dual role required for all dancers who perform the ballet.<br/><br/>A notorious womanizer modeled after the famous George Balanchine, Leroy tells her that to realize what the role of the Black Swan demands, she has to let go and free her emotions. To that end, he makes sexual overtures to her, a technique that apparently worked with the forcibly retired Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), an aging former lead who has become bitter and revengeful. Leroy takes on the role of the black prince himself and dances with Nina in a sexually seductive manner but tells her ""that was me seducing you, now you have to seduce me."" Her chance to let go of her stifling passivity comes when Lily (Mila Kunis), a new dancer shows up from San Francisco and captures Leroy's attention for her openness and spontaneity, qualities that Nina sadly lacks. Eager to capitalize on Thomas' interest, Lily maneuvers for the role of Nina's alternate and Nina begins to fear her as a rival.<br/><br/>Regardless, she goes out with Lily for a night of partying and Lesbian lovemaking which allows her to experience some untapped emotions, perhaps for the first time. As the day of the performance approaches, however, all of Nina's insecurities boil to the surface once again. Tension builds to a breaking point as she begins to unravel emotionally. With hallucinations of standing up to her mother and murdering Lily, the film threatens to become grotesque and sensational. Yet it is redeemed by a stunning climax, one that explodes in a dazzling display of energy and liberation. Aronofsky is a director of great audacity and Black Swan, though it will not leave us with sugarplum fairies dancing in our heads, is a powerful experience that sweeps us up and leaves us limp."
"MovieDude1893","10","2","6","14 December 2010"," Plays like Tchaikovsky by way of David Lynch and Douglas Sirk
","Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is reckless, glorious fever-dream of a movie. It is striking, intoxicating, blackly humorous, melodramatic, and beautiful. In short, it is unlike anything else the movies have to offer.<br/><br/>It is set in the cutthroat, isolated world of professional ballet. It chronicles the struggles of young ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). She is in her mid-twenties, young by any sane standards, but, ballet standards are far from sane. She is vying for the lead role in a new production of the classic Swan Lake. The role requires her to play the virginal, innocent White Swan and the seductive Black Swan. Nina obsessively perfects her form, but her director (Vincent Cassel) doubts that Nina can convey the alluring nature of the Black Swan. The film details Nina's obsessive drive to achieve total perfection, in the face of mental and emotional breakdown, and physical metamorphosis. <br/><br/>Aesthetically, this film is a stunner. Aronofsky employs hand-held cameras that place us in Nina's shoes throughout the film. We are there for the incessant drilling and rehearsal that ballet requires. The camera swoops and pirouettes to dizzying effect. Aronofsky also succeeds in portraying the intensely competitive world of professional ballet. We hear bones crunch, toes break, and feet crack. He uses fractured editing rhythms and a soundtrack cobbled together from classical and experimental music to create Nina's intense and horrifying world.<br/><br/>However, for all its success, Black Swan is not without its failings. At times, the film risks coherence for the sake of messing with the heads of the audience members. The film also introduces the frame story of Swan Lake in a very clumsy way: a monologue recited by Vincent Cassel. Aronofsky also relies too heavily on the visual contrast of white and black as a visual motif. <br/><br/>Yet, audiences won't leave the theater considering these flaws. Black Swan is a wholly visceral cinematic experience that will spellbind those who are willing to seek it out. It is an uneasy, but fascinating watch that doesn't completely make sense until the end credits. Yet, the film has an impact well past the end credits. It is a movie to provoke discussion, a dark, seductive fairy tale to haunt your dreams. In a year of pale retreads and creative bankruptcy, it is a breath of fresh air."
"americhanac","5","5","23","26 December 2010"," Insult to a good movie
","I must admit I actually created account to write a comment about yet another failed Hollywood attempt to create a good movie.<br/><br/>The intention to stay away from patterns was too dominant throughout the movie and at the end left a story line that has no basis in real life and puts audience in a catatonic state for most part of the movie.<br/><br/>As I saw it, this movie is on the same level as ""How was I pretty in Tibet"" from Brad Pitt, wasted money. Natalie Portman, way overrated actress, poorly creates an image of a real life ballerina like being a ballerina is not a job done by professionals but some disturbed and out-of-this-world yuppies. Full of misconceptions about life of a prime ballerina, it really reminded me of another watered down movie ""Piano"". Besides, no clue on where the background of the characters is, no basis for making a plot so they just decided to ignore it since there is no parallel. Practically, Athena's birth when Zeus give a birth from his head. <br/><br/>As I have a problem in actually believing such stories and actually know how theater works I can only say that this piece is a total waste of one's time providing the viewer actually has a taste with some filmography as well as 9-5 background.<br/><br/>Filmography is very good and director really has moments yet who ever saw ""Elephant"" sees a parallel. More so, I could name several films where supposed ""originalyty"" is clearly full of many films put together. Drama-like Avatar. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is nothing but a very expensive graduate work. Even more so, I am convinced that with this budget a graduate student would tame much more time in actually saying something than this piece of work.<br/><br/>I give it a 5 as it is nothing special, Britney kissed Madonna so long ago it stopped being news for everyone else but Hollywood."

","A rather intense, manic, over the top look at life inside an elite ballet's production of Swan Lake.
With all the bullying, jealousy, pressure to be perfect and no room to have 'a life', it's not that surprising that lead dancer Nina (Natalie Portman) is going insane.
She's certainly not happy, living with her crazy, suffocating mother (Barbara Hershey) who takes the hysterical Stage Mom role up several notches.
Mom still keeps her jewellery box and cuts her fingernails!
The piece is shot in dark, muted, claustrophobic corridors, studios and apartments and even though ballet as an art is supposed to be beautiful, there ain't much joy in Nina's life.
She's a nervous, flighty but technically perfect dancer, whose main problem is in convincingly trying to portray the coarser black swan twin in Swan Lake as well as she plays the role of the graceful white swan twin.
It's a crisply directed and written movie. The pace moves ahead at a rapid pace but there's not much respite from the doom and gloom.
Thankfully Mila Kunis, as boisterous new dancer Lily, who befriends Nina, provides some light relief.
Not really a movie for sweet ballet fans!

Each time she thinks she is not getting there she becomes depressive and each time she thinks she has climbed a rung she becomes manic. Vincent Cassel is impressive s the generic talented but unscrupulous artistic director and Barbara Hershey as the obsessive mother whose attentions supposedly intended to push her toward glory push her toward tse brinks The movie plot seems a descendant of a famous novel by a famous ballerina now retired and running her own company DANCING ON MY GRAVE. As a ballerina's autobiography prepared to anecdote real experiences it seems truer to life but of course has not been translated to the screen.

","Over the years, most movies about the ballet would have ignited the kind of dreams that had young girls and their mothers lining up at ballet schools the next day. I'm not so sure ""Black Swan"" would have that effect. It's a pretty dark story, which depicts the rigors of ballet at the top level, and the pitfalls of single-minded obsession.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a ballerina with a leading New York ballet company, is about to get her big break as the principal dancer in a new presentation of ""Swan Lake"". However she has issues.<br/><br/>She feels guilty about the ballerina she is replacing, and worries about a new ballerina from Los Angeles who could replace her. She feels stifled living with her mother, and is repressed socially. She also doesn't seem sure about her gender preferences as far as sex is concerned. All this is going on as she struggles to assume the dual roles of the good White Swan and the evil Black Swan in the ballet. She begins to experience strange phenomena and has difficultly distinguishing reality from fantasy. Then there is the self-harm, which is wince-inducing as she attacks herself.<br/><br/>Eventually, everything comes to a head on the opening night of the ballet.<br/><br/>Ten years before ""Black Swan"", the director, Darren Aronovsky, made the mother of all horror movies, ""Requiem for a Dream"". It didn't have a supernatural aspect nor did it blur real events with imagined ones – it was a raw slice of life about drug addiction, which made it doubly terrifying. Although ""Black Swan"" has a sumptuous ballet backdrop, it is more of what we think of as a horror movie, and has plenty of visual tricks.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds we realise that nearly all the strange events we see are actually in Nina's mind although her hallucinations are presented realistically on the screen. But we need to believe the reality of the scenes when she snaps out of it.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I can't help feeling that Aronovsky breaks a rule at the end; he cheats on the internal logic of the story with an ending I just can't believe, intense as it is. The injury Nina seems to have received in her dressing room would have most of us on a hospital gurney, crashing through the doors of the nearest emergency room with paramedics pumping our chests – not completing two strenuous dances before pirouetting to the top of the set for a standing ovation from the audience; the real just isn't real. For me it's a lapse in a movie that kept the tension ramped up to a high level throughout.<br/><br/>Even if you agree with that, ""Black Swan"" is still a powerful experience and worth seeing just for Natalie Portman's performance. Apart from breathtaking dance sequences, where her double could not have been involved, she projects alarming vulnerability, but is also the epitome of a beautiful, graceful, swan-like ballerina."

","Don't choose this movie, as I did, because you are hot for little Natalie Portman, and know she will be in ballet tights.<br/><br/>Maybe chose it for the echoing themes, in the Cabaret style, played out in the protagonist, and in the show her character performs, and in the movie itself. That's always what they used to call a 'head trip'.<br/><br/>Of course she plays a ballerina cast to play both the good white swan and the evil black swan. The director kept scolding her for never letting go and releasing her dark side. Meanwhile, there is an over controlling former ballerina mother, and a former mentor, now just fired, and a younger, more confident rival. And the director seemed like a sexual predator, and that his penis was the key to stardom.<br/><br/>It could have been terrific suspense, but instead, it was impossible to tell who was crazy, and what was real. There were horrifying scenes of her self mutilation, but some of the wounds that we saw inflicted weren't there, and some that we didn't see, were. The mentor was pretty surely hospitalized. But various stabbings of the mentor and rival and some hand smashings of the mother may or may not have happened.<br/><br/>It was psychedelic, I realized the next day. Christ I haven't seen a psychedelic movie since they flowered in the late 60's and gradually faded out in the 70's. And glad of it. I hate them. But this film was riveting and intense, so it towered above that genre.<br/><br/>And I got more true horror from what Natalie did to her cuticle than from various beheadings and disembowelling scenes in other films.<br/><br/>Natalie was more than willing to show her body scrawny and ugly, and her face ugly and distorted in intense passions. She is, as we know, a very good actress. Unless it was very good special effects, she also became a very plausible ballet dancer, at least to my ignorant eye.<br/><br/>Another ballerina, aging, did the swan flapping move, and the camera lingered on how the muscles and wrinkles worked in her strong but scrawny back. The impression it gave went through fascinating, into gross, but then back out again into more fascinating and even impressive. Good for the director!<br/><br/>So, it's unique, creative, intense, powerful, moving, fascinating, with multiple layers of symbolism and themes. It towers above its genre.

What Darren Aronofsky has created in this piece of filmmaking is such a rare case of what I could call ""the perfect movie"".<br/><br/>However, this movie is the type of film which you will completely love, or you probably are gonna absolutely hate, why?, 'cause its genre is not an easy step for commercial audience (even when the special effects, cinematography and direction makes it great for the marketing). It's like mixing Fight Club with Mulholland Drive, I mean, you are looking at an art-house film with a psycho-sexual story on it. So, if you like these types of films, it's likely for you to love it.<br/><br/>The superficial story is not very complex. It does get really messed up and confusing for the viewer but, nothing you would figure out after you've watched it. Nevertheless, when you try to reach for the psychological meaning of it, I mean, when you try to reach its depth, it will become an indomitable monster 'cause it really makes it to have a billion of interpretations on it, but, in my case, that's the best from this!<br/><br/>In fact, when you first see Black Swan, you'll probably buy the ""sweet, sexually-repressed girl going deep in darkness for an impossible role in a world where nothing is perfect... blah blah blah"" but, is it really like that? When you absolutely go deep in the story, you will discover lots of terrific things that makes this movie even better than the first time you saw it... <br/><br/>In my opinion, when the story takes place, you'll know you are in front of an incredible depiction of a narcissistic artist that destroys the perceptions and identities of the female gender and sexuality, just to expose a new and ""perfect"" (in therms of Aronofsky utopia) woman called ""Black Swan""<br/><br/>The ending is the most ambiguous part in the movie, and it will give lots of different interpretations to the whole motion picture. <br/><br/>Hope you give this movie a second try, and make it worth it, 'cause saying this movie is about the costs of perfection and how the lead character goes crazy 'cause of that, is like saying Star Wars is about aliens wanting to destroy other aliens... is just plain ridiculous and does not reveal anything new."

"Silverhawkins","Null","1","2","26 April 2014"," Obsession, beauty, desire and longing
","It's a film about obsession, about beauty, about desire and longing, and about jealousy. It will force a range of emotions upon you, from stark fear to arousal, and it has a soundtrack that will move you to tears. In all honesty, it wouldn't be amiss to declare that Black Swan is a perfect creation of cinema - a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Black Swan is essentially a modern retelling of the plot of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and it's utterly exhilarating. Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a ballet dancer in a New York City ballet company who, after years of trying, has finally scored the lead role of The Swan Queen in their upcoming production of Swan Lake. However, it's a precise role, requiring dual characteristics, both that of the Black Swan and the White Swan, and ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) isn't convinced that she's capable of exhibiting the right flare. Meanwhile, fellow dancer, newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis) seems to effortlessly portray the Black Swan, and Lily starts to fear that the girl is after her part.<br/><br/>Nina, whose character and personality is being repressed by her dominating mother, struggles to find some independence and adopt the free will and spirit of the Black Swan, and she initially befriends Lily, believing that her reckless lifestyle could inspire the freedom she needs for the role. However, it's not long before Lily seems more of a foe than a friend, and Nina's not sure she can control the dark side of herself that she is toying with.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky is famed for his explorative, and imaginative cinematography and Black Swan is a perfect example of this. There are numerous shots throughout that would be worth pausing and just enjoying as still photographs. This combined with intriguing set designs and astoundingly beautiful costumes (designed by Amy Westcott) make Black Swan a visual feast.<br/><br/>Both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis give career defining performances, particularly Portman, whose acting is surely worthy of Oscar attention, and as little as I know about ballet, it seemed to me they were both spectacular dancers too - certainly they move with a confidence and elegance that charm the viewer.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to neglect to mention Clint Mansell's superb score that underlies the entire movie. It is heavily drawn from Tchaikovsky's original music, but whilst that deems it ineligible for Oscar attention, it makes for a dramatic, majestic and emotional score, the likes of which hasn't really been used with film before. It's as if the 19th Century composer himself wrote the music.<br/><br/>In terms of genre, Black Swan occupies a definite grey area. In many ways it could be considered a horror. It's very frightening at times, predominantly due to suspense rather than constant visual shocks, and the shadowy, dark colour palette is especially foreboding. However, it perhaps functions more as a psychological thriller - what you see is rarely what is happening, the ballet director seems to be the architect of some dangerous mind games, and is Nina losing her mind? Undoubtedly there is much more method to the madness than might first appear and it's this magic of uncertainty and paranoia that will keep you spellbound through to the tragic, heart wrenching climax.<br/><br/>This is a triumph of film making and one to watch again and again. Definitely worth watching at the cinema."
"kamila-karas","Null","1","2","1 April 2014"," Not too impressed
","A love-it-or-hate-it movie. Aronofsky blurs the line between reality and fantasy, turning the film into a Gothic horror show that is fascinating and disappointing in equal measure. Nothing is perfect; Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin's script does have beautiful and organic (and almost poetic) dialogue, but the film does have its moments where it feels over-saturated and some superfluous plot devices could have been scrapped. In addition, some minor side characters were a bit underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Regardless of its flaws, none of which are necessarily damning, Black Swan marks an important chapter in director Darren Aronofsky's career. His direction (which reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's trademark technique — a compliment no doubt), alongside a beautiful score which consists of some of Swan Lake's most famous tunes, tie the film up very nicely, making it a true herculean masterpiece."

","Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey). The prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) is being replaced for the opening production of Swan Lake. Nina is the favorite, but new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) is impressive as well. Nina fits the role of the beautiful, fearful, fragile White Swan perfectly, but she can't get the Black Swan role right unlike Lily. She's obsessed with her deteriorating body as her paranoid mind collapses.<br/><br/>This is a great performance from Natalie Portman. There's a sense of chaos and insanity falling down on her. It definitely has the sensibility of director Darren Aronofsky. Although I do wonder where he's going with this movie at times. It has a realism and a horror feel to the movie. Portman's body slowly turns into a horror show is reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum picking apart his body in 'The Fly'. Mila Kunis is playing a pretty interesting mean girl, or is it all in Nina's head. That's the beauty of this movie. It plays not just with Nina's mind, but the audience's mind."

","Most negative reviews seem to focus on the absurdity of the portrayal of Nina's affliction, without apparently questioning exactly WHY she had arrived at that state. I don't believe the key reason was clear to all viewers, although there were many clues to just how depraved and desperate Nina's mother really was. An early scene showed Nina standing in a bathroom stall facing the toilet. There are only 2 reasons for this and it didn't sound like she was sick. Think ""Crying Game"" and you will see this movie on another level. Too much pink in her bedroom, too many ""my pretty little girl"" 's. Sexual confusion abounds. Many crotch-grabbing scenes - when will someone find out? Lesbian scene maybe - oh, just a dream or hallucination. Scratches on ""her"" back? The real personality trying to come out. Block her door with a chair? No, keep her mother out with a long, hard pipe. Original screenplay name was Alexandria. She would been called Alex though, which may have been too obvious. Her last name Sayers, same as the football player Gale Sayers, also a male with a female name. The self mutilation at the end was symbolic, I only wish it had been divulged what she really did. Alas, only 6 stars."

"tieman64","Null","1","2","4 March 2013"," Not too old to die young
","Satoshi Kon directed ""Perfect Blue"" in 1998. That film centred on a character called Mima, a young pop-star who leaves her clean-cut pop band in the hopes of beginning a career as an actress. But as Mima is forced into racier material, the film's narrative begins to break down, points-of-views, dreams, nightmares and private delusions overlapping and co-mingling. Eventually it becomes clear that Mima's breakdown is the result of, or induced by, a deeply disturbing culture. She's a victim of a world which pits sister against sister, which demands conformity, perfection, submission, is deeply sexist, bows to the tyranny of the image and is obsessed with both celebrity and a form of feminine perfection which tends toward neuroses, mental instability and finally collapse.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky bought the rights to ""Perfect Blue"" over a decade ago, an act which essentially allows him to rip it off with ""Black Swan"". His film borrows ""Blue's"" plot, themes, shots, but switches acting for ballet and changes Mima's name to Nina. And so Nina, played by Natalie Portman, is a young ballet dancer. She takes on the task of portraying both the white swan and black swan roles in an upcoming production of Swan Lake. Unfortunately Nina's director, sleazily played by Vincent Cassel, doesn't believe Nina to be capable of portraying both roles. Nina's a fine white swan, he says, but isn't sexy, dark and brooding enough to be a black swan as well. ""You need to touch yourself and live a little,"" Cassel says. Nina takes it upon herself to prove this man wrong. She too can be a slut, and so soar! <br/><br/>Both ""Perfect Blue"" and ""Black Swan"" then deal with a very specific identity split; the woman's pressure to be both virgin and whore, good girl and bad, and so a success. But as their original self images are undermined and deemed not sufficient, both girls become increasingly unstable, living up to expectations and personality images which must be painfully forged and constantly maintained. They must ""break themselves down"" in order to be ""rebuilt"" for an Other's gaze. In ""Perfect"" you're always aware of how this gaze is socially forged (fans, cameras, sexist and patriarchal pressures, money etc), whilst in ""Swan"", other women, and Nina herself, largely become the ""problem""; the source of mental illness.<br/><br/>Nina begins to change. Once frigid, a virgin, and a thoroughly good girl, Nina eventually succeeds in becoming a total slut, raving in dance clubs, having lesbian sex, fantasising about murder (she symbolically kills a rival/double and thus becomes TOTALLY BAD) and raging against everyone. She's the new ideal, both good girl and bad, a fact which angers ageing ballerina Beth (Winona Ryder), who is forced to confront the impossibility of maintaining the ""necessary"" level of perfection. In ""Perfect Blue"", Ryder's character is called Rumi, both women once successful in their younger days but now pushed aside to make way for younger models. In both films older women hate their younger replacements, but ""Perfect"" looks for root causes and ends with sympathy for its elder woman, whilst ""Swan's"" elderly women remain distant and/or villainous. Indeed, even Nina's mother, an ex ballerina who obsessively pushes her daughter, is treated as yet another monstrous woman by Aronofsky, rather than victim.<br/><br/>Aronofsky and Satoshi's differing preoccupations thus lead to vastly different climaxes. In ""Perfect"", Mima recognises the causes of her breakdown, rebels and asserts her own identity. She will henceforth be what she wants to be. In ""Swan"", Nina literally self-destructs on a ballet stage. The implication is that Nina suicidally gives her body wholly over to both the stage and the gaze; she is entirely yours, entirely possessed, a submission which echoes that of Ram the Wrestler in Aronofsky's last picture. Both deal with the giving of flesh over to the idea of celebrity, worth and fame, of giving one's flesh entirely over to art, until healthy passions give way to a very neurotic need to affirm one's worth to a culture which deems them worthless. But unlike ""Perfect"", ""Swan's"" more misogynistic than about misogyny. It's about ""perfection"" in a much more general sense. But seeking perfection and mastery in, say, the arts or sciences, is a perfectly noble or even healthy goal. Seeking perfection due to socially constructed feminine ideals is something else altogether. Aronofsky's film deals with the former, and so ends with a kind of lie.<br/><br/>Bizarrely, ""Swan"" doesn't recognise its aesthetic as being totally camp. The film is totally clichéd, totally goofy, filled with silly dialogue, obvious symbolism, material that has long been the subject of parody and plays like an Italian giallo movie, yet Aronofsky takes everything ULTRA SERIOUSLY. Indeed, much of ""Swan"" is comprised of chunks of better movies. You have bits of early DePalma, early Polanski (especially ""Repulsion""), ""Showgirls"", ""The Red Shoes"", ""Black Narcissus"", and of course ""All about Eve"". Nina's tale is also a less sophisticated, less touching version of Betty's tale in ""Mulholland Drive"" (also with doubles, identity blurring and mental breakdowns). ""Swan"" also borrows a number of well worn ballet clichés, like the ""ballerina who dies in the end"" cliché (""Waterloo Bridge"", ""Red Shoes"", ""Red Danube"", ""Spectre of the Rose"", ""Story of Three Lovers""), the ""female vamptress cliché"", the ""one dancer embodies the dark flip-side of the other cliché"", the ""psychosomatic disorder cliché"" (""Limelight"", ""Grand Hotel"") and the ""female rivalry cliché"", seen in dance films like ""Wishing Star"", ""Showgirls"", ""Dance, Girl, Dance"", ""The Unfinished Dance"", ""Suspria"", and the classic ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" Aronofsky, though, acts like these films don't exist.<br/><br/>6/10 – See Altman's ""The Company""."

","Knowing almost nothing about ballet, I watched this film after hearing good things about it. I thought it was going to be based on the tragic life of some Prima Donna.

It reminded me a bit of Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (only without the hilarity) probably because of the abundance of hallucinatory visual effects which were very well done; but also because both films were so highly over-rated! There was very little way of development in the film. The main character, Nina, starts off as being deranged and gets even more deranged then dies. The performances, however, were strong and I particularly enjoyed Portman, especially in the dance of the black swan, with the wings growing on her, and of course the music, though there was surprisingly little dancing.<br/><br/>May be I had the wrong expectations, but whatever one's expectations this film is not more than a 6/10."

"SeriousJest","8","1","2","29 January 2012"," Cast slams home another solid Aronofsky film about achievement at great personal cost
","Aronofsky's protagonists are often masters of their crafts who accomplish incredible feats at great cost (I wonder if he is projecting his own feelings into his movies). Accordingly, the success of his projects depend heavily on the performance of the lead. In this case, Portman is amazing. She loses herself in her role like her character, Nina, loses herself in hers. But what is often underrated in films like this is the importance of the supporting cast, because they, in essence, play reflections of the central character's personality, motivations, inspirations, and, ultimately, madness. Thus, Kunis is seductively enchanting as Nina's wild, dark, and sexual side. Cassel nails (no pun intended) Nina's insecurity and unrealistic self-expectations. Barbara Hershey drives home Nina's arrested development, but also her innocence and rational side. Winona Ryder convincingly embodies Nina's greatest aspirationsand simultaneously, her greatest fears.<br/><br/>I am not much into ballet (although I appreciate the beauty and grace of those extraordinarily talented women), but this film certainly kept me interested, entertained, and on the edge of my seat. Everyone should see this movie at some point, as it is brilliant. However, it's probably a one-time view, unless you're a ballet enthusiast, or you need to watch it again to figure some things out."

","Darren Aronofsky did another of his masterpieces here. I would say that he managed to get as closest as possible to the golden ration in the movie art, with this movie. <br/><br/>This movie dissects human mind in the way I haven't seen in the movie before. The story is about the young and promising ballet dancer, a girl that is obsessed with success, perfection and that does her best to become flawless in her profession. She lives with her mother, which has huge influence in her life, way of thinking, and her behavior. She represents a parent which tries to do what she thinks it's best for her child. Was she successful in it? - You should watch to movie and decide.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in the movie is something special. Dark, realistic, slow, sticky, hopeless in the moments, scary sometimes, cold... I would compare it to the atmosphere of the movie ""Pi"". Music is great and fits the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Acting is at the highest level possible! The effort made by Natalie Portman, to pick up all the ballet moves, is magnificent. It seems like she was able to act and impersonate everything that Aronofsky wanted her to, in a way that is fabulous. All of the twists, thoughts, breakdowns, paranoia, and whole specter of feelings that her character have were impersonated flawlessly. Mila Kunis, cute as always, did a fabulous job also. Same as Vincent Cassel and Winona Ryder as an ex ballet star.<br/><br/>This movie that manages to penetrate the mind of someone who is scared and ignorant about the world that surrounds her, is something that shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>Enjoy the movie!"

","Black Swan is one of the most intriguing movies one will get to see this year. The Director, Darren Aronofsky delivers the perfect concoction of Art, Drama, Suspense and Hysteria. Black Swan has everything in it to become the Dark Horse on the Oscar Night. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around New York City ballet company and their opening production of the new season, ""Swan Lake"". Much to the envy of other ballerinas, the artistic director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) chooses Nina Sassey (Natalie Portman) to play the leading role. Nina is a typical innocent 'Sweet Girl' and someone who has worked her way up through discipline and hard work. The role of the Swan Queen was all she ever dreamt of and is determined to make the act perfect. <br/><br/>The act of Swan Queen has two aspects; one of the White Swan and the other of the Black Swan. While, Nina is all perfect as the graceful White Swan, Leroy doubts if she can do justice to the dark side as well. While she has all the grace and charm to play the White Swan, can she play the alter ego? <br/><br/>Dedicated to make the act perfect, Nina is forced to shed her innocence and the image of 'sweet girl' to embrace the dark side. There is also Lily (Mila Kunis) who is naturally perfect as the Black Swan and someone Nina fears will steal the role away from her. <br/><br/>Pushed too much by exhaustion and fear of not being perfect, Nina loses control of herself; or at least her mind and falls into a world of surreal. Alonofsky builds an effective world of surrealism with essence of violence, sex and drugs that confuse Nina just as much as the audience. The climax is surprising and unfolds brilliantly keeping the audience at the edge of their seats till the last line. <br/><br/>Two aspects of the movie are truly remarkable that makes the viewing all the more special. The direction and Natalie's portrayal of Nina. Natalie looks and dances exactly like as a ballerina. The choreography is excellent and Natalie's portrayal of Nina, her innocence, fear and anxiety definitely earned the Oscar. <br/><br/>www.jayanthj.blogspot.com"

","I'm always wary when a director I really care about hits it big time cause we've been let down before but Aronofsky actually pulls it off. Nothing here that you haven't seen before one way or the other: A struggling ballet dancer on the verge of her breakthrough; an unhealthy mother-daughter dependency, an alter ego in the shape of a beautiful competitor, an aging star that goes berserk, yet everything about this film comes together beautifully: the script, the acting, the pace, but what I cared about most was the subtle camera-work. For instance, in the grand finale, the opening night of Swan Lake when it's all of nothing for our enduring heroine, the temptation would be to employ a great many camera movements with dolly and cranes and whatnot inter-cut with an awestruck audience when Nina dances her way to towards the climax but Aronofsky resists the temptation and instead relies on a refreshing down to earth approach with hand-held cameras that make you really feel as if you were part of the action. Likewise he avoids all the inevitable clichés with breathtaking finesse. At the core of this lies Nina's madness and the only film I can think of that matches the creepy feel of Black Swan would be Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. How she catches her mirror reflection scratching at her back or the scene where her toes have grown together are just the tip of the iceberg. Natalie Portman does a really great job of portraying this desperately eager dancer. Her intense acting allows Aronofsky to plunge right into the action instead of taking his time to build up the character, thus the film clocks in at a little over 100 minutes, which I find really admirable cause I reckon everyone else had dragged it out at least for 2 hours. Why can't there be more mainstream movies like this."

","Gratuitous and heavy-handed. It's not that it's without its merit - it's very impressive visually, and a powerful, intense atmosphere is kept throughout. The performances are all terrific too, especially a small but powerful and surprising turn from Winona Ryder. But the plot is predictable and pointless, and the film feels like it's trying way too hard to shock and to create discomfort.<br/><br/>None of which is Darren Aronofsky's fault - his directorial work is engrossing and original, and he's still in my book as one of the most promising directors of our times, in the same page as Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson and Chris Nolan. The problem is that after the wonderful maturity of his masterpiece The Wrestler, Black Swan feels like a regression, as it's closer to the heavy manipulation of Requiem for a Dream than The Wrestler's restrained minimalism. I just hope its success won't drive Aronofsky further down that road, and keeps trying much harder than he has to."

So, if you're one of the many people out there who are about as interested in ballet as you are in the lichen-per-square meter count of a cave system under Norway, you'll probably spend a good deal of this movie wondering what the fuss is about.<br/><br/>The director has clearly put a lot of effort into making sure that the theme of main character Nina's inner turmoil runs deep throughout this movie, but it's almost as if he was so focused on this theme that he forgot about little things like pacing, execution and style. The camera work is particularly annoying, filmed in that familiar 'shaky-cam' style to impress a sense of discord and turmoil to the viewer, but ultimately, you just wish they'd hold the damn camera still. The dialogue is wooden and forgettable and the characters seem fairly one-dimensional and cliché: all the cast is here - the incredibly high pressure and high maintenance mother, the authoritarian Boss who's constantly hitting on Nina, and even Nina herself fits into the 'not-quite-perfect' princess mold... Being able to display differing shades of 'distraught' doesn't make for an award-winning performance. In fact, it's just tiring to watch. Also, and this may just be the acting of Natalie Portman, but the scenes that were overtly sexual or violent in nature seemed completely out of place. We don't see any progression into these outbursts of intense emotion, no slow downward spiral or anything like that, they just HAPPEN, as if the director felt the need to grab you by your ears and scream into your face: ""HEY! SHE'S GOING CRAZY! DO YOU GET IT YET?!?""<br/><br/>And again, this reviewer can't stress enough the point about how you WILL have to at least be interested in ballet to watch this film, because that's all there is at stake here: a good opening night performance. That is essentially the only tangible obstacle that Nina faces in this entire movie. And the film emphasizes this point by dedicating the vast majority of the time on screen to discussing various ballet-related backstory and other ballet-related plot developments. By the time Nina's character finally DOES start to show some signs of 'cracking up', you almost welcome it, if only for those precious few seconds where you won't be listening to more ballet-related trivia.<br/><br/>While there are some effective scares, and some special effects worthy of mention, really, this film rides entirely on the viewers interest in a particular lifestyle (ballet) - if you are one of the many women who's ever dreamed of being a ballet dancer, then that's probably you. The rest, however, probably won't understand why they just spent 108 minutes watching a film about a woman stressing over her ballet performance.<br/><br/>Nobody is saying ballet isn't hard, it surely is. But if an astronaut can handle a very real risk of dying every time they're called into duty, it's kind of difficult to relate to a story about a ballet dancer who simply can't handle 'the pressure', even if she IS a headcase. 4/10"

","I'm very glad that i enjoyed this film! One because i had to purchase it on Blu-ray and two, many of my friends suggested it to me. Ill admit, i wasn't all for the ballerina aspect, but i was all over the dark/sinister aspect. i felt scared, tormented, etc. i enjoyed how dark the film got despite the fact that i only jumped once. what i loved about the film is there is no explanation, its all up to the viewer. and to this point, i still don't know what to make of everything that happened. but all in all, still a great film! if you're someone like me who loves a dark atmosphere, you will be pleased and yes it cancels out the ballet concept."

Most of the time, Mila Kunis, is in Comedies but in this movie, she's different. The Music in the movie was amazing and captures the tone of the film. The character, Nina, was also great because her personality in the movie switches from the White Swan to the Black Swan.

"liza-ulcakar","10","1","2","9 August 2011"," Simply perfect
","In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made....let me correct my mistake; it's perfect. I've always loved psychic dramas, especially those by Aronofsky. You can say about Black Swan anything you want, and I do understand if you think it's stupid and absurd, because it's just not made for everyone. I am one of those who understood this movie and its message. I loved the way the main character Nina Sayers slowly drifts into paranoia and changes into the black swan. The second time I watched it I noticed that the ""Swan lake"" story actually took place in her own life; she was weak and fragile (White Swan) meanwhile her choreographer wanted to draw the dark, the fearless and the passionate side of her (I loved how she progressively started to wear darker clothes ending with total black). At the end he finally wins and gets her Black Swann side. Eventually the White Swan dies (just like in the story).<br/><br/>Nina sayers wanted to be perfect, as she eventually was, and so was the movie; acting was perfect, music was perfect, effects were perfect, the way it was filmed, the story was perfect, the clothing was perfect, makeup was perfect, everything was perfect."
"xJags","10","1","2","5 August 2011"," The Best Movie in years!
","Black Swan starts Natalie Portman as Nina, a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life is dance. The new season opens with the director, Thomas Leroy's(Vincent Cassel) version for which he must replace Beth(Winona Ryder), the prima ballerina. Nina is the first choice however a new dancer, Lily(Mila Kunis) is quite the competition. Swan Lake has 2 sides, The White Swan which Nina is perfect for and the Black Swan which Lily's personification fits. It is here Nina's obsession with perfection could lead to her destruction.<br/><br/>There are so many reasons why I love this movie. First off is Natalie Portman's breathtaking portrayal of Nina. To see Natalie's perfection of the character Nina's extreme transformation is phenomenal.You really want to root for Nina. This is also Mila Kunis' big break as her portrayal of the ""frenemy"", Lily with which she does an amazing job. Cassel,Ryder and Hershey do fantastic jobs with their roles as well.<br/><br/>The script was so well written and its execution was fantastic! I love the fact that this movie plays with your mind and is so intense. The ""Did that really happen?"" aspect of the movie was executed so well. The movie's sensuality in comparison to performance was genius! Also the music and sound for the movie were perfect! <br/><br/>The thing I love most about this movie is the fact that there are so many questions and possibilities! People watch the movie but each person might get a different interpretation of it. Was Lily a friend or enemy? Did Nina imagine the entire thing? and more.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot fault Black Swan. Its is Pure Genius and The Best Movie of 2010 for me and will forever be one of my favorites."
"ephemereality","7","1","2","26 July 2011"," Style without substance
","Black Swan has all the ingredients that could make it good: a good cast, an interesting premise and the budget and director that could pull it off. Yet the final product doesn't even end close to good, in fact, Black Swan ends up as simply straight out bad. The story revolves around Nina (Natalie Portman), a ballet dancer who just got the lead role of the White and Black Swan in Swan Lake, and how she slowly transforms from the White into the Black Swan. So what exactly went wrong? First of all, this film is extremely pretentious. It tries so hard in delivering its message that the message actually completely fails all together. There is a corn of gold hidden within the main plot in telling a story about performance anxiety and the need to rely on others, but this is not the route Black Swan has taken. Similar to Perfect Blue (which partly inspired Aronofsky), Black Swan revolves around a woman in the entertainment industry and how she increasingly loses her sanity as paranoia takes over. However, in Perfect Blue, the explanation for this paranoia was completely reasonable and well-thought out, whereas in Black Swan the paranoia is simply not believable because of the poor characterization.<br/><br/>This leads me to the second issue I had with this film, namely the characters. Whoever thinks that the characters within Black Swan are deep and three-dimensional should rethink this statement, because it simply is not true. Mind you, I do not dislike two-dimensional characters per se, especially not if the film is not character-driven since the character development would then matter less. However, Black Swan is character-driven. Being able to portray a compelling main lead is therefore vital, and more importantly being able to portray a main lead to whom the audience can relate to. Black Swan fails in both areas. Nina is a horrible character who is supposed to plunge between two extremes – two extremes that are poorly developed since you will rarely find these kind of extremes in actual people. Honestly, how many 28-year-old women do you know that still live with their mothers, still maintain a child-mother relationship (as opposed to grown up-mother relationship) and decorate their rooms like little girls would? I cannot name one. Aronofsky goes to extreme lengths in trying to symbolize the White and Black Swan, and therein lies the pretentiousness, because unless the viewer is completely daft, it is simply too obvious. Take for example Lily (Mila Kunis) and how she even got a tattoo on her back looking like two black wings. Add her liberated behavior and she automatically turns into the ""bad girl"", or to be exact, the whore. Instead of representing Nina's struggles to become an independent woman reaching success similar to for example Secretary (that shares plot ideas with Black Swan albeit in a dark comedy setting), the tragedy lies in that Nina fails without a man to guide her, because Black Swan is undeniably told as a modern tragedy.<br/><br/>This ultimately leads me to my biggest gripe with this film – namely its demonization of liberated women. Yes, you read right, this film demonizes liberated women as the only way women can properly behave are those akin to the White Swan: innocent, virginal and motherly with a man at her side, always guiding her actions (ergo the White Swan's ultimate demise is that she fails to find a man to love her like a proper woman). Basically, the whole film is a retelling of the Madonna versus the Whore dichotomy in a (post)postmodern setting and in that sense, this film is actually utterly disgusting and a slap in the face of all women who struggled and still struggle against the oppression of patriarchy.<br/><br/>In summary, Black Swan is a slick production that superficially looks great and is meant to attract a wide audience, but once you dig some beneath that slick surface, you find there is simply no actual substance within, beyond the idea that women ultimately can never be free. The only real way Nina could ever have succeeded would be to be born as a man, but alas, she was not. There is no interest to tell a story about ballet (it just happened to be the setting of choice), nor is there any interest to tell a great drama about women's struggles. As such, Black Swan comes off as an incredibly clichéd film that is the ultimate representation why women are still not considered equal to men."
"sergepesic","6","1","2","25 July 2011"," Mediocre
",""" Black Swan"" is what happens when Hollywood pretends to be independent. Mediocre script, filled with the simplifications and stereotypes, quirky camera work and decent, but not fabulous acting -it just about sums it all up. Why is it so difficult to have an original idea? There are tens of thousands of creative young people with fresh thinking and clear heads. There are so many good actors that never get a single chance to show what they are made of. Instead failed models and pretty people without anything to offer pretend to act. It works for several years and than they fade away dazed like deer caught in headlights. This is not a bad movie or horrible acting. This is just mediocre, trivial dumbed down little flick. Oscar??? It's a joke."
"davideo-2","Null","1","2","24 July 2011"," Driven more by style than character, this will alienate some but pays off if you take it all in
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman) is a shy, nervous girl whose passion is performing ballet. In the face of stiff competition from more confident, forward girls, she wins the lead role in an up-coming production of Swan Lake in New York City, when demanding instructor Leroy (Vincent Cassel) drops older performer Beth (Winona Ryder) and invites her in. It's from here she becomes friendly with co star Lily (Mila Kunis), a more spirited girl who evokes emotions in her previously untapped. But the better Nina does, the more she is pushed and the more her strive to achieve perfection drives her dangerously over the edge and she finds her sanity waning.<br/><br/>Despite the rave reviews and the numerous awards they've won, I saw neither Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler (which makes this film even stranger!) or Black Swan at the cinema, and had to wait to see them on DVD. This may make their scope smaller to me in the eyes of some, since being on 'the big screen' is what the 'big films' of whatever day they're released in most will remember seeing them on. Luckily, Aronofsky, whichever way you look at it, is a director with talent, and he makes films where this manages to shine through in whichever format you see them in. There are a good few who would have missed his smaller, more independent but critically acclaimed effort Requiem for a Dream (which I've never seen!) but The Wrestler managed to be a far more mainstream effort and was an undoubted work of brilliance, one of, if not the, best film of the 00s many claim. But while that worked as a character study of a man adored by loads he doesn't know but seen as greatly flawed by those who are supposed to be closest to him, Black Swan is a film driven more by atmosphere and claustrophobia, or rather an impending and illogical sense of these things. In many ways it is also a character study, of a girl with great untapped talent and potential, whose innocent and sincere determination to be the best at what she does, at odds with her deep insecurity and fundamental lack of belief in herself, pushes her over the edge, but it's delivery, at least at the beginning, is as such that it makes it hard to get into and may alienate some viewers from the off set.<br/><br/>That the performances are so fantastic is for sure a bonus point, Portman in the lead role great as the central protagonist, a Carrie White style character still living with a domineering and controlling mother (Barbara Hershey) who hasn't let her really grow up and experience the world, whose shyness and vulnerability never really seem to go away as she progresses further and has to battle with her mounting delusions, and secondary mentions must go to Cassel as the archetypal slave driving instructor, a man prepared to push his lead star to a nervous breakdown in his quest to get the best out of his play and, more selflessly, her, while co stars Kunis and, in a far more minor role, Ryder also compliment the overall flavour of things. Unlike The Wrestler, it doesn't work as well telling a story as it does being a movie revolving around a sense of style and atmosphere that may be lost on some but which is there if you pay close enough attention. ****"

","Where to begin? Just because you don't understand it doesn't make the movie a bad movie. What makes it a good movie anyway? Let's start with the story. Is it a good story? The story of the Black Swan is really simple - even though there are two stories weaved together. One is fantasy and the other is reality. Where fantasy and reality meet is The Black Swan Movie, and it can get really ... pointless. That's right, at first I could not find the right word to describe this movie, but the word, ""pointless"", is just perfect. Of course, there are the obvious answers, like it's an Academy Award vehicle for Natalie Portman, or it's so pretentious directors like Darren Aronofsky can garner more praises for himself. I wonder if Aronofsky would be where he is today if he was Latino, Arab, or Asian? Not to say the Latino, Arab, or Asian Aronofsky would not be a director, but he probably would be just another guy without the glamorous job. The movie, however, does not really have a point. Is it that Ballerinas are all psychotic and want to be the Swan Queen? Or maybe have a gratuitous, lesbian, sex scene so it can potentially titillate the Men who were dragged to see the movie by their ""wannabe, dancer"" girlfriends?"
"joy_lamoya","4","1","2","17 June 2011"," Don't push it!
","You can love or hate Black Swan, but certainly it won't be just another movie. I have to give that to the director, who tries hard (REALLY hard) to show a very sick girl in some sort of beautiful light.<br/><br/>Personally, I found the movie too self-aware and pretentious, pushing the buttons of this unstable main character (Nina, played by Portman) in such an obvious way that it's almost annoying. Sure, a huge amount of pseudo-intellectual viewers are going to find it genius, but in the end, Aronosfky just directed a very elegant version of Saw.<br/><br/>Nina was sick to begin with, pressure didn't crack her at all. We don't have a story; we have a train wreck. Portman did an awesome job like most of the cast of the movie, but the plots urge of being a masterpiece just ruined it from the beginning. The movie shouts out loud 'I'm cooler than you and you should praise me for that'. I'm not sure if it is the script or the directing, but someone is trying just too hard.<br/><br/>Photography was beautiful in a green-ish kind of way. It's cold and uncomfortable in the beginning, but it gives a nice atmosphere for the concept. The screen just lightens up when Kunis (playing Lily, Nina's fellow dancer) appears: She's just a breath of fresh air in a suffocating movie. I'm guessing that that's the idea, but you know, not even a great performances can save a film that lacks humbleness."
"smatysia","6","1","2","15 June 2011"," Obvious Oscar bait
","This film is obvious Oscar bait. Whenever you have a late-year film with a well known actor or actress, whose role requires madness or retardation, then you know what it's all about. Mission accomplished, I guess. Natalie Portman, of course, plays an extremely demanding role. It is also extremely unattractive and unappealing. Many scenes are downright ugly and very hard to watch. Okay, I understand that this not supposed to be light entertainment. But man, this is hard. Mila Kunis was also excellent in the contrasting role. The direction was a bit too full of itself, long shots following the back of Portman's head, etc. Following Nina into the depths of her madness is difficult but not completely unrewarding."
"hall895","7","1","2","4 June 2011"," Losing yourself
","Natalie Portman plays Nina, a ballerina in a prestigious New York City company. Nina's toiled away for years, perfecting her craft. She's come a long way, had plenty of success. But she's never made the big breakthrough, never been the lead, the big star. She needs that validation, she's desperate for it. Thomas, the director of the company, announces they will be doing Swan Lake. Nina will get her chance. It's now or never. She needs this part, she needs to be the Swan Queen. Her life is nothing if she fails. The good news is that Nina is absolutely perfect for the part of the innocent, virginal White Swan. The bad news is it's a dual part. Whoever gets the part also has to play the dark, sensual, evil Black Swan. And for this half of the Swan Queen role Nina is all wrong. Can she summon up the darkness inside her? And if she can what will be the cost? Losing herself in this role may well cause her to lose her mind.<br/><br/>Thomas knows Nina has the dancing talent to be the Swan Queen. She's up to the task physically. But mentally? Emotionally? That's something else altogether. This sheltered girl, hovered over her whole life by her very, very overprotective mother, has no life experience to draw on to be the Black Swan. Thomas needs her to attack the role but she doesn't know how. Nina's a perfectionist, obsessed with getting all her movements just right. She won't, or can't, allow herself to be swept away, to lose herself in her performance. As an example of what Nina needs to be there is the new dancer in the company, Lily. Everything comes easily to Lily. She's not technically perfect. But she makes dancing look effortless. She connects with the material and the audience in a way Nina can't. Lily is the perfect Black Swan. Thomas sees it. Nina sees it. If Nina is going to be the Swan Queen she'd better find her dark side in a hurry.<br/><br/>Becoming the Black Swan is going to require Nina to go to previously uncharted areas of her mind. She's willing to do whatever it takes but she really has no idea of the terribly dark places this might take her. We watch Nina begin to unravel right before our eyes. She's losing it and Portman portrays this wonderfully. A breathtaking performance, helped no doubt by director Darren Aronofsky who captures the descent into madness beautifully. Aronofsky employs some clever visual tricks along the way, notably making wonderful use of all those mirrors ballerinas are constantly studying themselves in. Aronofsky takes us right inside Nina's mind and it turns out that is a very scary place to be. The sweet, young girl we saw in the film's beginning disappears. The Black Swan consumes her. The film isn't perfect. There is a temptation to say that as Nina loses her grip on reality Aronofsky loses his grip on his film. Things do seem to get away from him just a bit in the end. But it's still powerful, fascinating stuff. A great story, performed wonderfully by a stellar cast. Portman obviously gets the lion's share of the attention and deservedly so. She's fantastic from beginning to end in a role that was exceptionally demanding both physically and emotionally. But she's not alone in her brilliance. Vincent Cassel is terrific as Thomas, the man desperately trying to draw the Black Swan out of Nina. Barbara Hershey is the well-meaning but ultimately rather monstrous mother who refuses to let Nina grow up, to truly live. Hershey plays the part perfectly. Winona Ryder has a small but important role as an aging ballerina being pushed aside and Ryder makes the most of every moment she has. Then there's the real revelation, Mila Kunis. She plays Lily and she is stunning in every sense of the word. Very few would have guessed Kunis had something like this in her. Full credit to Aronofsky for giving her the chance. She surely made the most of it. For as good as all the supporting players are there is no doubt this is Portman's show. And she turns in a performance for the ages. Nina is transformed. Portman is too. People will always look at her differently now. She's not just a cute, popular movie star anymore. She's an actress of the highest caliber. Black Swan may not be a truly great movie, but it's a very good one. If greatness eludes the movie it doesn't elude Portman. The performance she turned in here is as good as it gets."
"neo9773","5","1","2","3 June 2011"," Portman redeems this movie
","I thought that James Cameron had taken the cake with over-produced, flash before substance filmmaking, but Aronofsky has thrown his hat in the ring and is a serious contender for the title with this film.<br/><br/>I suppose if you are completely infatuated with this film's director (as it seems Hollywood and the Academy are), you are able to look past the completely predictable plot, ridiculous metaphors, and entirely predictable ending.<br/><br/>Seriously, it would seems as though this film was written by the Daniel Kauffman character from Adaptation after he attended a seminar on how to write psy-thrillers.<br/><br/>Further, I have had it with the over-stylized direction of all the movies I have seen recently (Limitless, Hanna, Black Swan, I am number 4.) Its like we are living in a 13 year-old's world and we need to be over-stimulated because we have been slamming Mt.Dew and Sugar Bombs all day. Note to directors: tell your story, film the actors doing their thing. If you feel like you need to start spinning the camera in manic circles or add a crap-ton of CG, maybe rework the script or shoot it over. I don't need stockmarket tickers on the ceiling (Limitless) to know that Bradly Cooper is doing math in his head and visualizing. And without giving up too much, I didn't need the cg in this film to realize what the director is trying to convey metaphorically. It feels cheap and contrived, and somewhat condescending.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 5 stars on the basis of Portman's performance. She is a fine actor and delivers once again."

","Never wait to see a film after awards season. That is what I did and it may have tainted my expectations a bit. Personally, I was very excited to see Black Swan. I had been diligently following the film before they had even started shooting. I like some of Natalie's work and was intrigued to see some of Aronofsky's. Ballet is also a big interest of mine. I love psychological thrillers, or any film that toys w/ my mind and makes me think. So Black Swan from the beginning had the perfect ingredients for me. My mistake though was that I did not get to see the film until after awards season. After all of the hype, the praise, the pageantry. I think the overkill pumped my expectations up too much and it made the movie seem a bit lackluster when I finally saw it. The runtime was too short for my taste, and I don't think the director and cast pushed the story and characters as far as they could have. I had the feeling they were either being generic at some points or playing it safe. I did not even favor Natalie that much in her performance. I know there was a lot of praise for her, and I do not mean to diminish the work she put into her performance, but it was not as earth shattering as some people found it. To me Black Swan did not take the leap it could have, it did not push its boundaries farther (as a film, the characters, the stories, etc.) It teetered between going all the way and playing it safe. It was okay to me in the end. I honestly would have found more enjoyment in seeing a production of Swan Lake as opposed to this film. Maybe I should have done that."

","Firs off, hats off to Natalie Portman and what is a stalwart performance, comprising of charm, beauty, tenacity, mystique, intensity and vulnerability. Miss Portman inhabits these characteristics and emotions and really takes (us) the audience on a roller coaster of emotions throughout the film. Secondly the directing...first class. The hand held camera work is utilised to a tee and the film has a sheen to it that coats the whole ambiance of the movie in sheer brilliance. There's plenty of scares, twists and turns and shock revelations that really keep your eyes pinned to the screen, not to mention some erotically/passionately charged making out scenes that really add to the dimensions of Nina's (Natalie Portman's) persona. And finally - the dancing...simply...breathtaking.<br/><br/>So to conclude this film is ace and I can't wait to watch a previous couple of films by Darren Aronofsky that I have yet to watch (The Fountain & The Wrestler)...I have really high hopes for them both."

","I truly don't understand why some of the reviewers hate this film so ! You never know if you are going to enjoy a movie - however weird or boring - it is 'til you've seen it. I fully intended to buy this title, to start replacing thousands of titles I gave-away or threw-out....wish I still had them all......<br/><br/>Although the sex-scenes in this film truly shocked me, it wasn't the first time I've been shocked before. As the movie unraveled and we saw how the childish-but-brilliant dancer ""The Swan"" (Natalie Portman) was maturing (through masturbation) was beginning to survive the fanatic dominance of her mother (Barbara Hershey), it should have prepared us for the not-so-unusual scene with ""Lily"" (Mila Kunis) - every ballet-themed film I've ever seen has had mucho sex-scenes, of all kinds....except for ""The Red Shoes"". I respect one's preference in sexual matters, but we DO need to be aware that our own preference isn't the only one. As many have written, there are lots of other strange goings-on in this movie, which make it the interesting film it is. I was not aware that director Darren Aronofsky is especially famous for his unusual plots - also unfamiliar with scriptor Marc Heyman; but, I don't go to see any particular film to see what its creators are presenting. I'm hoping to find a plot that isn't readily foreseeable, and will provide me with a different story.<br/><br/>The only disappointment with the untidy-and-quick method the ballet-company's lead dancer was disposed-of. No doubt, there was much more to this story than was presented in tne finished product.<br/><br/>Not to give-away too much of the plot, I will only say ""The Red Shoes"" also featured a brilliant ballerina determined to destroy herself than not be able to dance. I shall also let you know ballerina Margot Fonteyne added years to her career with the arrival into the company by a fabulous, Russian male-cancer (many years her junior). The method of self-destruction was different and more understandable than ""The Black Swan"" used, but any true artist does live for their art, whether they can adjust to catastrophic changes in their careers, or not.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Black Swan"" and got its message immediately. I look forward to many move viewings, because I always find something different in every viewing. Those folk who only like one kind of film certainly narrow-mindedly limit their enjoyment (and life's-knowledge) by not finding the true message of any film, no matter what genre it is.

Maybe my girlfriend would like it. I was expecting something along the lines of The Usual Suspects, where I'm sitting at the edge of my seat, paying attention to every little detail to see if I can figure out the twist at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>That is exactly what I did. I was wide-eyed, while my girlfriend fell asleep. The first time I realized whatever just happened was just in her head, I was really excited. How much of it was really in her head? How do I figure out what was real and what wasn't? I almost re-started from the beginning right there. Then, I realized if I wasn't expecting a twist, I'd be really bored right now. Ohhh, there better be an awesome twist! Is she being drugged this whole time? Is this girl trying to help her, have sex with her, take her role, or even kill her? Did she kill her mom by accident? Did she kill that girl? I was glad that I stayed awake for the sex scene. Thank you for that.<br/><br/>The end of the movie absolutely crushed me! Oh you mean, she's just a stupid, crazy ballerina, who thinks ballet is real? Come on! I dated one of those! They all take it way too seriously! Sigh..... I wanted some logical explanation for all the crazy stuff that was happening, and maybe tie in her mom's history a bit more. Something that explains WHY all of this stuff was happening. You can't just say ""oh, she's crazy"" What a cop-out! This had all of the creativity (story-wise) as Trick-r-Treat.<br/><br/>With that said, the cinematography, was some of the best I've ever seen! If not, it was the best! I may re-watch this just for the cinematography. The lighting, camera angles, camera movement, position on the screen! Everything! It just set the right mood and contributed to the story and the feeling. Absolutely epic! <br/><br/>So, the cinematographer saved this movie for me. Other than that... crazy ballerina loses her mind? eh, seen it. With a different ending, this movie could have gone down in history. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe I don't have the necessary vision. Maybe the incorrect half of my brain is functional to ""get"" this movie. Maybe it will go down in history as a great. If it does, someone please explain to me why. I want to understand. Seriously, I don't get it."

","Black Swan engaged the culture of the ballet, the beauty of Swan Lake, to tell what is essentially a back stage drama. We have the slave driving mother, babying her daughter, pushing her to accomplish what she couldn't accomplish. We have the vulnerable and fractured offspring, following a path that can only lead to her destruction. Laid on top is the oft Hollywood thematic that a person is not whole unless she is sexually awakened. Technically, the film is excellent. Ms Portman gives a worthy performance. Vincent Cassel demonstrated again why he is once of the best and most versatile film actors in any language. But to my eyes and ears, all of this together with the high culture setting of the ballet, merely covers up a story line that is cliché at the very least."

"geminiredblue","10","1","2","3 May 2011"," Into the Mouth of Madness
","Whenever I sit through a Darren Aronofsky film, I always feel like I've just been hit by a train at the end! His movies are usually assaults on our psychological make-up. I dare anyone to sit through REQUIEM FOR A DREAM or BLACK SWAN and not feel overwhelmed afterwards. Both films delve into the darker sides of the characters and we're brought along for the ride. In BLACK SWAN, we're invited into the world of professional ballet. And we meet Nina, the protagonist, who's been doing ballet all her life (though it's more than hinted that her domineering mother forced her into it.) Nina is quiet, perfection-driven, and most likely virginal. When she gets the part of the Swan Queen in Swan Lake, Nina must somehow find a way to display both the White Swan (forlorn, looking for love, graceful) and the Black Swan (seductive, insane, domineering, powerful.) As practice goes on, we learn more about Nina's life and psyche as it starts to take a downward spiral. In fact, it seems that her own life is becoming the story of Swan Lake. By the end, we can all but tell she's gone over the edge. Not being a ballet fan, I have little knowledge of the art form. However, being a performer, I can understand where the character of Nina comes from. Whether you're a ballerina, a musician, or an actor, there comes a time when you're no longer the normal, average person. That person has stepped out and has been replaced by the character or persona. It's quite difficult to maintain two or more roles at once, especially when you also have to contend with everyday stresses, like work, relationships, and bills. However, the greatest performers are able to disappear into their roles and present to us the truth of their characters. Nina has simply taken it one step further, as we watch her crazed and tragic ascent and descent into the role of a lifetime. Natalie Portman does a tremendous job, as always. Mila Kunis does an equally stellar job as Lily, her rival. In fact, the whole cast was spectacular! From an artistic standpoint, I liked how most of the color scheme was on the gray scale, with a few dashes of pink, red, or green to highlight crucial moments. Once again, Darren Aronofsky astounds the senses with tricky shots and surreal imagery. This film is not for the light-hearted who are looking for cheap thrills. But for the rest of you, take the journey into the mouth of madness!"
"Polaris_DiB","7","1","2","24 April 2011"," Sticks close to what you should expect, with enough room to surprise newcomers to the genre
","This movie is actually difficult for me to review because it was pretty much exactly what I expected, through and through. I place Aronofsky's greatest gift at putting the viewer into the mindset emotional topography of the character, but here it sort of comes as part of the package, considering he's making what is honestly an identity thriller typical of his contemporaries back in the late 90s. You've really got it all here, mirrors, doppelgangers, mirrors, sexual confusion, mirrors, blurring of fantasy and reality, and mirrors within mirrors. If we consider ""identity thriller"" to be a genre, this is one of its more straightforward additions.<br/><br/>That said, it's still shot beautifully, featuring a particular style of grayscale that had me captured by the first few moments of the trailer and never ceased to let me down throughout the actual movie. And as Aronofsky's gift for cerebral suturing goes, unlike in his other films where such an immersion takes place over time, you're basically stuck in Nina's head from the moment the movie starts, with only enough indication of the world outside the movie to make everything so deliciously claustrophobic.<br/><br/>But what makes that work (as opposed to just make you shift in your seat uncomfortably for two hours) is two things: Natalie Portman's acting, and small details in the background characters. Portman's acting does not need too much elaboration because she's the star of the show, and shines: that's what is. What helps is that it's counterpositioned against the rest of the ballerina troupe--not just Lily, but the rest of them as well. There, petty jealousies, misunderstood whispers, even gestures with no significance intended set the entire tone of the scene for Nina/us. It's common enough to set a movie inside someone's rapidly deteriorating mind--but it's really difficult to do what I think Aronofsky pulled off doing, and that is showing enough indication that there's an actual reality outside of the mind being completely washed over from stress. Dare I say that this movie is then exactly what it would be like, having a mental breakdown while the evidence is clearly there that the breakdown is occurring? Certainly there have been times when I've known there is nothing to be upset about, but managed to let myself go anyway. The problem here is that Nina is outright encouraged to go crazy.<br/><br/>Another thing I really like about this movie, though, is that it's potential for literary allusion or allegorical meaning or whatever is actually ignored. It would have been so easy for Aronofsky to use this space as a place to pound Meaning and Significance, but for all the stylistic shenanigans I'd actually consider this movie quite reserved. The stuff that happens is kinda crazy but when it's over, it's over, and we're not left with some unearned pseudoquestion like whether the top falls or keeps spinning. We know what happened, because that's all the movie is concerned with doing.<br/><br/>I don't think it's Aronofsky's best, nor that it should really surprise anyone who has ever heard of David Lynch, Nicolas Roeg, or Jorge Luis Borges (to name just a few off hand). I think this movie might have been quite the profound experience to someone not familiar with those people or Aronofsky's other work, in which case I recommend they follow up. For those who love or hate Aronofsky, it is not going to change their mind either way one bit. And for those of you who are like, ""Eh? Aron-who-sky...? Bore-gus? Isn't this the movie with Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis getting it on?!"" yes, yes they do, and it's... pretty much the type of sex scene that is featured in a movie like this, which means you'll probably have something else on your mind while it's happening, like figuring out what the heck is going on. It's not that type of movie, bro.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"tir_intraday","9","1","2","23 April 2011"," A journey into a higher plane
","Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is among many things a tribute to balley, that fine art that does not touch the lives of most of us that comprise the hoi polloi, the common milieu, that revels and indulges in the mediocre and the mundane, and has steadily lost touch the finer aspects of civilization. And that's not all, of course not. It's also a journey into an artist's mind, a discovery of the dark side, not just for the protagonist, but for the audience too, into their own. Natalie Portman's Nina shall stay in the inner recesses of the mind for the rest of your life, as she not only discovers the cygnus atratus in her during the course of the film but almost gets the same release too.<br/><br/>In the inevitable comparison with his other films, it pleases one to find a brilliant director adding to an already formidable oeuvre of movies like 'Pi', 'The Fountain', and the 'Wrestler'. 'Black Swan' is without doubt Aronofsky's finest till date. The technical aspects of the film are first-rate, the characterization absolutely apt, the editing tight, the cinematography brilliantly succeeding at the introspection of the dark side of one's character. The quality of the lighting and the sound forces one to get into the mood, and feel the character's pain, both and real and imagined. Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake' is rendered in a beautiful manner, with the composition seamlessly melding into the background, rising and falling in a cadence, making for a heady and memorable experience. This is required viewing for every lover of grade-A cinema, and in doing so it forces one to think about the pedestrian nature of most oft the other movies released this year. That to my mind could be the only negative for the movie."
"TheExpatriate700","9","1","2","15 April 2011"," Haunting Story of Psychological Breakdown
","Black Swan is one of the best psychological dramas in recent memory. It combines good acting, characterization, metaphor, and even some well placed CGI to convey a ballerina's psychological collapse under the stress of a starring role. Although it is not an entirely original story, it is still a stunning work of art.<br/><br/>The acting is the bedrock of the film, with Natalie Portman earning her Oscar for Best Actress. She conveys her character's vulnerability and inner rage equally well. Although the past month has been filled with debate over how much she danced in the film, this really misses the point. (It was an acting, not a choreography award after all.) This will go down as one of Portman's greatest roles.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is equally good. Barbara Hershey is excellent as Portman's possessive control freak mother. Mila Kunis expands beyond her usual comic performances as Portman's rival / object of desire, the black swan to her white swan. Even though she has a limited role, Winona Ryder does well as an aging ballerina whose star gives way to Portman's- eerily paralleling the decline of Ryder's career as an ingénue. Ryder is admirably settling into a new role as a character actor.<br/><br/>Particularly interesting is Aronofsky's use of CGI to embody Portman's mental breakdown. The film shows that computer graphics are not necessarily the stuff of Transformers movies, as they let the audience see the character's hallucinations.<br/><br/>The only reason this review is a nine rather than a ten is that it seems like old territory for Darren Aronofsky. All of his films deal with obsession in some shape or form, ranging from addiction to performance. In particular, the climax seems to borrow heavily from Aronofsky's previous film, The Wrestler, in particular its shooting style."
"msack-25-504586","6","1","2","11 April 2011"," Where's the depth?
","Here we go again. The key to perfect art is sex. Hollywood's holy grail trotted out once again as the be-all and end-all; instant (or at least overnight) transformation.<br/><br/>So Portman's virginal (that was once a compliment) Nina needs only to try a little masturbation, lesbian sex (it's 2011, right - straight, horizontal hetero sex is now passe') once or twice, and having shed frigidity and plunged into what is purported to be the real wellspring of her art, will now automatically turn into a prima ballerina worth the title.<br/><br/>But any real authority on ballet will tell you that the depth of balletic perfection, of its transcendent artistry, comes from somewhere far more complex than simple physical orgasm. It takes years of practice and heroic concentration and focus in expressing those deep feelings so that they leap over the foodlights from the stage and touch the heart.<br/><br/>Sure, an artist's sexuality is part of the deal - but it's not the whole enchilada. Neither is sexual inexperience a detriment to once's art - in fact, there's something to be said for the power of unfulfilled desire to drive powerful artistic expression.<br/><br/>Having said all that about the film's shallow premise, I would also say the Black Swan was visually entertaining - beautifully photographed, compelling imagery, seamless storytelling, and glorious special effects that drove home the emotional content. I loved - and wanted even more of - the increasingly mad dance sequence that led up to those gorgeously flapping black wings."

Thomas encourages Nina to let go of herself in her performances so that she can emulate the black swan that Beth was previously playing well in the ballet production.<br/><br/>Beth is shown to be completely out of control ballerina who becomes suicidal after Nina gets the lead role. Nina actually drops by Beth's hospital room after an accident and appears to be sorry that Beth has taken the loss of the role so hard.<br/><br/>Thomas also tells Nina to start becoming more sexually active so that he can make a pass at her, and to ad more feeling to Odile the black swan. Another subplot that develops is a relationship between Nina, and her understudy Lily.<br/><br/>One of the hotter scenes in the movie occurs when Nina, and Lily are drinking and dropping ecstasy at a bar with some guys. Nina has a fantasy of kissing Lily, and of Lily performing cunnilingus on her clitoris, after she gets home.<br/><br/>Nina seems to fall apart psychologically as she embraces the black swan, and becomes anorexic, and schizophrenic. Nina at times loses contact with reality, and starts to become increasingly self destructive.<br/><br/>In her first show as the lead in Black Swan Nina makes errors on her white swan Princess Odette, but appears to be doing well on the black swan dances. Nina has another psychological break when she believes she has stabbed Lily, but we later find out that Nina has cut herself, and is bleeding profusely at the end of the show.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gave an extraordinary performance as Nina, and she won an Oscar for Best Actress.

"jrcj41","10","1","2","5 April 2011"," A True Masterpiece
","Late in the afternoon, with the rain and wind outside, I found myself sitting stories above Piazza Strozzi in a comfortable armchair dancing the ballet with Natalie Portman. Such is the dynamic of Darren Aronofsky's 2010 psychological thriller Black Swan.<br/><br/>The film explores the persona of Nina Sayers (Portman), a young ballet dancer on the New York City stage, competing for a part in her company's production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. Nina struggles to gain acceptance from her peers until she is chosen by director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) to dance the lead role. In training for the part, Nina falls victim to Thomas' ambiguous demands and sexual advances, as he implores her to become not just the innocent white swan, which her natural naivety emanates, but the sinister black swan; a threatening alter ego necessary for the role.<br/><br/>A preexisting mental illness emerges in full force when Nina learns to dance the black swan and forgets how to live her own innocent life. As the boundary between Tchaikovsky's tragedy and Nina's reality disappears her fate dwindles in the hands of the production. With the crowd fixed attentively, and the orchestra rumbling, the final act brings the black swan closer and closer to her own self inflicted death.<br/><br/>A true art film, Aronofsky presents a number of haunting motifs in his use of mirrors, doppelgangers and in the way Thomas seems to verbally narrate Nina's story, effectively rending him the director not just of her ballet, but of her life. The 16mm hand-held camera employed by Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique gives the film a raw documentary quality, amplifying the realism and drama of Nina's inner struggle. In addition, the highly-mobile camera technique used in the performance sequences allows the audience to dance with the characters.<br/><br/>While praising this film for what it does effectively, I must also note it is doubtful one will desire to sit for a second viewing of Black Swan. The excess of ""glass-in-flesh"" gross-out horror makes Black Swan one of the most difficult films in recent years. Nonetheless, there is no excuse to skip this masterpiece by Darren Aronofsky, where the boundary between truth and torment is as blurred as the eyes of a ballerina in the bright spotlight of a New York City stage."
"LazySod","8","1","2","4 April 2011"," Madness through perfection
","When a highly motivated ballet dancer wins the part she has been hunting for for so long she's happy as can be. Driven by a strive for perfection she trains hard in hopes to please her mentor. But is she ready for this kind of pressure with on the one side her lust for peer recognition and on the other side the need to escape the smothering of her mother? This film starts out looking like a fairy tale with all the standard characters - the somewhat naive princess, the overbearing mother, the jealous sisters, the bright unobtainable future at the horizon. As it rolls on it does not stray far from that path - in fact it follows much of the structure of the theatre play it encompasses. It is this structure that makes it a very interesting film - the pace is right, the tale is compelling and believable and most of the characters are in place.<br/><br/>The film starts off pretty dark and grows darker with every passing minute - biased around its lead player it depicts her madness with a pinpointed finesse, with everyone else revolving around her in an intricate dance. My hats off to Portman who plays the role of her life in this one. One tiny peeve to be had is the pained look she carries right from the start though - I guess the choice was made to have her character live her life as a tragic one, but in my eyes it could have done better by being slightly more optimistic at the start.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 swans dancing"
"bob-rutzel-1","9","1","2","3 April 2011"," Somewhat Perfect
","Nina (Portman) wants to win the lead in the Swan Lake ballet to play both the White Swan and the Black Swan. She strives for perfection but choreographer Thomas (Cassel) sees her as the White Swan, and not the Black Swan. She is awarded the lead anyway. <br/><br/>One would not normally think of a ballet story as a horror story, but there is some horror in here. Ouch! Also, those who normally do not like ballet and who would never watch a ballet story would probably watch this one because they know they would only see snippets of dance in here; and also because of the intensity of Nina throughout and her drive toward perfection. But, One would believe that winning the role of a lifetime would bring huge smile to Nina's face and it did .for one minute. <br/><br/>When Nina, happily crying and smiling, calls her mother and tells her: He picked me, Mommy, I would have given Portman the Oscar for that scene alone. That was pure gold. It was the only touching moment in this story. <br/><br/>For the rest of the time we watch a never-smiling Nina struggle with her overprotective mother, her inhibitions particularly towards sex, friends, and not being perfect enough. At times, we in the audience, had a tough time realizing what was happening in real time with the sexual fantasies and hallucinations Nina conjured up. Even she believed some things were very real – as did we. This reminded me of those imaginary friends some writers like to bring in to confuse the audience (read me).<br/><br/>When Thomas kept saying to Nina to let go, have some fun with the dance, never once did he tell her to smile. That, for me,would have helped, but it wasn't in the script. Pity. If this were, indeed, a true story I suppose volumes would be written as to why Thomas picked Nina when he believed she didn't feel the part of the Black Swan. But, hey, this is fiction. <br/><br/>The way ballet dancers primp and prime themselves reminded me the way thoroughbred horses are cared for. There are similarities, but the dancers must do all themselves. Were the split toes, webbed feet, cuts and stems of wings in the flesh real or were they also a part of Nina's hallucinations? We will never know. <br/><br/>Production wise, this was a complete success. The camera work,direction, dancing, dialogue, editing, pacing, cinematography and yes, the CGI (What? You didn't think you would see CGI in a ballet story? Where do you think those black wings came from?) and the supporting cast were all excellent. But, make no mistake, this was also a dark production with some horror thrown in. Yes, I jumped several times as I didn't expect horror in a ballet story. Who would?<br/><br/>But, the question for us is: Did WE care for Nina? Yes, we did because we always care for and feel the pain of someone who wants to be the best, and. um okay.strives to be perfect. <br/><br/>If you keep in mind that Nina considers herself THE BLACK SWAN you will understand all. And, finally a somewhat smiling, perfect Black Swan.<br/><br/>Violence; Yes. Sex: Yes, there is a lesbian scene. Nudity: No. Language: Yes. Also included are graphic sex terms."

","As the 1970 movie ""Performance"" with Mick Jagger will tell you, the only great performance is one that achieves madness. Well that's not really true, but this movie wants to define it kind of like that and kind of like George Costanza in Seinfeld, ""It's not a lie if you believe it.""<br/><br/>Anyway, I enjoyed the movie. I love ballet. The level of dancing bothered me at first then I got into it, especially the close-up filming of the end of it. All the acting was great, especially Portman and Barbara Hershey.<br/><br/>My big complaint - SPOILER ALERT - is that during the actual performance, between acts she's alone in her dressing room. In reality there would be a dozen assistants helping her change hair, makeup and costume!<br/><br/>Also, I never noticed what a horrible plot line Swan Lake has.

"santiarango94","9","1","2","25 March 2011"," The perfect combination
","The only reason why Black Swan didn't win best picture at the Oscars is, I think, because this is so innovative to filmmaking that it took everyone by surprise. Black Swan is the combination of classic arts like Ballet and the complexity of a character like Nina, which makes the movie take a turn to the psychological thriller. The film takes you to many subplots at a time; all of which surround Nina's odd behavior. I still wonder how could these people imagine so much things coming out of the mind of a dancer, and so I ask myself how could Natalie Portmann make such a good interpretation that, in combination to the background of the scenes makes you feel the mental trauma that this girl has in respect to so many things.<br/><br/>Black Swan is so good because it takes ballet, insanity, terror, family, society, love, and bonds it all up in one main plot, which can be said to be the main character's mental struggles.<br/><br/>This is a must watch for the first three times for sure.

Unfortunately the prince she falls for is seduced by her evil twin, the Black Swan, and she ends up killing herself.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's magnificent movie has Nina Sayers so determined to give the ""perfect"" performance that she finds herself ""becoming"" the character in shocking and disturbing ways.<br/><br/>Nina clearly has issues anyway, with a history of self-harm and an overbearing single mother (Barbara Hershey) who abandoned her own ballet career to give birth - and therefore carries the joint burden of resentment and a desire to live out her unfulfilled dreams through her daughter.<br/><br/>While the show's director freely admits Nina is ideal as the ""white swan"", he has reservations about her ability to also portray the evil ""black swan"" and encourages her to loosen up through a variety of unorthodox techniques.<br/><br/>There's enough ""body horror"" to satisfy David Cronenberg fans, while the ""in-your-face"" camera work and grainy film stock gives Black Swan the cinéma vérité feel of a ""behind-the-scenes"" documentary on the hard life of professional ballet dancers.<br/><br/>Sexually graphic in places as well, although you never actually see anything very little is left to the imagination, the film makes its audience uncomfortable and complicit in the unfolding psychodrama until you don't know what's real and what's imagined as pictures become animated, faces morph into self-reflections and Nina's body starts to undergo bizarre transformations of its own.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has brought out career-defining performances from his cast. Portman - who is on screen for almost every scene - is sublime, but she is also supported by a flawless cast. Mila Kunis, as Nina's only friend but also imagined rival, is a revelation while Vincent Cassel as the show director is enigmatically unreadable. Winona Ryder, as the outgoing lead dancer, although only in the film for a short while, is equally superb and memorable.<br/><br/>A truly unique film, Black Swan rightfully earned Portman her Oscar and will stay with you long after the credits have rolled."

","Extraordinary achievement. I believe that some films are just too good for people. ""Black Swan"" is one of them. Sure, it's not 100% Horror but the effects provoked on me were disturbing and that's why I consider it to be a terrifying experience. To equilibrate things, let's call it a Psychological Thriller. Although Darren Aronofsky's movies can't be labeled in one particular genre.<br/><br/>The plot is dramatic and focuses on the mental situation of an adult young woman trapped in the world of a young girl.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's Direction is unique, you can't compare his sui generis style. At some points the film feels like Polanski, Cronenberg, and I would add Jodorowsky and Lynch.<br/><br/>As an audience, we are witnesses of Nina's breakdown. It's all about Nina. The over the shoulder takes help to live the experience better, for example. We get dynamic camera shots, great editing, and surreal moments that you won't forget. For example, I felt I was jumping on the club scene. The suspense is great and fits perfect with the movie's tone. Nina's breakdown is memorable.<br/><br/>The comparison between Tchaikovsky's masterpiece and Nina's story is simply genius. It's such a tragic bond between them.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's acting is one of the best performances I've ever seen. Not as powerful as Ellen Burstyn's in ""Requiem for a Dream"" but still deserves special mention for being impressive. She's just too feminine, fragile, pretty, beautiful.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great. Barbara Hershey is a magnificent actress. I loved her since ""The Entity"". Mila Kunis plays herself and it works. Her chemistry with Portman feels very natural. I loved Winona Ryder's freaky and chilling performance.<br/><br/>The score is haunting, addictive, epic. Tchaikovsky never sounded that menacing and creepy. Clint Mansell is a master. His pieces will be considered as heroic and powerful, nostalgic, etc. Adding The Chemical Brothers was great. There's even a scene where you will remember about their ""Let Forever Be"" video.<br/><br/>I've always felt uncomfortable when ballet dancers stand on their own fingertips. Ouch! But this time I understood it and faced it. It was just like Nina facing her inner demons. Sometimes you gotta loose yourself ;) No negative points, this is a masterpiece."

","Thank you Darren Aronofsky on this beautiful masterpiece, one of the best movies I've ever seen and I mean EVER. Beats every movie dealing with the evil/good persona except for the Dark Knight and Fight Club. The way it's directed it captures the essence of Black Swan's mood. It's dark, grim, and grey; you don't only see the Black Swan YOU FEEL THE BLACK SWAN, YOU SMELL IT the way it was intended, I even doubt the original story was as good as this even in the mind of the writer. Absolutely transcends imagination in so many creative ways I can't explain. The usage of colours is absolutely fantastic it's a mixture between contrasts either excessive white on excessive black to embody the struggle between good and evil with grey atmosphere and backgrounds denoting the tendency towards the black swan, or another colour I'd like to call Evil Red in Natalie's eyes which Darren surprisingly mastered. The camera is so natural; you come to a certain scenes where you don't notice the camera switching or the editing I'm not familiar with the technical terms. Vincent Cassel was outstanding in most scenes specially when seducing; you can even say, ""He was at his best"". Natalie Portman was great yet still she could've been better, yet Mila Kunis in my opinion didn't do a good job compared to the monsters she was acting with, she still has a lot of work to do. Also sends a good message to overprotecting parents to back off a little.<br/><br/>Absolutely 9/10"

","Wow, that would be the best word to describe this movie. A deep psychological thriller that seizes your attention and gets you on the thin line between reality and hallucinations. <br/><br/>Nathalie Portman becomes Nina in this movie and makes you forget you're watching a movie, she get's you right in the head of a ballet dancer with ""no life"" and under a ton of pressure. The psychological changes trough the movie are simply perfect, from the acting to the smooth (yet complex) transitions in the scenario. In brief, the main actress delivers a flawless performance, convincing acting and dancing. Kunis' acting is good although not mind blowing and I think that is really unimportant in the movie since there's just no importance accorded to Lily, she's just the pretty party girl that makes Nina envious. <br/><br/>The movie itself is wonderfully directed. Great and original filming techniques, excellent montage, great music (thanks to an old master, but it is still well ""mixed"" in the movie), awesome scenario. I also loved the surrealistic elements and the visual effects that really aren't placed at the centre of the movie, but support it in a great way (director sometimes get lost into special effects and destroy their own movie). Also, I want to say that this movie seemed to me somehow reminiscent of Polanski's Pianist on a lot of things: - Wonderful acting and the way the main character is followed trough the film - Classical music - Similar atmosphere and filming<br/><br/>Well, that's about what I have to say on this great movie that will remain as a classic in my humble opinion.

"ssvikas","6","1","2","11 March 2011"," Great concept; execution is not worth the hype
","When a movie is marketed with Oscar hype, it sure creates a lot of buzz. Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' did manage the hype. But, was it worth the hype?<br/><br/>When a New York ballet company fires an old performer, Beth (Winona Ryder), it opens up a slot for a new lead in for its next production, Pyotr Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake'. Its Director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) wants his new star to portray both, the Swan Queen Odette, the white swan and her evil-twin Odile, the black swan. <br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a senior ballerina with the troupe is selected for the role. But, Leroy is still not convinced if the uptight Nina can play the sensuous Odile. She has competition in Lily (Mila Kunis) and an overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) to deal with. The pressure drives Nina to psychotic hallucinations.<br/><br/>The theme was undoubtedly bulletproof. The idea of capturing the emotional roller coaster that an artist goes through in his/ her quest for perfection had the potential to make a great thriller. But, what you get instead is a mélange of backstage jealousy, some risqué scenes between the lead women and a touch of insanity. <br/><br/>It's strange that a ballet themed flick doesn't actually show the lead actors performing it any more than Portman waving her emaciated arms with close ups of her woe begone face completely lacking expression. Frankly, there is very little charm about her even as the 'White Swan'. To her credit, Portman shed 20 pounds and learnt Ballet. But, barring her 'Black Swan' avatar towards the end, there wasn't much to her acting.<br/><br/>Rather, Mila Kunis as the 'comfortable in her own skin' Lily, also Nina's substitute seemed a better candidate if someone really wanted his play to run steadily for the whole season. Incidentlally, Kunis too lost as many pounds as her friend Portman who recommended her to the role. Vincent Cassel shines as the dictatorial director who pushes Nina to do her best and instead pushes her off the edge of sanity. <br/><br/>Having said that, 'Black Swan' isn't in fact bad; just that it falls below what I expected it to be. To make an intense film that combines sheer passion of art with the devilish depths of insanity is in itself a great challenge. Aronfsky has made intense films in the past a la 'A Requiem for a Dream'. This one is decent, but could have been better."

"philaychan","Null","1","2","10 March 2011"," Director's duo versus Natalie's trinity
","The first 30 minutes of the film is really well intended and constructed - a dark side of the beautiful reality. Following the camera work, elements poured into the shots I have been expecting very twisted plot, terrific acting and directing. Natalie Portman's role gets warm up quickly and is already in full shape in the characters build-up. It should have been a great movie.<br/><br/>The trinity of Natalie Portman, Nina and Black Swan is a very interesting part and I'm not sure if this is the original idea of the director; if not, then he should thank Natalie Portman for being so intricate in herself and the character mix-up. She works very hard in that playing Nina as a great ballerina, just as hard as Nina trying to catch Black Swan spirit with her own White Swan blood. Pushing herself to the corner or the limit, Nina really gets no better way out to understand what Black Swan is actually about, though Thomas Leroy is using his ""cheap"" way to seducing her thinking this would make her let go what she's possessing. Natalie Portman is comparatively under a much more difficult state of mind than Nina as she has to figure out how to transform herself into a perfect Nina who in turn is eager to find another ego in herself helping her to be in the role of Black Swan. The difficulties Natalie Portman faces is the plot actually doesn't provide enough build-up and space for her to understand such a complicated state and so she has to rely much on her own imagination about the role where the movie or the screen play hasn't provided yet. To be fair, Natalie Portman has saved the movie.<br/><br/>It seems the director purposely trying to underline sex as the key point about Nina's let go. The way Thomas is speaking about Nina's deficiency in the play (the White Swan is perfect but the Black Swan isn't there) matches the director's underestimation of the character's intricacy, both are so simple in thinking and don't bother to give more thought into what Nina should be. If Thomas has let Nina work on her own how to find the Black Swan spirit, the director has left Natalie Portman alone in the movie struggling around the trinity relationship of herself, Nina & Black Swan. This sounds interesting enough though, as the duo of the director and Thomas versus the trinity of Natalie Portman, Nina and Black Swan succeeds in giving the movie a newer perspective which the audiences wouldn't have given much thought into it. Has it been an original idea of the director? I don't know but the movie really provides such an angle for me to look into it at least.<br/><br/>The movie begins in a very artistic way but it lasts not more than 30 minutes. It could have become a really ""Dark"" movie but it seems the director doesn't want it be that, so in the last 20 minutes he has turned the movie into a typical thriller. I particularly don't like the way Nina finishes off herself. She should have been really into Black Swan and ends up together with it. Now she's no more than a schizophrenic patient. It should have been more than that."
"vghosh79","8","1","2","8 March 2011"," Intense and Watchable - But not for the Faint Hearted!
","A lot has been said and written about this movie. A lot good and a lot of it bad. I was unsure of what to expect and did it surprise me? The answer is a resounding yes. <br/><br/>Acting:Top notch. Ms Portman does this one to the hilt. Does not hold anything back. This adds to the intensity of the film. Whether it is her emaciated back, or her stressed out face,her roughly cut nails or her bruised toes, the physical ardor she endures, is remarkable, and none of it looks like acting. I winced every time she did, cried out in anguish every time she fell, exulted when she completes the final act! It is her film and her film alone, so much so, she must have had 90% of the camera time to herself. The rest of the cast did their jobs well, Cassel as Thomas, the brilliant but exploitative boss, Mila as the liberated fun loving soul from SFO, Barbara Hershey as Nina's obsessive mother, who has nothing better to do than to keep her daughter under surveillance. <br/><br/>Direction, Script and Editing: Aronovsky's direction makes the film very real. The tight editing never let me off the hook, and I groaned in exasperation when the interval was forced. The camera work is amazing, although the gritty, hand-held camera made me giddy at times. Am not a big fan of hand-held stuff, though it has to be mentioned, the frames were composed beautifully. The only real color used was red, be it the smudged lipstick stolen by Nina, or the blood oozing out of her fingers and toes. Towards the end, when Nina is alone at the studio, practicing and the lights go out, the shot where Nina is searching for the light man, highlighted by just a single stage light in silhouette, is amazing. That being said, I have seen remarkably gritty films (Thin Red Line, No Man's Land etc), without the surfeit of violence and stomach turning shots used here, (skin peeling, nail cutting, face stabbing). At times the film descended into the macabre, and I felt like I was watching a House of Wax sequel! The film could have done without these cheap quirks to elicit audience squeals. <br/><br/>Story: The story line is powerful, and it is almost like watching the ballet live, where I could visualise the transformation from the pristine white to the dark, seductive black in Nina's character. However, barring a few twists, once I got hang of the director's portrayal, the story was predictable.<br/><br/>All in all, a good watch. Portman's performance, the music, the story make it a memorable watch (you feel like you are watching a thriller with a well defined climax), managing to transcend the grittiness portrayed. However, it is too real for comfort sometimes, and the rest of the cast dwindle into oblivion, towards the end like dewdrops evaporating in the heat of the final act."
"saritray2001","8","1","2","5 March 2011"," Aronofsky's characters are driven by some preternatural, obsessive impulse, says Sarit Ray
","""Done to death, but not like this,"" promises Thomas (Vincent Cassel), the autocratic leader of the ring, as he seeks to reinterpret Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. You could say the same of Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan. On its surface, it's the story of a dedicated young performer yearning to excel and to impress, at the cost of all else. Yes, that's been done before. So, what's new? It takes familiar plot lines, uses the conventionally pretty, cheerful backdrop of ballet, and twists it into a sinister psychological thriller that is deeply moving and haunting.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's characters are often driven by some preternatural, obsessive impulse (Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler), and none more so than the sensitive, fragile young dancer, Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). The ballet is her life, she knows nothing else. Apparent rejection almost breaks her, and a shot at her dream role leads her to unforeseen madness. Dressed in white, she is the pure, virginal white swan. For the role, though, she must find the dark black swan within. She does, but in a maniacal, self-destructive way.<br/><br/>The demon in her head, however, has always existed. The scratch marks are evidence of an old habit. Her mother's (Barbara Hershey) unnatural protectiveness indicates something is wrong. Her pink and white room is like a fortress, the stuffed toys and miniature ballerina in it are talismanic. As she transforms, this world falls apart.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis) proves to be everything she aspires to be—uncontrolled, instinctive, sexual. Nina identifies her as a natural rival. The line between reality and schizophrenic dream blur as she imagines making out with her (unfortunately, Indian audiences may see an edited version).<br/><br/>This is Portman's film. And you can tell she's worked hard. She's noticeably lost weight, and trained hard to learn ballet. Camera-work can perhaps mask flaws, but Portman can pirouette, and my untrained eye can't tell if she's imperfect. As an actor, she is brilliant, going from edgy and diffident to maniacal and possessed. She scares you, makes you cringe as she effortlessly pulls the skin off her finger or stares back as the alter ego in the mirror. As she sprouts wings mid-stage, her tragic transformation is complete. It's dark and oddly beautiful.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's film is a warped, extreme vision. Yet, the exaggerated pains and desires Nina manifests are rooted in the human psyche: The black must exist if the white does. Black Swan makes you disturbingly aware of that.<br/><br/>-@saritray2001 (culturecutting.blogspot.com)"

","Driven to the point of destruction, this ballerina won't let anything get in the way of the 'perfect' performance, including herself.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a thriller starring Natalie Portman, French actor Vincent Cassel (The Apartment) and Mila Kunis (best known for her character in 'That 70's Show'). Supporting actors are Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder who plays an ageing ballerina (receiving much credit for no more than a fleeting role).<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky appears to be exploring similar themes in this film to that of his most recent success, 'The Wrestler'. In both films the lead characters are self-destructive and obsessed with their careers and at the end of each film we are left wondering if either character survives the brutal treatment they inflict upon themselves.<br/><br/>The story of 'Black Swan' begins and ends as a nightmare. Natalie Portman plays 'Nina Sayers', a young hard-working and conscientious ballerina, desperate to win the lead in 'Swan Lake'. Mila Kunis's character 'Lily' contrasts greatly with that of Nina. Lily has a carefree attitude towards Ballet and Life but poses a real threat to Nina's ambition. Vincent Cassel's character Thomas is the director of the Ballet Company and is unconvinced that Nina is able to play both parts of the lead role in Swan Lake. Nina is a natural for the role of Princess Odette, The White Swan, innocent and virtuous but the role of the Black Swan, Odile, is more of a challenge. It requires Nina to connect with her dark and sensual side, something that comes more naturally to Lily and not unrecognised by the director. Eventually winning the lead, Nina is constantly taunted by the director who undermines her ability to play the Black Swan in an effort to encourage her performance. This backfires enormously and contributes to the deterioration of Nina's mind.<br/><br/>Barbara Hershey is good in her supporting role of a former ballerina and over protective mother of Nina. She is the first to highlights to the audience the fragility of Nina, as we watch her nurture and care for her daughter whilst actively encouraging Nina's innocence. As the story unfolds we witness the punishing routine Nina put's herself through to reach perfection and we see further signs that her mind is slowly deteriorating. Vision's and hallucinations begin to take over Nina's reality in the race to embody the character of the 'Black Swan'.<br/><br/>From: charisse-movierevue"

You are inside of Nina....her mind is a roiling vessel of fright, delusion, uncertainty, and full-blown psychosis. And it couldn't possible feel any more real. <br/><br/>The direction and cinematography of this film are brilliantly implemented. Unfortunately the score was ruled ineligible for the Oscars, as it is magnificent, and takes this film to a whole other plane. I saw this film the first time at the T.F.Festival.

Applause broke out, and we knew we had seen something special. No one wanted to leave the theater. Everyone just sat there, debating on what exactly they had just witnessed. It was one of those moments that really excited you to the core. <br/><br/>This piece will find a place in the annals of film, not as much for the brilliant surreality and edginess of the story, but for Portman's performance.

"HOUDINI1874","9","1","2","29 January 2011"," Aronofsky's Ballet
","Black Swan instantly joins the ranking with the avant-garde masterpieces of Kubrick, Bergman, and most any other art film of a foreign persuasion that embodies the psychological thrills and chills one might experience when obsession takes over, and insanity begins.<br/><br/>Upon my first viewing, I was reminded of several other films that regard an obsession that imminently drive a character to madness, such as The Machinist, A Beautiful Mind, and Pi. Personally, I'm a sucker for these types of films, but I have never before felt such pounding aggression of self-conflict, particularly that of a psychosexual nature based on envy to the tenth power.<br/><br/>The film is not so heavily rooted in plot, but rather inner psyche and metaphorical sequences of psychological terror and distress that, to the audience, is sometimes almost unbearably unsettling. After a ballet company's veteran star is ""retiring""--polite euphemism for old and unwanted--a new face is needed. The director, Thomas (""toe-MAH"") Leroy, seeks a new face for his new version of Swan Lake, in which both the black and white swans will be played by a single metamorphic dancer. Rivalry ensues between Nina and Lily, the new dancer from San Francisco, and Nina is incidentally flung into a downward spiral that will eventually destroy her, if she does not end up destroying all those around her first. This is beautifully shown on the screen, in the form of an inner entity, her own Black Swan trying to break free, like a demonic possession this innocent white swan cannot control.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* Near the film's climax, this inner black swan is shown to have taken over completely, as Nina performs the ballet's second-to-final act, complete with red eyes and sprouting black feathers. As she walks offstage before the final dance, she looms around the ambient darkness with an erotic smile, moaning in self-love of the dark side that used to frighten her, now swimming in ecstasy. That being said, the final number of this dance scene will give you such chills, you'll swear you are also growing feathers. *END SPOILER* Art is purely based on interpretation, which is ironic, because Black Swan, as stated in the film, is perfect. The sole plot, therefore, is immaterial in comparison to its aesthetic. Even though the two go hand-in-hand, the stream of consciousness through Nina's eyes can stand alone as its own dominant feature, to the point where a simple story is almost unnecessary to convey her persona, psyche, and obsession to be perfect.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is apparently developing a pattern of taking a bold, surreal look at professions, or lifestyles for that matter, that the general public either frowns upon, or disregards without interest: professional wrestling, mathematical theory, drugs, and now ballet. The opening scene shows a ballerina, illuminated with a single overhung spotlight amidst a featureless blackness, dancing the overture of Swan Lake. Immediately, I almost fell in love with Nina, ballet, the music, and of course, the film itself. This notion did not change throughout Black Swan, which is why I have no reservations with the first paragraph above."
"jtmytake3","10","1","2","24 January 2011"," Darren Aronofsky's prickly tale of the cut-throat world of ballet
","Black Swan is Darren Aronofsky's take on the ballet world with Natalie Portman as Nina a young and talented ballerina given the opportunity to be principal ballerina after it is deemed that the previous principal a bit part from Winona Ryder is beyond her best years. Nina is a perfectionist taking onto her small shoulders the responsibility of achieving all that her over bearing mother (played by an excellently neurotic Hershey) could not achieve. Their relationship is tense and strained at best akin to the relationship between Carrie and her mother in the Stephen King classic without the sharp flying objects. Nina finally is able to realise her dream when she lands the part of the Swan Queen in what the ballet director Thomas (Vincent Cassell) describes as a new take on the traditional Swan Lake. If only she can shake off the repression and guilt bestowed upon her by her mother. Thomas tries to use unorthodox methods of enhancing Nina's performance in an attempt to release the looser side of her nature to come to the fore to play the black swan as well as the twin Swan Queen.<br/><br/>However strange things are afoot and when unconventional ballerina Lily (Kunis) joins the company it is clear that Nina must still compete for her role. Lily seems to bring out Nina's darker more rebellious nature and despite Nina's initial misgivings she lets her hair down on a drink and drug fuelled night out with Lily. Nina begins to succumb to the stifling pressure from her mother coupled with the added weight of achieving the perfection she feels she has to attain to be the best.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has produced a masterpiece the themes of duality are played out to excellent effect with Nina trying to cope with the two opposites she has to portray in the play, the elegant and graceful Swan Queen is starkly contrasted with the dark and dangerous Black Swan. The cast is excellent with Portman giving an outstanding performance of a young woman coming to terms with her independence and burgeoning sexuality which has been heavily repressed due to her mother's controlling nature. Portman and Kunis both trained for months to get into shape to portray the incredibly fit and nubile ballerinas and this adds kudos and realism to this mesmerising picture. Aronofsky has managed to create the backstage atmosphere of a ballet company with his heightened competition bringing out the most despicable in its company members. This is most definitely a candidate for best picture and best actress."

","As I was walking out of the theater, I just kept thinking of Hillary Swank's performance in Million Dollar Baby. Can Portman be denied the Oscar for Best Actress? Cassel certainly deserves a shot at Best Supporting Actor as well, and Aronofsky for Best Director. Hard to think of anything that wasn't first rate anywhere in the performances, writing, directing, or scene design. I was struck by how seasoned Mila Kunis has become since enjoying her breakthrough role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She is likely to have some pretty solid scripts coming her way after this knockout performance in Swan, and I expect she will soon find herself among the highest paid women actresses. Kudos to Barbara Hershey for turning in a strong character performance as a woman fifteen years younger than her present age; always helps to have an attractive and skilled expert play the key role as the manipulative Mother, and I loved seeing her in this role."

In a word, story.<br/><br/>It's not so much this is ""Repulsion"" on New York's Upper West Side, it's that the filmmakers rub your nose in it.

"Bunuel1976","8","4","19","22 December 2010"," BLACK SWAN (Darren Aronofsky, 2010) ***1/2
","I had first read about this at the time of its Venice Film Festival presentation, where the picture was (unsurprisingly but rather misleadingly) compared by many to Dario Argento's supernatural shocker SUSPIRIA (1977). Consequently, I went into BLACK SWAN (nothing to do, of course, with the classic Tyrone Power swashbuckler from 1942) expecting more horror elements than were actually on offer, but I was still very much impressed with the end result. Back then, the movie was not really talked of as the Oscar contender it is clearly shaping up to be; still, two-thirds of the way in I was perhaps ready to consider it overrated myselfthat is, until the last act kicked in and took the film to a whole new level! Needless to say, given the ballet milieu, parallels to The Archers' THE RED SHOES (1948) could not be avoided (it even contrives a similarly tragic denouement!). However, many another individualistic film-maker's style has also been applied to Aronofsky's effort: from Roman Polanski (with shades of REPULSION [1965] being especially felt throughout) to Davids Cronenberg (due to its adopting his trademark 'body-horror' device) and Lynch (the whole plays out like one of the director's surreal trips into the human psyche, and MULHOLLAND DRIVE [2001] in particular).<br/><br/>Being one of the major contributing factors to the film's success, a word is obviously in order now about the cast. Naturally, we begin with Natalie Portman: hers has aptly been described a courageous performance – in the Isabelle Adjani POSSESSION (1981) mould – not least because of scenes involving masturbation and lesbianism; having just recently watched Chloe Grace Moretz in LET ME IN (2010), I could not help recalling Portman's own prodigious start as a teen in Luc Besson's LEON (1994). I do not think I have ever watched Mila Kunis in anything prior to BLACK SWAN, but the favorable notices she has been getting for this role are well-deserved – managing to leave a mark even when the show clearly belongs to Portman. While Vincent Cassel is better than usual here, he is hardly in the same class as Anton Walbrook from THE RED SHOESand since his character promises us a visceral re-imagining of the Tchaikovsky opus, I was ultimately disappointed that the unfolding horror proved to be of the 'all-in-the-mind' variety! Barbara Hershey's possessive mother, then, lends the film a distinct CARRIE (1976) vibe. As for Winona Ryder, I guess one needs to commend her for being such a sport in accepting the role of a has-been; incidentally, the scene where Portman returns to the now-crippled Ryder the 'mementos' she had pilfered when star-struck of her emerges as its most poignant moment.<br/><br/>Performers driven to the edge for the sake of art (and fame) has long been a cinematic staple, but it has rarely been done so vividly and with such tremendous punch; truth be told, I have always wondered in films like these just how talented actors could be made to play down their gift in scenes where they are not supposed to meet their on-screen taskmaster's standards, or whether the artist behind the camera at times needed to exert himself as much as the one in front of it in order to coax what he was striving for out of his cast! Reflection, too, plays a pivotal part in the narrative: mirrors are omnipresent, while several characters deliberately look alike (so that Portman often sees herself in others!) – preparing one for the bravura sequence where the heroine undergoes a 'literal' metamorphosis from her guise of White Swan (i.e. gauche, virginal) into the Black one (embodying malevolence and seductiveness). No less important, however, is the disquieting score – which, apparently, consists of a variation on ""Swan Lake"" itself played in reverse! <br/><br/>Having watched all of Aronofsky's feature films, I would probably rank this as his finest yet – with THE WRESTLER (2008), his acclaimed previous release, placing close behind it. On the other hand, I am not over-the-moon as many others are about the rest of the director's work – finding PI (1998) too muddled, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM (2000) too depressing, and THE FOUNTAIN (2006) too ambitious for their own good!"
"Matt_Layden","8","2","7","21 December 2010"," Aronofsky has another polarizing film under his belt.
","Aronofsky is a visceral director, most of his films are polarizing, Black Swan is no exception. Here, he takes the beautiful and artistic art of being a ballerina, which seems so innocent, and turns it into a sick and twisted mind melt of a film. Black Swan grabs you, shakes you and leaves you wanting more. The film is far from perfect, but it shows that Aronofsky is certainly a master of his craft. <br/><br/>After winning the role of the lead in a production of Swan Lake, Nina becomes obsessed with trying to be perfect for a demanding instructor, her overbearing mother and even herself. Her world is thrown upside down when she thinks that the new girl is vying for her spot, yet not everything is black and white. <br/><br/>Portman plays Nina, a girl who was thrust into his life by her mother, who gave it up to raise her. Her constant obsession with being perfect leads to her ultimate undoing. She tries so hard to please her mother, her instructor and herself that she starts to loose her mind. Her life begins to mirror the story in the production. I say the word mirror because Aronofsky uses this object in almost every scene he can. He shows the duality of the character, she plays both the white swan and the black swan. The creativity of the mirrors is quite something, I don't know if it's true, but it feels like there is a mirror in every scene of the film. As if it's another character, Nina's self reflection trying to break into this life. <br/><br/>Mila Kunis is the new girl who is both beautiful and talented. So of course she becomes Portman's alternate. Her eyes are hypnotic and she plays the role of the bad girl with an attitude. The polar opposite to the uptight and proper Portman. Yet the obsession and paranoia eats away at Portman enough to lead her to some dark places. <br/><br/>Nina becomes so entranced with the story and her performance that she can no longer tell the difference between her hallucinations and reality, even when she plucks a feather from her back and stares at it with her beady red eyes. That's a haunting image. Nina's obsession mirror's Aronofsky's own obsession to the art and the process of filmmaking. Every shot, every colour, every beat is mapped out in his mind and I believe he captured every moment on film. The cinematography in the film is fluid and beautiful, yet visceral when needed to be. There are moments that will get under your skin. I can watch a person being mutilated to no end in Saw, yet the little things that happen in Black Swan are enough to make you cringe. Remember, it's the little things that count. <br/><br/>I praise Aronofsky for taking a different approach to each film. The run and gun style of the Wrestler is far from the picturesque beauty of The Fountain. Black Swan lands somewhere in the middle. The film begins and ends with a beautiful dance number. The last performance in the film is quite beautiful to be honest. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next, she was possessed and I loved it.<br/><br/>Portman shines in a role that should earn her an Oscar nomination and the film manages to be one of the best of the year. The supporting cast was marvelous, Vincent Cassel is seductive and menacing. Mila Kunis, as stated before is a great counter weight to Portman and Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother feels like icing on the cake. Her relationship to her daughter rivals Carrie at times. I was engrossed with Nina and her deterioration from start to finish. When she told the story of Swan Lake to this guy in a bar, I knew how the film would end. The film takes some time to get to where it wants to go, so the pace is one concern I have with it, yet there is enough of a pay off in the end. <br/><br/>Black Swan is a film that stays with you, whether you enjoyed it or not. Aronofsky doesn't apologize for his films, he makes them the way he wants to and I applaud him for it."

","Director Darren Aronofsky does not mind to step on anybody's toes when it comes to demonstrating that he can outperform other auteurs in orchestrating movies starring obsessed ""go to the extreme for their profession"" characters. Probably due to the fact the Aronofsky does the same himself in his craftsmanship of his pictures. Aronofsky's latest gem is the psychosexual ""Black Swan"" which uses the ballet as the backdrop. Natalie Portman stars as Nina Sayers, an apprehensive but driven ballet dancer in a New York company who gets the lead in a new version of the legendary ""White Swan"". Nina lives with her controlling mother Erica, and this Erica wants ""all her children"" (which would be just Nina) to reach supremacy in the ballet arts. Nina is the little niña of Erica and she won't let her forget it. The ballet company's artistic director is Thomas Leroy, who pushes Nina to the edge by insisting that Nina demonstrate reckless & impulsive behaviors in order for her to take a trip to the dark side to aid her in her ""black swan"" performance within the ""white swan"" ballet. Thomas makes a few sexual moves of his own on Nina for her to unveil a hidden aggressiveness or maybe for her to be the ""(rhymes with luck)swan"" to him. Yea Baby! OK, enough. Nina's ballet rival is Lily, the spontaneous little bombshell who may or not may not be a swan figment of Nina's imagination. In fact, there are numerous scenes in ""Black Swan"" that Aronofsky showcases Nina's extreme mania to excel by inserting hallucination or non-hallucination visions that Nina experiences. Aronofsky does push the envelope at times within those scenes but at the same time it displays his forte expertise of exhibiting determined & semi-delusional protagonists. There is no black & white (or maybe there was) when it comes to Mark Heyman & Andre Heinz' masterful screenplay of ""Black Swan"", it will effectively engage you in the ""WTF"" process. Portman's audacious leading performance as Nina will very well show the Academy that ""she was perfect"" and they will most probably hand her a Best Actress Oscar. The supporting acting of ""Black Swan"" demonstrated that they were almost perfect themselves; Mila Kunis was captivating as the wily Nina, Barbara Hershey reached over the veteran actress bar as the overprotected mommy Erica, and Vincent Cassel was powerfully enigmatic as the ""no holds barred"" ballet director Thomas. Hey, even Winona Ryder was a scene-stealer (did I just include Winona and stealer in the same sentence?) with her show-stopping performance as a jealous veteran ballet dancer. ""Black Swan"" was not perfect but it's the only time in my life that I have immensely enjoyed anything remotely close to the ballet. **** Excellent"
"tj19","9","2","7","12 December 2010"," Masterpiece
","Visionary director Darren Aronofsky's (Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler) latest film, Black Swan, is a psychological thriller set in the competitive world of New York ballet. Natalie Portman (Closer, V for Vendetta) is Nina Sayers, a featured veteran dancer who finds herself locked in a web of fierce intrigue with a new rival at the company (Mila Kunis). She then finds herself to be the affection of her director (Vincent Cassel), and also must deal with her vicariously overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey), as well as the harsh reality of the ballet business when her fellow colleague (Winona Ryder) is forced to retire. But, even with all these distractions are seemingly in her way to become the perfect Swan Queen, the only person standing in her way is herself. Most of Darren Aronofsky's films relay love/hate relationships with their viewers. Arguably his most notable film, Requiem for a Dream, was labeled as a masterpiece by some, and was totally panned by others. However, Black Swan is much more refined than his other works, whilst still staying true to his vision as a director. Aronofsky has grown as a director, and he shows it in Black Swan. Aronofsky is known for his ""style over substance"" filmmaking, and while their is more style than substance, it is still exhilarating and contemporary cinema. Natalie Portman gives an outstanding performance, the best of her career, and will undoubtedly get a much deserved Oscar nomination. She deserves accolades for her physically demanding role that she made look effortless, as well as her seemingly quiet and strictly devoted character hiding bottled-up rage and painfully submerged lust. Mila Kunis (The Book of Eli) also gives her best performance as Portman's rival. Her performance was so care-free and bold, just like the character she portrayed. Black Swan is a film about that strive for perfection, and the toll that strive takes on one's self. It is a film dialed up on full-blown hysteria. And the too-much-is-never-enough approach may turn some people off, for Black Swan is a singular and unrelenting experience. I found the tension, music and cinematography to be brilliant. It is engaging and seductive from start to finish. Black Swan picks at our deepest fears; in most fright films, danger lurks in the shadows. Here it is devilishly grinning in the mirror. It is pure horror mixed with backstage melodrama, and Aronofsky's high-flying style of directing makes Black Swan one of the best films of 2010. It is a must-see for anyone who lives and breathes movies."
"drownnnsoda","9","2","7","12 December 2010"," Carmilla meets ""Repulsion""
","I had been anticipating this film for over a year now, and was ecstatic to find out it was coming to my city this past Friday; ""Black Swan"" is frankly everything I'd hoped it would be, and genuinely lives up to its dazzling marketing campaign, critical accolades, and purported Oscar buzz. The film focuses on Nina (Natalie Portman), a twenty-something year old ballet dancer who has dedicated her life to the craft. She lives in a high-rise apartment in lower Manhattan with her overbearing mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina as well, and works for a ballet company run by a man named Tomas (Vincent Cassel). When a revival production of the infamous ""Swan Lake"" is in the works, Tomas fires Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), an aging dancer who had played the swan in several previous productions. In search of a new swan queen— one who can embody the white swan as well as the black swan— he eventually elects Nina, putting her life dreams into play. But things begin to get complicated when Lily (Mila Kunis), a dancer from San Francisco, comes to work for the company. She embodies the black swan in most every way- she is daring, vivacious, and unafraid of herself; whereas Nina embodies the white swan— graceful, innocent, and ultimately fated. This sparks wild insecurity and jealousy in Nina, who is already having problems letting herself go in her role as the black swan. As mounting pressure over the ballet gains momentum, Nina's grip on her role, as well as herself, begins to fall apart.<br/><br/>Having been blown away by Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" years back, the content of ""Black Swan"" piqued my interest from the get-go: crazy mothers, ballet, female competition, and insanity— what more could you want? Plot content aside, ""Black Swan"" is captivating enough through its aesthetics, which truly are breathtaking. I have to clap my hands for the amount of work that went into this film, from the art department to the cinematographers, and to the actors and ballerinas. The production quality of this film is ""Swan Lake""-on-Broadway caliber. <br/><br/>In terms of the plot, this is ultimately a character study; a portrait of a person who spirals downward in a climb toward perfection. Though this crux is formulaic and familiar (think Polanski's ""Repulsion""), the arena in which it takes place, as well as the circumstances of each of these characters is what makes the film stand on its own feet. Nina is the center of this movie, and her own frustrations, insecurities, and growing madness are lived and breathed by Natalie Portman. Her character ranges from timid to hysterical over the course of the film, and Portman executes each move with the precision of a professional ballerina. Her mother, played by Barbara Hershey, is key in all of the madness. She is forceful and caring toward her daughter, but the extent of their relationship is frankly disturbing. She tucks Nina into bed every night, helps dress her, calls her repeatedly, and domineers nearly every aspect of Nina's life. This may seem normal for a mother and a ten year old child— but not a daughter who is in her twenties. There's something definitely not right, and that uncomfortable dynamic between Hershey and Portman is illustrated wonderfully.<br/><br/>Lily, played by Mila Kunis, is the catalyst in the story— a seductress and Carmilla-like figure, driving Nina's ambition as well as her insecurity through the roof, and Kunis does a great job here as well. She's lively and funny, but also sinister when necessary. Vincent Cassel owns the role of the rich, oversexed, and arrogant director, and Winona Ryder takes the rest of the cake here as the retiring self-destructive dancer; she only has a few scenes, but she's got a sort of drunken 1970s Joan Crawford sensibility about her, and also partakes in probably the most disturbing scene in the entire movie.<br/><br/>The film builds itself into an astonishing third act, a crescendo for everything that has slowly burned through the course of the movie. It's astonishing not only visually, but also metaphorically, lyrically, and because of its hysteria- ridden balance between ""what is real?"" and ""what isn't?"", all of which combusts on opening show night.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" leaves audiences with some questions but quite a few answers, and the ambiguous fragments really make the film what it is. The performances here by all the actors are fantastic, as is the art direction and the general storytelling itself. It may leave you scratching your head in regards to some of the material that is hinted at and thrown toward us without full explication; but ultimately it won't matter, because ""it was perfect"". 9/10."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Normally, I watch a movie, organize my thoughts and write my comments. Not surprisingly, this film has me all tangled up in thoughts, opinions and analysis. Though I won't, I could easily write 10 pages on this mesmerizing work from visionary director Darren Aronofsky. It's best if this film is allowed to work it's (black) magic on each individual viewer.<br/><br/>What I can tell you is that similar to Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"", there will be a definite line of demarcation between those who like and those who don't. And just like with Nolan's exceptional film, among those who ""like"" this one, there will still be much debate and discussion about themes, meanings, presentation, performances and message. In my opinion, that's a pretty good report card for both films.<br/><br/>Be forewarned ... this is a very dark, risky and edgy film. Know that it steps even farther out than Mr. Aronofsky's previous work in The Wrestler, The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream and Pi. In other words, he works very hard on the presentation so that the viewer can be whisked away in many different directions emotionally.<br/><br/>The multi-faceted story has many angles, any of which could be construed as the lead. Natalie Portman (Nina) stars as a mid-20's member of a struggling New York ballet company. Barbara Hershey is Nina's smothering mother, who gives all dance mom's a bad name with her attempts to live vicariously through her daughter, while also stifling her growth into adulthood (the pink bedroom looks as if an 8 year old girl would be in heaven). Wynona Ryder (Beth) plays the ""aging"" prima ballerina who is forced into retirement, and Mila Kundis (Lily) is the mysterious newcomer who may or may not have an agenda. The fabulous Vincent Cassel (Thomas) is the company director and plays the role full bore.<br/><br/>Thomas announces that the company will be performing ""Swan Lake"" and, almost knowing the dancers will hiss at the re-tread, he quickly adds that it's never been done his way ... the same dancer playing both the White and Black Swan. He knows that Nina is the perfect choice as the White Swan but isn't sure she can dig deep enough for the dark side. Lily is her polar opposite ... mirror image ... as the emotionally free and with a comfortable level of darkness and evil. I mention mirrors because they play a key role throughout the film.<br/><br/>When Nina is chosen for the role, a twisted friendship with Lily emerges. This draws Nina further inside herself exposing thoughts and actions she never before imagined. On top of this, Thomas is the predatory authoritarian who constantly challenges her, leading to even more self-doubt.<br/><br/>As Nina slowly transforms from little girl into womanhood, we witness what looks like a slow slide towards madness. Has she gone too far? Will she snap out? Much of what we see is a clash between reality and her delusional mind. The viewer must decipher where the line is ... often multiple times within a single scene! We are left wondering if Lily is stealing Nina's identity or is it the other way around? The other topic we cover is the constant battle that dancers face. The cutthroat competition, backstage battles, increasing pain and injuries, the fear of failure - both physically and emotionally, and the immense dedication and skill required for this short-lived profession. There is a drive for perfection in these dancers, just like in the best athletes, musicians, actors, etc. Of course, perfection as a goal leads to disappointment in result.<br/><br/>I can't rave enough about the script from Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin. Breathtaking is the best word I can use to describe the camera work. We are literally onstage and whirling through the dancers. The musical score combined with the familiar songs topped with amazingly subtle (and some not so subtle) effects makes this best described as an artsy horror film meshed with a crackling psychological thriller held together by nightmarish melodrama. If that leaves you intrigued, then this one is ""perfect"" for you!"
"satana-6","10","3","14","15 December 2010"," Natalie Portman is hot!
","My girlfriend dragged me to this movie tonigt. I though, oh crap, it is about ballet. To my pleasant surprise, Portman spends a good 20% of this film touching herself. The rest of the time is spent with her running around either scantily clad or in a tutu. What more do you really want from a film?<br/><br/>As for the movie, it is kind of a horror flick I think. It starts with an ominous, dark feeling, and just gets worse. It isn't a feel good movie and is actually kind of depressing. It is gritty and a downer, but very well made and disturbing movie. Did I mention Natalie Portman is hot and spends a good part of the movie getting it on with herself? Worth the price of admission for this alone, and for this I give it full marks!

","I was unlucky enough to take a chance on this movie. The good is that Natalie Portman gives an Oscar worthy performance. The bad is that this movie is so intense it is frequently painful to watch. I've even heard some who think it should be classified as a horror movie. <br/><br/>As independent film buffs, my wife and I see a lot of films that are not intended for a wide audience. Fortunately, many are excellent. Although this film was very well made and had excellent direction, it has very low entertainment value. <br/><br/>The one high point of the movie was near the end when Natalie performs as the Black Swan. But this is not worth the price of admission. As is sometimes the case, movies that don't entertain get very high critical reviews. What is surprising to me is that user's gave this movie such a high score. Sometimes, when this happens, I like to see the movie again when it comes out on DVD or cable to see if I was out in left field when I saw it in the theaters. I hated the final Bourne movie in the theaters but found it much more enjoyable on cable. Go figure."

"annuskavdpol","1","2","8","9 February 2011"," Riveting - Black Swan is one in a million
","Perhaps in life good and bad are always evaluated. The main theme in this movie was about the weighing of the two sides. Like Star Wars between the Jedi and Darth Vader. Or like the ying and yang in Eastern Religion. This movie was about opposites. Not just good and bad but also the differences between reality and non-reality. Between success and failure. Between famous and destruction.<br/><br/>Throughout this whole movie, I felt that someone was pulling my hair. The movie was so uncomfortable to watch. I found the whole content and graphics very disturbing. The blood from Nina's fingers, the blood and scratches on Ninas' back. I felt shaken inside when watching this movie. This is one of movies that I went to were people actually left the movie theater. Last night 4 people got up in the movie theater and left their seats - not returning either. The only other movie that I experienced that happening to was with Schindler's List.<br/><br/>If I put this movie into perspective, I must admit that the movie was one in a million. That I have not experienced anything quite like it before. That I could actual feel the frustration, pain and complete loss of control and the gain of control all in one. So in that viewpoint the director succeeded immensely.<br/><br/>I think the ratings 14A should have been put up to 18+ and Restricted because the movie has lots of blood and a very destructive intertwined story.Even though it was a story of a ballerina, the graphics, were almost like watching a war movie.<br/><br/>I must commend the xtc scene and the hard dancing combined with the flashing paused cinematic photography. That conveyed an incredible real, life-like feeling. And I loved the metamorphose effect when Nina changed to the Black Swan - in one of the final scenes. Her skin started to change into scale-like features, and black patterns and wings started to appear on her body. She became the Black Swan in her being and it came out in her dance. That dancing display of blackness was amazing and empowering. It really gave a good impression of what was going on inside her head."

Meanwhile, we didn't know what was real and what wasn't and my Mom and daughter were totally lost. This movie could have been a lot better, there was just too much of the nambypamby good queen in it and we'd all been better off without the sex stuff. So, in retrospect, i wish we'd gone and seen anything else."
"plamya-1","6","2","8","29 December 2010"," Anything stupendous is worthy of admiration
","...including stupidity. For two-thirds of this movie I was thinking ""this is a stupid movie;"" about one-third was genuinely mesmerizing. The main theme is best reflected in the choreographer's remark to the heroine early in the film ""You must kill the sweet girl Nina in order to play the Black Swan."" There was a brilliant film in here somewhere, in the intersection between the plot of the ballet ""Swan Lake"" and the contemporary story of rivalry among would-be prima ballerinas, but this wasn't it, unfortunately--although all the components were there. The evil sorcerer's magic spell is cast through alcohol spiked with ""Ecstasy;"" Prince Charming and Svengali intersect.<br/><br/>The film's aesthetic sense is one more likely to appeal to aficionados of horror films than those expecting a logic more typical of psychological thrillers: taut it ain't. We know that not everything is beautiful at the ballet from the dancers' point of view, but neither do the conflicts behind the scenes amount to mythological tales of good and evil. It doth make me mad."
"angry127","9","2","8","29 December 2010"," Pretty Much Perfect
","I was not expecting that a Ballet movie would be one of the most disturbing horror movies I've seen in a while. Its quite intentional that the film gives off this impression. Just look at all the shots of the mirrors in the film. How many times do scissors and knives appear? There are multiple broken finger and toe nails throughout the movie. And, seeing the ballerinas on their tippy toes has a always made me a little queasy. But I'm digressing to some extent, since the point of all the suspense and horror is completely essential to the movie.<br/><br/>Like many Aronofsky films, things start out nice and simple. Then disorder comes in as the second law of thermodynamics predicts and things all go to hell. The movie takes place in only a few places (probably 4 or 5 locations). There are few characters in the movie of consequence. It feels a lot like a play adapted to film. Or perhaps even a ballet? I was not very taken with the Ballet shots earlier in the movie, as I'm not a fan. But, I quickly was drawn in to how the dances Natalie Portman performs reflects on the psychological and professional state of her character. Soon, I was at the edge of my seat hoping she would not fall or something bad would happen. The dancing scenes become extremely intense. A lot of this has to do with Natalie Portman's acting. I was never a big fan of hers. After seeing this, I think she is a really gifted actress. She plays the part of the white swan so well. She is always at the teetering edge completely scared and hopelessly trying to forestall any type of failure. After reading a little bit of her biography, she may not be acting at all in the movie.<br/><br/>The film is extremely consistent and the ending has the payoff you would expect. Before the end happens you are wondering what will actually happen. The film does a very good job at keeping what possible scary outcomes always under some sense of skepticism."

This movie was hyped, but it fails to deliver. Too bad. It could have been great. As it stands, I give it a 1 because I can't give it anything lower. I expect so much more from Keira Knightley.

I am thankful that I watched Black Swan again because, after this second critical viewing, I experienced so much more technique fused with a narrative that I enjoyed. Black Swan follows Nina Sayers as she transforms herself into the perfect portrayal of the Swan Queen in Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"". As she becomes more consumed by the role, she begins to lose her grip on the line between perception and reality. Starring Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, the 2010 film by Darren Aronofsky was a brilliant psychological exploration illustrating the depths someone will go to achieve another person's idea of perfection.<br/><br/>Always chasing her big break, Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a ballerina who is constantly practicing and working on her technique when she hears that Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) the artistic director of a New York City ballet company is casting Swan Lake. The director is one that Nina is desperate to impress as she joins the countless others vying for the lead of the production. At any other time, the lead would have gone to company favorite, Beth Macintyre, but now that she has been forced to retire, Thomas is looking for another star which heightens the intensity of the auditions. No one needs the role as much as Nina, who lives with her overly involved mother, a former ballerina who now lives vicariously through her daughter. Thomas recognizes Nina's ability and has no reservations that she can capture the essence of the beautiful and graceful white swan piece of the performance. It is the darkness needed to portray the black swan that Thomas believes Nina may not be able to capture. Thomas begins using manipulative measures in order to bring about a darkness he has never before seen in Nina. The manipulation of Thomas, and the internalized pressures Nina puts on herself to become someone else and replace Beth brings her to hallucinations and an inability to discern between what is actually going on and what is going on in her mind. Thomas also begins to pit her against another dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis) who he believes has no problem capturing the essence of the black swan. With that added element of competition and insecurity, Nina loses her grip on reality even further and begins to fall victim to the circumstances around her.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's camera work especially the constant movement and out-of-focus shots were a genius way to illustrate the constant whirlwind of what was going on in Nina's psyche. The exploration of Nina losing more of her own individuality as she attempts to become another person was brilliantly executed by Aronofsky. As she spends more time with Lily and sees the ease with which she lives her life, she begins to convince herself that becoming more like Lily will be to her benefit. The more she actively tries to become another person, however, she loses her own uniqueness that initially inspired Thomas to select her for the lead in the first place. Another interesting aspect of Black Swan is the hallucinations the audience is allowed to experience from Nina's perspective. Just as Nina is unsure of which of her experiences are happening in her mind and which are taking place in actuality, the audience is also left to wonder what is actually happening. With an ending in which has been discussed since the film released, Black Swan is an exquisite turn in the filmography of director Darren Aronofsky."

","A second-generation ballet dancer, being trained by her mom, and who has always been known in her dancing classes to be the ideal one, the one who gives it all in to reach perfection, no matter if it puts them in harm's way. Natalie Portman does justice to the ballerina part, supported by her tender and fragile body. She appears to be the best one they could've cast in Hollywood. Mila Kunis as supporting actress is truly welcome with applause. At some point, Whiplash(2014) seems to draw some inspiration for its scenes from this movie(Whiplash won the Academy Award for Best Movie Drama in that year), if we compare. Moving along the plot, some intricacies in the mind of the character Nina gets along which daunt her the whole story line.<br/><br/>Would she be able to fight her own problems? Would she get along with what is happening?<br/><br/>It's a closely knit plot differentiating between what is real and what's in our head. So, one could guess that this movie gets along the lines of Fight Club, or Insomnia<br/><br/>Watch and tell me you're taken aback with the sheer content this movie has to offer."
"quinimdb","10","1","3","26 July 2016"," Black Swan
","""Black Swan"" is actually an adaptation of the play Swan Lake. I know that would seem obvious to you if you haven't seen the film, but many believe the play is only a plot device in the film to trigger her eventual descent into insanity. But as Thomas Leroy states early in the film, Swan Lake is ""Done to death, I know. But not like this. We strip it down. Make it visceral and real."" And that's exactly what the film does. Rather than being the actual play, it becomes a dark character study and psychological thriller, but it still follows the same story.<br/><br/>The film begins similar to the play, with a prelude where the spell is cast on Nina Sayers, our main character. This spell is not a literal one however, but rather the curse of the play, and how it changes her. I believe she is split into three parts, and these are represented by the characters Beth Macintyre, Erica Sayers, and, of course, The Black Swan. Erica, her mother, is the side of her that demands perfection, and wants to keep her innocence in order to stay focused. The Black Swan is the side of her that wants to lose her innocence and embrace her imperfection, and basically say ""live a little."" Beth Macintyre is the side of her that realizes her imperfections and punishes herself for them. Thomas Leroy is what she wants to be. He is perfection for the play. He knows exactly what he needs to be and when. This is represented by Nina peeing standing up towards the beginning of the film, and when she has sex with The Black Swan in a dream and confronts her the next day about it, but The Black Swan says ""Not unless you have a penis and your name is Tom."" She seems to be referring to the man named Tom whom they met the night before, but who else is named Tom? Thomas Leroy. These sides of her are also represented by the colors black and white, which are important in the film. The Black Swan, Erica, and Beth all wear black throughout the film, showing that they are the negative aspect in her and the struggle between them is what eventually drives her insane. Thomas Leroy usually wears gray, or both white and black at once, showing that he has both the black swan and the white swan in him, but, unlike Nina, he has it in perfect balance, there is no struggle within him. <br/><br/>She tries to get rid of all three sides of her, but once she finally does it, she realizes they are still there, and don't seem to be leaving anytime soon, so the only way to freedom (and perfection) is suicide, just as the white swan in the play."
"greg-e-porter","9","1","3","1 June 2016"," Black Swan is a great psychological thriller/adaptation of Swan Lake; it's a solid movie.
","We follow Nina Sayers (Portman) who is going into her third or fourth year as a New York ballerina. Swan Lake is the ballet of the season and Nina is looking forward to getting a main part; the director promised her something more than a minor part because she's so talented and dedicated. ""Looking forward to,"" is something of an understatement though; she is desperate, if for no other reason than to appease her domineering mother. The stress of trying to get the role is overwhelming. It mixes with her fears and anxieties about the competition from the new spunky, sexy dancer, Lily (Kunis). Weird and creepy things start to happen as Nina starts to breakdown.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say really anything else about the story other than that the movie incorporates Swan Lake is a really great way. Sometimes movies that are called ""adaptations"" are really more attempts to directly translate a story to the silver screen. Black Swan, however, takes source material and changes it to a new situation. Now that's what I call an adaptation.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great and the music is spectacular. This is a solid movie. It isn't too scary either. I heard it was creepy but because it's a psychological thriller, that helps; you know that a lot of the stuff is in her head. It's not like a monster is going to get her and then you.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised Natalie Portman won the Academy Award for her performance; she did a darn good job. Mila Kunis gave a great performance too. It gave me a newfound respect for her, actually. I've always associated her with expensive but lame movies like Friends with Benefits (2011) or Jupiter Ascending (2015) but I've been slowly warming up to her.<br/><br/>Although, now that I look at the dates of those movies, it would seem that she is going kinda downhill because Black Swan came out in 2010 but this is to say that she is capable of a solid role. I mean, look at Nicholas Cage. His name on a movie poster is like the red X on the door of a plague victim. But! But, I say, he did win an Academy Award for Leaving Las Vegas so he has (or at least had) the ability to do it."

","From top to bottom, this film is at the height of what it means to be true art in cinema. The various elements of the film, the Miss- en-scene, was so incredibly structured by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky that one need only sit back and admire at the fluidity of his camera movement, or the marvelous hue of colors amid st a film which has it's color scheme largely dedicated to the symbolism of black and white.<br/><br/>The performances where spot on, Vincent Cassel was terrific as the suspicious teacher, whose brilliance and lust for the dancers in his show are both quite reputable, one often beating out the other. And Mila Kunis truly shines in this one, bringing out a side of her many probably didn't know was possible. She is absolutely beautiful and aptly portrays the black contradiction to Natalie Portman's white, a terrific contrast of good and evil. Kunis, however, as many may assume, is not meant to be there to spark a general conflict of good vs evil, but to emphasize the side of Portman that we have not yet seen. A side that will drive her to the brink of insanity to obtain.<br/><br/>And therein lies the true theme of the film, obsession and physical strain over all else. Much like ""The Wrestler"" we have the main character dedicated to an unappreciated form of physical art. Here, it is Portman's obsession with becoming the lead of the ballet Swan Lake which drives her into madness. You enter her mind as her teacher pushes her to become perfect, pushing her to let go of her fragile White Swan and become the loose and destructive Black Swan. As you follow her through the stages of her audition leading towards a booming finale she becomes less and less aware of what around her is distortion and what is reality. As she loses grip, Aronofsky's ability to depict psychological deterioration shines through.<br/><br/>And make no mistake, this film belongs to Aronofsky and Portman. As stated, Aronofsky captures everything beautifully in frame, his movement of the camera is almost as fluent and beautiful as the very dancers on the screen. His use of behind the head vantage shots has been a bit of a trademark of his, allowing as to see what the character is. And his use of lighting is nothing short of extraordinary. But now comes the true star: Natalie Portman. She blew me away, from start to finish, she displayed her transformation for the sweet girl to the physically and psychologically obsessed, all the way through attempting to embody the white and black swan when necessary, literally trying to become them in her mind, driving her towards insanity in the pursuit of perfection. Words cannot describe Portman's performance here, to say it is Oscar worthy would be a vast understatement, as the depth of her character goes so deep it would nearly be worthy of playing two separate roles. So fragile at time that you fear for her life, and so corrupted at others that you hate her. Acting at it's finest, Portman deserved the Oscar."

","""I was... perfect,"" says Nina as she bleeds out and we fade to white.<br/><br/>Perfection is what this movies pursues: beautiful, artful, perfection. And for the most part, it succeeds. Though it prioritizes style over character to a fault, the end result is a pretty, dark, smart evocative tale of a mentally unstable ballerina who has been thrust to the lead of a production of Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best attribute of this film is its ability to put us inside Nina's head. It's not overt about it, at least not until it needs to be, but the way they shoot and display everything makes us feel like we're in her skin. This neutralizes a lot of the film's low points and gives it another interesting later to chew on. Some parts of the film are obviously Nina's hallucinations, specifically two scenes with her friend/rival/love Lily: one in which the two of them share a hot sex scene that a lot of guys probably skip to when they pull up this film on their Netflix account, and another in which Nina kills Lily with a mirror shard. But a lot of other scenes could either be real or hallucinations. You're not sure.<br/><br/>That feeling of unsureness is appropriate, as Nina can't tell what real and what's not. She as confused as she is self-harming and bulimic. A scene near the end in which she pulls a shard of mirror out of her own stomach is gruesome to watch. You feel her pain and empathize with her more than you otherwise would have. Portman is fantastic in this movie. She takes a systematically restrained character, one who, as opposed to the overt Lily, tries to not show any emotion, and makes her mystic, almost classical.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis, who plays Lily, is a joy to watch. Witty and crude, she's Nina's diametric opposite. I would not have minded if the movie had focuses around her, though I understand that the film would have to be adjusted quite a lot. Winona Ryder plays the old prima ballerina, who has been run out of the role of the Swan Queen by Portman and is now psychotic, or so Nina's perspective leads us to believe. It's nice to see her acting again, and it's a funny role from a meta sense. Aronofsky assembled a star cast.<br/><br/>Speaking of him, I was surprised to learn that he's an American. Both this and the other film I've seen of his, Requiem of a Dream, have a cold, visceral, artistic touch that seems very European. If nothing else, he has established his own style, which I appreciate. A director that has no distinctive touches might as well not be behind the camera.<br/><br/>The film is gorgeous, particularly during the hallucination sequences. The dream at the beginning in which she sees herself performing on stage is one of the prettiest openings I've seen. Notice how there is a heavy use of black and white imagery, particularly during the first half of the movie. During the second half, as her situation grows more dire, more and more red creeps in.<br/><br/>It's not a film that will change your life, but it's certainly a high-quality spectacle with some real staying power. It was an instant classic, and that's not gonna change any time soon.<br/><br/>By: Joshua A. Fagan http://jfmillenniumreviews.blogspot.com/"

","Black Swan tells the story of a ballet dancer who goes on a terrifying descent into madness while facing the pressures of playing the lead of Swan Lake. This is a tough watch and you will need to brace yourself. This terrifying plummet into the abyss is more shocking and frightening than most horror films could ever hope to be, and it examines the dark side of fame and destructive road to greatness far better than most films do. Natalie Portman, as the lead, redeems herself for the Star Wars prequels, while Mila Kunis is surprisingly good as the lead's rival. Darren Aronofsky, who thankfully is on better form than he was when he helmed the slog that was Noah, directs the film brilliantly, and Black Swan manages not to tell the story of the psychological breakdown predictably. Developed characters, thought-provoking themes and a sharp, ferocious screenplay make this not just terrifying, but deeply upsetting as well. Black Swan may lost control of itself a bit towards the end and descend into over-the-top Gothic horror imagery, but this is only a slight misstep and it gets back on form fairly quickly. The story eventually starts to feel slightly rushed, but the finale still delivers an appropriately devastating blow. It's great that this was nominated for lots of awards at the Oscars for it completely deserved the nominations. I personally see this as a horror movie, so it's one of the best, if not the best horror films of the 2010s so far.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This is exceptional film making that, like most really well put together film, supports ever deepening appreciation on subsequent viewings.<br/><br/>After early suggestions of shadows at play, from a well paced, seemingly innocuous start, the film takes several rapid left turns, punctuated with passionate and erotic twists, drawing us deeper into a squirm-in-your-seat psychological thriller - not a genre or feeling I myself seek or generally enjoy - but this is seductive filming, building steadily to a powerful and sublime climax that is richly satisfying.<br/><br/>The film is evocatively and masterfully shot, full of subtlety, richness and depth. The supporting cast are absolutely flawless in their roles. Portman nails the part - is the part - embodying it metaphorically, psychologically, and in some sense literally. <br/><br/>The dance itself is effective, though not, per se the focus of the film, so much as the unnerving character study and exploration of the shadow we all posses, or possesses us, and ultimately, the power in transformation.<br/><br/>Powerful lighting, direction, edgy score - the overall gestalt is a film where the sum creates something greater than its component parts - the alchemical art of film making."

","Black Swan is a plunge into a really dark world of self-doubt that not only manages to make its audience incredibly uncomfortable, but also establishes a psychological and interpersonal connection with it as well.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky has been no stranger to directing some of the deepest, most personal and darkest films of the 21st century. Black Swan is not only not an exception, but perhaps his most layered film yet. I had been anticipating this film with incredibly high expectations, considering my admiration and appreciation of his directing of contemporary classics like Requiem and The Wrestler, yet this film still managed to absolutely floor me. Natalie Portman delivers her indisputable best performance to date, with complete immersion into her raw and starkly real role as the Swan Queen, Nina. Her performance serves the very deep and personal plot flawlessly, which absolutely made its way into my soul. The supporting cast is pretty good too, leaving nothing to be desired. But perhaps most exceptionally notable is this film's direction and lighting. The dark and disturbing imagery that accompanies this film is shot so spectacularly well that I was often left conflicted between awe and disgust. The film's script also integrates itself within the film and its cast seamlessly, as I, even being the script nitpicker I am, couldn't find a line in the movie that felt out-of-place or awkward. It is all consistently emotionally- investing and brilliantly unsettling.<br/><br/>All in all, Black Swan is an unforgettable work of art that managed to completely obliterate my already high expectations. Definitely the best drama of 2010."

","Black Swan (2010): Dir: Darren Aronofsky / Cast: Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder: Tense and riveting film about personality disorder. Natalie Portman plays Nina, a ballet dancer set to perform the White Swan for Swan Lake but her instructor informs her that she hasn't the feeling to make the transformation to the Black Swan. At home she is dominated by her mother who at one time was a dancer herself. Now she conflicts reality and fantasy sometimes interlocking the two to consequential results. This is Darren Aronofsky's best film since Requiem For A Dream with similar images involving what the mind sees and what is actually there. Portman delivers a maddening performance as a woman who strives for perfection to the point where it controls her. Vincent Cassel plays her egotistical instructor who just dismissed his long time leading lady and now seduces Nina with forceful intensity. One of the pleasures of Aronofsky is that this situation doesn't conclude as expected. Mila Kunis plays another dancer whom Nina fears is replacing her. She seems enthusiastic at Nina's talent and invites her on a night on the town that concludes with an intense sex scene that may or may not be real. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's dominating mother who dreams that her daughter will succeed where she failed. Winona Ryder plays a performer past her prime who is being replaced. Her reaction to this is severe. Visually spectacular with many mind blowing turns where one's quest for perfection becomes a sacrifice of sanity and losing self for the sake of art. Score: 10 / 10"

","This film was an absolute beauty. I was deeply amazed by this movie with its acting, story line, and atmosphere. Watching Portman's character Nina drift slowly into madness for the role of Swan Queen are some of the best psychological thrills about this movie, as she battles her inner ""Black Swan"", fighting to perfect the role, and prevent this new and upcoming rival Lily (Kunis) from taking it from her. Along with the somewhat violent sexual contact received from her instructor, a supposed tool he uses to help her understand the Black Swan's role, she is under constant pressure to ""let go"". This madness drives her to see her darkest nightmares and desires to become reality, right before her very eyes. Nina's hardship is made worse when her over-obsessive mother begins to attempt to keep her off the stage, believing that her (Nina's) physical self-abuse is making her sick, and unfit for the performance. But it's her strong-will to play the part that pushes Nina to the end, even if she may end up paying it with her life.<br/><br/>This psychological thriller-horror is one that will make your skin crawl with fear and suspense. Highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Forewarn, this movie contains repeated scenes of strong sexual content, lots of strong profanity, some violence, drug use, and a few jump scares."

","Darren Aronofsky's obsession with obsession continues in Black Swan - a twisted psychological drama bordering on horror that turns ballet into a dangerous mind game. Here, he explores the quest for perfection in what is a near-perfect film!<br/><br/>This arty thrill ride of a movie has a story mirroring that of 'Swan Lake', the venerable ballet at the heart of the action. It follows coy ballerina Nina Sayers (Portman), who is made the prime ballerina for the upcoming performance of Swan Lake, replacing the previous principal dancer Beth (Ryder), much to the delight of her domineering mother Erica (Hershey). To play the lead in Swan Lake, Nina must embrace her Black Swan - the sinister, unbridled yin to her white and fluffy yang. Pummeled under the barbaric tutelage of her director Tomas (Cassell), Nina begins an inexorable descent into madness. While Nina successfully embodies the innocent, delicate spirit of the White Swan she struggles with the opposite persona of the Black Swan, a more dark and sexual being. As a result she is pushed into competition with Lily (Kunis), a new dancer, who has the ability to capture the darker side of the ballet. In her unending quest for perfection, Nina takes ""losing herself"" to a whole new level, living in a spinning vortex of fear and unreality. The intensity builds as opening night draws near, Nina's grip on reality becoming more tenuous by the day, and reaches a fever pitch during the first performance of 'Swan Lake', the movie's themes crystallizing into a beautiful, gut-wrenching climax.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is phenomenal as Nina - it's a virtuoso performance of hard graft. She inhabits the role with gusto, making Nina a superb balance of mothered restraint, desperation, repression and wide-eyed innocence, all masking a caged animal keen to break free - an incredibly raw and gutsy display of her talent. Adding to the film's gravitas are the superb performances from the supporting cast. All of the actors, from the ever watchable Vincent Cassel (as the ballet's sleazy director) to the controlled Mila Kunis (as a dancer as free-spirited as Nina is repressed) to wonderfully monstrous Barbara Hershey (as Nina's overbearing stage mom) to a briefly but effectively used Winona Ryder (as the ballet company's fallen queen bee) are splendid.<br/><br/>But the big star here is unquestionably Aronofsky, whose singular vision quite literally stuns one silent. This film finds the director reverting to his truer, untamed filmmaking self, giving in to his unhinged artistic impulses. It's that quality that gives the film so much more resonance than most thrillers; ironically what makes the film so effective in painting a vividly unsettling picture of losing control is Aronofsky's complete mastery of his material. The slow burn air of unease is established from frame one and carefully, creepily crescendos until finally exploding into a stunningly intense final act - the ultimate cinematic culmination of the film's dualities of focus and surrender, liberation and destruction, and most of all, beauty and horror.<br/><br/>Black Swan has a pulse, a feeling of agitated, intoxicating brilliance. Part thriller, part horror and part trippy exploration of the clash between reality and livid vision, Black Swan is a balls-to-the-wall display of cinematic showmanship."

","Nina Sayers is a hardworking ballerina in a New York City ballet company. She is the perfect ballerina for Odette, the white swan, but she desires to be Odilr, the black swan. Natalie Portman's performance of Nina Sayers is heartbreaking and brilliant. She captures the madness and Nina's inner demons so well. Barbara Hershey is perfect as Nina's mother, Erica. She can be overbearing but she watches her daughter change with this career making role. Unfortunately, Erica shields and protects Nina but she can't save her daughter. Nina's self-destruction is a slow painful process to watch but she had a history of cutting and scratching and self-mutilation. Nina deteriorates quickly and Portman deserved all those accolades for her performance here. The director here also did ""The Wrestler"" where the title character also would risk his health for his job. Unlike career wrestling, ballet is a tougher discipline where perfection is sought. Nina's mental health is sacrificed for her career when her mother tries to save her, it is too late. It is a heartbreaking end to such a promising career. If you have the DVD, you can see Tina Sloan (Guiding Light's veteran Lillian Raines) and the director's parents at the gala meeting Nina. I found the movie hard to watch at times. Mila Kunis is wonderful in her role too."

","Superb direction from Aronofsky and a brilliant, Oscar winning performance from Portman highlight this dark psychological drama about a gifted ballet dancer trying to find her inner ""Black Swan."" Aronofsky seems to have a real gift in casting and coaxing great performances from his players. Compare this to The Wrestler. He selected Mickey Rourke, a fallen star with a broken body, living on past glories, to play a character that was very similar. In this one he selects a beautiful, gifted actress who had shown brilliance, but never quite fulfilled her promise, to play a similar character. Portman, like Rourke before her, knocked it out of the park, with the journey she takes on screen to this brilliant performance echoing the journey of her character.<br/><br/>The good performances in Black Swan don't stop with Portman either. If Portman's performance was the crowning glory of her career, Kunis' effort is her coming out as a formidable talent playing two characters. Winona Ryder, an actress in her 40s who was once an it-girl, gives it her all as a ballerina in an identical situation. Barbara Hershey as, Mommie Dearest, is unsettling, but in no way one note. One minute she is a loving parent, the next a brooding monster. Vincent Cassel, a talented actor and sometime producer, revels in one of his best roles as music instructor Thomas Leroy.<br/><br/>Through skilled direction, Aronofsky follows Portman around the entire film, often looking over her shoulder, and superior use of lighting and score create an atmosphere more unsettling than many modern horror films can manage.<br/><br/>In the interest of fairness I read some negative reviews for this film, and the main negative seems to be the feeling from people who are involved in or have an appreciation for ballet not believing that Aronofsky has done the profession in general, or Swan Lake specifically, any justice. The criticism being that the director only has a superficial understanding of the subject matter, not a small issue by any measure, but not one I have any knowledge of. So if you are a fan of ballet, you could be in for a disappointment. <br/><br/>I don't know much about the ballet, I can't think of any scenario by which I would sit through a two hour (or longer) performance. I appreciate the skill and dedication of the performers, but it's not my idea of entertainment. What I do know something about is actors and performances, and Portman gives one of the best acting performances you will ever see. Like it's subject, Black Swan isn't perfect, but it's spectacular entertainment."

Thomas decides to replace Beth, the prima ballerina/his lover, for someone new to play The Swan Queen. Despite his doubts, he picks Nina. But he's also intrigued by Lily, the company's newest dancer. Leroy thinks that Nina can easily play the White Swan because it's who she really is--innocent, fragile, fearful. But he doesn't think she can play The Black Swan who is beguiling, seductive, dangerous.<br/><br/>Black Swan seems to be all about getting in touch with our dark side and the toll it can take on us.

We see Nina struggling to cope with several problems throughout the film--fear of failure, mental illnesses, anxiety, constant pressure and even the threat of losing her mind.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman does such an amazing job portraying this that it never feels like she's acting. She IS Nina Sayers. Mila Kunis does a great job as well as Lily, Nina's friend/competitor. Even Winona Ryder's brief turn as jilted Beth is intense and memorable. All of the performances were great. It's hard to pick a favorite.<br/><br/>But Nina isn't exactly the best narrator, but I don't believe she is supposed to be. We never know what's real and what's not. The pressure is really getting to Nina & I think director Darren Aronofsky did a great job with the film. I especially liked the talking pictures towards the end, Nina's relationships with the people in her life and how they add to the pressure and delusions, the increasing uses of the evil twin, and the ripples. Very subtle touch.<br/><br/>Overall, I think ""Black Swan"" took me on a wild, interesting ride. It was interesting to see what ballerinas actually go through. I heard that Portman and Kunis spent almost a year training and researching for these parts. That included ballet exercises every day for FIVE hours, and 1200 calorie diets. Wow. Anyway, enjoy and leave the lights on."

","So that's why Natalie Portman won the Oscar. She's absolutely incredible in this. Pretty great movie too, a little artsy for my taste but intense, scary in parts and I love it when a movie ends and you have to work things out in your mind, you have to think, figure it all out and other people have a completely different view about what was going on than you did. <br/><br/>Anyways, Natalie totally deserved the Oscar for her performance here as a New York ballet dancer who gets the lead in Swan Lake. Perfect for the role of the innocent white swan 'Nina' becomes completely consumed with the dance, transforming and losing herself as she as she pushes her body to the limit, becoming more and more like the dangerous black swan. 02.24.14"

","Black Swan had so much press and excessive hype going for it at the time it came out. I have to say it was quite possibly the most over-rated film I have personally ever seen. The storyline had no real premise and was even downright stupid! What was the big deal and how possible is this movie rated an 8-REALLY? Seemed like it just went from scene to scene with no continuity. The acting-especially that of Natalie Portman-was average at best. I find her to be quite wooden as an actress-no real layers of depth in the roles she has played throughout her career. No way should Portman's performance have been deemed Oscar-worthy...her whining was quite annoying throughout the movie. She played the part of an infantile young woman who needed the approval of people around her at every turn. Several other characters in the movie seemed to have no real purpose in the story as well-very shallow character development in general. The only tolerable element of the movie was the stylish cinematography. In general I would not recommend the movie at all--complete waste of my time lost to view it!"
"togetherfade","10","1","3","27 March 2014"," Favorite movie of all time.
","Remarkable psychological thriller with great, exquisite Natalie Portman. Very smart, sensitive film about sacrifice work to ballet. Perfect soundtrack, creepy atmosphere, and sexy Mila Kunis. Subtly but continuously, he builds tension. Turns the inner world of the character, making it a reality. And that of uncomfortable, because the character - not the average person with such average needs. She is talented and fanatical desire to unleash her talents. For me, the film is about how far a person can go in pursuit of desired. As far as deep inside it can look. It's pretty scary - to find themselves in the darkest, sanctuary, carefully hidden. Moreover - pull it out, give himself up this dark side."

","Great psychological drama, though not perfect. Incredibly intense plot and direction, allied with a superb performance by Natalie Portman, and good supporting performances from Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey.<br/><br/>However, it is not totally original nor unpredictable. The broader conclusion was quite foreseeable. If you have seen all of Darren Aronofsky's previous movies, Black Swan will seem like an amalgam of them. The ending is very reminiscent of The Wrestler and the fantasy scenes reminiscent of Pi and, especially, Requiem For a Dream.<br/><br/>A great movie though I can't help but feel that the themes and broad plot are not at all original."
"JuliaCaron","8","1","3","13 January 2014"," Great Movie
","Natalie Portman was excellent, I truly liked the movie. I strongly recommend it. I loved the dance and the scenes. It was very captivating and intense. Sometimes scary, but really good. I just couldn't see another actress performing in the Black Swan. It felt like Portman was the only suitable actress for this role. I also believe that preparing for this movie involved a lot of ballet training, which I think Portman nailed. The costumes were superb. Another great characteristic of this movie is that it incorporated beauty and violence. Portman is a great actress to begin with, therefore she performed better than expected. She was able to express her emotions in a very unique and original way, which it definitely impressed me."
"MoviesAreLife93","9","1","3","4 January 2014"," A psychological roller-coaster
","Black Swan is one of those films whose artistic craft knocks you off your feet. I found it to be psychologically engaging on a profound level. Darren Aronofsky did a superb job creating a film that dives into the deep, dark depths of an increasingly unstable mind. He takes us on the psychological roller-coaster of an insane mind, and doesn't let us out of our seat until our minds have been rattled. After the film ends, we are left speechless, yet we have so much to say. This is a movie that sparks your mind in a unique, ingenious, and utterly bizarre way. The musical score, the acting, the directing, and the camera-work are excellent; they all contribute to the film's psychological framework. Most notably, of course, is Natalie Portman's performance. She was highly convincing in her portrayal as Nina, a disturbed young woman striving for perfection. As Nina leads herself down this detrimental road, we feel our own minds warping with hers. This is what makes Black Swan a superb work of psychological art. I highly recommend this to anyone who can appreciate an intriguing, bizarre, disturbing, and artistic film."

","I'm not the typical cinema expert but I've watched a few and if you love cinema, theatre, the entertaining industry in general, you must see this movie. All sorts of human expressions actually, where talent, technique and the fear of doing wrong battle with the immortal spirit at the same time building it and serving it, at any cost.<br/><br/>The peculiarity of this movie is that it is about itself. yes. how? well in the end I could feel that not Nina but Natalie Portman herself was the ""swan queen"". <br/><br/>At first I didn't rate this movie 10/10 only because there are some flaws in the direction and generally because of the technical ""confection"" of the film, which is not ""perfect""; the style is eclectic with scenes that resemble a horror or erotic movie. <br/><br/>Although if you watch the movie you'll understand why this movie is ""out of the ordinary"" and how it can be ""a movie about itself"", why ""perfection"" isn't always ""perfect""... therefore to be coherent with my review, I'll rate it a 10/10.<br/><br/>Portman's performance is the incarnation of all that."

","So I finally sat down and watched the Black Swan. I am not to interested in movies with dancing but this one was different. The lead character is given a role of her career and will do anything to prove she is the right person for the role. The film is pretty suspenseful and thrilling. It may come off to some as a horror film and I understand why. Some of the reviews I read on here call the film confusing. What they failed to understand is that mostly all the craziness that went on was all in her head. She let the role consume her. Towards the end the dance instructor tells her she is the only one standing in her way which confirms the hallucinations she was dealing with was with herself mainly. In one scene she believed she had stabbed a girl who was trying to take her spot but in reality she stabbed herself. The acting was good and may be a bit violent for some."
"LeonLouisRicci","8","1","3","15 December 2012"," Stylish and Subversive
","This one doesn't quite satisfy as a Horror/Thriller film and doesn't quite make it as a tribute to the ballet. It is, of course, more than either of these restraints and as a result is more than the parts and less than the whole. That is to say it has enough crossover involvement to attract attention to the amalgamation but not enough to be totally successful at either.<br/><br/>It is stylishly, subversive and creative, however it does have some convoluted and in your face scenes that can be called indulgent and not much more. There is a glossy look and the Director's artsy way is on display here with varying visits to hallucination and mental instability.<br/><br/>The film is an attractive and disturbing affair that can be absorbing and repugnant. Fans of dance and stage production will be disappointed and if one is expecting an all out Horror/Thriller, well maybe. <br/><br/>One could do better to see Michael Powell's The Red Shoes (1948) or Bob Fosse's All That jazz (1979) or any number of films by Dario Argento to do better. This Director while not bad, he does have his moments, has yet to demonstrate anything excellent."

"lrishJoe78","8","1","3","9 December 2012"," Original psychological thriller
","This movie is an examination of obsession, and a mother living vicariously through her daughter. Ultimately it proves to be a journey into madness. Natalie Portman is utterly believable throughout as the shy but talented Nina Sayers, and deserves the awards she is likely to receive for this performance. Mila Kunis plays the darker role of Lily with equal skill and style. For me, these two make the movie although they are very ably supported by Barbara Hershey as Ninas mother, Winona Ryder as the usurped prima ballerina, and Vincent Cassel as the company's artistic director.<br/><br/>Black Swan has to be one of the more original psychological thrillers in recent years. Although the first hour goes a little slowly, there is a complex plot building all the while. As the film goes on, and it becomes clear that the line between hallucination and reality is fading for Nina, the skills of director Darren Aronofsky really come to the fore. The production is superb, with beautiful camera work and light use of CGI to illustrate the hallucinations which are taking Nina over. <br/><br/>Overall this is a highly enjoyable and well delivered movie, with a tight story and plenty of surprises in store!"

","Wow! I forgot how much that movie deeply disturbed me . I have the deepest respect for Natalie Portman, and she really did deserve her Oscar for this movie. But holy s***balls this movie disturbs me. It mostly just made me cringe a lot. Especially the part with her nails, and when her legs go backwards. (Shudders) I mean I loved it! I really loved it. But every time I watch it, and this is the third time I've watched it now, I end up with a severe need to shower repeatedly to get the creepiness off me. This is a fine piece of film work and is beautifully shot and directed. It mixes the beautiful, the perverse and the passionate together incredibly well and you can't help but become kind of hypnotized. I can totally understand why Natalie Portman won the Oscar for her performance in this film. She is simply stunning. Her portrayal is superb and even my beloved wife here, who always has something to say about Natalie Portman, cannot fault her flawless performance here. If this movie were not so disturbing I would watch it over and over. But as it is, I tend to watch large chucks of it hiding behind my hands and peeking out between my fingers."
"g-phanisrinivas","9","1","3","10 October 2012"," Dauntingly mesmerizing
","The film was the most sought after at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals. Later, Natalie Portman won the Oscar Best Actress for the film. I loved Natalie Portman in Brothers and so I watched this film with lot of expectations.<br/><br/>The film gives no space for rest. The screenplay and editing are watertight and the proceedings are damn interesting. It doesn't allow you to look away from the film even for a single second. The dance sequences towards the end, that contribute a lot to the storyline, are finely choreographed. I have never seen much of ballet, so the film was a different experience for me.<br/><br/>The production design heavily uses black and white owing to the film's theme. The camera lingers a lot around Natalie as she walks around the corridors and dances in the theater. Editing is superb. The film never lets any scene get heavy and cuts through unapologetically. <br/><br/>Black Swan is a psychological thriller that deals with an aspiring ballet dancer who has to portray two roles quite opposite to each other. While she is extremely good with the positive one (White Swan), she can't carry off the negative Black Swan effectively according to the director. Lily (Mila Kunis) is a perfect alternative for the Black Swan but Natalie fights through to acquire both the roles. In an effort to accomplish both the roles effectively, she gets deeply involved with the character of Black Swan. She starts hallucinating and what we witness is a roller-coaster of marvelous scenes that confuse, enchant and mesmerize.<br/><br/>Ballet is depicted in the film as an art which, to perform efficiently, requires self torture. Nina (Natalie) suffers from rashes and cramps at many points in the film, although the rashes turn out to be something else that I won't reveal. The sequences with Mila Kunis are arguably the best in the film. Kunis turns out to be the surprise package and makes her character believable. She makes a late entry and dominates with her strong screen presence and her very down to earth personality. The complete club sequence and the next one at Nina's house come across totally unexpected.<br/><br/>Natalie Portam is the star of the show. She gives a very humane performance that we empathize with right from frame 1. She may not have done the dances herself (nobody can), but she gives a unique dimension to her character that makes her aim and struggle more believable. She gradually transforms from the naive, easy going White Swan to the cunning, ambitious, experienced Black Swan. The murder scene in the second half is exemplary, mainly because of the wonderful transformation of Natalie. The next ballet scene where she turns graphically into a swan is the best dance sequence in the film and the brilliant camera work by Matthew Libatique makes the scene more accomplishing.<br/><br/>Vincent Cassel is in terrific form as the dance director who is always unsatisfied with Nina's dancing abilities. He attracts hatred every time he comes, but one cannot deny that he has a positive side too. Daren Aronofsky has a novel script at hand and makes full use of it. The film is not without blemishes, but it rides high on the superb direction. Aronofsky maintains an eerie atmosphere, although, the film is not of horror genre. The continual use of Tchaikovsky's score, which is loud at times, electrifies the sequences, more towards the second half.<br/><br/>Black Swan is an awe-inspiring experience in short! 9.5/10"
"kgprophet","6","1","3","7 February 2012"," Hard to Recommend - Hard Not To.
","What can I say, I had a negative experience watching this story and couldn't wait for it to end. The critical mass has established that this film is a masterpiece. It would be fruitless for me to argue otherwise. The acting, especially Barbara Hershey, is believable. The editing is brisk. The direction is done well. It is the story, not even the subsequent screenplay, that feels uneven. The character arc is more a straight line than an arc.<br/><br/>The confusion the main character is going through leaves no grounding for the audience from the beginning to the end. This constant uncertainty and frustrating tension just made the story an unpleasant experience. Portman is shown constantly throwing up and crying. There was no escape for her or the audience throughout the 1 hour and 40 minutes of the world of professional ballet. Again, the movie features very little actual ballet, which could also disappoint cultural moviegoers who expect some artistic gratification. I actually found the scenes of repetitive practice realistic in comparison to my own life, spending years practicing piano. There was some insight to the behind the scenes world of professional ballet, but that also felt to be not enough to fill an entire screenplay.<br/><br/>I started to really lose it in the third act, where instead of watching a character study, I felt like I switched the channel and was watching a David Cronenberg film. Natalie Portman is literally turning into a black swan like Jeff Goldblum was literally turning into ""The Fly"". Then this drama about depression and living in stress tries to become a thriller or horror film, setting up your classic horror shocks with loud sound effects and creepy faces in shadows. Again, my complaint was - what I am as an audience member supposed to feel? The only moment of growth I felt, other than the obvious finale, is when Portman finally stands up to her overbearing mother, and even then we still can find sympathy for the Mother's devotion. Barbara Hershey was perfectly cast as the former ballerina mother with her own sordid past. Darren Aronofsky found the right balance of mania versus reality in the film's presentation, and kept me guessing to the end. However, in the end it saddened me to have such a depressing experience watching a well made film."
"kenjha","7","1","3","7 August 2011"," Not Bad but Clichéd
","A fragile dancer lands the lead role in ""Swan Lake,"" but struggles to meet the expectations of the ballet director. Portman received a well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of the unstable young woman who not only has to deal with a demanding and lecherous boss but also an oppressive mother. Unfortunately the film is full of clichés: the boss demanding sexual favors (Cassel), the has-been star (Ryder), the manipulative understudy (Kunis), the stage mother (Hershey). The depiction of Portman's psychological descent from White Swan to Black Swan is simplistic and some of the scenes are gratuitously graphic. The dance scenes are well done, helped by Tchaikovky's great score."

","Watching a movie after a thousand of positive reviews is something a little pointless, since your single opinion won't change the hype the film has. Fortunately, it wasn't the case; ""Black Swan"" is definitely a good movie that deserves to be seen and congratulated.<br/><br/>This movie works as a psychological thriller, which looks just like a nightmare. Natalie Portman plays an apparently innocent and unprotected girl who's afraid of everybody but improves after a while. There are lots of things involved in her disturbed life: fear, perfectionism, naivety, neurosis and even drugs come to her life. By the way, the disco scene was veeery well made, I felt myself in the party with them! Unfortunetaly, it has some predictable things, like when Nina tells the story to ""Jerry"" and she says that the girl kills herself in the end; I instantly realizes she was going to do the same in the end.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" may not deserve an Oscar for the best 2010 film, but is surely worth a watch!"
"tommmk","10","1","3","30 May 2011"," Going down in the third round
","WOW that ending is one for the books and that is why Natalie Portman won the Oscar for best actress. Darren Aronofsky consistently makes great films, but shows a real talent for the campy and the melodramatic, so I think Black Swan is one of his best, one that places it in the esteemed company of arty potboilers like Repulsion or Carrie or The Red Shoes. Also of note are performances by Barbara Hershey and Vincent Cassel, and top-notch screen writing, cinematography, editing, sound and music, art, sets, makeup and costumes. If I had to find a complaint about this movie, one of 2010's best, it would be to raise a pinky in protest over the apparent lack of a single gay male character anywhere, for although we are everywhere, including the world of ballet, we are just not in this particular hallucinatory psychodrama."

"dawn-clover","5","1","3","23 April 2011"," Disappointing
","After reading several reviews, watching the trailers and watching the IMDb rate go up like a flash, I was ready for some Mystery / Thriller action! Even if it involved ballet (nothing against it, just not my cup of tea).<br/><br/>The thing is, this movie has nothing of mystery in it, and just a teeny bit of thriller. It was disappointing to say the least - especially since I'm a huge fan of ""The Fountain"", ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" from Darren Aronofsky. Instead of a psychological mystery thriller that gets under your skin until the very end, we get a drama disguised as a psychological mystery thriller until the hugely disappointing ending, which is capable of destroying almost the whole experience. <br/><br/>Yes, I know the movie is categorized as a drama as well, but it was heavily promoted as a Mystery Thriller. The movie starts like any Mystery Thriller would - slow build up, weird stuff happens, viewer is left wondering what is going on, but unfortunately it ends almost ignoring all these cryptic scenes that make you think through the first two acts of the movie. What's left in the end is... almost what you have in the beginning, just a bit prettier.<br/><br/>In the visual department it was stunning to look at. The visual effects are top notch and the photography as well. The music fitted like a glove, it almost felt like we were watching an actual ballet act instead of the movie (and yes, I don't enjoy ballet, but props must be given here). <br/><br/>The actors also did an excellent job, Natalie Portman (Nina) portrayed her character brilliantly, and we could always see what she was feeling inside without her having to speak. Mila Kunis (Lily) was also a wonder to watch act, she did the complete opposite of Nina (as supposed) excellently.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a well acted, edited and scored movie that falls incredibly short in a department I was not expecting to be disappointed at (this coming from Darren Aronofsky and all): the plot.<br/><br/>I guess I got too hyped? Either way, I feel it was a mediocre film because it failed in one of the most important aspects of cinema.<br/><br/>4 out of 10."

","Overall, I found this movie to be incomparable. I was very upset that I wasn't able to see this film in theaters due to the exceptional reviews it got, but since I got the chance to see it at my home, I was surprisingly pleased by level of depth this movie was able to reach. <br/><br/>To me it was excellent on all levels. It had wonderful music, the screenplay was excellent, it was very dramatic and suspenseful at some points, and you were really able to get in touch with the characters. The performances were superb by each actor and they all filled the screen with such passion and emotion that you could really start to feel for them.<br/><br/>Aronofsky did a first-class job with this film and really got the audience to react. The only thing that really bothered me was the level of sexuality in this film. Sure some of it was necessary to thicken the plot, but i do feel they overdid some of it. Other than that, I thought that this film was truly magnificent in a disturbing yet beautiful way."
"gelman@attglobal.net","10","1","3","2 April 2011"," Portman Deserved the Oscar
","Say what you will about ""The Black Swan"" -- that it is difficult at times to distinguish what's supposed to be real from what's supposed to be imaginary, that the onset of self-destructive insanity makes the movie excessively unpleasant, that it offers a distorted portrait of ballet and ballet dancers -- but Natalie Portman swept the Oscar and other major acting awards for a reason: She is utterly compelling as Nina Sayers, the young ballerina chosen to play the Odette/Odile (White Swan/Black Swan) duo in a new version of ""Swan Lake,"" one of ballet's most familiar masterworks. It's said that Portman did most of her own dancing, an assertion I'm inclined to doubt because much of the footwork displayed on the screen is just that, footwork without a body attached. But that's unimportant. The central thesis of this movie is that the two swans display such opposite characteristics that it is necessary for the ballerina playing the dual roles to transform herself psychologically in order to succeed in both parts. Nina Sayers is pushed to and over the brink as she strives to meet the challenge. It's not entirely clear but she may, in fact, have killed herself in the process of achieving a triumphant embodiment of both Odette and Odile. While there are other performances in the film that might be worth noting, everything ultimately rests on the slender shoulders of Ms. Portman, and she bears the burden with extraordinary skill. We've been told that she damaged her feet in meeting this film's physical demands. One wonders how well she managed to deal with the psychological demands which must have been intense, even though she had read the script and knew that she, if not Nina, would survive intact."

","Im a regular guy, no psychotic tendencies or mental health issues, whoever wrote this however is a seriously twisted individual that should really seek help.<br/><br/>The film its self is so highly strung that virtually every scene makes you feel uneasy. Its not like a horror movie or a thriller ,they may be frightening but they have normal structure that keeps you grounded in the real world , well not this film. If i had to class it id have to say its a psychological snuff film, you feel like you're looking into the mind of an insane person (the writer). Its not my cup of tea, i gave it 4 for good acting.<br/><br/>It does beg the question if that is what the life of a ballet dancer is like with the whispering, name calling and the paranoia with everyone trying to stab you in the back why would anyone want to be a part of it?. And if its not what the hell is the writer trying to say? is the ballet part of it irrelevant and the story could as easily been about a waitress or business woman. Why not just skip it all and go film some real loonies at an asylum and save the millions of dollars."

","Before I even sat to watch the movie I was already biased against it, because I thought it was way too over-hyped and over-rated. Everywhere I went - I just heard the title of the movie. Such words as ""genius"", ""masterpiece"" and people going OTT praising the movie immediately put me off. And I thought that liking this movie was something that's in vogue now. And I hate jumping on the bandwagon. How wrong and stupid I was... <br/><br/>First of all I was stunned with Natalie Portman's performance. I've never seen an actress achieving such a variety of emotions in one movie - fear, despair, confidence, grace, etc. All the awards were well-deserved. I never took her seriously always thinking that Leon is the only movie worth-watching with her, as her other roles are pretty one-dimensional. By a clear mile - that's the best performance I've seen in many years. <br/><br/>The movie itself is a puzzle. And in the very end you finally find all the pieces that belong. Nina (Natalie Portman) is a highly restrained young girl. Her mother failed to be a great ballerina and wanted her daughter to become one. That's why she tried to protect her from the outer world. And Nina turned into a scared, fragile virgin. And her rival Lily (Mila Kunis) is somebody she subconsciously wanted to be. <br/><br/>Nina's haunted by hallucinations and persecution mania. She tries to let go of all her inner insecurities. And we see that she finally succeeds. But to do so - she had to literally kill the white swan in herself. <br/><br/>The ending of the movie is quite ambiguous. We don't really know if Nina died in her quest for perfection or that blood was a symbolic, metaphorical demonstration of her becoming a confident woman. So it's controversial. <br/><br/>Today I watched the movie for the third time. And every time it gets more clear, I recognize more details. And now I'm even more upset that it didn't get an Oscar. I mean - ""The King's Speech""? Really?"

Brilliant, Fantastic & Beautiful.<br/><br/>The plot is about a girl called Nina Sayers (played by Natalie Portman) has toiled for years within a New York ballet company, always pushing herself to be perfect. The company has fallen under hard times, and director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) makes the swift decision to put on a new rendition of the classic Swan Lake. With the company's go-to lead pushed into retirement, Nina is quickly selected to be the lead in the new ballet. With competition arriving in the form of new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina begins a journey into dark uncharted territory.<br/><br/>I thought this film was beautifully set out and I thought this film is totally original as the storyline is unique and something I have never read about.<br/><br/>Natalie who plays Nina gives a brilliant performance. She brilliantly played the character very well as she suffers the hallucations and bad things happen to her. As well as trying too hard to be perfect and you can feel that she was under the pressure by the director, Thomas (played by Vincent Cassel) and her mother Erica (played by Barbara Hershey). As well as being paranoid of Lily as she doesn't want her to take her role as Nina portrays the white swan whereas Lily portrays the black swan. <br/><br/>I would also describe Black Swan as seduction as the films portrays sexual tension as well.<br/><br/>I would congratulate Natalie Portman to get 'Best Actress' at the Oscars and the BAFTA's. I also thought that Black swan should have got more awards other than Best Actress. <br/><br/>Black Swan is the film that had me kept my eyes glued to the screen and I enjoyed it. <br/><br/>Black Swan gets a 9/10 from me. :)"
"Jona1988","8","1","3","8 March 2011"," What a performance!!
","I haven't seen any other film by Darren Aronofsky so maybe I didn't know exactly what to expect. Still my expectations were very high, having heard much praise for it. I was not the least disappointed but also very impressed.<br/><br/>If one thinks this is a movie about ballet well it's not. The story starts out with kind of straight forward events but it soon starts getting more and more deep and unpredictable. I'm soon at full focus, the film really grips one to attention. I feel I for a long time had little idea what twists the plot would take. What is impressive at the same time is that even tough is gets deeper I never lose any track of the ongoing story. There are some plot points that I feel I have seen done before but this is no problem. Totally original plots are long getting rare. Natalie Portman has been the subject of much of the praise for Black Swan and it's definitely not without reason because she is just great. At first she plays the kind of innocent girl like she often does and does well but as the story gets more scatter-brained her performance turns into her part of her life. But it's not just she who shines in Black Swan, they all make close to outstanding acting. Vincent Cassel is brilliantly disturbing interesting character. Barbara Hershey brilliantly creates the mother which the viewer feels both sentimental for and frustrated at. Mila Kunis I did not expect as much from but she is great and I feel actually competes with Portman for the spotlight here. The depth and focus of the story lies in the psychological aspects that are really tough and at times almost to the level of disturbing. The story is both gripping and smartly told, I feel one should and most likely wants to see this more that once. Might get hold of exactly how everything was and one might as well notice thing you didn't grasp at first. And then is the dialogue which is likewise well done. Both because the actors deliver it so well but it in itself is great, impressive writing. Black Swan is a great movie both on the inside and on the outside. The story brilliantly tries to mess with your head and the visual design and acting is a pleasure to watch. The music perfectly fits to give the right tone of the film. After the film was over I wanted to analyse it with others. The story is deep and interesting that one might even feel the need to kind of resolve how some things were. Sometimes I can get annoyed at movies that leave things to the viewers interpretation. At times the writer can seem lazy. Here this is not a bad thing as in here I feel this is the feeling Darren Aronofsky wants to give. The plot is exciting and maybe even provoking but never frustratingly so.<br/><br/>Black Swan is one of the best movies of 2010. A thrilling psychological thriller."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","3","7 March 2011"," Don't let Black swallow up White
","Tchaikovsky composed one of his most beautiful musics for that old tale in which a prince will come to free the white swan who is a princess but the prince will fall in love with the adventurous and enterprising black swan and that will cause the death, the suicide of the white swan. Charming Princes are no longer what they used to be: they want to choose their princesses. Princes have been liberated from simple predetermined stories, especially when there is an ugly black duckling in the flock.<br/><br/>The cruelty and the difficulty of the choreography is that the same dancer is supposed to be both the white and the black swans. Two styles, two genres, two universes that are so antagonistic and so mutually hostile, that it leads to a drama every night. If the dancer identifies with that impossible and schizophrenic situation it is more than a drama, it becomes a tragedy.<br/><br/>The genius of this film is to invest and embed the dancer in a personal situation that leads to death in a way or another. She is the daughter of a dancer who stopped dancing at the age of twenty-eight when she got pregnant, without a father and twenty-eight is old for a dancer. She never was anything but a member of the chorus line. She carries her daughter at arm's length into realizing the dream she has never been able to realize herself: to become the Swan Queen. She supports her, helps her, takes care of her in the most stifling way imaginable.<br/><br/>She thus stifles in her any kind of personal libido, love instinct. That makes the daughter awkwardly constantly scratch her shoulders. But when she starts embodying the Janus double-face Sawn Queen, the darkest impulses surge up and find their way out in a fantasy-driven nightmare. She explodes in unsatisfied or self-satisfied sexual impulses. She develops a strong hatred for her body-double, a body-double which is normal practice with ballet stars.<br/><br/>The worst is till to come because her mother who wanted her to be what she herself has not been able to be is also the one who wants to prevent her daughter to do what she has not herself done, hence to succeed better than her. This conflict between the mother and the daughter is also schizophrenic. The dancer can identify perfectly with the paranoid psychotic Swan Queen and live the fate of the white swan right to the bitter end of its death.<br/><br/>The music is the most beautiful music you will ever hear but do not get trapped by the poisonous syrup that flows from the notes. The candy is laced with ecstasy if you are lucky, more probably with arsenic if you are really lucky, because then you can evade this unbearable world. And that is a phenomenal liberation, to die when the audience in the house is frantically calling for you after the show.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

"jessicaselwood","6","1","3","22 February 2011"," Black Swan; The Beauty is within the Beast
","Black Swan (2010) immediately grabs us with the binary opposition of black vs. white: black swan vs. white swan. The theme of duality comes to mind not unlike the bestial references present in Stevenson's classic The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde But I would like to argue that the intense sexual references in Black Swan is somehow misplaced among this ""frigid"" white female. Natalie Portman is fantastic in her portrayal of not just the aspiring ballerina but of the white swan herself. As her instructor and borderline molester puts it; it is the black swan that she needs to discover; it is this role where she needs to learn to let go. But at what cost? Not unlike Robert Zemeckis' production of What Lies Beneath (2000) and Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), the theme of water is present throughout. It is the water which holds danger with connotations of the horror/thriller genres. Portman's protagonist, at one stage in the film, discovers an old wooden plank; of some descript, in order to lock herself in her mothers' bathroom. At 28 years of age, this girl still lives with her mother and, to a certain extent, enjoys her mothers' mollycoddling; seeing this is a sign of affection. As she starts to hallucinate, she swiftly locks her mothers love out. We can also extend this theme of 'coming of age' further; even though the character Nina Sayers perhaps is a bit of a late developer in this regard.<br/><br/>The theme of the single obsessive parent (Erica Sayers) used to practise ballet and due to no husband or partner in sight, she chooses to pour all her energy into her daughter. In doing so, she is preventing Nina from growing up and ultimately stopping the physical and physiological growth process. We can either blame, therefore, Nina's mother for her eerie hallucinations, which usually involves images of self-harm or harm to others, or her complicated friendship with her fellow ballerina Lily.<br/><br/>Lily represents youth revolt incarnate; she entices Nina to come out for a ""drink,"" the night before the show (much to Nina's mothers' disapproval). Nina happily escapes and ends up welcoming the recreational use of narcotics, heavy liqueur and fornication. The latter is portrayed as a deliberately anomaly as Nina remains unsure if she had a sexual encounter with Lily or an unnamed male from a local club.<br/><br/>One feels sympathy for Nina as she is taken advantage of not just by her instructor Thomas Leroy (exquisitely executed by actor Vincent Cassel) but by Lily as well. Many are drawn to her sexually and Nina responds uncertainly but regrettably reciprocates their advances out of both confusion and uniformity. It's almost as if the audience sees Nina's virginal innocence drain away as she starts to experiment in masturbation, homosexuality and oral sex. All the time the dominator is pushing her to perform just as Leroy is pushing her to perform on stage. He verbally assaults her to get results leaving Nina emotionally torn and upset.<br/><br/>It seems slightly odd that although Nina has been dancing at the ballet studio for the last ""four years,"" accordingly to her instructor, she has developed zero social bonds with the other ballerinas and constantly spends most of her time either reflecting in isolation or being taken advantage of by both male and female onlookers.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, Leroy both explains the basic narrative of the much loved ballet Swan Lake and picks out his favourites for his new show at the same time. It is a tale of love where the temptress, a black swan, steals the white swan's love and ultimately commits suicide. Portman's protagonist later explains to an interested, yet harmless, male admirer that this is beautiful tale of love. The director of Black Swan, Darren Aronofsky, takes the narrative of Swan Lake further, behind this theatre curtain of pain and deceit by exploring the idea that Nina carries out her own version of Swan Lake in her life. She will stop at nothing when exploring her infatuation with Leroy or through her role as the Swan Princess on stage. Whether Nina is causing harm to others or herself is left ambiguous by Aronofsky until his Shakespearean tragic finale.<br/><br/>Not unlike Shakespeare's Ophelia from Hamlet, Nina not only hallucinates, but like Lady Macbeth, starts to realise that her plan to reach the top has damaging psychological and physiological effects on both herself a and others. The director makes this unclear as to how much Nina's actions of violence are fact or fiction. For example, at the point of the explicit theatrical dual split between white and black swan Nina thinks she sees Lily in her dressing room and struggles with her on the floor. Symbolically, the mirror shatters and she attempts to stab Nina in several places with a shard of glass.<br/><br/>Unlike Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, Nina is exploring womanhood from an almost post-menstrual level whereas Alice is just discovering the responsibilities of female adulthood. Carroll draws us to the blood red roses in the Queen's garden as Aronofsky asks us to revisit Nina's body which is a temple under self-destruct without her conscious realisation until the end.<br/><br/>Like Brecht, Aronofsky wishes to marry the two art forms of film and theatre but we are left with a bitter aftertaste by questioning what is fiction and what is really reality in this stage of deception and duplicity?"

","I cannot even try to add to the plethora of posts critiquing this film. I can simply say the things which would have made this film great in my opinion.<br/><br/>I've seen a couple of people mention Mulholland drive and David Lynch. I only wish the director could have gone down this route a little more. There is a scene where she is training alone and the lights go off. She walks on stage into a shot which could have been taken directly from Mulholland drive, later she she goes backstage where two people are getting it on (imagined or not, I don't know). This scene worked very well. The director does not have the ability to pace and film a scene like Lynch, who can make a tension absoulute.<br/><br/>It does become a sort of cliché fest. Inevitably we have to follow and follow. No surprises with the conclusion of the film, I think most of us knew she was suffering from multiple personalities. Perhaps the director could think outside of the box, that he has already thought outside of.<br/><br/>All in all a pleasant unpleasant experience, but it did not rock my world or my foundations."
"Red-125","7","1","3","20 February 2011"," A Minority Opinion
","Black Swan (2010), directed by Darren Aronofsky, has an IMDb rank within the 100 highest-scoring films ever made. It's hard to argue with that kind of success, but I wasn't that impressed by the movie. <br/><br/>The plot itself is standard ballet fare--beautiful principal dancer, aging dancer being forced to retire, ""friend"" who is anything but, cruel but talented director, smothering mother who never got past the corps in her own career. What else is new?<br/><br/>The film alternates between reality and hallucination, and often we can't tell which we're seeing. Serious mental illness is treated as just another part of the tense, competitive ballet world. If you are actively hallucinating, you need medical help. Audience applause won't do it.<br/><br/>I think part of the film's critical success is based on Natalie Portman's beauty. The image of Portman in her Black Swan makeup--used for the movie's poster--has already become iconic. Portman is a fine actor. So are Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey. They're all good actors in a good movie. So, Black Swan is worth seeing. However, in my opinion, it shouldn't rank 61st in the list of the greatest movies of all time."
"mayurdeepz","9","1","3","20 February 2011"," A timeless & poignant thriller that is almost nonchalant in manner !!!
","After an incredibly inexplicable wait, ""Black Swan"" finally saw the light of the day here in Malaysian theaters and I could not have missed it for the world. As a religion, I queued up infront of the Box Office, where I represented the first patron of the day and the theater barely 1/3rd filled, made it to the first show on a Saturday morning. With the large portion of the next 2 hours spent at the awe of what I experienced, I could finally sum up the pieces of my blown out mind as I sit to write this piece.<br/><br/>3 specific names associated with the premise meant; it tagged along itself the rather heavyweight of all downers some like to call ""expectations"". French film giant Vincent Cassel, Natalie Portman and Darren Aaronofsky who most recently was celebrated for his violent yet heart breaking projection and Mickey Rourke's comeback vehicle ""The Wrestler"". Add to that 5 Oscar noms, 3 of which are for Best Leading Actress (Portman), Best Picture and Best Director and You have Yourself a list of sorts, that pretty much dictates to You why You should spend a well earned weekend morning inside the theaters.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a fairly straight forward story of a ballet dancer and her evolution into a foray She was particularly destined to fail at. Thus it brings along her struggle, fights within her boundaries, reasons and contradicting perspective of pretty much everything She was always led to believe. Throw in some exceptionally well written characters, in the form of her Mom (Baraba Hershey), Mentor (Cassel), Peer (Mila Kunis) and Predecessor (Winona Ryder) around the protagonist that helps her development and along with the eventual narration of the story. All support staff of the production and the one at the helm of all affairs should be given special mention for building a rare mood that aggravated the tension and only added to the crescendo of climax built with a rare but dedicated eye for soul. That for me managed to do what no feature film has been able to do in the past few months. I shed a tear at the climax for it was that epic height that one achieves, specially in creative spheres after weeks, months and years of inspired but relentless and mostly fruitless perseverance.<br/><br/>Quite fittingly the movie ends on a deafening sound of a hair raising round of applause by an auditorium filled with patrons who witnessed one of the finest renditions of the ""done to death"" opera ""Swan Lake"" because only they knew what they had experienced was both rare and timeless. Sadly the same cannot be said of the theater I watched the movie in, but as lights came on and credits rolled, I rose on my trembled feet and my heart swelled with the sense of fulfillment only a 35mm story can bring to me. And that's just how I would love to spend all my Saturday mornings for the rest of my life !!!<br/><br/>Highly Recommended"
"alvispotter-1","9","1","3","19 February 2011"," Natalie Portman's film but still an excellent film!
","It's undeniable for me this film wouldn't be half as special if it weren't for Natalie Porman, so i guess it's safe to say Natalie was the best part of the film. She did a stellar job that many actresses not only her age would dream of actually doing, and i'm just glad for her. I knew she had done serious roles before, but none was as stunning as this one, which just kept me heart-racing throughout the film. She impersonates both the white swan and the black swan tremendously perfect and it'd be outrageous if she doesn't win the academy award.<br/><br/>But the film would be good on its own. Darren Aronofsky's directing is top notch, and he know how to make his films interesting and good. The pacing is great, and some parts are as disturbing as they should be. The story, while nothing completely new (but what is this days?), was great and i just sat on the edge of my seat through every second of it, whether you knew that mainly it was all in Nina's head. I like the ambiguity of Darren to let you make your mind to what was real and what wasn't.<br/><br/>The other actors were good as well, especially Barbara (Nina's mom) being as protective as she is. Thomas was funny, and Mila Kunis did good for me, and she is really pretty.<br/><br/>The dancing was great and i love the swan's lake music, so all that was a plus. It was good to see that even though Natalie didn't dance the whole part, she definitely did perfect for the role and danced may bits. Oh, and i was scared from time to time... such as when Wynona Ryder ""stabs herself"" in the hospital, so my heart was racing.<br/><br/>Great film, but most of all, perfect performance Natalie!"
"stone_soup","9","1","3","16 February 2011"," Layered story, stunning ending
","I love the layers of meaning and the openness of the story that really gives the viewer much to think about at the end of the movie, as well as giving room for many different interpretations of what was real and what was not real.<br/><br/>The middle of the movie stumbled a bit as we slowly see some manifestations of the Black Swan, but the ending is stunning, not just by virtue of the great soundtrack, but Nina's dramatic transformation, which I will not elaborate on further.<br/><br/>I felt afraid of, afraid for, and sad for Nina by the end of the movie. The directing was not fantastic, but Darren Aronofsky's vision for this film is frightening and eye-opening. Natalie Portman has really exceeded and pushed herself in this film. Worth watching just for her acting."
"coconuts-r-cool","9","1","3","16 February 2011"," Brilliant screen-play, costume choices, acting, and themes. A very bold film. Extremely powerful.
","It's the type of film that is extremely big and loud. Not in the literal sense, but it's mind-blowing and it could easily steal the spotlight from subtler films, which isn't necessarily good all the time... The screenplay was AWESOME right from the start, and the opening was so strong! It got you hooked instantly. It wasn't a ballet film, and it wasn't poncey or pretentious, but it was about ballet and it had a theme of ballet that was completely consistent throughout. The casting was great, and they introduced the character of the mother perfectly. You could instantly tell so much about her simply from the costume choice, the dialogue and the way she interacted with Nina (daughter). All of the characters' basic personalities were established amazingly within a single scene. <br/><br/>The costume choice was exquisite, right from the beginning you could pick out people's characters from their costume choice, and I think that really helped to develop the exploration of contrasts that are a running theme throughout the film. (For example contrast between the good Nina and the bad aspects that she is channelling out in a psychotic way.)<br/><br/>Most people would of approached a film like this by saying 'This is gonna be a beast to make.' (meaning very difficult) but I think the producers or Black Swan used all of those difficulties to their advantage. And the continuous metaphor was brilliant. It put you in Nina's shoes very effectively because of the confusion, but not ambiguity. Most films that try to do that end up being ambiguous and annoying. This wasn't.<br/><br/>I thought their mix of modern themes and very traditional ballet worked like a duet; each style complimenting the other. There was a night- club/drugs scene that was done very well with strobe lighting and confusing elements, and it contrasted incredibly with the more balletic/traditional styles. <br/><br/>The ending was kinda ironic and that really added a subtlety to it. And it wasn't dragged out, the ending reflected Nina's ending, which was 'Perfect.' and it also ended similarly to the story of Swan Lake being performed in the film. <br/><br/>All in all it was a very bold and very powerful film, full of raw emotion and deep metaphors with strong senses of theme. It was beautiful and you could really tell that the creators of Black Swan were really passionate about film making."

"alanyuu","9","1","3","13 February 2011"," Natalie Portman, light and dark, black and white swan
","The art world is a challenge. The overall scenery put on for this particular film, the theme is too strong for the lighthearted. <br/><br/>At the beginning you get the impression that Nina will probably be second to another dancer. This changes when she puts the director of the ballet in is place. And suddenly, she's the top dancer with all that implies. <br/><br/>This proves completely that personalities have dark and light sides. The first act is a disaster and this proves now to a challenge. In a battle of positive and negative, in a show of light and dark, you get involved. And for the final performance, you get the impression that someone dies, but then the ballet dancer kills her dark side and ends apparently bleeding perfection. <br/><br/>Strongly recommend this film, if you want to leave the theatre with awe and disbelief."

"Buddy-51","9","1","3","13 February 2011"," Artful variant on Jekyll and Hyde
","A bizarre combination of art-house drama and psycho-sexual thriller, Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" is really an allegorical account of a young woman's descent into madness. It's also a variant of sorts on ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" exploring the evil twin that lurks deep inside each and every one of us. <br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman) is a sheltered, intensely disciplined and sexually repressed ballerina who's just landed the role of a lifetime – that of the Swan Queen in a major New York ballet company production of ""Swan Lake."" Yet, while her innocence and formal perfectionism make her a natural for the part of the White Swan, she may lack the fiery, hot-blooded temperament and life experiences needed to convincingly portray the Black Swan. Or so the company director (Vincent Cassell) tells her, a man with an obvious interest in Nina beyond the purely professional. But Nina clearly has more pressing issues to deal with than just a lecherous dance instructor and a mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer herself, who clearly wants to control every aspect of her daughter's life. Nina seems to be losing her grip on reality, as she begins to hear muffled voices, starts bleeding mysteriously from various parts of her body, and appears to be two different people when peering into a mirror. In fact, the idea of dopplegangers becomes a major visual motif throughout the film – reflective of the White Swan/Black Swan, Jekyll and Hyde, Good vs. Evil dichotomy - with one minor character even at one point assuming that Nina and a fellow ballerina are sisters because they look so much alike - as most ballerinas, almost by definition, have a tendency to do. Subtly at first, then with greater intensity as the story progresses, Nina begins to reflect a person deep in the throes of a nervous breakdown. <br/><br/>With a screenplay by Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin and Andres Heinz, based on a story by Heinz, ""Black Swan"" borrows quite liberally from earlier movies. There's a touch of ""All About Eve"" in its tale of an up-and-coming newcomer (Mila Kunis) seemingly intent on usurping Nina's lead in the production; there's a hint of ""Carrie"" in the dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship; and the whole young-woman-slipping-into-madness scenario is eerily reminiscent of Roman Polanski's film ""Repulsion"" from 1965. That being said, Aronofsky brings a great deal of his own to this work, keeping the horror movie hokum down to a minimum (though some does creep in from time to time) and effectively plunging us into a dizzying alternate reality in the bravura, brilliantly shot and edited scenes towards the end of the film. In fact, the closing stretches of the movie represent cinema in its purest form, as the pacing builds to a frenetic crescendo, perfectly reflective of Nina's mental state at the moment. Nina ultimately finds it in herself to truly become the Black Swan, but at what cost to herself and those around her? <br/><br/>The movie is obviously intended as a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and of avoiding life, and about the way in which single-mindedness when carried to the extreme can lead to psychological damage and even insanity for the individual involved. And who is more single-minded, disciplined and obsessed than a prima ballerina? <br/><br/>To say that Portman delivers a tour-de-force performance in this role would be to minimize her accomplishment; she throws herself so deeply into the character that it's hard to decide which is more impressive: the sheer overwhelming physicality of it all or the wrenching emotional conviction. This is clearly her movie, and she has given her whole heart and soul to it. Kunis is equally impressive in the Eve Harrington role of the far more easygoing, but clearly manipulative soubrette whom Nina is convinced wants to take her place in the show. And Hershey brings a compelling mixture of jealousy and concern to the role of a mother who's been where her daughter is now but whose influence over her seems to be waning over time. <br/><br/>Like Nina, we like to show only the White Swan aspect of our personalities to the world at large, choosing to hide – whether consciously or unconsciously – the Black Swan side from public view. Yet, as Nina soon discovers, the Black Swan will at some point insist on having its day, perhaps going so far as to kill off the White Swan in an effort to assert its preeminence. <br/><br/>Freud would have had a field day with this movie."

","i think the movie is a vicarious piece of art, mixed with obsessive madness, masochism, sexual abandon, neurotic melodrama and downright harrowing reality, very out of the box, it had u thinking and cringing. Its one of those 'literature book' movies. Natalie Portman is as usual unrelentingly superb! I think its a jolting journey into the mind body and soul of a person who's a perfectionist or who has to perfect in sumtin...an obsessive tyrannical world. It speaks millions of the dangerous neurotic lines people straddle in trying to be like others and lamentably, of also being ourselves. It hits home on the issues of having a very dark side, the side some of us prefer to be in denial about, the side that really wants to meet us face to face, how much we push it away and how much it longs to devour us, unwaveringly sucking us into its own world. No matter how much scruples we have, given the wrong or right situation we fall from grace. I liked it very much! I liked how her own life in the movie mirrored the protagonist of 'Swan Lake' and it tells a lot of how we become what we think and act. I liked how very real the movie could be!...for some people the ballet aspect of the movie might be a turnoff lol but it (the movie) is much more beyond that surface....there's so much to be said about it"
"DICK STEEL","8","1","3","5 February 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Black Swan
","It's clearly no surprise about the full house in today's sneak preview of Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan, given the buzz built from lead actress Natalie Portman's win at the Golden Globes, and various other Oscar nominations now surrounding it, including an outside chance of winning Best Picture come end of the month. And as if the slow mutilation of Portman's Nina isn't enough to chip away at her good girl persona and character, you can just about trust our local censors for wanting to get a piece of the action as well through exercising its scissors to mutilate the film in a critical scene between Mila Kunis and Portman when the latter ultimately experienced the crescendo of her letting go.<br/><br/>I think many in my generation and older have seen how Natalie Portman has grown up in cinema, from her unforgettable introduction into the silver screen through Luc Besson's Leon the Professional, to the more adult role now offered by Darren Aronofsky to push her boundaries, and in a case of life imitating art and vice versa, it's somehow surreal that it's precisely the same boundaries that Portman's character Nina the ballerina has to break through in order to own her role as the Swan Queen in Swan Lake. It's also deals with the perils of getting too absorbed into a role to the point of obsession, having that line that separates reality and fantasy get really blurred, to the detriment of the self-absorbed thespian, and here we observe Nina's horrific metamorphosis from all things good to a mean, and psychotic even, streak.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of the film is how layered Andre Heinz's story is, taking place on many planes and even running parallel to that in real life with Natalie Portman taking on an adult role, and of course that between her character Nina and the Swan Queen in Swan Lake. Like the latter, Nina becomes a little bit paranoid that her lucky run may just get derailed by the introduction of another talented dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), who has that extra X-factor to outshine her, and similar to the taking away of the Prince of her dreams, would actually get an outside chance to steal her dream leading role from right under her nose, something that she (and any other ballerina in a troupe) would covert through all means possible.<br/><br/>You can just about see how this film is like a companion piece to Aronofsky's The Wrestler, with both taking place in niche entertainment circles that call for being at the physical peak, as well as countless of hours in training just to be able to entertain an audience, gain fans, admirers and followers, and wow when the lights come on in the ring or stage. Character wise, they're of the opposite ends, with one being at the twilight of one's career, and the other given a window of opportunity to shine.<br/><br/>But back to Natalie Portman, her performance here is nothing less than magnificent, and like many other actors before her, she too her undergone some physical transformation to be that zero fat ballerina with impeccable graces, doing a great job in bringing forth her character's constant obsession with perfection, pummeling herself in training if she's not meeting her own incredible standards. We witness her transformation from innocence to rebellious in that quest to, as advised, transcend what she already is, into something she isn't and overcoming her inhibitions, thereby adding a surprising wow factor in her performance. It is this transformation all within the film, that will make one sit up and take notice as she tussles from nice, to bad, to somewhere in between.<br/><br/>Like its fellow Oscar contender The Fighter, Black Swan also boasts wonderful performances from its supporting cast. Mila Kunis as Lily was great as the competition who always seem to be inching closer and closer as a bona fide replacement should Nina finally get pushed over the edge, and provides constant fodder for Nina to always look over her shoulder. Vincent Cassell also always look comfortable playing slimy roles, and as the artistic director of the ballet company that's seeking new funding through a new production with a promising new lead, makes enough moves on Nina that you can on one hand feel he's taking advantage of the ingénue, yet on the other hand knows just all the right buttons to push to get a performance of a lifetime from his ballerinas. Winona Ryder has a small role here as the discarded ballerina has-been, and Barbara Hershey shines as the protective mom of Nina's who's constant fussing over her daughter and her prospective successes which becomes a confirmed recipe for exploding past the stifling environment she provides Nina with.<br/><br/>I was also looking forward to listening to Clint Mansell's score in this film since he has so far scored most, if not all, of Aronofsky's films, but somehow it got drowned out. Be warned though that not only is this film an effective psychological thriller with plenty of reflective surfaces in almost all the scenes to peel into the inner world of Nina and her inevitable change, but it is also as effective somehow as a horror film toward the latter half with its frightening scenes, employing some of the usual bag of tricks in raking up the good old fashion scares to a successful degree. Definitely highly recommended, although I will advice to seek out a more complete film elsewhere rather than to head to the cinemas for a disrespectful, mutilated cut."

","I have marvelous time to watch Black Swan movie. Couple of thing's maid this movie extraordinary experience to me.

This is her best movie till now , I never seen in Natalie such a talent actor until this movie. I know for sure she will take the Oscar else I don't know who deserve more from her to win the Oscar. Second Tchaikovsky music is so wonderful , it's complete the movie and left me with a shiver in my body . Third , this movie it's not another Hollywood craps , it's an art in all aspect's <br/><br/>Thank you."

","Amazing, amazing, amazing!! Yes, I'm sure you've heard already that its pretty amazing. Definitely one to slot in there with the top greatest. Unless you're one of those people who really loves dumb-ass ballet films with no meaning to it then GO SEE IT!! Oh yeah, it's NOT a film about ballet, that of course plays a part in it but it simply acts as a small thread interwoven within Nina's (Natilie Portman) desperate struggle with reality. It's one of those films that really takes you on a journey but it doesn't simply take you gently by the hand, it violently clutches you by the face and drags you in... in a good way.<br/><br/>It was a very uncomfortable and unnerving film that set up a great, alluring atmosphere, it on many occasions left you thinking. did that actually happen?! If it didn't then how did that happen?!?! If it did then how did... AHHHHH!!!! This got you very much thinking just like the main character (Nina) and this created a great connection that allowed you to feel very much involved. Very deserving of any awards possible and a definite must see. The only criticism is maybe Natalie should try a more contrasting role, I mean, first Leon, a crazy little girl who repeatedly tries to seduce a 50ish old man. Closer, a desperate, young stripper or Star Wars, Anakin's bitch! And now this!! Of course I'm joking, shes great! All in all another great film from Darren Aronofsky's powerful arsenal. GO SEE IT!!!"
"Ar_Pharazon_the_golden","7","1","3","2 February 2011"," a film by Daroman Polanovski
","I thought Black Swan is a very good film. Not as good as most people say, but very good. Barely a surprise though, since it was already a very good film 45 years ago when Roman Polanski shot it and called it ""Repulsion"". Personally, I though it reminded way too much of this (and a few other) Polanski film(s). Lonely, kind of obsessive, superbly beautiful girl that's reluctant, almost afraid, of relationships, descends into madness. <br/><br/>-(minor) spoiler ahead- <br/><br/>Yeah. Seen it before. And let's be honest, Aronovsky is no Polanski, at least when it comes to the psychological thriller part. After a point, everything is, or could be, a delusion, which is kind of irritating because you are only left with assumptions of what actually happens. You know what you see is Nina's paranoid view of things, but it's so overwhelming that you're left wondering about almost every scene, which is a bit too much.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is, in the end, on par with some of the best films of its kind, but that's mostly thanks to Natalie Portman's (even more) fabulous (than usual) presence...and a lesbian scene between her and the also wonderful Mila Kunis. If anything, all the actors did very well."
"Alexxx23","9","1","3","29 January 2011"," Is this movie awesome or is it just plain horrible? A bit of both, because it's just plain awesome!
","How does one follow up to the critically acclaimed and wonderful film that is known as 'The Wrestler'? Qutie simple really, one just presents Black Swan.<br/><br/>When Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) finally wins the starring part of Swan Queen in the ballet spectacle of Swan Lake, nothing could be better. HA! Not a chance when director Darren Aronofsky is in charge of the center stage production. As accustomed, Aranofsky manages to bring the beautiful elegancy of ballet and cleverly change it into a psychological thriller where Nina's dream turns into the most real of nightmares while we watch her desperate struggle to overcome it.<br/><br/>Black Swan is clearly one of the best films of 2010 and Natalie Portman's performance is surely worthy of the Oscar. On the surface, this movie may seem like just a movie about ballet, but to all the men out there with this mindset, I just say it really isn't.(there is quite a 'naughty' scene involving two females) <br/><br/>Aronofsky has once again shown his brilliance in Black Swan."
"stephisthekingpin","9","1","3","29 January 2011"," Excruciating, Intoxicating, Superb!
","Excruciating, Intoxicating, Superb! Many people are somewhat familiar with Tchaikovsky's classic play Swan Lake the tale of a princess turned into a swan, who is deceived & chooses to make the ultimate sacrifice for love. Screenwriters Mark Heyman, Andrew Heinz and John McLaughlin have taken many elements of the classic tale and transformed them with violence, sexuality, intensity or as one Alex DeLarge in Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" would put it Ultra Violence! <br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman)is a New York city ballerina who's life is completely consumed with her profession. When company director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) announces that a fresh production of Swan Lake is the upcoming project & that he is casting a new leading ballerina in the title role replacing long-time princess of the stage Beth (Winona Ryder), Nina jumps at the opportunity to receive the honor. Constantly trying to impress her director & an overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey), Nina is fragile who need only a push to completely fall apart.<br/><br/>Thomas assures Nina that she is perfect for the role of the White Swan, which represents innocence & grace but the lead dancer is also required to portray the evil Black Swan, representing sensuality. Nina has a competitor, a new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) who is everything Nina is not, a personification of the Black Swan it seems, and bears a striking resemblance to Nina.<br/><br/>The two young dancer's expand their rivalry which fuels a twisted friendship. With a growing paranoia on Nina's conscience she begins to believe Lily is out to get her. Encouraged into the idea that for her to successfully become the Black Swan on stage she must lose herself in her performance, Nina's mind take's this into her reality. The idea becomes a virus attacking Nina causing her to hallucinate, it becomes near impossible to differentiate reality from her living nightmare.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman has delivered the performance of her career, brilliance doesn't quite do the justice it deserves. There isn't a doubt in my mind that Natalie hasn't earned herself her first Academy Award win with this breathtaking performance. The supporting cast Kunis, Cassel, Hershey, Ryder make the most of every second on screen and have flawlessly given the audience fresh characters to admire.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler) is one of the most consistent directors of our time. Unlike any other director in Hollywood, Aronofsky is able to make any working material excruciating to watch, the Ballet in this feature would seem like a blood sport more damaging to the body than professional wrestling. Each Aronofsky film seems to surpass one another, receiving 5 Academy Award Nominations including Best Picture, Director & Actress in a leading role.<br/><br/>This psychological thriller is an instant contemporary classic, one that will be talked about for years to come. The ending is truly exhilarating & poetic, those who loved Fight Club & Amadeus will adore BLACK SWAN."
"ajs-10","9","1","3","28 January 2011"," Liked it even more on the second viewing!...
","I first saw this film at the cinema back in January and I was so impressed with it I decided to give it another viewing when it appeared in the TV schedules recently. I'm really glad I did as I enjoyed it even more second time around! I'll give you my (revised) of my thoughts after this brief summary.<br/><br/>Young ballerina Nina Sayers has been chosen to play the lead in Swan Lake. The production's director, Thomas Leroy, has chosen her because she can play the white Swan perfectly, but he wants her to show more passion when she dances the part of the Black Swan. As she strives to achieve this level of performance we witness quite a dramatic change in her that totally alters her personality. She also has to contend with a rival dancer, Lily, who Thomas has put as her alternate (I guess the equivalent of an understudy in a play). Add to this the decline of Beth Macintyre, an experienced dancer that Nina admired and the attentions of her overbearing mother, Erica, and you can see she has a lot to contend with. I'll leave my brief summary there or the Spoiler Police will be after me with a crossbow again.<br/><br/>There is much to admire in this film, Darren Aronofsky certainly knows how to get a performance out of his cast. He also knows how to tell a story, I couldn't fault the filmmaking; it's great to look at, all topped off with a great performance from Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers. Also worthy of note are; Mila Kunis as Lily, Vincent Cassel as Thomas Leroy, Barbara Hershey as Erica Sayers and Winona Ryder as Beth Macintyre.<br/><br/>I very much like the use of music through this film; the iconic themes from Swan Lake are throughout and only add to the enjoyment of the piece. I love the way the line is blurred between reality and the dark place Nina is trying to find inside herself. Aronofsky has a very interesting filming style; you are in there with the dancers as they perform and that makes it even more exciting particularly at the end! In fact, you literally 'follow' the character, Nina, all the way through the film. It's a brilliant film with some great performances; well worth a second (or even first) look if you get the chance and one I highly recommend.<br/><br/>My score: 8.7/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 192,436 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 87/100 (based on 261 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 86/100 (based on 116,116 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."

","""Black Swan"" strikes deep and hard...<br/><br/>I want to keep this short, in order not to spoil the movie for you :) This movie is a deep surrealistic trip into the abyss of the human soul and in fact is the adaption of Tchaikovskys extraordinary and infamous ""Swan Lake"" ported into our time. Aronofsky presents a fairy-tale about passion, hate, love, fear and emancipation adapted to strike all of your senses. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman delivers a very authentic performance, you can almost smell the sweat in the dancing scenes. Aronofsky puts you in the middle of the happening and lets you percept the world through Nina's eyes and it's a hell of a trip :)<br/><br/>So my friends, don't miss this one, it's a true piece of art ..."
"jah718","8","1","3","27 January 2011"," A intense, infuriating masterpiece
","I just got back from the cinema and I felt compelled to write a review of Black Swan. I researched it extensively before going and I found an array of different reviews and it seemed that nobody was quite sure what to make of it. So, I went to see it with mixed expectations, not really sure what it was about and whether I would like a Film about a Ballet. Right from the get go, I was in no doubt that this was an Aronofsky film as it is exceptionally dark and menacing.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman was outstanding, I would certainly say a career best. I could see all through the Film the dedication and commitment that she gave to play this role. She really captures the brooding intensity and paranoia that this role required. Cassel is the character that you expect him to be and I think he was perfect for the role. Mila Kunis was good, however, I felt that she had limited screen time and as such I can understand her being overlooked for Awards.<br/><br/>This Film is definitely not for everyone, If you are looking for a ballerina film or a mindless 2 hours then stay away as you will not enjoy this. This film is dark, brooding, often infuriating and quite scary. It is a trip into the dark mind of a Woman who so desperately wants to be perfect.<br/><br/>I felt that at times the Film didn't know what it wanted to be, it delved into the genres of drama, thriller and downright horror. It felt like the director didn't want to dwell on the ballerina aspect and as such appeal to a greater audience. <br/><br/>However, all this aside, I would recommend this Film as it is visually breathtaking, an emotional masterpiece and a thrill ride into the subconscious with the audience never really sure whats real and whats not."
"I_Bystander","8","1","3","27 January 2011"," Black Swan
","Saw Black Swan last night— Compelling with terrific performances from the entire cast. I do, however, have one criticism...<br/><br/>I was hoping that the over-use of extreme close-up in the early stages of the film was an artistic expression of the narrow horizons of Nina's world and that the picture would open up as new experiences befell her, leading to a wide vista of her stage performance in Swan Lake for the finale. However...<br/><br/>The extreme close-ups persisted throughout the movie, leading me to suspect that far from being an artistic decision this approach had been adopted in order to mask the fact that Natalie Portman can't dance as well as the narrative requires us to believe her character can.<br/><br/>I found this over-use of close-up obtrusive and, if I'm honest, I think it made the film feel like an overblown TV movie; there was just something very un-cinematic about the whole experience.<br/><br/>That said, I return to my initial comment: compelling with terrific performances. I just think that this one might run as well (if not better) on a small screen. Oscar material it ain't, IMHO which I now cast into the mire of other web-based HOs for your perusal and consideration."
"imagiking","7","1","3","26 January 2011"," Black Swan: Interesting and Intelligent
","Hailed by many as a modern art masterpiece, nominated for awards aplenty, and benefiting from a series of rather beautiful posters, Black Swan was the first of the current Oscar bait pieces I was reeled in by.<br/><br/>An aspiring ballet dancer since her childhood, Nina Sayers is eager to be chosen for the lead role in her company's presentation of Swan Lake. The demanding role requires her to perform as both the white and black swans, the latter of which she is less well equipped to do. The competition from fellow dancer Lily, the restrictions of her overprotective mother, and strange marks on her back are just some of the oddities that begin to plague Nina as she trains.<br/><br/>The film begins, as it quite appropriately ought to, with a ballet sequence, the first of many. Perhaps ignorantly, I was slightly fearful of being overrun by an excess of such scenes, my general cynicism toward dance and the like making itself known in the back of my head. Such fears were, and are, entirely unwarranted. In its opening scene, Black Swan demonstrates beautifully the complex combination of cinematography, choreography, and performance which combine so well to create scenes of near dazzling effulgence even to the most hardened of sceptics. The first of these is also the most appealing, its grandeur revealed quickly to be a dream of our protagonist. Nina is portrayed wonderfully by Portman, the quiet fragility she brings to the character eliciting sympathy every step of the way, her apologetic passivity difficult not to sympathise with. Cassel too gives a fine performance, his sexually suspect instructor suitably imposing and creepy. Despite their mutual proficiency, these performances are both towered over by Hershey in her maternal role, one of the film's very strongest facets. Strong too is Aronofsky's use of mise-en-scène, the placement of mirrors throughout the film and the stark contrast between black and white which pervades its every scene working well with the general idea of duality which the film examines. This is, however, a little overstated by the end, the constancy of the monochrome and mirror effect becoming eventually an irritant through overuse. Subtlety seems an alien concept to the film, tarnishing slightly its otherwise wonderful art direction. Nevertheless, the film tackles its primary theme well, utilising the aforementioned visual cues to reinforce the narrative itself. Of the narrative, a quick complaint must be made. After an approximate eighty minutes of slow, contemplative, atmospheric building of tension and suspense, Aronofsky turns it all up to eleven and throws everything at us. Though it does little to detract from the overall effect of the film, it feels very sudden and tonally different from what came before, quite probably deliberately but unfortunately rather amusingly—not a feeling it should evoke.<br/><br/>Though its interesting and intelligent art direction is somewhat marred by its blatancy, Black Swan is a visually interesting piece, communicating certain ideas via its lighting and mise-en-scène ever before doing so via its narrative. Not as strong as it potentially could have been, and delving less deep into its central theme than perhaps it should, one wonders to what extra-narrative end, if any, the film has been envisioned. Though far too accelerated in its finale's insanity, the film is an entertaining work, visually appealing, and populated with interesting, well-articulated characters."
"Jules45","8","1","3","26 January 2011"," Billy Elliot eat your heart out.
","Signature of Afronofsky is his sublime yet controversial camera condensation of total self sacrifice in another masterful, more horror orientated sporting output. Settling on the other end of The Wrestler's steroid pumping, muscle bulging, manly man's movie is the delicate, tender perfectionist Nina; who through a series psychological and wince worthy moments drowns in the less angelic, antonym of her former self. Ambivalence really doesn't get better than this.<br/><br/>The gruelling consummation process of her ordeal is much like Afronofsky's technique. Buy into it and you'll have joined the elemental delight his devotee's bask in, or else it's a sink or swim experience that only leads one other way. Tragically it can still feel something of an experiment to his most assertive fans, when its tendency to become carried away with the visual metaphor feels like a flawed burden in contrast to the head scratchers that dominate and support the majority of the film.<br/><br/>Not acrimonious enough to contend as an equivalent to the malevolent bitterness of Nina's predecessor Beth (a vicious comeback for Winona) but gathers frustration in the boycotting of narrowly missed perfection. What is, without a nail splitting pirouette of a doubt, isn't Natalie Portman's circumventing of a sickly sweet scarlet ballerina image (undeniably helpful though) but the gradual shattering of her once pure demeanour to raw, savage precision, devoid of imperfect acting.<br/><br/>She fits into the rare category of actually being born to play a role, uproar hopefully would persist a minimal Oscar nomination if that is what would subsist, because frankly had she faulted just one scene the entire film could have swan dived its way out of brilliance. A film of the year, no. A performance of the year, you can bet your tutu."

","I've always harboured a resentment towards ballet. After all, what kind of 'art' forces a person to starve herself, cause severe damage to her health and when she's reached a certain age (usually 30), chuck her out because she's not wanted. A few years ago, Aronofsky took us to the dark and difficult world of wrestling. Now he takes us to the depressing painful world of ballet. However, 'Black Swan' is by no means another 'The Wrestler'.<br/><br/>In a way, like his first three films 'Black Swan' is sort of a mindf*** to an extent as the darkness of Nina's paranoia unfolds as she spirals towards paranoia. Yet, the director also gives behind the stage glimpses of ballet, stressing on the struggle of this so-called art.<br/><br/>Nina's dream comes true when she finally gets the lead role in 'Swan Lake'. Raised by an over-protective mother who has ensured that her daughter becomes a top ballet dancer, Nina makes her mother proud. Yet she is haunted by visions and constantly scratches herself in her sleep. The main challenge for her is playing Odile the Black Swan. As she struggles to own up to the part, her insanity gradually begins to take more severe tolls to the extent that the line between reality and insanity seizes to exist.<br/><br/>Lighting is kept to a minimum which supports the dark theme and works atmospherically. The score is also kept to a minimum and that, with excellent sound effects, works very well. The cinematography, especially the hand-held camera-work, adds to the claustrophobic atmosphere.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman delivers a wonderful performance. It is her best work after 'Garden State'. She captures most of the nuances of Nina's torment and ambition. Barbara Hershey, Mila Kunis, Winona Ryder (effective in her few scenes) and Vincent Cassel are superb. It's good to see Hershey after a long time.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has not only tapped the world of ballet, he's taken us through and involved us in another mind twirl cinematic experience."
"rooee","7","1","3","26 January 2011"," Monstrous elegance
","In typical genre-jumbling style, Darren Aronofsky's fifth feature contains elements of sports drama, horror and operatic romance. The result is a fraught, frightening film about the pursuit of perfection; one that does not concern itself with the experience of watching ballet, but rather the various forms of violence that go into preparing for and performing it.<br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman) is chosen by Thomas (Vincent Cassel) to be the Black and White Swans in his re-imagining of Swan Lake. She effortlessly embodies the elegance and fragility of the former role, but can she delve into her dark side, and nail the latter? The arrival of Lily (Mila Kunis), all sensuality and laissez-faire, not to mention a whole bunch of talent, triggers a vicious rivalry and sets Nina's inner runaway train down the tracks.<br/><br/>A lesser film may have focused on the suggestion that the whole dreadful rivalry may be some twisted training device masterminded by the ""genius"", Thomas. But Aronofsky wisely focuses on the most interesting characters - not Nina and Lily, but Nina and Nina. The fact that Nina is evidently unhinged from the first frame lends the film a slightly monotone quality. But it's far, far from predictable.<br/><br/>That the pursuit presents a path to derangement will not come as a surprise to fans of the director's debut, Pi, while fans of Requiem for a Dream will find the escalating, claustrophobic chaos of the later scenes familiar. Aronofsky seems most at home when he's commanding an anarchic narrative through a warped aesthetic. This probably explains why his most grounded film, The Wrestler, which most closely resembles the real world - as opposed to the world as seen through his protagonist's eyes - feels the least his own.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a deserved Oscar contender (if you believe in that sort of thing) and the work of a consistently impressive auteur."
"98nurdinm-1","8","1","3","25 January 2011"," Black Swan
","Nina (Natalie Portman) has been given her big chance at long last: she has been cast to play the Swan Queen in a new production of ""Swan Lake"". But already pressure is building: her mother (Barbara Hershey) is trying to control her, a new dancer (Mila Kunis) could be trying to steal her role, and her director (Vincent Cassel) doesn't believe the darker side of her role, the Black Swan to her White...<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is ridiculous, insane and brilliant. It is a return to the brilliant form of director Darren Aronofsky's epic ""The Fountain"" - a stunning blend of art, psychology and classic film genres, all of which add up to a uniquely stunning film.<br/><br/>That being said, it starts off slowly - very slowly. The titles echoing the most obvious reference, ""The Red Shoes"", before we start to explore the story of Nina. But this gradual build up works eventually; the tension rises and rises, picking up pace as the film progresses, until the last 45 minutes when, literally, all hell breaks loose, and you are at a loss as to what you are watching is really happening or not.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is amazing - never away from the camera, her character and the breakdown she suffers captivates the storyline and holds you tight in its grasp. Her performance will surely go down as one of the greatest of her career, defining her as an actress of her own rights, removing her from your memory of her in the sad, wooden Star Wars prequels. It is often incredibly difficult to tell whether or not it is her dancing or a body double.<br/><br/>The ballet scenes are shot wonderfully; though this is certainly a film that is not just about ballet, it still plays a pivotal role, aided by the brilliant, memorable soundtrack of Tchaikovsky's work, and adding real depth to the story and to the characters, as they echo the core themes of the ballet itself: desire, deception, death.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect, sadly; the script is most certainly full of clichés, resembling a high-budget erotic thriller at times more linked with something like ""Basic Instinct"". Cassell's character in particular is a tried and tested formula of the teacher who lusts after his own students. There is a nice cameo appearance from Winona Ryder as a faded star, and one feels that more could have been made out of her character. Kunis is almost in danger of becoming a very 2D bad girl, but the script saves her as it sweeps the rug from under the audience's feet in a bizarre set of twists.<br/><br/>There are jumps a plenty, a few quite bloody scenes and, of course, the much talked about lesbian scene, which really isn't at all what it says it is on the tin. Be warned - this is not just a film about ballet. Ultimately, this is a film about obsession and madness, a companion piece to Aronofsky's last work, ""The Wrestler"" - where that was about a tried old man, this is about a scared young girl.<br/><br/>Utterly compelling once it gets properly started, this film will, like all of Aronofsky's work, divide everyone who goes to see it. Brilliant.<br/><br/>8/10"
"qdbkye","6","1","3","25 January 2011"," Average film carried by a good actress
","I didn't know what to expect going into Black Swan, which is always the best way to view a new film. From the opening scenes, I was expecting an emotional, paranoid thriller. In reality, it was more of a mediocre cross between Jacob's Ladder and The Red Shoes. <br/><br/>The film tries so hard to be shocking and raw that it quickly becomes irritating. There are two rather vulgar (and ultimately unnecessary) sexual scenes that where screaming so hard for attention you can almost hear Megan Fox in the background wondering why she wasn't cast for the role of Nina. The rest of the cast are so cardboard and cliché they aren't even worth a mention. The story is predictable from the first 10 minutes if you know the ending to Swan Lake and has as much intrigue as a dead dog in a skip.<br/><br/>At time of writing, it has already won a golden globe (Portman, best actress) and has been nominated for similar awards at the Oscars. I find it quite annoying that the cardboard cutout of a film behind the lead actress is completely ignored because Natalie Portman acted well. If this had a lesser female lead, it would have been bargain bin material and forgotten about within a few years. Completely and utterly carried by the beautiful Natalie Portman."

While at times the chilling action makes the viewer feel uncomfortable, this is part of what makes this film so great. The juxtaposition of the ""black swan "" character and the ""white swan"" was terrifying and brilliant to say the least. This was the film of a lifetime for Natalie Portman, earning her a Golden Globe for Best Actress. She plays the role of Nina Sayers, an up and coming uptight ballerina who takes her dancing too far. She gets the lead role in ""Swan Lake"" and must strive to be able to overcome her innocent ways in order to dance the part of the 'black swan'. Mila Kunis' secondary role was also quite impressive as well; her sexy scenes with Natalie were dark and absolutely captivated the audience.

","Thoroughly enjoyed this film, even after my wife said it was just about ballet!!<br/><br/>Great acting, certainly from NP. The whole film was gripping and intense, also quite scary in some parts. <br/><br/>Filmed through first person viewpoint in many parts it really gives you a sense of taking part and being Lily. NP's character goes through a physical and emotional journey in trying to become the 'perfect' lead role in swan lake.<br/><br/>This journey takes her to dark and dangerous places in her mind and gives the audience an intense insight into the unsettling desire of one persons need to prove herself.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend seeing this film."
"pulkit-avadakedavra","10","1","3","23 January 2011"," Nightmarish Perfection
","I came across the trailer of this movie in August and thought it was going to be some complex and melodramatic horror movie too obsessed with it's style to develop any characters or be interesting. The synopsis on IMDb didn't alter my impression.Frankly, I didn't even know what ballet actually was prior to watching the trailer of this movie as I have no interest in any dance form, thanks to Bollywood's song-and-dance inclusion in about every movie. Moreover, it's rated R and I'm just 14. All these points led me to avoid this movie. <br/><br/>But a poster of the movie caught my attention and didn't let go for a long time. Even before watching the movie, I had a nightmare which was based solely on the image of that poster. It was then that I decided to watch this movie. Somehow, I had this hunch that it was going to become one of my all-time favorite movies. That boosted my eagerness and thus I downloaded this movie. <br/><br/>It's about a ballet dancer, Nina who is nothing like the stereotypical image that pops into your head at the very thought of the word Ballerina. Physically, yes, but emotionally and personally, no. From the very starting, you get to know about her fragility, shyness and mental instability. Living with an overprotective mother, suffering from horrific hallucinations and experiencing inevitable loneliness, her only escape or rather pathway to happiness is a successful career as a ballerina. <br/><br/>Soon enough, a glimmer of hope crosses her way with the announcement of imminent opening of the season with ""Swan Lake."" The role of the Swan Queen becomes her ambition. It is then that her obsession overshadows every other aspect of her life.<br/><br/>This is clearly the most artistic movie I have seen. From the performances of the marvelous dancers, their magnificent costumes and grace to the psychic gravity of Nina's personality, everything grips you and refuses to let go. It's controlling you, just the way Nina controls each of her movements and The Black Swan's controlling her. There isn't a scene in the whole movie where you feel like, ""Come on, move on."" From the very first scene, you want to know what will happen to her next and with each scene, the tension intensifies. It's visually intriguing and has a brilliant screenplay. The background score, that goes aptly and beautifully with the plot, is the best of the year.<br/><br/>There aren't many characters as 75% of the screen time is occupied by Nina alone. Still, among the few there are, one can't afford to dislike any. From the mean and passionate director Thomas to the conservative mother, each is diverse and has a meaningful role to play in the transition Nina goes through from being the White to the Black Swan. The most important, besides that of Nina of course, is the role of lily, the existence of whom exacerbates Nina's condition to the power of ten. Each character is played perfectly by the consummate cast and what the characters demand and how the actors quench their thirst is stunning. Natalie Portman got the Globe and is definitely getting the Academy Award, though I wouldn't mind if Mila Kunis gets one, too.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's direction is nothing short of breathtaking as his visceral vision has so much happening at the same time. He certainly deserves an Oscar for this masterpiece, though I'm sure The Social Network will get it. His direction made this nightmare an attractive woman whom you'll like to watch again and again. Beautiful but sad. He also proves the point that sad can be beautiful and it often is. <br/><br/>The best aspect for me is the ultimate realization. Nina doesn't know that the her life is actually taking the form of the Swan Lake until the end, where her mind reveals the very thing that can make her act perfect and she unconsciously learns how to let go, just like Thomas wants her to. The ambiguous ending adds to the seductive quality of the movie and will leave people like me gasping, satisfied beyond possibility. And for the third time in my life, I cried while watching a movie and for the first time, really felt the tears, the pain the protagonist had to go through. <br/><br/>My favorite movie of the year, of the decade and of forever, taking the top spot above Citizen Kane. <br/><br/>In one word, it's devastating."
"graysongaines","7","1","3","22 January 2011"," A scary and unique movie. Well done but not amazing.
","This movie was very well done and unique. It had many cinematic elements that I have not seen before in a movie. That said, I was with two ladies- 25 and 24 years old- and many times during the movie they were unable to watch the screen. One of the ladies actually had a rash because she was so scared. So this is a warning, this movie is disturbing and strange and a lot of people will find it scary and unwatchable.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is great in the movie. She looks hot and it is very scandalous. There are very graphic and suggestive scenes and if you want to see hot girls acting naughty this flick might float your boat. I personally thought the film was very well done. It was unique and interesting. Natalie Portman did a great job portraying the dark and light aspects of human nature and the complex interaction that can exist within our heads.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was worth seeing but I would not watch it again. I thought it was cool, but it didn't leave much of a lasting impression. Although, I do refer to my girlfriend as the Swan Queen often and I flap my arms around like the ballerinas. So I guess something changed in my life because of the movie. Maybe that is enough for me to recommend you seeing it. <br/><br/>Whatever you decide. Stay classy!"
"blacklist-1","10","1","3","22 January 2011"," A completely riveting and emotionally intense experience. Full of beauty and hauntingly atmospheric. Another Aronofsky masterpiece.
","Well that's done it. I didn't think it would be possible. The chances must be astronomical. Three Oscar winning films in a month! First 127 Hours and then The King's Speech and now Aronofsky's third cinematic masterpiece triumph in a row. Black Swan for me has overtaken The King's Speech to take the top spot. Aronofsky's Black Swan is cinema at it's most serious, creative like art full of rich beauty and swirling darkness. This is Aronofsky's best film so far for many reasons. <br/><br/>But first a brief synopsis. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) lives at home with her controlling domineering mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) who wants the ""best"" for her daughter as Nina is a professional ballerina dance. Her mum encourages and pushes her as she's an ex-dancer herself who gave up her career to bring up Nina supposedly as she says. Artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to replace his prime ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) for his production of ""Swan Lake"" where one ballerina will be chosen to be the Swan Queen and be the White Swan, a sign of beauty, virginity and fragility and the Black Swan representing darkness, strength and seductiveness. Nina gets the part. She is fine playing the White Swan, but finds it very hard to produce her other side. Leroy ""helps"" her by trying to seduce her and she pushes him away, signalling strength. Another ballerina Lily (Mila Kunis) supposedly befriends her, but throughout as Nina becomes infatuated with Leroy she becomes convinced that Lily is out to steal her part and get Leroy for herself. She tries to become the Swan Queen by pushing herself to the extreme as her life spirals out of control. She's starts becoming obsessed with being the perfect Swan Queen due to the fact she takes drugs and is controlled by her mother. She starts going insane. <br/><br/>We really get inside the character's head of Nina. Aronofsky uses surrealism for dark images of her mental breakdown along with cleverly using music and sound effects along with costumes and truly exquisite cinematography to signify both Nina's light (white) and dark side (black). As the white swan we see her struggle to please her mother and Leroy and gain confidence herself to believe she can fulfil the role of swan queen. At the same time she struggles with her virginity when Leroy asks her how many boyfriend's she's had and tells her to really transcend herself and immerse herself into the role of the black swan she has to feel herself. Her dark side comes out later as she defy's her mother, takes drugs and has sex with Lily. Aronofsky uses also to magnificent effect, special effects and makeup to unsettle the audience with Nina's state of mind as she turns into the black swan, like when her eyes turn red, or you see her actually turn into a black swan and dancing with her prince swan. Natalie Portman herself dances beautifully and is excellent, she moves fluidly and gracefully with aching beauty, which cleverly mirrors the creative cinematography of the different colours of white and black. The way Aronofsky himself has shot the film with hand-held camera and editing which in itself is fluid and graceful like Nina's dancing. Also the pacing of the film never flagged throughout and where lots of films feel the need to drag themselves out needlessly, Black Swan dosen't and still retains that in-depthness of exploration of the characters and their aspirations. <br/><br/>The performances are equally astounding. Natalie Portman who I have seen acting in a few films gives a performance I have never thought possible. It is indescribable really. It is absolutely astoundingly, positively sensational. She gives Nina such depth, you feel really the emotional intensity of what Nina is going through as reality and fantasy is distorted and reflections of both her personalities (cleverly jutxapositioned with the use of mirrors) comes out. Portman is actually quite terrifying at times as you hate her and care for her at the same time. The film played so much on my mind and reached me so deeply that I had to remember that the cinema I was in was the reality for a while. Portman deserves without a doubt best actress at the Oscars. Of course the other actors cannot be ignored. Vincent Cassel as Leroy is memorably sleazy and strict as the art director, Barbara Hershey is excellent in a harrowing role as Nina's mum and gives her character depth as well. Winona Ryder is utterly superb in her short scenes as Beth who is broken down realising she is at the end of her days. But the second best acting was Mila Kunis as Lily. She was quite literally amazing and gave clarity to her character and dominated her scenes with maturity I never thought possible. She was reasonable in The Book Of Eli and funny in the comedy Date Night but they weren't serious films. This is and she played well high of the expectations I expected of her.<br/><br/>So it comes down to it, Black Swan is Aronofsky's finest so far. He deserves an Oscar for best director as Portman does for best actress. But also the making of it is a triumph as well as it really taps into the audience's mind and explores the issue of mental deterioration incredibly well with it being sensitively handled and we feel we are experiencing Nina's journey with her. Everyone should see this, particularly those who like Aronofsky or have a taste of surrealism. This is cinema at it's finest. I would bet for me this will remain one of the best film's of the year. It will be exceptionally difficult for any other movies on hand this year to top Black Swan as it is truly remarkable in every sense of the word and deserves to be hailed as a cinematic classic for decades to come. Truly a sensational masterpiece of our time."
"marksns","10","1","3","22 January 2011"," Black Swan
","The Black Swan is a movie based on obsession. It is one of the most talked about movies of the time as it should be for its empowerment over the mind. It is absolutely genius from beginning to end and I believe deserves all kinds of praise. Even though it is a dark movie it is still very beautiful to watch the struggle of a young woman who wants to be the best. It is not your ordinary obsession of being infatuated with someone else but it is based on a ballerina becoming so obsessed with being perfect it ultimately drives her crazy. Nina whose character is played by Natalie Portman has been part of the New York ballet company for a long time and has constantly pushed her self to be the best, she is already the best white swan ballerina in the dance company but drives to overpower her mind in order to become the dark, evil, black swan. Nina constantly feels like people are after her and are trying to hurt her. Throughout the course of the movie you see different scenes of violence and blood all dictated by Nina's imagination. This movie is heavy yet really pulls you in to understand what is going on to make Nina see what she sees. Nina becomes so smitten with becoming the perfect black swan that she thinks that she is turning into a swan...causing her to see feathers coming out of her body. Everyone in Nina's life is trying to support her and help her not become too overwhelmed by this life style but she only sees it as pure evil. She thinks her mom and friend Lily are out to get her. Lily's character is played by the beautiful Mila Kunis. Lily is constantly trying to be a good friend by talking to Nina when she is upset and tries to even help her find a life outside of ballet but Nina cannot handle this which is portrayed in a few scenes of the movie. All in all this is a great movie and i definitely recommend it to people who enjoy dark yet moving films. To try to compare this movie to another is nearly impossible. If i was to compare it to any movie it would have to be Inception director and writer Christopher Nolan. Inception is based on the mind and going beyond ones dreams to live a life that you choose. I compare these two movies as similarities because they truly make you think and open up ones mind. You truly have to let go of your everyday life and open up your mind and eyes to these crazy, twisted films."

","This movie takes you to surreal and psychological places you don't expect. If you are uncomfortable with very personal scenes, I don't recommend this film, because it's very personal. Natalie Portman plays an astonishing role as an innocent, nervous and caged girl. Her mother coddles her and wants her to stay innocent and young. Things get interesting, things spin out of control as she struggles to keep a balance of the themes we know of as black and white. The directing stays true to Aronofsky's traditionally indie looking films. This movie was inspirational and causes one to deeply self reflect. <br/><br/>Ballet has taken a new dimension, a new view. Winona Rider and Mila Kunis are excellent supporting actresses."
"s-woodyard","10","1","3","22 January 2011"," Expected Nothing, Blew me away!
","What can I say about this movie. Well, I certainly wasn't expecting to be remotely entertained. Badgered by my other half to go and see what I thought was going to be a gash chick flick with B' List actors, the idea of watching Natalie Portman after her performances in the Star Wars films, just filled me with dread. and every time I hear Mila Kunis voice, I expect Peter Griffin to crash on to the screen fighting a chicken. Not in my opinion, a good start. But boy, how wrong one mans pre-conceived ideas could be, just cant be measured. Portman was amazing. From start to finish, her performance was exceptional. To go from a wooden faced futuristic princess to turn in an emotional, believable, intensive and graphic portrayal of an artiste' descent into madness was just incredible. Kunis was steady as was Hershey and Cassel. The latter played a blinder with the will he/wont he (be a sexually manipulative sadistic moron)saga. However, enough praise cannot be given to the Director Aronofsky. Without his stewardship, one feels that Portman, Kunis et al, may have struggled with the task in hand. Be prepared, Black Swan will dominate The Oscars"

","Black Swan was overall an amazing display of cinematic excellence blended in with amazing performances and a great plot.<br/><br/>It must be admitted that the previews and trailer do not expose the film for all its horrific glory. There are some seriously disturbing scenes which include self mutilation. I didn't like the fact that the opposing character had black wings tattooed on her back, as some of the plot lines were too obvious. You knew exactly what was going on in every scene and that everything was just a hallucination. Then again you don't need to be deceived to realise that Nina (Natalie Portman) was extremely unstable in in the end reached her obsession to be ""perfect"".<br/><br/>Other than the obvious plot line, Black Swan was an amazing cinematic experience. Many audience members were surprised by some scenes and it left me even more proud, that such a movie could show and move people to understand the great pressure that is put on ballerinas. Not only the pressure that is present physically but also psychologically.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie gave me goosebumps and left me wondering and wanting to explore more. Natalie Portman greatly deserved her Oscar. If you are amazed and intrigued by the human mind and just how little it takes to be pushed over the edge, then Black Swan is the movie for you!"

The directing was impetuous, artful, powerful. Natalie Portman was just BREATH-TAKING. I'm still in AWE. Seriously. Her performance was almost unreal. I think it's safe to say it was the best acting by a female I have ever witnessed. All in all the movie is a work of art. It would be an insult not to go watch it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Even if some scenes were a bit over the top, maybe there were just few horror elements too much included for my taste...oh yeah and the startling explicit bedroom-scene after the clubbing... it still remains a definite 10 out of 10 and a must watch for anybody claiming to be a connoisseur of cinema! thank you for your attention."
"xtygerlillix","10","1","3","19 January 2011"," Black Swan Review
","Another visually intense film from Darren Arronofsky, the director of Requiem for a Dream. I made the mistake of assuming this film would be more mainstream and therefore less horrifying than Requiem, but this film definitely goes just as far to push you to your limits. Before seeing it, a friend described it to me as ""hypersexual"", and I have to agree with that. It left me a little bit afraid to be alone with myself, to be honest. An excellent psychological thriller to follow my Fight Club review. This is another film that I will pretend is anywhere close to science fiction because the psychological is manifested in reality in a stunning, yet fantastic way.<br/><br/>To address a concern many of the fellows might have, I dragged my boyfriend to see this film with promises that it would be as incredible as Requiem, and he agrees with me that about halfway in it doesn't matter that it's a movie about ballet. Just in case you were worried. The music and dance really added visually to a great story, and I probably don't have to mention the parallels to the ballet of the swan queen or the black and white imagery. The ballet allows Arronofsky to continue to plague his films with stark and artistic images. He pulled it off beautifully.<br/><br/>I won't give a plot synopsis because there are excellent ones all over the internet. What I will say is that while you know the basic story, you will be shocked at where it takes you. From the trailer, I thought I knew where this was going, but felt it would still be worth the ride. It turns out I was wrong, and without spoilers, let me just say that to enjoy this film thoroughly, forget everything you saw in the trailer and go at it anew. Watch Nina closely for the effect each subtle event has on her, and forget what the reviews have told you is going to happen.<br/><br/>This is a movie about what can happen to a sweet girl in a viscous, competitive world, and I don't just mean the ballet. Nina is unnaturally innocent for her age, to the point of being emotionally immature, and the controlling forces in her life cause her to break free in a dark way that goes beyond what is expected for rebellious little girls. She becomes the Black Swan because it is expected of her to shed her innocence as she comes of age, but at the same time, her mother exerts a suffocated control over her, expecting her to be a child forever, and even Thomas, the artistic director of the show, is controlling while he pretends to free her. He has control over her sexuality as he forces her into an unhealthy relationship of the strong dominating over the weak.<br/><br/>A great story of the mind, with excellent art direction and a very imaginative manifestation of the psyche. It's been a long time since a movie has glued me to the screen to the extent that I can forget my own existence for the entire third act.<br/><br/>Starlight - http://starlightmusing.blogspot.com/"
"TheGame111073","8","1","3","15 January 2011"," An Entertaining, Twisted, Drug Ride of a Movie
","Black Swan is a bizarre, intriguing but muddled tale of obsession, desire, sacrifice, passion, and most of all a fixation with perfection. The movie is highlighted by an impressive performance from Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a multi layered visualization of a young woman's obsession. It's an emotional journey of a young woman chasing a lifelong passion that has become fanatical. The movie aptly illustrates the struggles within herself and the immense amount of pressures that are placed on her which causes her to lose touch with reality in her neurotic pursuit of becoming the lead in a Broadway ballet. <br/><br/>The movie is one of the weirdest films that you'll ever see however, it is a touching, engaging story that aptly exemplifies the degree that ballerinas go through to achieve a childhood dream that often becomes a life long passion. Black Swan opens with a great scene illustrating the detailed, painstaking process of preparation. It contains multiple scenes showing her feet that are filled with scars, cuts, and bruises to accentuate the sacrifices that ballet dancers are forced to overcome in their surrender to their craft.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives a riveting performance as she portrays Nina, a repressed, shy, little girl trapped in a woman's body. She has been emotionally repressed because of her overbearing mother, who constantly treats her like a little girl. Nina is terrified of her mother, after being forced to chase her mother dream, having been made to feel guilty because she birthed her at the age of 28 and sacrifice her dancing career. Nina constantly seeks her approval just like a teenager. Portman delivers an extremely convincing depiction of a young woman with an neurotic obsession with perfection. The eloquent portrayal of her character's gambit of emotions is very impressive. Nina develops a dual personality because of a number of influences. The pressures of the pursuit of perfection, the fact that she scars herself in order the alter her perfect appearance, and the constant inner battle to keep her inhibitions in check. This causes her to repress her personality. Another impressive aspect to Portman's performance is the fact that she does most of the ballet dancing herself. Mila Kunis adds a good performance as Lily, the inhibited newcomer, that threatens to upstage Nina. Vincent Cassell also supplies a commendable performance as Thomas, the promiscuous director of the Ballet.<br/><br/>The film does a great undertaking at trying to connect the audience with Nina's level of psychosis. She is unstable emotionally and the movie goes through great lengths to try to get the audience in her head. The cinematography and soundtrack of Black Swan is excellent. They both enhance the film very well. It's visuals are excellent and has dual purpose. Much of the cinematography is used to convey her feelings. Nearly every scene in the movie is used to convey her emotional state within the movie. Multiple camera angles are used to resemble her emotion state. One angle in particular that is used is from behind Nina. Many of the scenes are from behind Nina, this allows the audience to share Nina's feeling of her instability and her level of insecurity. The final ballet scenes were terrific as Nina dances transforming from the White Swan into the Black Swan was impressive. The soundtrack was equally impressive as it plays just like a ballet, especially in the most tense moments. The music raises and lowers highlighting the action of the film giving the true feel of a ballet.<br/><br/>Black Swan is extremely dark. Almost twisted in nature. The movie is actually pretty decent but it an exceedingly hard film to watch. Too much of the film plays out like you are on drugs, It's all over the place. This was the only detractor from the movie. It's truly difficult to discern what is actually the reality of the film and when it's Nina twisted perception of reality. The movie never makes it clear. It constantly flip flops between the two and you are constantly trying to make sense of what is going on. This lack of clarity is the only extreme hindrance of what is a good movie but could've become a great one."
"sudchat","9","1","3","14 January 2011"," Mimesis in Black Swan — the devastating turbulence of the 'mentor and his muse' phenomenon
","AN Indian PERSPECTIVE The traumatic dichotomy between a mentor and his muse has hounded the history of performing arts since times immemorial. Pygmalion saw the reflection of an ivory statue of a girl he had sculpted, in a stream and fell in love with her; Svengali hypnotized Tribly to perform as a diva and went to the extent of sexually exploiting her; using the ruse of aesthetics he tried to gain complete control and authorship over her. Nearer home, fabled myths abound about the Guru Dutt – Waheeda Rehman , Raj Kapoor — Nargis or the Chetan Anand –Priya Rajvansh and the more recent Anurag Kashyap – Kalki association and obsession. Setting gossip mills churning sensationalism they set to stoke the fire of public imagination and try to point out how great art is possible only when an inevitable romance is sparkled between the director and his leading lady. Performing arts has always been about how flesh and blood coalesce to create kindred spirits who work in perfect sync to produce, everlasting masterpieces. Mimesis is all about how two souls reflect each other so completely that they seem to look like one. Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan(2010) is a mischievous, irreverent, part carnal part psycho-sexual take on this phenomenon. It has been labelled by The New York Times as ""visceral and real even while it's one delirious, phantasmagoric freak out"". It probes into this heart of darkness where the lines between morality and aesthetics seem to get more and more blurred as the auteur relentlessly pushes his audience into the skewed mind space of its protagonist essayed so eerily menacingly by Natalie Portman that it is bound to give you goose pimples. Yet it is to both the director's and Ms Portman's credit that this same woman in her white swan avatar retains a pristine child woman quality to her persona. Our area of study is not to critique the film but to deconstruct the phantasmagoria within which such relationships are often caught leading to gut wrenching experiences of both the mentor and his muse, ironically resulting in an edifying experiences of high aesthetic merit. Is it tragically inevitable that only through such blood curdling experiences that works of lasting value in dramatic forms can be created? Nina Sayers an aspiring ballerina who works relentlessly and ruthlessly to perfect her craft becomes a pawn in the hands of Thomas Leroy, the Artistic Director of a leading New York Ballet company (a chillingly cruel performance by Vincent Cassel). Thomas wants to get rid of the prima ballerina Beth (hauntingly etched by Winona Ryder) of the previous season, tired with the excess emotional baggage she carries of her former relationship with him. He needs a new muse to fulfill his dreams of creating a contemporary and more visceral version of legendary ballet The Swan Lake. A new muse entails a newer touch, the taste of new saliva, newer lips, newer boobs and maybe a juicier pussy. All in the name of inspiration! But under the authoritarian regime of her determined Mom, Eica( another stellar act by Barbara Hershey)she is so devoted to her art that the only physical sensation she can feel is pain manifest through her peeling skin, chipping nails and bruised toes — all a consequence of the sheer physical labour of practicing pure form. She has become virtually frigid. The irony is that in her twin avatar as the evil black swan, Nina has to play the ultimate seductress. Thomas has to arouse that side of hers. And in what better way than by seducing her, exploiting her fragile body with his swarthy hands and his hyena eyes penetrating deep down within her soul? So much so that she gradually starts losing her mind to become a psychological wreck. But Thomas does not care about this moral crisis. All such middle class notions have no place in his scheme of pure art form. Perfection must be achieved no matter what the price. Helplessly we watch Nina's deflowering as she transforms from a nubile nymph to becoming a warped mind hankering for and lusting after that 'one curtain call'. By then Thomas has drilled in into her mind that all that life was worth living for is 'the final curtain call'. That opium consumes her completely and destroys her. She mirrors Thomas's inner evil with such fecundity that it even leaves the maestro confounded at the end of it all. In a blood curdling finale, this film celebrates ruthlessness as a triumph of human tragedy. How perverse, yet how true!<br/><br/>It is fabled that the erstwhile cabaret dancer Maria Falconetti was so radically transformed while playing Joan in Carl Dreyer's epic, ""The Passion of Joan Of Arc"" (1928) that she lost her mind and could never act again. Graciously Dreyer took care of her for the rest of her life and even shared his rations with her during the Second World War. Back home, Guru Dutt could never fully recover from the trauma of his autobiographical film Kagaz Ke Phool, delineating his emotionally fraught relationship with Waheeda Rehman. Ultimately, wallowing in self pity, he committed suicide. Such tragic stories about mentor and muse abound. They are very cathartic for an audience and make great viewing material. But what happens to those caught within this matrix? With his cruel and incisive knife, Darren Aronofsky dissects this for us in Black Swan. You don't need any further nightmares after this. Coming from mainstream Hollywood, this dark diamond confounds and bedazzles us all!"

"cinemaniac_x","10","1","3","9 January 2011"," A nightmarish masterpiece
","Black Swan is a visual masterpiece, a disturbing character study, and a gut-wrenching psychological horror piece. In one of the best films of the year, Darren Aronofsky directs with a bold artistic vision, documenting the rapid mental breakdown of the paranoid and perfectionist ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). In an Oscar-worthy performance, and certainly the performance of her career, Portman sheds her sweetheart attitude and travels to new depths of acting, at the same time that her character loses her innocence and descends into madness.<br/><br/>In fact, Black Swan abounds with such artistic parallels. It is a film about ballet, and moreover it is a ballet; it features over-the-top theatricality and uses the nightmarish music of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, the ballet around which the film is centered.<br/><br/>In Swan Lake, one dancer must portray both the innocent White Swan and her evil twin, the sensual Black Swan. The psychological duality of these roles parallels Nina's own duality, which she explores with devastating consequences. The doppelganger aspect of Swan Lake is also seen in the film, as Nina is haunted by her double, the free-spirited Lily (Mila Kunis), who becomes Nina's understudy and seems to embody her darker side.<br/><br/>As Nina struggles with the dual nature of her ballet role, she must deal with other issues as well, ranging from her strained relationship with her repressive mother (Barbara Hershey) to unwanted attentions from the ballet company's director (Vincent Cassel). Also suffering from an eating disorder, obsession, and paranoia, Nina bends under the immense pressure and begins to see grisly hallucinations that take a toll on her mental health.<br/><br/>But in a film with an unreliable protagonist, reality and hallucinations are often indistinguishable, and this is what makes the film fun. The viewer must judge whether Nina's perspective is accurate and whether certain events even happened. Thus Black Swan becomes a multilayered film with many possible interpretations.<br/><br/>This complexity is further enhanced by Aronofsky's clever manipulation of mirrors; there is a mirror in almost every scene. Mirrors are often associated with deception, desire for perfection, and duality, ideas that are all explored in the film. Moreover, small details such as the color of Nina's clothing illustrate the duality at the center of her struggle. Her change in wardrobe color choice, from light to dark, parallels her mental collapse and her psychological transformation from the pure White Swan to the evil Black Swan.<br/><br/>Symbolism and parallelism aside, Black Swan is an audacious declaration of Aronofsky's creativity. He constructs an unlikely blend of horror and ballet, mental illness and artistic devotion. These mismatched themes work surprisingly well together, and we soon realize that the music of Swan Lake does suit the atmosphere of a horror film.<br/><br/>A film like Black Swan is rare: it is as nightmarish as it is exquisite, as disturbing as it is beautiful. It explores not only the duality within every person but also the fine line between hallucinations and reality. The film takes us to intimate places with Nina and we cannot help but empathize with her, making the film, though over-the-top (and intentionally so), seem frighteningly real."
"adamcfreeman","10","1","3","25 December 2010"," Wow! I was left speechless.
","I should start this by saying that I have high expectations of Aronofsky. All of his feature films have gone various directions with great success. Out of everything that I've ever seen, nothing has managed quite the impact that Black Swan has. I almost never rate anything at the top of the chart, but this film makes it. I was completely speechless at the end.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this film is predictable, especially if you're a fan of David Lynch. Even though Aronofsky has proved himself to be an excellent director and creative mastermind, he is still growing. That said, while I knew where this film was going, and how it was going to get there, I was still shocked at most of the events. The whole film starts very slowly, much like Aronofsky's other works. As things start to happen, tension starts to build.<br/><br/>The main character (Nina, played by Natalie Portman) pushes herself to become the star of a reworking of Swan Lake. We always hear about great art requiring sacrifice and suffering, but this role for Nina is nothing that her years of rigorous training could have prepared her to handle. Unlike many other films that play on the drama created between competition for coveted positions, Aronofsky keeps the main focus on Nina, the tumult under her surface, and how that impacts everything around her. Her producer (Thomas) demands much, pushing and pulling her in directions she's never explored. In the end, the work by Nina and Thomas leads to a phenomenal, new rendition of Swan Lake."

","It took me a long time to watch this movie, and I had high hopes based on what I had heard.<br/><br/>I was really disappointed though, the movie seemed really obvious the whole way through, and Nina's spiral into psychosis seems to mirror every single other film with similar themes as well.<br/><br/>The parallels between the story of swan lake and the characters in the film were heavy handed as well, and you could tell Darren Aronofsky thought he was being really clever with them.<br/><br/>Actually the whole movie seems like Darren Aronofsky just attempting to come accross as profound, every single line from Leroy is like Aronofsky jacking off to how smart he is!<br/><br/>Also for a movie where most of the characters are female, it came off as weirdly sexist? Not to be preachy about those kinds of things, but Aronofsky displays a limited view of women in this film. They're either timid and virginal or seductive and immoral. Very madonna-wh*re. There's the overbearing mother character as well of course.<br/><br/>Bit of a letdown overall! Most of the body horror and special effects were amazing to be fair but the rest was less than I'd been told to expect."

","The harrowing journey through the psyche of a young ballerina who ultimately proved to be frighteningly perfect for the role of The Black Swan shows once again Daren Aronofsky's bold direction. Twisted friendship between the two young dancers more and more drop a hint at Nina's dark side with that temerity that threatens to destroy her. It's the most intense and passionate melodrama I've ever watched. Although the film divided critics, I bow to the extraordinarily subtle and emotionally authentic performance from Natalie Portman. It's a daring, horrifying and impressive watchable piece of pure cinema. It's different from everything I've seen. Worthy Oscar winner."
"agulasy","9","1","4","18 September 2013"," Black Swan presents a dark side to classic ballet
","Black Swan a psychological thriller directed by Darren Aronofsky presents a dark side to classic ballet. Natalie Portman plays the lead character Nina Sayers, a young ballet dancer in her twenties living in New York City with her mother (Barbara Hershey). Aronofsky did a great job in capturing Nina, the theme of the film, through many close-up shots and positioning the camera angle throughout the film to focus on solely her. The film begins abruptly with Nina in the spotlight on stage performing as the Swan Queen in the production of Swan Lake. Though this performance was just a dream, her flawless ballet dance moves and the intense sound of the piano playing in the background prepare you for the thrill, mystery and drama that you are about to witness within the film. Nina doesn't have any friends, her mother Erica Sayers, is the only friend and confidant that she has. Nina is in her mid twenties but she is treated like a child by her overbearing mother. Ballet is Nina's life, even when she is not in the studio she is continuously practicing dance choreography in an effort to be perfect. The ballet company is casting a new star role for their production of Swan Lake, and she will stop at nothing to get the role of the Swan Queen. The Swan Queens role is complicated because it embodies two personalities; the white swan and the black swan. Nina's begins to develop a crush on her ballet director Leroy (Vincent Cassel) but he doesn't think that she is capable of being the black swan because of her innocent and uptight personality. Growing up in a sheltered environment Nina is socially awkward and it's hard for Leroy to envision her having a dark wild side but she will show him otherwise. <br/><br/>Nina becomes obsessed with Swan Lake and in the midst of trying to prove her ability to be the black swan, she begins to lose herself. Mila Kunis plays the character of Lily, a ballerina from San Francisco, who has zero self discipline and is wild and promiscuous. Lily is everything that Nina is not and everything that she wants to be. Lily befriends Nina and you slowly see Nina's mannerisms begin to change. Strange things begin to happen and the issue of separating reality from illusion becomes custom. Nina feels pressure from her mother to be perfect, to be the best as well as pressure from Leroy in her performance for Swan Lake causing her to become unstable. <br/><br/>If you've seen The Machinist directed by Brad Anderson, and you like that kind of thriller then you will love Black Swan as their themes are alike in many ways. Nina's character is a lot like Christian Bales character Trevor in The Machinist, Trevor suffers from insomnia and his body looks thin an unhealthy, he becomes delusional and believes that someone is out to get him. Nina suffers from anorexia because of the pressure on her to be skinny and perfect in her role as the swan queen and while she begins feel like the swan queen she has illusions and thinks that Lily is after her by trying to replace her in Swan Lake. <br/><br/>Mirrors are used as a motif in the film, seen all over in almost in every scene. Nina strives to be perfect and the more she pushes herself to do better, the more unwound and delusional she becomes. The mirrors consistency in each scene of the film represents how Nina sees herself. In the beginning of the film when Nina is standing in front of the mirror she looks innocent, fragile and easily intimidated. As the film progresses you see Nina through the mirrors and her mannerisms begin to change, she seems more confident and tranquil. The mirrors are also used throughout the film to show her body physically changing progressively into something inhuman. The Black Swan is a film that captures the story of a girl who is pressured to be perfect, to dance perfectly and in the midst of fulfilling her dream, she becomes someone else something else."
"The-Sarkologist","9","1","4","10 September 2013"," A movie that seriously messes with your head
","This movie serious messes with my head, though it is not the first movie where the world of the dream and the world of reality come crashing together to the point that it is difficult to tell what is real and what is not. In a way I can see that numerous good films are going to take this technique, particularly in our existentialist society. Other films of a similar vein would be Brazil and, while I have not seen it, American Psycho (though it is only recently that I have discovered that there is a debate as to whether the protagonist's actions were entirely in a dream world).<br/><br/>Black Swan takes place in the back rooms of the New York Ballet Company as they prepare to perform another version of Swan Lake. However the difference here is that we have the same actor (or dancer) playing the white swan and the black swan. In the original story, the black swan steals the love of the prince from the white swan damning her forever to live as a swan. However in this production, as comes out in the film itself, the black and the white swan are basically the same person, and that it explores the competing sides of our own personality.<br/><br/>However, while the commentators talk about how this film is about how Nina goes from being the puritanical white swan to the sordid and evil black swan, I saw it somewhat differently. Instead I saw it as the manifestation of the stress that encompasses the actors and actresses as the seek to perform the perfect role, as in this case, the role of the white swan. While there is a lot of talk about how, while she can play the white swan, she cannot play the black swan, and that to be able to do it she must delve into her dark side and unleash that part of her personality, I saw it more as the resulting stress that one experiences as one comes out on stage in front of thousands who expect a perfect performance.<br/><br/>In many cases this film is about a descent into madness, and we see that descent as complete near the end where she kill's her double and then goes out onto stage and performs the perfect set. As is said in the film, it is not surprising that there is somebody that wants her role because everybody wants her role, which adds further to the stress to perform well.<br/><br/>The end of the film is left in limbo, wondering whether she is dead or not, but once again I believe that it has something to do with her descent into madness. Throughout the film her one desire is to perform the perfect dance. In fact he desire to perform the perfect dance (to the extent that she leaves everything else behind) means that when she actually does it there is nothing left to accomplish. My suspicion is that while she may not be dead (and that in and of itself is debatable) I do not believe that she will be coming back on stage, and is more likely to be left in a catatonic state, similar to the state in which the ballerina that she replaced has been left in.<br/><br/>There is also the aspect of her coming to terms with her sexuality, however once again I do not believe that that is necessarily a major aspect of the film. She begins the film frigid, but in many ways it is because her mother holds such a tight reign on her. We notice that in the first scene where she is masturbating, she stops when she discovers her mother sleeping in the chair next to her. However, the lesbian love scene (which so horrified my mother) more likely represents her finally breaking free of her mother's hold that for her coming to terms with her sexuality. I suspect that the reason she broke away from the guy in the nightclub has more to do with her coming to realise that she was kissing a stranger than kissing a man.<br/><br/>Remember, she is a romantic at heart, which is why she is a ballerina, which means that the idea of promiscuous sex would not enter her mind. The reason she hallucinates the girl in her room rather than a guy is because she has never been with a guy (so does not know what it feels like) and does not have a deep relationship with a guy for her to have that image. However, remember that at the end of the film she does go up to the producer and passionately kisses him, before heading back to the change rooms to change back into the white swan."
"el_diablo_03","10","1","4","19 January 2013"," ""Perfection is not just about control. It is also about letting go. Surprise yourself so you can surprise the audience. Transcendence. Very few have it in them""
","It is not altogether surprising that Aronofsky pulled another masterpiece with Black Swan. After all, he is eminent for some of the top-rated movies of all times including Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler. Not so different from his other movies, Black Swan somewhat achieves a similar style that is somehow dark, gloomy, and mysterious with a large focus on the main character's development.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is known for bringing the movie to the screen from the main character's perspective. He does that this time with the black swan's main character: Nina. So thrilled about her next audition, Nina finds herself caught in the midst of an inner battle between her strive for perfection and the persistent urge to release herself from any means of control. The movie questions every aspect of perfection: what is perfection? Is it just about maintaining the control of every step we make so that we don't make mistakes? Or isn't it also about letting go and freeing one's self from any essence of control so that it can transcend and unleash its creativity. These are the main questions that the movie tries to demonstrate, and how striving for perfection can truly affect one's life. This is illustrated again from Nina's perspective and how attempting to perfect her role as the white/black swan affected her life in a significant manner.<br/><br/>Great performance by Natalie Portman. You can truly see the diversity of the role she played and how it progresses with the movie; so calm and innocent in the beginning and tense and paranoid by the end of the movie. It truly explains the whole life-cycle of the journey toward perfection; your emotions are cool in the beginning but it gets more agitated as you progress with the role until it enters your personal life and creates damages due to the accompanied pressure and tension.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is a beautiful movie that will make you attach yourself to the character and feel what she was going through. A must-watch!"
"piratecannon","9","1","4","26 December 2012"," Not Nearly as Light as a Feather
","I've finally gotten around to checking out Darren Aronofsky's latest offering, and, I have to say, it certainly lives up to its reputation.<br/><br/>Not many films are ""black and white"" in terms of an intended subtext, and Black Swan is no different (though the sharp, monochrome tones that pervade the screen might suggest otherwise). In this instance, we see things from the perspective of Nina (Natalie Portman)—a ballerina who has high hopes of nabbing the lead role in a somewhat offbeat rendition of Swan Lake. Nina is a perfectionist, and as such she inevitably has trouble taking on the role of the Swan's ""evil twin"": a being that works via lithe seduction. This, as Nina is informed, is a role that requires that she ""let go"" of her more rigid tendencies as a dancer. Having been kept under the wing of her equally prim and proper mother—echoes of John Locke abound—it's no wonder that Nina soon begins to suffer a psychotic meltdown.<br/><br/>Juxtaposed against Nina is Lily (Mila Kunis), a newly arrived performer from San Francisco who's everything our protagonist is not. Lily is, in a certain sense, a ""free spirit,"" and she's able to assume the essence of the black swan with relative ease. The dichotomy/rivalry that emerges is fascinating to watch, as it's really a materialization of Nina's deteriorating psyche (in the most extreme sense, one could almost label this a ""loss of innocence"" tale, though ""annihilation of normality"" might be more fitting).<br/><br/>To say this is the crowning jewel of Portman's young career is an understatement. She's brilliant as Nina, and I can't imagine anyone else having done the part justice. Kunis is great too, as is Vincent Cassel (the lusty director who does everything he can to bring forth Nina's inner bad girl).<br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind for anyone interested in checking out Black Swan is that it isn't for the squeamish. There are some incredibly uncomfortable scenes that play out just as awkwardly as you might imagine, but, as much as I oppose an over-abundance of raunchiness, I'll concede Aronofsky's directorial prowess and say that it certainly did add a worthwhile element of depravity that might otherwise have seemed elusive.<br/><br/>So, after all that, would I say that Black Swan deserved the accolades that seemed to have been endlessly showered up on it.<br/><br/>Yes. It's symbolism made tangible on celluloid. It is, in the most primal sense, the true embodiment of ""art""."

","I avoided this at the box office first-run. I just watched it (9/2012) on HBO. It is is very well made. The main reason I am writing this review is not only to let people know that it's interesting and moves along well. It's nothing like I thought it would be. More importantly, I have seen the film characterized in a number of ways in other reviews or summaries. There seems to be a consistent pattern of declarative statements being made about characters in the film in areas where the movie is ambiguous. One of the reasons I LIKE the film is because you can't be sure where reality ends and Nina's drug/pressure-induced imaginings begin. Mila Kunis's character of Lily is key in this area of uncertainty I am describing, but certainly not the only one. The thematic touchstone of people encouraging Nina to ""Lose(her)self"" sets the stage for this psychotic metamorphosis."
"Cat-Wings","10","1","4","22 June 2012"," It's a perfect thrill, and it's about the tragedy of a perfectionist.
","The director of a brilliant film ""Requiem for a Dream"", Darren Aronofsky has directed another psycho thriller, ""Black Swan."" The story is about a young woman, Nina (Natalie Portman), who belongs to a New York ballet company, and lives with her mother who is a former ballerina, placing a hope in Nina to become the Swan Queen. When the director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), chooses Nina as the new prima ballerina for their new season, and Swan Lake, Nina starts being driven into a corner by the fear of immeasurable pressure to play a perfect role on the stage and the competition against other ballerinas. As the Swan Queen, Nina is required to play both the White Swan which is innocent and fragile, and the Black Swan which is seductive and has sensual guile. Whilst Thomas likes Nina's talent as the White Swan, he also wants Nina to become a personification challenge while playing the Black Swan, like Lily (Mila Kunis), who is an alternate for the Swan Queen role, and is more of a party girl with a fun attitude. Along with Nina's twisted interactions with her over-parenting mother, Lily as a competitor and considerate friend, Beth who is the former Swan Queen (Winona Ryder) and is being corrupted herself after her replacement in the role of the Swan Queen, and Thomas, Nina suffers between her perfectionism as the Swan Queen and mental obfuscation with a self-destructive face due to the pressure.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, the fear and confusion that Nina keeps holding reaches a peak. It seems like she is almost unable to play the Swan role because of her confusion, but at the same time her perfectionism of playing the Swan Queen arouses her emotions and makes her toe loops precise. The fact that no one can help Nina makes her situation worsen. It somehow reminds me of ""Requiem for a Dream"", where two young people fall in love and become addicted to drugs, meaning the situation is ""hopeless.""<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" is a great story and a well-depicted sense of pressure and fear. I wonder if this film gives a different impression between men and women, since the emotional feeling towards pressure would be different."
"zaciogeribello","10","1","4","23 May 2012"," This movie is a complete lesson of Art in its highest level
","We should not watch this movie with the regular references of almost every movie we see. There isn't such a thing like a normal or regular movie, actually they are often made to be distinctive and original, but in this case I'd suggest you to watch or watch it again as a pure project of art, object of art, work of art, as the most strong expression of it. Then Black Swan will show you very different things, unusual ones, a whole new movie that must now be read as a complex language, as a very strong piece of aesthetics. Pure Art!<br/><br/>If we don't do this, if our eyes are nude and unprepared, our instinct probably will drive us to elect a story and some protagonist that will compose an expectation for outcomes, even if it is just a wish for twist and surprise. This movie would give you a good response also in this case, but then you'd loose a wonderful opportunity to get really engaged with the experience of art making, and that the movie hides from a vision too quick and shows it to those who are willing to see something more elaborated. There are other movies like that: Mephisto, All That Jazz, Camille Claudel, La Belle Noiseuse, connect the audience with this parallel universe, the language and the secrets of artistic creation. We shouldn't miss it. That means the plot offers now another drama, and that would be no longer the priority of space and time, or of a square, round or fuzzy story, or a game to play about the destiny of every character and the facts told. You'd see now a story with meaningful elements of human finest creation, Art, the fire itself. You'd be merged in the world of aesthetics and a new hero would lie underneath: Prometheus. He is writing this level of the story.<br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman) is a character that goes all the way across this complete transformation. Black Swan is a tragedy of creation. We should not cheer for our favorite character or outcome anymore, but we should just appreciate the conflicts and challenges of art making. And it's so hard, it asks for everything in us, it tears us apart so we can become the nicest artists. Art in its ultimate impulse and inspiration is a heroic search for beauty as perfection. Nothing less makes any sense. That's what starts tho happen with Nina, in the moment she decides to do the perfect show, to be the perfect dancer in artistic standards, no less. The movie turns into language, it's not verisimilitude what matters the most in this approach, but the limit between fantasy and reality. Nina wants to be just art in her show but to do that she has to call so many delicate or deep conflicts she cannot stand. But it doesn't matter, because she is in search for perfection. It isn't just her. The director, the public, the world, the company, all of them want Nina to completely give herself to her performance, except for her mother, that struggles to keep her daughter within some known limits.<br/><br/>The intense battle between the White and the Black Swan is incorporated in the production of the show, and the leading dancer is the one that holds the key for success in the expression of Art at its highest level. All the time she has to make decisions, if she is going to keep the ways she has been so far or if she is braking all grounds that are necessary to give the show an impressive result, which would be Nina seducing everyone by her performance. But she can be also destroyed in this search. This environment is formed and takes complete control of the movie. It becomes even weird for those who would prefer a conventional story, let's say that. The black swan (character) would be the antagonist but in Art it's not, it is the key for beauty of the show. We could think that the new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) would personify the Black Swan, but it also isn't true, in part, it's ambiguous, she kind of holds the Black Swan qualities, but in reality, as Lily herself, not as the character of the show. Here we understand that there is a mix between the characters of the show and the characters of the movie, and this distinction also falls in some moments.<br/><br/>The director and the mother work in the story to make it even more tense. Unforgettable acting of Vincent Cassel and excellent acting of Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis. Natalie Portman's acting is perfect! She is able to bring to the audience all this complexity of the movie, being a regular one or a project of pure Art in highest level. She traduces to us intensely all the conflicts, limitations and changes Nina operates, she brings beauty to us in the form described above, as a very serious work about aesthetics. The final result is Art and a wonderful movie about Art. She will probably will get the Oscar for that."

"sashank_kini-1","6","1","4","19 February 2012"," A Flawed Premise Executed With Finesse
","'The Black Swan' is a flawed piece of work, albeit executed with honesty, commitment and vision. It is like a great football match played on a basketball court; a ballet dancer's life becoming ballistic is believable but not when she has the top spot already. <br/><br/>Nina Sayers is a committed, technical ballet dancer who believes in perfecting all her moves to be perfect. She faces the harshest adversity in herself when she has to play something she is not, or rather something she believes she isn't. It is not the unthinkable to conceive of such a plot; usually actors do face this challenge in real life when they are given parts contradictory to their personalities. They opt for different routes to bring out the personality in them – some empathize with their characters by putting themselves in their situation, some do the lazy and easiest but less satisfying job of 'acting' it out externally while some begin to rediscover themselves. Nina Sayers, who has to tackle both the white swan and the black, for her role of Swan Queen, chooses the third route, which itself comes as a surprise since she believes so much in technique and prettiness, I thought she could've faked it with external expressions. But she is pushed to the limits by her tough artistic director, Thomas, who employs sexual methods to invoke some stimulus from the actors. Also she fears she may not live up to her role, and disappoint the audience and the previous swan queen Beth. Fear of being replaced by Lily, the alternate, haunts her while pressure from her embittered mother strains her. Nina's gradual discovery of the blackness within her threatens to obliterate the goodness and purity that she believes she has retained throughout her life. Her contrived existence becomes a narcissistic one which ultimately culminates in the 'grand performance of her career'.<br/><br/>The plot of Black Swan is a contrived one pretending to be convoluted, as it takes the overused approach of 'going' surreal and eerie in order to overlook the loopholes in the film. If I compare this with 'Mulholland Drive', a vastly better film, the first noticeable difference in both the films is the position of the characters – Naomi was a failed actress who had plotted to kill her bisexual lover who got the part, while Nina Sayers has already got the main part. Who seems more susceptible to madness – Naomi's Diane or Natalie's Nina? I pick the first, and would most, because failure drives you nuts. Success may send one to the rehab, but that usually involves overuse of drugs or heightened anxiety over a long period. Nina here does something that's generally not done by sane people by the end of the film, and it's just her first performance as the Swan Queen. Also, judging by her personality, who in the right state of mind would have picked her for such a sterling performance? It's almost exploitation of a disturbed woman, and we viewers are witnesses to the act. How did no one notice the abrasive change in her mental condition? Or are we to think that everyone in ballet is cruel and willing to sacrifice someone in the process of creating an act? Nina's mental decadence seemed implausible just because of a night out, high pressure and Dermatillomania; the only effects that I could see was some vomiting, headaches, tantrums and a reparable breakdown. Unfortunately, Darren goes for a 'showy Oscar-moment' ending instead and fools the audience – even I got fooled on my first viewing of The Black Swan. Not in the second, though. The movie progresses well till be have the untimely sex, bloodshed and looniness that just come out of nowhere like the alligator in 'Adaptation'. It then becomes maudlin, overwrought and reckless, like an orchestra being suddenly accompanied by DJs and strippers. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman won an Oscar for portraying a timid wreck in the film, and she worked hard for this role. My father must've surely seen her in some previous film, but couldn't recognize her here and indeed, it's hard to because she lost so much weight. I could make out from this performance that she worked well as long as the director used her well. In the hands of a mediocre director or a mediocre film, she may crumble – just watch her cringe-worthy performance in Your Highness. She however, and it's partly because the script itself is riddled with improbabilities and excesses, doesn't realize her Black Swan as well as the White one on screen. Surely she danced well and snogged well, but she made herself look more like a spoiled girl than a disturbed girl. I remember Jessica Lange's applaud-worthy portrayal in 'Frances' – Natalie is not so good an actress to transcend her character's complexities on the screen fully but she does try her at least. Mila Kunis, in a relatively simpler performance maintains her character well, and so does Vincent Cassell. Again I felt the film would've been more effective had Thomas himself been the Prince along with the director. Hershey and Ryder do their duties as mother and ex-Swan Queen respectively, especially Hershey as her scenes with Natalie are standouts.<br/><br/>Darren gives a claustrophobic film, not only by limiting the characters to a few, but also by having tight close-ups of Nina throughout. It is hard to believe that Nina only was involved with Thomas and the guy playing prince, since the rehearsals would've had to integrate all the other performers as well at the later stage. Again, this is common aspect among psychological-thrillers to sidetrack the event itself and focus on prime characters. The close shots though are praiseworthy; we are constantly updated on Nina's state of mind. The cinematography and production are bleak and brilliant and robbed of Oscars. <br/><br/>I wish the film had ended differently, or started differently or progressed differently instead of serving this.<br/><br/>My Rating: 6 out of 10"

"ChrisIhao","9","1","4","22 October 2011"," Why talk about ballet when you can talk about psychology
","I gave this move 9 out of 10, not because it correctly portraits the world of ballet (and frankly I wouldn't know), not because it brings something completely new to the table but because it captures the psychology of the desperately worn out and borderline psychotic mind in such a wonderful manner.<br/><br/>Its clear from the beginning that something is quite not right. Small sounds seem ""out of place"" and details in the picture seems to shift just an inch or so. The life of Nina seems to exclusively revolve around her profession and, of reasons not disclosed to the viewer, it seems like she has been conserved into emotional immaturity by still living at home with her mother and probably also lies to Thomas about not being a virgin. She simply has had no natural development of emotional boundaries and do not know how to relate to people around her. She looks at the world pretty much in black or white, and hence people around her pretty much have good or bad intentions, not something in between.<br/><br/>My interpretation is that all the way through the movie we see only what Nina sees and not an objective representation of the world. By pushing herself to the limits, something which has probably been well on its way even before the movie starts, the defense mechanisms of the mind starts to shatter when she is forced into confronting her undeveloped darker sides to fit into the role.<br/><br/>We don't really know much about Nina or her mother, but we can suspect that things haven't been easy growing up alone with her obviously neurotic and protective mother, and that she consequently have been pulling into the safe haven of herself (the way the mother acts seems to be largely due to bad experiences with self harming in the past, perhaps something even more serious). Instead of working with understanding her own emotions she has to some extent managed to replace these necessary parts with striving to be the perfect ballerina.<br/><br/>A lot of the user reviews here on IMDb seems to focus on technicalities, if the movie is completely original and just about everything but the psychological aspect. I work with young people with psychological problems and I have to admit that I actually cried after the final scene, something I very rarely do. I can all too well recognize how life is too hard for some young people, no matter if you're a ballerina or if you work in an office, and how self mutilation and even attempts of suicide seems to comfort and replace the damaged parts of the human mind. The hard life of being a prima ballerina could very well be interpreted into the pressure of participating in modern society. Even most of us get along somehow, a lot of people are left behind to fend for themselves emotionally. With my background I think the movie pretty accurately captures what many of these people struggle with.<br/><br/>In the very end she has taken the ultimate step towards ""losing herself"" like Thomas asks her to, perhaps more correctly demands of her. Multiple times during the movie she sees the ""darker self"" within her externalized, and perhaps by finally mortally damaging herself she finally overcomes it and is able to let herself be free, hence enabling her to give the greatest performance of her life.<br/><br/>Its clear to me that Aronofsky has consulted with experts on human psychology when he made this movie to make it as realistic as possible. Even small details, like how low sounds seems to be much louder than they normally should be, and the manner in which reality seems to mix with illusions, up to the facial expressions of Nina seems to feel quite realistic to me. Some of you mention that the movie at times resembles a horror movie, but guess what: having a mind break down is sometimes much worse than any horror movie you have seen, in particular when you are self destructive at the time.<br/><br/>For me this is a 9 out 10 just because it did something within me as I saw the movie. I don't think the movie will change the world, or me for that matter, but even so it is a nice portrayal of a young woman on the border of breaking down.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Chris<br/><br/>PS: That many of you gave the movie 1 out of 10 is a joke, and frankly I can not take you people seriously for the rest of your hobbyist reviewing lives. Even if you thought the movie sucked you should have given it at least a 4 or 5 out of respect for the fine craftsmanship in terms of music or filmography. Imho."

","I have found this movie pointless. I have to give it 3 of 10 just because of acting of Portman and Cassel and some visual aspects. But as a whole it's really just another - in fact really boring - sport movie. This is all the same regardless of kind of sport (boxing, skiing, dancing etc.) - the main figure is struggling her/his own fight of being better. That's it. No more - no less. But in this case it's extremely quasi-intellectual and at the same time sensual and the result is pointless mixture of feelings and no sense of telling this story at all. P.S. I intently do not compare this film with others of Aronofski's creations."

","It's funny how most reviews that I've read of this movie are on opposite ends of the spectrum; viewers either love it or absolutely can't stand it. While many have criticized this movie as a pseudo-art-house piece, I can't help but think that a piece of work should be recognized as having artistic merit simply because of its ability to produce such vehement criticism and equally passionate defense.<br/><br/>I'm one of the people who absolutely loved this movie. I think this is because of my experience as a professional dancer/performer--I went in expecting a ballet movie with a dark twist, but I got something else entirely. In fact, the dancing itself is rarely shown on screen, which made some people angry. However, I think the fact that the actual dancing did not have much presence worked for the underlying theme of the movie, which I found to be that the audience never sees (and wouldn't want to see) the agony and drama that goes into a breathtaking performance on stage. Yes, there was a ""Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde"" element to the movie, but that wasn't what stood out for me.<br/><br/>This movie hit a little too close to home for me. It made me physically uncomfortable--I was sweaty, my heart was pounding, tears would sometimes well up in my eyes, and my face was visibly flushed when I left the theater--not because I've had lesbian trysts or hallucinations, but because I've strived for perfection in a similar way as Nina does in the movie. I fought the natural shape of my body, my instructor played constant mind games with me (but was not sexually abusive like in this movie, thank goodness), and I tried my hardest to play by the rules, to not speak up or defend myself, and to create the physical perfection that I thought my coaches, parents, and audiences wanted from me. I can't remember the number of times that I was told to ""loosen up"" or ""embrace the character"" or ""stop focusing on the technical aspects"". When I saw someone going through something similar on screen, it touched me in a way that most movies haven't.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is fantastic. Natalie Portman's performance, to me, is pitch perfect, and avoids the pitfalls of the melodramatic that she could have easily resorted to. Mila Kunis's performance is highly underrated--she's sexy and carefree in a way that offers the perfect foil to Portman's repressed performance. Winona Ryder is excellent and completely believable in her pivotal supporting role (except for one thing--I think an ex-ballerina would have long hair. Most ballerinas must have long hair to create a ballet bun, and it is unlikely that someone clinging to her career would have cut her hair), and Vincent Cassel is perfectly creepy and manipulative--I can see myself falling victim to his games. I'd never seen an Aronovsky film before this one, but I will certainly seek his other work out, as I thought the direction of the movie, it's overall look and tone, the music, and editing were all brilliant.<br/><br/>This movie gets inside of your head. Don't see it if you aren't up for being uncomfortable while you watch--there are plenty of flinch-worthy, almost horror movie-like moments. But if you can handle it, see it. You may not love it, but you'll certainly have an opinion about it."

","When I started to hear that director Darren Aronofsky was beginning to work on his follow up piece to his stunning 2008 film The Wrestler, (which is easily in my all time top ten movies) my interest in the film started to reach an almost insane level of expectation. (especially when I read up some articles,which said that Black Swan was going to be a companion piece to The Wrestler)Sitting down in the cinema,I began to get myself prepared to be completely blown away by this film. As the credits started to role,my main feelings of the film were some of the most mixed that I have had for any movie,which was mainly due to it not completely just being The Wrestle-Part:2 (which is also something I now feel very stupid about).Leaveing the cinema,I started to get very strong feelings that I needed to watch the film again,due to having a strong sense that there is something very special in the film,which I would catch more of on repeat viewings.With the DVD having at last come out in the UK, (sadly with no extras) I rushed out to get hold of it,so I could at last see what,my lingering senses had picked up on.<br/><br/>plot:<br/><br/>Having had a weird dream/nightmare,Nina Sayers gets out of bed and starts performing yoga,so she is all set to return for a new season of training at a highly regarded ballet school.Just before she leaves to catch the train to the school,Nina tells her mum Erica, (who decided to give up her ballet training,when she became pregnant with Nina) that the lead dance choreography-Thomas Leroy has said that she might have a more prominent role in their productions.Being happy that her daughter might have a great opportunity ahead of her,Erica gets a bit distressed when,she notices that Nina has some strange scratches on her back.Telling her mum that its nothing at all,Nina rushes to the ballet school.where all the students are told that they have to take part in an audition for the next production:a ""re-worked"" take on Swan Lake.With having failed to be picked Nina confronts Leroy over his decision.Thomas tells her that whilst she is a perfect fit for the sweet and innocent White Swan,he strongly feels that Nina lacks the willingness to ""Lose herself"" and,turn into the very aggressive Black Swan (a transformation that occurs to the lead character in the ballet.)Suddenly,Leroy gives Nina a strong kiss,which lasts until she shows her ""aggressive"" side,by biting him hard on the lips.To her surprise,Nina is suddenly given the lead role of the White/Black Swan.Sadly her opportunity to celebrate is short-lived,due to Leroy constantly telling Nina that she must show him the anger,which was shown when she bit his lips.Ninas increasing anxiety's are also not helped,when Thomas threatens to replace Nina,with a more care-free,less perfectionist student called Lily,who he says has the ""perfect"" attitude to play the White and the Black Swan.With Nina starting to feel that shes losing her grip on the role,Nina decides to dive headfirst,into attempting to embrace the ""Black Swan"" side of her personality.Due to the constant battles of letting her perfectionist,more innocent side fade away,Ninas body begins to literary tear itself apart,as the pressure of the role starts to consume her life,Nina also begins to experience some very disturbing hallucinations,which start to make it very hard for Nina to tell what is real,and what in her imagination...<br/><br/>View on film:<br/><br/>Looking at Aronofskys stunning directing of the film,I was surprised to notice one of the main filming techniques for The Wrestler,being noticeably taken to the extreme for this film,with the camera being kept very close to Nina from the moment she starts walking to the school,which, in a similar effect to the ""ring"" scenes in The Wrestle,helps to give a very deep feeling of claustrophobia,when Nina starts to become obsessed about transforming into the Black Swan.Noticeably,Aronofsky uses this effect for the whole film,that really helps to give a strong,fearful sense of paranoia,as Nina psychology starts to melt.With having enjoyed watching David Croenbergs 1975 horror Shivers,I was very impressed with how cleverly Aronofsky was able to use Croenbergs body-horror,in a way which massively helps to show the changes in Ninas personality and attitude,by showing Nina at first, being very scared as her body starts attempting to burst Nina out of her ""innocent"" White Swan side,to her at the end almost,excepting the more ""wild and care-free"" Black Swan side as the whole entity of her personality and attitude.For the amazing screenplay,writers Andres Heinz, (who also came up with the story of the film),Mark Heyman and John McLaughlin have the character of Lily, (played by Mila Kunis,who gives a truly outstanding performance)be someone that the audience can have a completely different view on during their repeat viewings of the film.Whilst the screenplay wisely takes its time to revel ""the change"" that is happening to Nina,by setting up the character and the ballet school environment which she is surrounded in. (which on my first viewing of the film,was something that felt too slow paced)On my second viewing of the film,I was left startled as the end credits began,when I realised that some of the things that happen to Nina,had been hinted at right from the start of the film,such as Nina stealing a lipstick from the schools fading star Beth Maclntyre, (brilliantly played by Winona Ryder)which the ""Black Swan"" side of Nina.may have used to write something pretty disturbing in the schools bathroom,to perhaps attempt to start loosening the grip of Ninas ""White Swan"" side.For this performance,Natalie Portman gives a stunning performance as she shows, Ninas initial terror of what is happening to her change,to eventually becoming obsessed with having the Black Swan be the dominating entity,which might ""help"" Nina to break out of her life-long shell.<br/><br/>Final View:<br/><br/>An unforgettable,psychological horror- style drama/thriller,with an intense screenplay,extremely clever directing and astonishing performances from the whole cast."

","Have you ever got a feeling that your are caged in your body, in your look, in your style, in the image you created for years deliberately or notHave you ever wanted to see a different reflection? Have you ever let your dark side be in charge, your black side, your free side... Have you been a black swan? In a tiny café while waiting for the movie we were glancing over some booklets featuring the cinema's event guide. A small review on ""Black Swan"" by Darren Aranofsky was illustrated with the Natalie Portman's image. She was wearing a tutu – a ballet dancer marbled in a graceful pose. I thought – a movie about ballet? Interesting.<br/><br/>But ballet and this century-old story of struggling to become a ""prima ballerina"" is just a cover of the film, its scenery, its curtain It is just a decoration the protagonist is set into. It would be totally ignorant to say ""Black Swan"" is about ballet. Though there is a lot of ballet, a beautiful ballet by the way, marvelously performed by Natalie Portman as Nina.<br/><br/>I would say this film is about transformation and self-discovery. It is about growing up and getting independence and inner freedom. It is about self-harmony painfully attained through the torturing acts of unlocking smaller and bigger doors in yourself to let your passions out, to let your demons live side by side with your angels, to find a black swan in yourself <br/><br/>Natalie Portman absolutely succeeded in showing this stunning soul transformation. In all the details, with all shades and colours, deeply and persuasive. Her acting is over-the top and all awards and nominations speak for herself. Portman won Oscar as an Actress in a Leading Role and if you still had doubts about her outstanding talent – forget them! <br/><br/>And if you had doubts about Aranofsky – shame on you! ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Pi"", ""The Fountain"", ""The Wrestler"" It is something unstoppable about Darren. Something that squeezes its way to your heart even through the complete dubbing, capturing it even on the small screen of your 13'' laptop. This ""something"" is often called a signature style, I would call it Aranofsky's touch. You are always touched and always touched in a different way."

","As someone said, a path of beauty isn't soft and smooth - it's full of harshness and asperity. When a talented but not to the level of genius ballerina Nina landed the part of Swan Queen in Tchaikovsky's immortal masterpiece Swan Lake she was warned about her limitations. The part required her to create two opposite images: one of the pure innocent White Swan, and another of the sultry, seductive and treacherous Black Swan. She was perfect for the role of White Swan but was failing to express the nature of the evil twin. Nina's own nature is that of a perfectionist: perfection is her religion, self-control is her Bible. But now she comes to realize that her Bible is exactly the thing that barricades her from perfection. She must ""burn"" her Bible, i.e. self-control, if she wants to grasp the wild, unrestrained nature of the Black Swan. This conflict is throwing her mind into turbulence and then into full-blown insanity. Yes, she ""burns"" her Bible and triumphs in the brilliant performance. But to achieve the absolute perfection she must also die in the end as the role demands. So be it. This is the explanations of why she did what she did in the last moment."

","I will start by saying that this movie is exquisite. It truly is a remarkable film. It is beautiful, powerful, and unique like no other film I have seen. It will probably go down as one of my top 10 favorite films of all time. And, I don't say that lightly.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is top notch. Natalie Portman delivers her role so perfectly that I completely forgot who I was watching on screen. But it's not just Portman who makes the film. The rest of the cast are astounding as well. Mila Kunis proves that she is capable of much more than people thought. Barbara Hershey, as Portman's Mother, is equally brilliant. Why she was not nominated for a Supporting Actress Oscar is beyond me. Vincent Cassel was also amazing, as always. And, even Winona Ryder, who only appears on screen a few times, was outstanding. The cast was put together perfectly. I really can't imagine anyone else playing these roles.<br/><br/>I'm beyond shocked that not only did this film not win Best Picture from the Academy, it didn't even snag Best Direction. Darren Aronofsky was jipped. That, I am sure of. He is brilliant, and this film tops all of his prior films. The colors, the camera movements... everything is perfect. PERFECT!<br/><br/>Please, if you are debating on watching this film because it looks ""weird""... WATCH IT!! I was hesitant on watching it as well. I didn't rush to the theaters to see it, as some did. But, now I wish I had. Yes, there are times you will say ""What the hell just happened?!""... but by the time the film wraps, all your questions will be answered. I may have been watching in my living room, but I applauded as the film ended. I also may have shed a few tears... The point is, RENT IT! Hell, buy it!! I know I will be.

","... and that's by design.<br/><br/>The central theme of this film is so disturbing and distasteful that it had to be communicated in the most subtle and subdued way. It had to be this way to avoid the box office-killing NC-17 rating, and also to keep scores of people from being disgusted and turned off. Darren Aronofsky, known for his blunt style, had to resort to this extreme subtlety out of necessity, and the result is a film that is brilliant.<br/><br/>Now that you've had enough time to stop reading before hitting a spoiler, here is the bottom line. This film is about an obsessive-compulsive young woman slowly losing her mind. The reason: her sexually abusive mother. That's it. The incestuous relationship is only hinted at various points in the film. I noticed four, although there may be more: 1) When the mother gets Nina to lick the frosting off her finger, 2) When the mother tells Nina to take off her shirt and she yells ""no"", suggesting that getting undressed at her mother's command was not an unusual occurrence, 3) When Nina jumps into bed moments before the mother comes into the room asking ""are you ready for me?"" (this one's a dead give-away -- what else can it mean?), and 4) Spout's theory that ""... coming home, still high from rolling, Nina's mom accosts her in her state and has sex with her. However because of her state, Nina is more responsive than usual because she is imagining that she is with Lily (it is later revealed that Lily never came home with Nina). That's why the shot of the mom on top of Nina is one of the mom smiling before she continues oral sex with Nina."" <br/><br/>In ballet, Nina has found refuge from this horrific existence, which explains her obsession with her art. In the end, she cracks up from the inside, and this is what we get to witness from her point of view."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","4","24 March 2011"," Drowning in Swan Lake
","Darren Aronofsky is a pure film artist, one of the best of his generation. His specialty comes with exploring characters that are coming apart under the stress of paranoia, yet he never makes his films boring or depressing. It is exciting to watch his characters thrash about, trying to get a handle on their situation. With his 1998 debut Pi, he examined a paranoid mathematician who was trying to unlock the coded patterns of the universe. In 2000's Requiem for a Dream, he followed Ellen Burstyn (in a brilliant performance) into a diet pill addiction that led to a rubber room. Then with The Wrestler two years ago, he followed the fall and disgrace of a former professional wrestler played by Mickey Rourke whose life goes from bad to worse.<br/><br/>Those were great films but I think he has finally found the best arena for his kind of melodrama: ballet. Black Swan is a gorgeous looking but sometimes horrifying story (as great ballets sometimes are) about a woman so obsessed with perfection that she ends up losing her marbles. Aronofsky uses Swan Lake as a template to tell a story that is both grounded in reality and in flights of terrifying fancy. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayer, a fragile spirit who was pushed into the world of ballet by her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey), and now occupies a place in the New York Ballet Company. Under the tutelage of the demanding company director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), Nina is poised for the lead in the new production of Swan Lake, which has been recast after Thomas ousted the former lead Beth McEntyre (Winona Ryder). Pushed between Thomas, her mother, and her obsession with perfecting her dancing (set off when Thomas tells her that she has the chops to play the white swan but not the black one), Nina's mind is coming apart. Added to that stress is the presence of a new member to the company, a free-spirit named Lily (Mila Kunis) who Nina fears will take her place.<br/><br/>This sounds like the standard, ordinary backstage drama - All About Eve in a tutu - but the movie is focused squarely at Nina's point of view and makes her journey into a dark and seductive thriller. Nina sees things that aren't there, like injures to her fingers and back (if you know the basic structure of Swan Lake, you quickly deduce why). She becomes paranoid about losing her part. She thinks Lily is out to sabotage her. She sees herself doing things in the mirror that she is not doing in reality.<br/><br/>There is a stark and frightening melodrama at work here but also a fascinating mystery. The more you understand the basic plot of Swan Lake, the quicker you will understand what is happening to Nina. Yet, even if you don't, the underlying mystery unfolds beautifully leading to one of the most exhilarating final acts that I have seen in a movie in years. Finally, like a breath of fresh air, it is nice to see a movie whose ending isn't telegraphed from the beginning.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is a revelation here. I've been watching her for years in a variety of roles both good and bad but something came out of her in this movie that I didn't expect. I know that she is a wonderful actor but I wasn't aware that she was such a good re-actor. Most actors stand by, waiting for the moment but Portman knows how to play to a situation. Here she is asked to play a character who is in a constant state of stress and confusion. She wears the pain right at the center of her face and around her eyes. If her performance seems somewhat overwrought, then consider that ballet itself thrives on that very thing.<br/><br/>That's what makes the movie work and why the third act is such a kicker. We've followed this young woman on a strange journey and, in the end, we are taken down to her inevitable fate. But the finale isn't the point, it is the strange journey getting there. The film is lurid and grotesque but it finds a balance of tone that keeps us watching. This is Aronofsky's best film and, to my taste, the best film of 2010.<br/><br/>**** (of four)"

","I was scared that I might've been getting a little too hyped up for this and my expectations would be set too high and I'd end up being disappointed with it, feeling like it was over rated rubbish. But, ""Black Swan"" didn't just meet my high expectations, but exceeded them.<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin with this absolute masterpiece (or marsterpiece as my art teacher would say) it is simply extraordinary. Let's start with the obvious. The performances. Natalie Portman deserves every single award she's nominated for. Not only did she dance like a professional but she managed to still emphasise with her character whilst still remembering her moves. That requires some serious skill! Portman should get that Oscar! Barbara Hershey was equally as mind blowing as the over protected, slightly (well, maybe a little more than slightly) loopy mother. Barbara was terrifying! She was like Carrie's mum (in the scary sense, not in the disturbing religious sense) and I hope she wins something as well. The womanising teacher was great, as was the rival ballet woman. Every performance (like in ""The King's Speech) was fantastic! ""Black Swan"" is a marsterclarse in directing (that's masterclass) right from the editing to the camera shots it was perfect. The final scene was shot so intensely that my pulse was racing, but we'll get to that in a minute. I've never seen a Darren Arfronskey film before but by gum I will do now! Every scare counts and is effective. Nina's slow decomposition into hell is perfectly paced.<br/><br/>The screenplay is solid and captivating. Letting us experience every bit of horror are mentally unstable person can experience. I can't remember actually watching a film before and just being sucked into the world of the film. It felt like I was actually there and when it was over I felt so disorientated and dizzy (no it's not because I'm middle aged) I was just absolutely astounded by what i just witnessed. The film can be so well analysed, it is so clever it's unbelievable. Kids should be analysing this at school! Not ""Death Of A Salesman"" Why do people keep commenting on ""there's too much ballet""? Yeah there is but it's completely purposeful to the film! They didn't just think ""Oh, let's bung some ballet there for the intellectual's"" it's meaningful and I actually enjoyed it! (and I'm not gay!) The last half hour or so was bloody intense! It was like all she had been waiting for was building up and suddenly released it was beautiful, stunning! No words can describe the ending! It is just heart pounding. I was left speechless, the first words that came out of my mouth were ""Oh my god!"" Yeah, it's literally mind blowing.<br/><br/>I could write an essay on how incredible ""Black Swan"" is but it still wouldn't justify it. It is possibly the greatest film I've ever seen. At the end of the film Nina says ""It was perfect"" and I couldn't agree more."
"cory_j_adams","10","1","4","28 February 2011"," The Dark Side of Professional Ballet
","Black Swan was something else when it first premiered at Sundance. I saw it when it came out at our local theatre. As I always write, I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. It seemed pretty interesting from what I saw in the trailers: a classic psychological thriller, only it was set in the world of professional ballet. I was thinking let's try something new, so I did.<br/><br/>I was utterly mesmerized. It was a near perfect film that brought me deep into a place that I didn't even know existed. Darren Aronofsky did something a little different from some of his previous. I saw Requiem for a Dream and absolutely loved it, so he was one of the reasons I was practically drawn to the film. Natalie Portman gives the performance of her career as Nina, the films White Swan, and so does Mila Kunis as Lily, the films Black Swan, for whom I have only known as Jackie on That 70's Show. She definitely stepped out of her comfort zone to play this role. Natalie's transformation from the soft and graceful White Swan to the seductive and sensual Black Swan was truly something to experience.<br/><br/>In the end, I walked out the theatre having learned a lesson: that someone's perfection can be their greatest imperfection. Natalie depicted that perfectly. I would not change anything about it. (BTW, I saw the Oscars last night and was so hyped Natalie won. I think she truly deserved it):)"
"erobertdc","10","1","4","18 February 2011"," A brilliant piece of ""Magical Realism""
","The movie is not actually about ballet - it is more about an inner dialog that Nina has with herself in preparing for the part of the Black Swan, given that she is a perfectionist.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, we see that she lives with her mother and her bedroom is completely pink with stuffed animals. This seems extremely odd, given that Nina seems to be a grown woman concerned about being an aging ballerina. The movie is more fun to analyze if we interpret it like a Kafka novel where perception is reality.<br/><br/>In this sense, the real Nina may not even live with her mother of have an entirely pink bedroom - these are just reflections about how she sees herself. At one point we see her grabbing a few of her stuffed animals, running to the garbage shoot in her apartment building and thrusting them down the shoot exclaiming that she is not a child anymore. This is just a metaphor for Nina trying to escape her child like nature.<br/><br/>Through out the film, Natalie Portman portrays Nina with a grimace - what seems to be a very concerned smile. This results in a vary flat performance for Portman, but it is exactly what the script requires - this grimaced perfectionist is exactly how Nina sees herself.<br/><br/>Her competitor for the role of the Black Swan is Lily who seems to embody all the personality characteristics Nina does not have. Nina is very suspicious of Lily and one might say that Lily's character embodies all the sources of the neuroses that Nina has. <br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie, Nina destroys Lily but ends up stabbing herself - a metaphor for the great sacrifice she has made to achieve the part of the Black Swan.<br/><br/>In the final scene, she jumps and lands (as the White Swan's role requires) but the other dancers see that she has stabbed herself for her bodice is red with blood. The ballet director comes over and immediately he sees the blood and calls for help. This, indeed, is the final triumph of any artist, to give everything to that role ( or painting or book) and then be recognized for that effort.<br/><br/>Given this ""Magical Realism"" framework it is indeed fascinating to go through the movie and try to interpret the succession of events. In this way, the movie is truly amazing."
"Red-Barracuda","9","1","4","14 February 2011"," A great companion piece to The Red Shoes. Quite outstanding.
","Black Swan is surely a film that lives up to the hype. Like many of the best films, its story-line is quite a simple one. An innocent ballerina is cast in the lead role in a production of Swan Lake. Her producer admires her technique but doesn't think she is sexually free enough when dancing to pull off the role of the Black Swan. From this point onwards she immerses herself so much into the role that a transformation starts to happen<br/><br/>The combination of beauty and darkness is extremely compelling. It reminded me very much of the other ballet masterpiece The Red Shoes in it's depiction of a beautiful art-form and the consequences it can have on the psychology of its performers. In that film too, the idea of life imitating art with tragic consequences was a major aspect. Both films also incorporated fantastical elements into their otherwise straight narrative. In The Red Shoes it was as a means to show the central dance performance in a way that was cinematic as well as expressive, where in Black Swan it's used to show the psychological breakdown of the central character's mind. This often goes quite clearly into horror cinema territory, and I did often find myself genuinely on edge; mainly because this is a film that often goes places that are hard to predict.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is a revelation in the central role. It's a truly iconic performance. She looks quite beautiful in the dance scenes and is never less than convincing as a troubled girl. She is well supported by Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey. This truly is a film of exceptional acting. But what makes Black Swan such a brilliant work is that these performances are incorporated into something very cinematic. It's not just a solid drama; it's also a very dark and unsettling thriller with beautifully creative visuals and dynamic camera-work. It doesn't matter which of the nominated films wins the big prize at this years Oscars, Black Swan is the one that is going to last the test of time."
"Ricardo-36","6","1","4","4 February 2011"," It's ""Eraserhead"" for stupid 16 year old girls
","This review has massive spoilers.<br/><br/>This movie can be split in two, kinda like the white and black swan analogy. About 15% of it deals with the world of Ballet, in a crude, sort of realistic manner. This part of the film demanded acting, which the whole female cast delivered. It demanded some major dancing, which Portman delivered in a way no other actress has - she really did her homework and delivered an awesome rendition. Wynona Ryder disappears in a great supporting role as well. These 15% alone grant this movie a 6 out of 10, it's that good.<br/><br/>The rest... Well, 5% of it are unnecessary masturbation scenes. The other 80% are a stupid mess, mixing the clichéd ""unreliable narrator who is hallucinating and things will show up as they are in the end"" with uncomfortable, awkward scenes and a weird ""pseudo-horror"" vibe. Like Jack Nance in Eraserhead, Nina goes from one awkward and disturbing moment to the other. All the way through the whole film. It's over the top, it's self indulgent and, aims for an ending that looks like it came from M Night Shyamalan's rejected ideas bin. It's so confusing, we are absolutely lost in the character's madness in a way that takes away the joy of the movie. We are treated to unnecessary injury shots, and the whole Kafkaesque hallucinated metamorphosis too literal (and bizarre) to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>And how the hell did she manage to dance with a fatal wound for half of a presentation? How convenient she managed to bleed only at the end.<br/><br/>Al in all, it's not that bad of a movie, it's watchable, but don't give it too much credit."
"ptb-8","8","1","4","27 January 2011"," The Nut-crack-up? Creature from Swamp Lake?
","SHE'S CRACKING UP screams the poster for this jaw dropping new film which just might be the cinema world's very first horror ballet movie. In Australia we have a poster of porcelain beauty Natalie Portman with a big plaster crack from her jaw to her brain. Subtle it is not. A bit like the mad dolly toy that rattled from under the bed in a Pixar 'toon. This film, with especially hilarious moments for the slow learners in the audience to know that SHE'S CRACKING UP plays it like a mix of a Joan Crawford 60s shocker like STRAIGHT JACKET or BERSERK except that in BLACK SWAN we get THE (blood) RED SHOES as if played by Audrey Hepburn still in WAIT UNTIL DARK mode. While not quite the lurid standard of 60s guignol tabloid mania we sure are in the same league for some of the way. Hilarious and tingling scenes abound eg: Mommy Dearest played by Barbara Hershey, and especially the headless legless ballerina toy still twirling away on the music box to the off key deranged tinkling music. Mix in some sexual ALL ABOUT EVE understudy antics, add some FORTY SECOND STREET rehearsal calamities with the director berating the fragile star, pepper in some WAIT UNTIL DARK apartment creepiness, even 70s hi art junk like EYES OF LAURA MARS and voilà: Natalie Portman looking like Audrey Hepburn in a Crawford-esque shocker pirouetting The Red Shoes for good measure: and serve it up with murky colorless digicam wobble vision with too many close-up stalker-vision moments. The BLACK SWAN even has her sprout a few feathers and smash a mirror and show us blood that might not be there. While not quite the female answer to NORMAN BATES ON ROLLER SKATES we are however in spinning madness territory, sort of a ballet-horror RED RIDING HOOD parable: first period for a virgin mental anguish, and the discarding of girlhood playthings (see the stuffed bed toys get shoved in the furnace) ... BLACK SWAN is no doubt a startling and hilarious ballet film about overwhelming pressure to get laid to become a temptress so you can dance properly in a black tutu. How Euro-horror can we get here? I expected to find this was secretly directed by the ghost of Mario Bava. THE CREATURE FRIOM THE BLACK LAGOON and BLACK SWAN have a lot in common........ BLACK SWAN delivers and the swirling marsh madness of our little horny ballerina stepping up (and out of her mind) to deliver the performance of a life time makes for a real horror movie leaping about on tippy toes while you sit there bug eyed at the sheer lurching hallucination of it all. Maybe it is meant to be funny. You should see BURLESQUE as a chaser, it is almost the same but knows it is silly. All BLACK SWAN needed was some torn fishnet stockings and BURLESQUE SWAN could easily be ready to go."
"Theothervip","10","1","4","27 January 2011"," Perfection
","Every time I see a film I absolutely love, it's hard for me to put into writing my show of affection. Oh sure, I could apply the usual words like ""masterpiece"" or ""pure cinema"" like I always do, but the more I get the opportunity to see movies like BLACK SWAN, it's pretty hard for me to apply all the usual praises ad naseum. You just got to talk about the unique visual style, the direction, the superb acting, the poetic imagery, the music, and everything else. BLACK SWAN is that kind of film; a film that I'm truly wild about. This is definitely one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has never been the formula guys; he's one of those directors that are always there to surprise us and restore our faith in a cinematic world where spoon-fed formula is always the order of the day. Films like PI, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, THE WRESTLER, and even the underrated THE FOUNTAIN are works of an artist to watch, and with BLACK SWAN, he has proved once again that he's a true filmmaker. After a more conventional but still outstanding work with THE WRESTLER, Aronofsky returns to the surreal style of his earlier films in this dark, beautiful, grotesque, and absolutely amazing work. Like what it said in some of the reviews, it's THE RED SHOES meets Polanski's REPULSION, with elements comparable to the works of Cronenberg, De Palma, Hitchcock, and even animator Satoshi Kon (whose 1998 anime PERFECT BLUE is numerously referenced here), but the film is still purely Aronosky's, with his trademark visual style and camera angles, as well as the resurfacing of themes in his earlier works; like the characters in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, Nina (Natalie Portman) slowly loses her grip with reality and her dreams as she becomes obsessed with ""perfection"" and slowly descends into madness. Like one of the best thrillers, Aronofsky understands the importance of visual clues; a manner of showing rather than telling (The endless use of mirrors, for example, imply a dual personality). Aronofsky also gives the film a more natural feel like his previous THE WRESTLER, which means it requires natural performances, and the actors deliver.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman deserves all the praises she got portraying Nina, a goody-two-shoes ballet dancer who gets the lead part of the White Swan in their company's audacious reimagining of Tchiakovsky's Swan Lake. But to be able to truly nail the role, she must also play the character's mysterious and looser alter-ego, The Black Swan. Mila Kunis plays Lily, Nina's understudy who may or may not be driving her crazy so that she could get the role. Vincent Cassell is terrific as the commanding artistic director Thomas Leroy, who tempts his young performers so that he can get the performance and grace he wants from them. Credits should also be given to bit role performances by Barbara Hershey as Nina's domineering mother who watches anxiously as her daughter lives the dream she left behind, and Winona Ryder as Nina's predecessor and professional ballet dancer Beth, distraught by getting replaced.<br/><br/>And as usual, I've applied all the usual praises to a film I know I loved WAY more. I just simply can't do justice to this superb masterpiece. It's just, well, perfect. The beautiful choreography of the ballet sequences (backed up by Clint Mansell's brilliant recapturing of Tchiakovsky's original compositions) are gorgeous to behold, as well as mysterious and dream-like. The movie also has the feel of a waking nightmare where the lines between what's real and what's a hallucination have been blurred out; we feel Nina's slow descent into madness as we see things as she sees them.<br/><br/>Is BLACK SWAN the best of the year? A bit of a stretch, but it's still unlike any movie I've seen all year."

","Whilst I thought this film was well cast, produced, directed and acted,I found the content very difficult to deal with and unnecessarily violent at times. It was very 'dark' and distressing and anyone with a nervous disposition would be well advised not to go and see it. There is no 'feel good factor' at all and when the film finished there was just a stunned silence, broken only by someone behind us saying sarcastically, 'Thanks for taking me to such an uplifting film!' That made people laugh and broke the tension. Unusually, we didn't hear any positive comments on the way out. We had wanted to see 'The King's speech' but it was full so we saw this instead as we had seen interesting trailers and heard good reviews. Sadly, I feel there was too much sensationalism and not enough reality. I would never watch it again and rather wish I hadn't seen it at all as the horrible images stay with you afterwards.I watch films to be entertained not disturbed. As I said, I thought the acting was very well done but the content was too harrowing. I wonder how the writer even thinks up these ghastly scenarios. It was rather sick in my opinion.I expect it will do well in the name of 'Art,' Rather like the 'Emperors New Clothes.'"
"FilmFanatic03","3","1","4","26 January 2011"," Amazing acting, drama, class....with unnecessary sexual content
","First of all i'll start with the positives of this film. Natalie Portman stole the show by miles. Her acting ability to portray a fragile naive ballet dancer in pursuit for the role of a lifetime is captivating and powerful. Her performance was filled with raw emotion and with so much class. Defiently Oscar worthy. I loved how Darren Aronofsky simultaneously told the story of Swan Lake and the story of Ninas drive for perfection. The ending is defiantly the best as it is filled with so much emotion and tension and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. There are scares and thrills throughout the movie which was cool. Aspects of the film were amazing, however, this film as a whole is far from perfect. For the sexual content of this film is very offencive and unnecessary. I understand that the Black Swan is seductive and darker than the pure White Swan but i think the director pushed the boundaries on the sexual nature of this film by miles. The moral message of this film is that in order to be loose and have fun the answer is sex, drugs and alcohol. It's not. This prevents me from saying it was a great film because i can't support a film as a whole where it promotes immorality. But i can say aspects really worked and are to be admired. That's why i have given this film 5 stars, because the drama of the film is amazing but the sexual content was offencive."

","OK, first of all this movie wont be for everyone. That much is obvious. I see some people on here have deemed this a horror/drama/thriller movie (and one Japanese horror which is ludicrous!!). In my opinion it is a psychological thriller. The demise of Natalie Portman's character is one of pure beauty and horror. Coupled with the influence of Kunis and Cassel's characters is simply brilliant. Full credit goes to the actors, if the Kings Speech wasn't so good (apparently) then I would tip this for a clean sweep at the Oscars. The dedication of Portman and Cunis to train and diet for this is fab because, lets be honest, they were very thin. Portman especially did not look well!<br/><br/>The sex scene(s) are graphic yes but that, plus the few jumpy and creepy bit only adds to the intensity of the destruction of the mind. <br/><br/>Can't praise this enough<br/><br/>Like I say, it wont be for everyone but then what film is?<br/><br/>10/10 and I would see it again"

"yris2002","8","1","4","10 January 2011"," Enthralling, although oppressive psychodrama, superbly interpreted by Natalie Portman
","Movies dealing with stories of highly talented people, hit by mental insanity (let's only think of ""Shine"") have always appealed to the public. This is probably due to the mysterious charm exerted by dramas concerning the human mind, mainly when the condition of mental insanity is intertwined with that of being a genius.""Black Swan"" is no exception, still more exacerbated by the environment, that of classical ballet, where the tension towards perfection and the hard demanded sacrifices may challenge whoever's mental balance.<br/><br/>Indeed, if on one hand I got to the end of the movie almost exhausted, as mentally and emotionally absorbed by the drama of Nina, on the other one I couldn't but feel like going to that very end. The story proceeds relentlessly, and as the sense of anguish increases inexorably, we feel more and more captured by its obscure and morbid development, until the highest moment of success coincides with the highest moment of folly.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman delivers a truly intense and strongly felt interpretation, probably the best of her career up to now. We really get to feel her being gradually consumed with dance, we feel her mental distress together with her physical pain. The morbidity inside and outside her, in her real life as well in her follies, may sound a little excessive, but in my opinion necessary to make the drama true. Also Winona Ryder as Beth, the older and cut off ballerina, leaves a noteworthy interpretation."

Many are not a fan of his dark gritty style of directing, but those who are wont be disappointed.<br/><br/>Beautiful Cinematography, Choreography and Acting. The movie is a real piece of art. Natalie Portman is brilliant. After just a few minutes into the movie, I was in the world of Nina Sayers. Almost all her life, she has been kind of a White Swan. Then after she gets the part in the play, overcome by obsession, jealousy & anxiety, she slowly & slowly goes into her dark side and finally gets transformed into 'The Black Swan'. I'll be damned if I forget to mention Mila Kunis. She shows a really new side in this movie and she does it quite well.<br/><br/>Screenplay is interesting and keeps you hooked to your seat.

","I went to see Black Swan because I had seen the ""making of"" segment on FMC. I was expecting to see more dance and didn't realize that the main character was descending into a major mental illness. If I were a doctor, I would say perhaps this character had onset schizophrenia. The manifestations of the mental illness are hard to watch. Bloody special effects are shocking and although perhaps accurate in respect to the mental illness, still disconcerting in the extreme. There were a few things that jumped out as not true to a dance company's standards nor procedures. The character Portman plays would not have been dressing herself. Not to let on about an important part of the movie, but she would not have had the privacy to do what she did in the end. The movie can be worthwhile if the viewer understands that there are a lot of disturbing scenes and is forewarned."

It's a genuine drama focused on a pure, naive hearted ballet dancer who makes the necessary sacrifice in order to produce the perfect art form: she gives up to her soul. The side effects and the general dark background of this film contrasts very well with the character's naive shaped beliefs, implemented by a too strict and full of regrets mother.

","There is a well-known dream that so many people all over the world have experienced. It goes like this: you arrive to school to take a test that you never studied for.... or you never even showed up for class! Or you come to school naked. Yup, you show up at school one day, you are about to enter the school, but then you realize (to your horror) that you are naked. Or you don't have your pants on.<br/><br/>There are variations on the dream. One is ""The Actor's Nightmare."" You are about to go on stage in front of an audience, and you have never read the play. You forgot to show up for rehearsals.<br/><br/>Of course the dream is completely unreal. Nobody could have just realized they were completely naked as they enter the school. No director would allow you to go on stage if you never showed up for rehearsal.<br/><br/>But in the dream, that is what happens. Really. You really did show up naked or not knowing your lines.<br/><br/>Now, we are all familiar with Fables. Like the Tortoise and the Hare. The tortoise and the hare race against each other. Is it a true story? I doubt it. But is that what really happens in the fable? Oh yes, in the fable they really do race against each other.<br/><br/>There is a reason that so many people all over the world share the same dream. It is an unreal situation, but there are emotional and intellectual truths revealed by the dream. In the case of the Actor's Nightmare, it is about feelings of unpreparedness. Or inadequacy.<br/><br/>In the fable, we learn how slow and steady can win the race.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a phantasmagorical fable. Phantasmagorical = a swift series of dream images. I won't go into any detail of what happens in the movie. Suffice it to say that some really weird things happen.<br/><br/>It is very likely for people to think of Black Swan as a movie about an insane girl, or hallucinations, or schizophrenia. Certainly, I thought of that at the beginning. It's hard not to.<br/><br/>However, as the story unfolds I realized that the entire story is a fable.<br/><br/>It is not a film about madness or that it takes insanity to create art. Or even some kind of Fight Club doppelganger. Everything in this story is unreal, yet it happens. Just like in a dream. Or in a fable.<br/><br/>And just as in those dreams and fables, there are emotional and intellectual truths to discover in Black Swan.<br/><br/>The movie is about a young woman who leads a child-like existence. No matter how technically skilled a ballerina she is, she will never become the artist she wants to be and remain the simpering child.<br/><br/>This is a coming of age story.<br/><br/>Yes, there are many themes. it gets very complicated. And every scene of the movie is nightmarish. There is a lot to think about in this movie, and a lot to laugh about. Yeah, I not only liked the movie, but I also found it bombastic, ridiculous, and preposterous. However, as events came to their conclusion, I was amazed by the way the director coalesced all his thoughts into a rather powerful, stunning package.<br/><br/>So I found it to be a work of bravura. Gutsy, 'I don't care what the critics think' bravura. He made a camp movie about a subject that is not camp at all. Bravo."

","""I felt it — perfect. It was perfect."" At first I was hesitant to watch this movie. Nothing in the trailer really appealed to me, but I am so happy I did! Often times the best films are not the big blockbusters with all the A list actors (not that the Black Swan lacks these) or the action-packed ones with the generic story lines, but are the ones that are able to arouse intense feelings and emotions, whether good or bad, within us. Black Swan induced emotions from anxiety to fear to pity to disgust to awe. At one moment I wanted to cringe, and the next moment I wanted to cry, all in between repeating intervals of one another. The dimensions and progression of Nina's dynamic character left me constantly changing my perception of her. Being caught up in Nina's delusional world often made it hard to predict what would happen next or what the final outcome would be, which ties the movie together perfectly. I highly recommend this movie and predict at least an Oscar nomination for this well thought out, acted and directed screen play."

","Not had a chance to see True Grit, probably after Jan 1... so here's my top films so far<br/><br/>The Fighter, The Kings Speech, Black Swan, Inception and not in that order, each has its reason for being #1 for me. Aronofsky's other films I've liked are The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream. Black Swan reminded me more of Requiem for a Dream, it will mess with your mind, in a good way. Reminds me of reading PK Dick's Three Stigmata, he would lead you down a path only to find out it wasn't real then another build up and again you weren't sure what was real. Inception was similar in that respect except it didn't emotionally grab you like Black Swan... being grabbed and let go and grabbed again. Also like the wrestler those that had a relationship with the main character (Nina) were strange themselves. Aronofsky also worked his magic with Barbara Hershey, Kunis and Cassell... looking forward to his next film. Thank you to all who worked on this film."

","Since the Black Swan is the most talk about movie among dancers, I finally watched it last night. Perhaps I had such a high expectation of the movie, I can't help but say that I'm somewhat disappointed. I like and dislike it a the same time. It is a good movie, the story line is clean and focused. The dance costumes and makeups are perfect for the show. I loved Natalie Portman's performance in it. However, Mila, in my opinion, cant act. She is not doing nothing but reading a script. With such limited dialog of hers, she simply just can't act, or she had not act with heart yet. The coach looks like a real coach. I found the movie hit too close to home, the drama that happened in the dance community, the pressure, the competition, the obsession, the hunger for perfection. <br/><br/>I agree with most people that it is an intense movie. However, i was disappointed in a sense that the movie is so predictable. I think it is more of a girls' movies than guys. Because a lot of us can, in some way, relate to Nina. All of us want to be the swan queen and we all believe or want to think that we have talents, 'we' can be the one, the talented chosen one. But you have to be so naive to actually believe that you can be the one. The truth is, there are so many talented people out there, what makes you different?<br/><br/>The coach says, "" the only person standing between you is you."" Is competition really not about beating others, but how one can push their own limit? Nina's first assignment to "" go home and start touching yourself"". That just sounds so familiar, doesn't it, my fellow dancers. :)<br/><br/>After watching the movie, i found that it just increased my doubts even more about continuing to dance. Because i know i can never be. I can be good, but i cannot be great. 99% of us cant be great either. There are many good artists in this world, but only few can be great. Because only a crazy soul can express emotion in such a pure form that is selfless. You can let yourself go, but you wont know what it means to truly lose yourself. History proved it to be a fact. Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. That's the law of nature. A great comedian is a great entertainer on stage, but a sad soul at heart. The price that every great artist paid. <br/><br/>The movie sent a clear message, however, these are things that i already know. I am disappointed because I didn't learn anything new. It just emphasized that my belief is correct, or rather, the writer shared my same point of view, which is kind of upsetting, because sometimes, I'd rather be wrong."

","If there's one thing I could say about Black Swan, it would be that it is definitely not overrated. Obviously, the movie is supposed to win a gazillion academy awards and such, but in all honesty, it deserves every single one.<br/><br/>With such a great cast, how could one go wrong? Natalie Portman has truly outdone herself in this one, her character escalating from a mere nervous perfectionist to a textbook case schizophrenic. I found the analogy of the transformation the white swan and the black swan to Nina's transformation very interesting. The hallucination scenes were skillfully done and felt real every time. I also felt that the beautifully rendered Tchaikovsky music contributed greatly to the tone of the music.<br/><br/>We have all heard about how dark, disturbing, and depressing this movie is, but when I came and saw it I found that it was also strikingly beautiful. The visuals were simply amazing- I especially loved the dance at the very beginning of the movie. The lighting was great and so was the camera work. The story was also beautiful in a kind of heartbreaking way, as I find destruction to have its own kind of beauty. Nina's journey to the top and her fall were fascinating and beautiful.<br/><br/>The only complaint that I have about this movie was that it was constantly intense, all of the time. There was no lull in the action for the audience to catch its breath. Still, Nina's character was developed very well even while all of these events were going on.<br/><br/>I loved it so much I feel like everybody should go see it, but of course it contains profanity, blood and gore, sex scenes, and intense hallucinations, so of course it's not everybody's cup of tea. However, if you can stomach all of these things, you must see it!"
"dripdrop001","10","1","4","30 December 2010"," Is it really THAT black?
","Well, as a matter of fact it is. Pitch dark! I have always been fascinated by the black swans in the nature, but this ""Black Swan"" made me spend more than 90 minutes with my hand covering half of my face.<br/><br/>It amazes me when some people consider ""Black Swan"" to be almost a horror movie, when actually it is not. Disturbing - yes, but definitely not a horror movie. That's the reason why I admire Darren Aronofsky so much. As a viewer I like being slightly manipulated and that's what he does. From the very beginning. It's like you dive into the dark waters and do not reach the surface until the end titles show up. ""Black Swan"" is full of anxiety and pressure, but it doesn't fall on the shoulders as a heavy load.<br/><br/>There are lots of details to pay attention to. I couldn't help noticing all kinds of sounds in the background. Flutter of wings, sighs, uneven breathing and a strange sound of.. Well, I'd call it a sound of metamorphosis. And of course, that amazing sticky sound of a pointe touching the ground, which in this case is somewhat tragic. All of these sounds combined together makes you feel kind of watched by someone and you might want to look over your shoulder to check if there's no one behind you. You can not only hear the wings, you can see them - the statue in a hall, tattoo of black wings on the back of Lily (Mila Kunis), white swans in the bathroom at Nina's apartment (scene, where she takes a bath). Also, there are lots of mirrors. And, of course, there should be. There's no better way to show the reflection of a person - whether it is the physical reflection or the inner dark side reflection. And there's no need for ""mirror, mirror on the wall.."", because the mirror itself helps a viewer to distinguish the difference between reality and fiction. While watching the movie I couldn't escape the feeling that there's something wrong in every single shot. I was trying to catch something bright, but I couldn't, because from a first glance the only bright thing - Nina (Natalie Portman) - was turning into something darker than the dark itself.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's character Nina is an ideal example of fragility (or so it may seem). She is petite, delicate, tender, reserved, somewhat tense and hard working ballet dancer, she speaks quietly and is a little stuck in a little girl's world. She never wears dark clothes (not even underwear) and lives in a white and pink room full of fluffy stuffed animals seated on chairs. The bright living space of hers should be like an oasis in a desert of anxiousness, but it isn't. Even the music box playing the music from ""Swan Lake"" is somewhat disturbing. I think it's the environment that set a strong base for her inner change long before she had to wake her sensual side up for the role of the Black Swan. Overprotective mother (well played by Barbara Hershey) is stuck in her memories of those early days when she was a ballet dancer, who gave up her career to give birth to Nina. Mother wants best for her child, but she doesn't realize that she pushes Nina into her own (mother's) life she could never have and takes away from her everything that a young beautiful and even a hard working woman should enjoy - her own life and privacy. I couldn't think of anyone else but Natalie Portman for this role. I was absolutely convinced by both dark and bright sides of her character. Those reflections of her character she saw on other people - now that's what I call the glance of darkness! Natalie Portman is spectacular to watch, because she's versatile, she can be anything. And she definitely has both white and black swans inside of her.<br/><br/>Besides the pressure at home, there's also pressure at work. Twice as difficult to take - Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) and Lily (Mila Kunis). Besides the fact that Vincent Cassel is a talented actor you can hardly forget, his facial features give him all the strength of the character he needs in this movie. Rough, tough and strict. Vincent's Thomas is intimidating, but at the same time - hard to resist. Also, there's Mila Kunis. As a matter of fact, I have never heard of her. Or seen. But her feline-like femme fatale performance made me an impression. Her character - Lily - embodies everything that Nina's not. Besides her casualness, femininity, wildness and freedom, she always wears black. Though these black wings she has tattooed on her back raises a question. Was it really necessary? I mean, it would be enough for me if Nina would have imagined them in couple of scenes, where, for example, Lily replaced Nina in a rehearsal. It would emphasize the competition Nina's afraid of. It's more than clear, how different those two girls are. Anyway, Mila Kunis made her Lily look very mysterious in a way that as a viewer you can't tell whether you can trust her. Is it Nina's mind playing tricks on her or is it Lily's rivalry game? You might ask yourself this question several times. I did.<br/><br/>That's exactly what made me cover my face for those 90 minutes - the understanding that there's no more twisted place than the abyss of human's mind.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Redfoxx1","10","1","4","30 December 2010"," Simply Brilliant!
","Acting: Natalie Portman has been one of the top actresses for some time in my opinion. However, she never had a role that completely wowed everyone. That particular role has been found with Black Swan. Natalie Portman, who plays Nina Sayers, completely transforms before the viewers' eyes and makes the audience feel all the destructive emotions that haunted her. Her performance creates a character who is cynical, depressing, haunting, sad, immature, and obsessed all in one. Natalie definitely gave off an Oscar worthy performance and if I had to put money on it, I'll pick her to take home the award. Mila Kunis portrays Lily, the dangerous friend/ antagonists. She does a tremendous job at pushing Natalie's character and helping dictate the pace of the film. Overall the acting was stellar.<br/><br/>Cinematography: If there was anything to criticize, it's got to be some elements of the cinematography. The best way to describe it is simply inconsistent. Most shots were damn near perfect, conveying a tremendous amount of emotion. However, some shots were done in a ""guerilla"" style that Darren Aronofsky used when he did The Wrestler. The camera shakes and bounces around giving that gritty feel but it did not in any way mirror the pace and feeling of this particular movie. Although, there were some ""handycam"" moments, it can be almost completely overlooked because most of the cinematography was done tremendously well. Darren Aronofsky feeds us some of, if not the best alter ego shots ever seen before in a film. These amazing shots were both scary and fulfilling on so many levels and were a joy to look at.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Black Swan is one of those movies that only come once a year. It shows that filmmaking is much more than putting together effects and action sequences, it is a true art form. Darren Aronofsky plays with the one thing we all connect with the mostemotion. Black Swan is truly a stunning film that will prey on the human psyche. Holding one of the best performances given by a female lead, Black Swan is a must-see experience because calling this film simply a movie is unjust. This film is a tremendous inspiration to me as an aspiring filmmaker. Black Swan is easily one of the best films I have ever seen in my life and I urge everyone to go see it immediately."

","My boyfriend and I saw this together for a movie date; I know how to pick out films due to the trailer or other reviews in total. When I first saw the trailer of Black Swan, which was played at the Toronto International Film Festival I knew this movie was a must see on my list. I then read the phenomenal reviews from many critics about the film and decided that no matter what I would see it for sure.<br/><br/>I found what drew me into the movie was not only the dark thrill, but the ballet and the classical music. Here's hoping this movie gets an award for the music score, it was all pure classic. The suspense of the movie started to really draw me in, some parts could be predicted at times however the film could still be pulled off and made where there was always another unexpected twist.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie if you're into dark thriller movies, but to warn you it's really graphic and creepy. However I say go for it if you're really into that kinda stuff. I give this movie a 10/10 review and don't be surprised if Natalie Portman wins big for this film, this masterpiece is something that you gotta see it to believe it."

","I don't know of any living director that knows better than Aronofsky how to make us feel so strongly after characters. I was amazed with the Wrestler, especially the ending which was open to interpretation. SPOILER!!! The Black Swan shares a similar ending in form and substance but does not leave to much to interpretation. It is all clear, she pays the price of achieving perfection. It remembered me of the old saying: Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.<br/><br/>Also, Aronofsky has a great talent on choosing very unique point of views for his shots. This makes his movies a pleasure to see. The Black Swan is no exception to this.<br/><br/>Thanks Aronofsky for this amazing movie. It was totally what cinema is meant to be, a dream."

","A young ballerina (""Nina""/Natalie Portman) is held in an imprisoning relationship with her single mother (Barbara Hershey) who, herself, had been an aspiring ballerina until.... <br/><br/>It's never explicitly stated but it's easily inferred that the mother's career ended when she became pregnant with Nina after an affair with her ballet master and that she's trying to fulfill her own thwarted ambitions through guiding Nina. <br/><br/>What we see in Nina is a young woman with a reliance on her mother more typical of a 9-11 year old girl (and with a similar stunted personal maturity), trying to fulfill mother's desire to be the perfect ballerina her mother wished to be and avoid any romantic relationships (which could interfere with reaching that goal as it had for her mother).<br/><br/>Nina suddenly has a chance to dance the role of the Swan Queen (the white swan) in ""Swan Lake"" but must also dance (as standard for this ballet) her nemesis' role, a look-alike black swan. As the virtuous White Swan, Nina's perfect but her ballet master (who aims to have sex with Nina) keeps badgering her to be sexier, more seducing as the non-virtuous Black Swan. This, of course, clashes with Nina's mother's upbringing of Nina.<br/><br/>This clash provokes a developing psychotic reaction which Nina does not recognize--and, for awhile, neither do we, the film's viewers: we react to some scenes as actual experiences of Nina only to find out later that those episodes were the stuff of Nina's psychosis. And we leave the theater very unsure of how much of what we saw of Nina's experiences were real or her hallucinations. I'm sure our fascination with this uncertainty and trying to unravel the tangle of reality from insanity contributes much to what drives many viewers to be fascinated with this movie. (E.g., look at the questions and debates on IMDb's Message Board for this film.)<br/><br/>IMO, the pathological relation between Nina and her mother that sets up what follows was exceptionally well done by Portman and Hershey. There's enough similarity in their facial features that we easily see them as mother and adult child. All the other cast members (""Lily""/Mila Kunis as a real world seductive Black Swan and rival; Vincent Cassel as the preying ballet master) seemed perfectly chosen and gave excellent performances. My movie companion (who took ballet for years) said the scenes of ballet practices were authentic.<br/><br/>IMO some of those therapists experienced in treating personality & psychotic disorders (especially including the various schizophrenias) may be among those having quibbles with ""Black Swan."" E.g., the clash between Nina's internalized aims of her mother vs. those of her ballet master would certainly provoke a massive conflict within Nina. But a depressive reaction would be far more likely and, if a psychotic reaction did occur, there'd surely be noticeable disorganization between her episodes of hallucinations (i.e., she'd not be able to function or dance normally between those psychotic episodes). <br/><br/>But captivating narratives have never had to strictly follow reality to make them enjoyable--e.g., ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Harry Potter,"" the ""Twilight"" vampire series, and hundreds of others. ""Black Swan"" is an entertaining, psycho-fictional, horror movie--it's NOT a realistic case study or documentary.<br/><br/>I think IMDb's current rating of 8.7 of 10 stars and Ebert's rating of 3.5 of 4 stars are both representative of how most of the general public will react to this film.<br/><br/>I think a 4 or 5 of 10 (or even less) could be more typical by some of my shrink brethren with much mental health experience dealing with psychoses as well as from those offended by the lesbian sexual content or the gore."

","This is one of those what the heck movies where you are amazed by it but don't know what the heck is going on until the movie ends. And even than some of the audience might still be confused. I never found ballet to be entertaining, but the gritty and realistic feel of the film makes the film most definitely worth checking out. Yeah it's a artsy film, but it's a psychological thriller that is also disturbing and sometimes horrifying. After watching this movie, I won't be able to think of ballet the same way again. I don't know if real ballet is this nerve racking and let me tell you the tension in this is very high, yet it's beautiful to watch sometimes. I was never a fan of Natalie Portman but she was practically perfect for this role and did her job really well. I enjoyed Aronofsky's film ""Pi"" and I was immersed in this film as well. Sort of reminded me of ""Perfect Blue"" except it's about a ballerina instead of a singer/actress and this is in real life. But that is a good thing.

"roxanne7333","9","1","4","28 December 2010"," Film's Successes and Failures
","The heightening elevation of Nina's madness was extraordinarily well-done--until it reached a certain point that contained a tinge of ludicrousness. Of course, there was a climax, but the utter gruesomeness of some parts was overdone, and some other parts were much more meaningful than its neanderthal, bloody counterparts. In the end, the hallucinations were squashed together to the point where it culminated into no longer a elegant, deep climax, but a low-grade horror movie that sought to scare rather than provoke. Of course, I get it, it displays the accumulating madness of poor Ms. Portman, but really, the scenes between hallucinations and real life were so disproportional that there was a lack of contrast--something that would have greatly added to the movie. It would have relayed her afflictions to her actual actions. It is not to say, however, this was never done.<br/><br/>Moreover, I would like to discuss Ms. Portman's performance. I genuinely liked it at first--that furrowed brow and the incessant worry presented on her face. Until it became permanent. And more permanent. If she didn't get lasting wrinkles from this movie, I'd be surprised.<br/><br/>She was innocent and uptight at first--but her dark side never really showed. Well, it did for five seconds at the end (she gave a devilish, sultry smirk to Cassel), but it quickly degraded back into her muddled, ""Oh god I need to pee"" look. For those who say her acting was superb and reflected her transformation from a white swan to black, I disagree. All I noticed was greater brow-furrowing toward the end of the movie. Not only that, the supposed ""excellence"" of her acting should be mainly attributed to the circumstances she was in. It was the idea, the commendable concept of some hallucinations and actions that led people to perceive her sprouting, obsessive insanity--not her acting.<br/><br/>As the bad news are over, I would like to applaud the rest of the film and actors. Ms. Portman was not horrific, but it was bland to a certain degree, especially when comparing her to Mr. Cassel, Ms. Kunis, Ms. Ryder, and Ms. Hershey--most notably Mr. Cassel, who played the slavish, slimy coach extraordinarily well. Ms. Ryder played a deranged lunatic in fits of jealousy wonderfully. Ms. Hershey conveyed a distraught mother excellently and Ms. Kunis played a seductive succubus artfully as well.<br/><br/>The very idea, the bulk, the plot of the film was ingenious and the cinematography was sublime. The gritty feeling of the camera gave the film a cunningly dark undertone, which was what I especially enjoyed. Overall spectacular film."
"mistarkus","10","1","4","27 December 2010"," Dark Subconsciousness
","A dark, mysterious roller-coaster of a thriller into an awakening of a subconscious.<br/><br/>On the surface its about ballet and the quest for perfection. Portman's character is granted the swan queen part which encompasses both the white swan and the black swan roles. She is a marvel technically and can fully encompass the white swan part but she can't perfect the black swan part which requires not only technical proficiency but a transcendence from who she is. At her level more than technical mastery is needed but a certain essence of the spirit is necessary to perfect the artistry. She is the innocent, virginal white part but she lacks a dark passion which must be emoted in order to perfect the black part. This inner dark side lies dormant in Portman's character as it would in most innocent, sheltered youths. Influences from her teacher and her look alike competitor and the queer controlling relationship with her mother help her unleash various dark and indulgent emotions such as jealousy, anger, pride, rebellion and lust. The rapidity at which these perhaps novel emotions are felt, along with the obvious pressures to perfect such a performance, and the physicality of grueling ballet training all take us on a journey into a slowly developed spiraling madness of Nina's repressed innermost mind. The filmmaker created an intimate point of view portrait. We are transported into Nina's awakening of her dark subconscious soul. And we follow Nina on her path of madness by slowly stepping out of reality into a hallucinatory decadence that will lead to the glory of perfection or a fatal destruction.<br/><br/>The swan queen role of the black and white swans' is a wonderful metaphor for the duality of humanity.<br/><br/>A profoundly interesting psychological character study uniquely blended with artsy horroresque intensity that is so well made that we become totally absorbed into it."
"RCWjr","9","1","4","26 December 2010"," Demented
","The first word that came to mind after watching this film was ""demented"". An absolutely demented film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives a performance that is equal parts sweet and tragic. She has always shown flourishes, but not since her first break out role in The Professional, has she been this open, this exposed. The story is simple, yet the emotions complex. Portman plays ""Nina"", a 28 year old woman who still lives with her mom, chasing a dream that her mother had; to have the lead in a major production. But there is a new girl in the troop, ""Lily"", played by Mila Kunis, who Nina sees as a rival. Kunis is fantastic. Lily is the exact opposite of Nina; open, free, though just as talented, Kunis is wonderful and gives Lily the right amount of edge. The real problem in her life is that Nina's mother dots on her as if she were still a young girl. This has, in many respects stunted Nina emotionally and she is still the 16 year old girl that her mother treats her as. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mother beautifully. The dynamic between Hershey and Portman is fantastic.<br/><br/>The film hints at a very demented and destructive side to not only ballet, but to the pursuit of excellence. Nina is constantly trying to be perfect. Perfect to the point of being self-destructive. This is manifested in a physical way through self-mutilation. Winning the coveted lead role in Swan Lake is equal parts blessing and curse for Nina. In many respects, the curse side is the most predominate. What ensues is a major demented, genius piece of filmmaking. Aronofsky, ever known as a filmmaker that is not afraid to take chances, gives us his most commercially demented work yet. The way he films and presents the art of ballet is breathtaking.<br/><br/>Bravo to Portman and Aronofsky, a film which intrigued me prior to seeing it, after viewing, left me equal parts happy and sad. Torn, like Portman's Nina, you have to love it when a film goes as deep into the rabbit hole as this one does, and leaves you breathless at the end."

"joshkaplan2","8","1","4","26 December 2010"," The Weight of Perfection
","What is a person's individual worth? How much of others do we incorporate into ourselves? Is significance indivisible from uniqueness? These are some of the questions explored in Black Swan, which presents the industry of ballet in a whole new light (or lack thereof), and brings into view the question of personal identity, especially in regard to the actor's relation to their role in any performance art.<br/><br/>The overarching plot is simplistic, centering on a ballet company's production of Swan Lake, but quickly hones in on the preparations of the newest lead, Nina Sayers, who goes from being another anonymous dancer to being the star of the show through her hitherto unrecognized talent. With the danger of spoiling too much, it's easier to explain the plot of Swan Lake, in which the two primary characters are the pure, virtuous White Swan and her evil doppelganger, the titular Black Swan, both played, out of necessity, by the same ballerina. Despite having the lead role, the presence of a kind (if unpolished) dancer named Lily threatens the previously virtuous/recessive Nina's first chance to shine through her more accurate portrayal of the Black Swan. Because of this, and her own perfectionist personality, Nina is forced to find the darker part of herself so that she may become the character completely.<br/><br/>For those who believe this is another tedious Cinderella story ""chick flick,"" your ideas could not be farther from the truth, as the singularity of the film completely prohibits the application of the word ""another."" The filmmakers weave together atmospheric music, camera techniques, claustrophobic sets, and special effects to build up an omnipresent sense of anxiety that is impossible to dissipate. An ominous, often monotonous score combined with a constantly mobile camera sets the viewer into an uneasy baselessness, flawlessly putting them into the shoes of the anxiety-ridden protagonist, and making it nearly impossible to sever that which is real from that which is not. On one level a cautionary tale about the dangers of self-imposed pressure, Black Swan lives up to its categorization as a ""thriller,"" the visual shocks making it anything but predictable.<br/><br/>A thought provoking drama with a near total absence of relief from tension, Black Swan is a film that is, though brilliantly executed, most un-enjoyable to watch, partially because of the frightening visual effects and partially because of psychological implications. While it's a common enough (however thoroughly avoided) thought that someday we will die and eventually be forgotten by the world, a reminder of our own replaceability is never so blatantly presented before us as it is before Nina in the film. Aronofsky's Black Swan shows that there's still a future in the movie industry, and that while perfection is often equated with purity, its true meaning could include the concept of completeness, equal ratios in a single phenomenon between both the White, and the Black."
"IheartCali5882","8","1","4","26 December 2010"," It's like Swan Lake on acid
","It's safe to say by now Natalie Portman is well on her way to receiving an Oscar nomination for her performance here in Black Swan. And the nomination would be deserved. Portman is a very competent actress, and this time is no exception. She plays a professional dancer, Nina Sayers, whose entire life is consumed by her desire to get ahead within her ballet company; to ultimately play the title role of swan queen in Swan Lake. Her mind can focus on nothing else. She eats, sleeps, breaths it. Her mother, once a dancer herself, is equally consumed by her daughter's ambition, living vicariously through Nina. Nina is told by the company director that she must have not only a purity but also a dark side to her in order to actually BE both the White and the Black Swan of Swan Lake. Always in control, always striving to be perfect, Nina doesn't know how to let go and give herself over to this so-called ""dark side"". She struggles with feelings of inadequacy and desperation, and in the midst of this sort of manic frenzy Nina begins (continues ?) to suffer from hallucinations.These hallucinations serve as the focal point for the plot, showing Nina spiraling down into a state of altered reality where she can no longer differentiate between what is real and what is not.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky definitely knows how to make a film. Not just in the direction but in the cinematography as well. The look of the film is just beautiful. The use of lighting, music, color, and camera work in the Swan Lake sequences is absolutely phenomenal. Top notch. Aronofsky has brought forth some passionate performances from not only Portman, but also Barbara Hershey, Mila Kunis, and that slippery Vincent Cassel who I've grown to like more and more ever since I saw him in Ocean's Twelve. I always marvel at his perfect hair.<br/><br/>There's not much to find fault with in Black Swan. It's grade A in almost all respects. I just wish Aronofsky had given more of a basis for the story. There are some facets of Portman's life that the viewer is thrown into and not given an explanation for. Has she always had a mental illness? If so why? Her mother certainly acts as if this is a long-standing condition. It's also revealed to the viewer that her mother has some sort of manic mood swings, which Portman is frightened of. The scene is included in the film, as are several others showing Portman barricading herself in her room at night. But then that avenue is abruptly ditched and never develops into anything. It left me wondering why Aronofsky would go to the trouble of including these scenes if he didn't intend on developing them. And towards the end of the film, the hallucinations begin to become just a bit redundant. After a handful or so, we can surmise that she's not well. Anything more than that weakens the impact of the film in my opinion. I'd also like to mention that while this was a very brave and risky performance from Portman, I felt that the lesbian scenes cheapened the film just a bit. Black Swan is nothing if not a sophisticated film, and it seemed like a girl-on-girl scene was just a little tawdry here and a slight cop out. Not because it was shown at all, but the way in which the scene was orchestrated could have been altered. With films like Basic Instinct and Body Heat, over the top sexuality is the gimmick all by itself and the scenes I'm referring to in Black Swan would have fit smoothly in either one of those films. However in Aronofsky's they just seem out of place and awkward.<br/><br/>All in all though, these are relatively minor things when viewing the movie as a whole. It's a well-made film with brilliant acting and an interesting take on the ""life mirrors art"" story. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of thrillers, or for that matter anyone who simply wants to see a good movie.<br/><br/>My rating: 7.5/10"
"ameerzebamjad","9","1","4","26 December 2010"," Riveting story. Amazing acting.
","If ""Inception"" was for our minds, ""Black Swan"" is for the emotions - a treat to watch! Right from the start we are taken into a world of contrasting themes: where we are captivated by the elegance, the beauty & grace of ballet, we are also exposed to the raw, vile & physically vulnerable life of the performers. Where we empathize with Nina Sayer's innocence & susceptibility, we also see her jealous & rivalrous, almost dark side. Where the story builds up in a methodical way, it also turns visceral.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and by the end you can even second guess how it's going to unravel. But it is the emotional gamut that you will experience in the ride to the end that makes this a special treat. It's amazing how the group of friends I watched it with all couldn't agree on how they felt about Nina Sayers in the end (can't give more away).<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is the movie! She makes the character Nina Sayers believable. The Oscar that evaded her for Closer, for me it is a given this year. Vincent and Mila also deliver strong noteworthy performances.<br/><br/>A must watch. A Strong 9 for direction and a breathtaking performance."
"sandeepamar","8","1","4","26 December 2010"," Brilliant one on second thoughts
","As soon as I finished this movie, I got up and thought just another ""psycho pi"" stuff from Aronofsky. My next thought was why doesn't he make something like wrestler again. And then it just hit me ""quest of perfection"", the mathematician chasing the meaning of Pi, and the wrestler who has to wrestle, as that is what is wants to do, even if he risks his life. There was a magical moment and I found the movie suddenly brilliant, and appreciated Aronofsky for his genius.<br/><br/>I do not believe in extreme emotions, rather one has to take nothing so seriously which human being has created. And here is the brilliance of Aronofsky, he portrays the extreme and psychotic nature of human emotion, ambition and quest. At the end the movies communicate that this extreme nature is a labyrinth created by self, which is delusional in so many ways. <br/><br/>The movie is about a young girl trying to a perfect ballerina, and everything should be perfect around it. She hallucinates and falls pray to her ambition. The acting is superb, the hard work in direction on ballet scenes and developing of movie is great. A must watch and I guess a high chance of Oscar for Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>I still feel its time Aronofsky makes a different movie, rather than the extreme emotions. I think Pi was his greatest movie, it is like how Wrestler and Crazy Heart are similar movies, but Crazy Heart has a neutral/positive spin at the end. I am not looking for a positive ending, just a different kind of brilliance from him."
"Ryan_MYeah","10","1","4","25 December 2010"," What more can I say except, ""Perfection?"" Natalie Portman gives the year's best performance.
","The film reveals a side of Darren Aronofsky not explored since the 2000 mind screw known as Requiem for a Dream. Forgive me if that sounds harsh, because I was nothing but intrigued, and horrified by Requiem. I say this because Black Swan is an outstanding return to past form for the man, but obviously not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman stars as Nina Sayers, a sweet and dedicated ballerina who's given both roles of the White, and Black Swans as part of her group's upcoming rendition of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. She has no problem performing the innocent, and frail White Swan, but her director Thomas (Played by Vincent Cassel) feels a lack of passion for her performance as the Black Swan. He urges her to bring out her underlying dark nature, long suppressed by her overbearing mother (Played by Barbara Hershey), her dedication to technique, and the need to please critics. Over time she begins to realize the dark side of her soul, but begins losing her grip on reality...<br/><br/>...an arc of storytelling handled perfectly by screenwriters Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin. The themes of which they present (Sexual desire, paranoia, self-inflicted injury, and jealousy) are eerily, but exceptionally explored, helping to put us inside this dark descent. But Aronofsky is slightly more to thank for this film, as he makes clever use of sound, film editing, and special effects to ease us into uncertainty, heightened only by the cinematography by Mathhew Libatique, who presents us with a warped, and creepy view of Nina's mind, often stylized by the presence of a mirror, evoking a strong sense of her intimidating transformation.<br/><br/>Actors are also quite wonderful too. Vincent Cassell and Mila Kunis are brilliant as Nina's director, and rival, who acts as the perfect contrast to her more fragile nature. Barbara Hershey is also brilliant, while Winona Ryder makes great use of her relatively small role.<br/><br/>And Natalie Portman, obviously I can't really say anything about her performance that hasn't already been said, but she's brilliant. The arc of her character is nothing if not for her dazzling, and devastating portrayal. She's also a damn good dancer, and gives the performance of the year. Simply put, if there's ANY justice in the world, she'll win the Academy Award for Best Leading Actress.<br/><br/>If it wasn't completely obvious halfway through my review, I give Black Swan **** out of ****"
"mixpix33","8","1","4","24 December 2010"," With every white side, is a dark one
","This movie is more about character development than an involved plot. There is no real twist & turns that encompass many other thrillers. But the acting, casting, production & directing is top notch. Not a real heavy story line, but there are anticipations that leave the viewer wondering.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, as Nina Sayers, does an excellent job in this story. She is completely believable, and leaves nothing behind in her portrayal of this tortured to the dark side character. Mila Kunis, as Lily, the rival, does a good enough job in portraying the part. I might be the most critical on her but her dancing was as good as any of the other people in the film. Mila might have been just a touch over the top as the ""bad girl"" of the dancing troop. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mom. She plays the part like she was born for it. She is over bearing & controlling, and can be seen as the root to why Nina is so embattled. Winona Ryder (beth) plays a small part, but underlines the ruthlessness that is the competitiveness in the dancing world, and the back drop to this film; bringing out the dark side in all of the main characters. Finally, Vincent Cassel, Thomas Leroy character, is the catalyst that brings the characters together. Thomas is a very powerful character that pits the others against each other in his own clandestine manner. You get the sense that when his dancers are used up, he casts them aside like trash. In the mean time however, if you are the dancer in his favor, you are the member of royalty that is monarchy in the world of his ballet troop.<br/><br/>The story unfolds as an up & coming young talented star, Nina, is thrust to the lime light, due to the falling of grace of an aging dancer, Beth. Nina is by her own word, ""perfect"" as the white swan but falls short in the metamorphosis into the Dark Swan. The dance director, Thomas Leroy, casts doubt on Nina's ability to dance the full spectrum of the swans. Nina's battles not only emerge from competition from the other, under study dancer, Lily, but from her own mind. Nina knows all she needs, is to find ""it"", but will Leroy allow the development? Nina is tortured because she feels that Leroy is playing her with Lily. In the mean time, Lily is getting into Nina's head by being an intervening force of Nina's self discipline & personal life. Lily is selling it as a friendship but in Nina's head, it is a torment that is an em-battlement of her wits. With no real plot twists, the viewer is left wonder where they are? Though they're not in the overall plot, there are always twists that can haunt some minds"
"CriticalThinker1000","9","1","4","24 December 2010"," Superbly Taut and Compelling
","Black Swan is a spectacular artistic success without so much as a hint of pretension in spite of its ballet backdrop. This is a sinister excursion behind-the-scenes of the highly competitive, often neurotic ballet world. Like ballet, Darren Aronofsky's direction is tight, disciplined and economical without wasted activity. Natalie Portman sizzles as Nina. a virginal prima ballerina who is technically perfect but struggling to find her passion and expression, particularly her dark side. Mila Kunis delivers a deliciously ambiguous performance as Nina's friend and rival, Lilly. Barbara Hershey is wonderful as both the caring and compassionate parent and, at times, the stage mother from hell. Winona Ryder seems stiff and mechanical as Beth the, prima ballerina on her way out of the company.<br/><br/>In addition to all of its virtues, Black Swan's sound is complicit in weaving a tapestry of remarkable quality; From the subtle squeak of toe shoes dipping into the rosin box to the ruffling of costumes the audio adds significant texture and depth.<br/><br/>Cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, provides a very straightforward film allowing the artistry of the ballet and the actors to shine through."

","Quite enjoyed this movie although not quite figured it out and will have to view it again. The acting was very good and the story quite absorbing. Sort of Jacob's Ladder with less explosions and more tutus. The scenes with Portman and Ryder were the best part of the film and if the director has indeed cut Ryders participation then he needs to reinstate it pronto for the DVD as the two were electrifying in their few moments together. Portman/Kunis were good as well but not on a par with Nat and Noni. Supporting cast did a good job and the film keeps you guessing as to what exactly you are seeing. In the end it's down to you. Some good ideas generated on the IMDb boards about this and it is certainly a film for people who think about what they are watching. Unlike a film such as Inception this actually is a smart movie and one well worthy of your time. Would really like to see a film with both Ryder and Portman together in major roles as they are both really wonderful actresses. Overall for a film about Swan Lake it's a damn good thriller."
"Supachewy","9","1","4","12 December 2010"," Aronofsky Shows Psychoticness in his Finest Film
","The dark psychological thriller Black Swan is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, and Winona Ryder. The film takes place in modern day New York City.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers (Portman) is a ballerina who performs in a New York City ballet company and her life centers around dance. Her mother, Erica (Hershey), was a ballerina and the two live together in an apartment and she has much control over Nina's life making sure that dance is her number one priority. When the production of Swan Lake begins at the opening of the season the director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) chooses Nina to be the lead of the Swan Queen instead of the veteran ballerina Beth (Ryder). Also Nina believes that a new dancer at the company Lily (Kunis) is trying to steal the lead role away from her so she has to stop her. But I didn't even talk about all the crazy hallucinations and rashes and stuff...<br/><br/>The screenplay was written by Mark Heyman, and Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin and it was absolutely brilliant. All the five leads were as developed as they needed to be so the viewer could live in Nina's insane world. The hallucinations were great and the parts that weren't hallucinations were great. From the very start of the film it was enthralling and and it absorbed you into its complex plot. The only problem I had with the screenplay was the ending, it was just not as great as the rest of the film. If it was more crazily dramatic and there are some things specifically I could say about the ending but I will not because it is a spoiler.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's direction was brilliant, and I have to say this is my favorite film of his so far. I am a big fan of Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler but the two did not contain the beauty that this film contained. Speaking of The Wrestler I felt a lot of that film in this one, both are sports films but really not about sports, and both have the same sort of tracking shot which I really loved where the camera follows around either Rourke or Portman as they're just walking someplace. There is not one shot in this film that didn't feel appropriate, and the ballet scenes were absolutely beautiful. I loved a specific scene with Portman and Ryder in the hospital but I can't go into any details because it is a spoiler, but just know it was fantastic. People who think Inception is a mind bender haven't seen Black Swan.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives an Oscar worthy performance in this film and if she doesn't win the trophy on February 27 I'm going to be very angry. Because Annette Bening in The Kids Are All Right can't even compete with her and if they just give it to Bening because she is older and never won before that is just a cheap shot. Portman is brilliant as a very shy, fragile, childish woman who just wants to live her dream as being the Swan Queen. In the final scene she confirmed to me that she gave the best performance of the year and also whenever she is interacting with another of the female leads in the film she is magnificent. She is fine with Cassel also, but there is no crazy parts with Cassel.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis is known for her comedic roles in the TV shows ""Family Guy"" and ""That 70's Show"" or in the comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and in this film she turned her back on comedy and decided to go to crazy psychological thriller. She was absolutely electric in this film and was perfect for the role. When she and Portman were on the screen together so many emotions were portrayed and it was just magnificent. I really hope that Kunis will stay in serious films like this one because she can truly be a star.<br/><br/>Vincent Cassel is the director of Swan Lake and he is the only character that doesn't get involved in Nina's craziness really. He plays the part of a stage director brilliantly and it is exactly how I imagine that stressful world to be. He is attracted to Nina's character and tries to seduce her. Cassel is a very interesting actor and the only other movie I've seen him in was Ocean's 13 and I can't really judge his abilities by that. But in this film he shows much promise and I hope that he too stays around in American films because I know earlier this year he was in a couple of foreign ones.<br/><br/>The classical score for this film by Clint Mansell was perfect. It added another layer of drama, and psychological horror to the film and I was in love with it the whole time. It worked great with the stage work and even better when Nina was going crazy.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 9/10, it was fantastic and my only problem with it was the ending. If you are preparing for Oscar season this is a must see and it is the second best film of the year, the first being The Social Network. The whole entire cast delivers wonderful performances in this thrilling film. I recommend this to anyone who likes dark psychological thrillers or really the films of David Lynch. Aronofsky has his best film with this one and he will finally get an Oscar nomination. This film is absolutely crazy and I love it."
"aliensbishop","8","1","4","12 December 2010"," Thank you for this.
","Thank you for another quality film. Black Swan was an excellent effort. I found a lot of humorous moments in the film, which put an interesting twist on a pretty dark theme. <br/><br/>The alchemy between the story of Nina and the story of Swan Lake provided some interesting ambiguity. In certain scenes, Nina's role requires her to emote things which mirror her own struggles and deterioration. However, we in the audience are not sure whether she is acting for the sake of the role in the ballet or because she is really beginning to tap into her own dark places. The film walks a razor's edge as it takes both stories to the climax in the final performance of the ballet. <br/><br/>My only complaint was that Nina seems to take a journey from girlhood to insanity rather than girlhood to womanhood, which means (to me at least) that she is still a girl at the end, and nothing has changed. Again, the heavily ambiguous structure of the story could easily go another way, so I hesitate to draw any real conclusions. <br/><br/>Well Done."
"K-nightt","9","1","4","12 December 2010"," Fighting the double
","The pervasive theme in this film is the struggle one has with their own shadow... It becomes clear that Nina is trying to embody the puritanical mode of being, yet disavowing her dark side.. but the latter provides an overwhelming resistance as time passes, showing itself in sublimated manners, as it tries to free itself. Clawing away at her skin consistently is an indication of this destructive force trying desperately to find liberation. Now, the dance she engages in with this figure takes on interesting contours. The child being seen as the symptom of its parents casts a stronger light on the mother figure, who cries as she paints, who castrated herself in order to obey some greater calling in life, who smacks the daughter who tries to defuse herself from the imposing phallic mother (phallic yet castrated, creating a weird amalgam). If fusion is the tendency, is the norm, can one imposing object be replaced with another? Nina grapples with the notion of fusion or destruction of her double, a self-confident sexualized version of herself; the scene where Nina engages in sexual acts with ""Lily"" represents the sought-for incestuous bond with her own split off part it could be looked at as her reintegrating herself with her mother, but in a much more psychically-accepting manner, since true incest would be intolerable. The hallucinatory and delusional undertones color the film in a manner which may preclude any definitive interpretations. In a mind-boggling final act, the white swan is enticed by her own darkness, murders the split-off double, allowing fusion of her pure and her destructive/sexual parts when this occurs, it is clear which part predominates, the black swan astounding the spectators with her seductive guise. Reality becomes unbearable, it is made clear Nina, in trying to destroy her primitive projection, was in truth attacking self in fantasy and reality, and she ran back to her psychic haven, which she was familiar with thus the white swan reemerges the autistic self does not regard the outside world, she is pervaded by persecutory internal objects, and she must devise an illusory beautiful self and commit the ultimate sacrifice in order to die the ""perfect"" death fantasy is consummated, she rids herself in all ways of the lethal forces inside her, but to do so is to die once again as a fused being, in denial of her shadow."
"deickos","9","1","5","28 February 2017"," This is good
","This film is good not just because Mr. Aronovsky enjoys to torment himself and his actresses. This is much more ambitious. It takes us from the everyday life of an ordinary dancer and takes us higher and higher. We are grateful for that. Only by risking everything it is that you are entitled to take it all. Moreover there is serious psychology involved here - the kind you find in Shakespeare and the classics."
"raphaklopper","10","1","5","20 October 2013"," Best....ballet movie....ever made (with some scary ass sh#t!
","Director Darren Aronofsky that already had presented us: the disturbing and broken world of drug users in ""Requiem for a Dream""; the connection of different lives at different times; made us cry and laugh with the life of a retired wrestler. And now with ""Black Swan"" not only he wanted to show the world the actress that Natalie Portman is, but also wanted to scare us mentally from start to finish in this fabulous film.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" tells the story of Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) a dear and innocent New Yorker ballerina that, like all in this business, dreams to shine on stage and perhaps achieve perfection in dance. One day Nina's life changes when her art teacher Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) gives her the leading role in his remastering of the play ""The Swan Lake"" which is the Swan Queen (that actually consists in two roles, the White Swan and the Black Swan). But Thomas thinks that Nina as the White Swan is perfect, capturing the grace and innocence of the character. But not as the Black Swan that requires malice and sensuality. Qualities that another dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) manages to convey in the dance, impressing Thomas. So now the two girls begin a contradictory friendship expanding their rivalry. But with this Nina gets to know her malicious and cruel side, which can destroy her terribly inside and as a person, or perhaps help her incorporate the role of the Black Swan.<br/><br/>If you know the story of the ""Swan Lake"" then maybe it can be a spoiler for the story...... if you have the mentality strength to see it. Darren Aronofsky didn't participate this time the script giving the job to Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John J. McLaughlin, but nothing is lost, but personified. The writing from start to finish creates a great metaphor in the film involving the story of ""Swan Lake"" and the life of Nina.<br/><br/>Nina is the innocent White Swan trapped in her world wanting to somehow break free. And when she meets the gentleman Thomas he gives her a chance to shine, replacing the dying swan Beth (Winona Ryder) in the role. But it becomes impossible when the malicious Black Swan Lily steals everyone's attention with his guile and sexuality. Now Nina has only her friend and mother the swan queen Erica (Barbara Hershey) to aid her.<br/><br/>But not only is the metaphor of the story in the narrative shines in the film, but suddenly the script takes the film to a dark and terrifying side. That happened when Nina meets Lily which is clearly Nina's opposite: she lies, makes fun of people, and of course uses her sensuality to her advantage. Things that Nina had never been able to be or do, and strikes up a friendship with her rival to might try to find her malicious and sexy side, but it starts to bring great dangers with disturbing visions and changes of attitudes. That's where the terrifying dialogs shown concepts that we all have a dark and evil side in each one of us. Not only in dialogs that this is shown, but also in the magnificent direction.<br/><br/>The direction of Aronofsky has never been so great as it is here. Yes I know, ""Requiem"" had that depressing and disturbing tone. And in ""Wrestler"" he put us in the place of Randy both walking the streets as faking a fight in the ring. But here is a little bit of both, not only putting us in places that Nina goes in her home or on stage during the show, but also dark and disturbing moments where Aronofsky uses the perfect use of a beautiful cinematography and (surprisingly) visual effects (which helps in the most beautiful, creepy and metaphorical scene in the movie).<br/><br/>The entire cast is fantastic: Winona Ryder as always superb; Vincent Cassel as always with that British air challenger and cocky; Mila Kunis with a good level of performance. But as I said earlier, who stands out is and Natalie Portman, from start to finish simply phenomenal.<br/><br/>Many may disagree, but I believe that this movies is so far Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece. ""Black Swan"" with its metaphors about the fight between our good and evil side within the play of ""Swan Lake"", along with an engaging script and brilliant-terrifying direction with the phenomenal performance of Natalie Portman manages to stand out as a masterpiece of this generation.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Black Swan, the little film from 2010 that could, is actually a very good film - despite the accumulation of backlash the film has received in the midst of all the glistening praise and Oscar recognition (the film received five nominations and won one for Best Actress). People criticize the film for being too ""pretentious"", too ""artistic"", too ""complicated"", too ""corny"", and it becomes quite obvious these people are simply looking for problems because they don't want to appreciate the film, for whatever reason. <br/><br/>The film itself is technically perfect, with stunning performances, beautiful cinematography, excellent set pieces, costume design and a very involving, entertaining plot. The only real weak point is the dialog, which does come across as a little 'trashy' at times, but it's not even that bad, nor is it that trashy. It's not a cheesy exploitation flick disguised as a high-brow art film... it's simply a good film, with good performances. It's likely to go down as one of the true great American films of modern cinema. It's challenging and heart-breaking, but also beautiful and hopeful."
"bigplatts","8","1","5","19 February 2012"," A Unique but Flawed Masterpiece
","Black Swan is definitely an interesting film, telling the story of Nina (Natalie Portman) a Ballerina who's dedicated to landing the double part of the black and white swans in the real world ballet ""Swan Lake"". The story is both a deep emotional drama focusing on the pitfalls of talent and fame, and also a Psychological thriller about the growing madness of it's lead character as she tries to push herself to the limit to get the best performance. I do admit that both of these sides to the film are well done but put together the overall quality is questionable.<br/><br/>In terms of the main story Black Swan is a hugely unpredictable tale that leaves you guessing about what will happen next all the way through, but this at times becomes annoying when things that happened turn out just be dreams or illusions that bring the story down a lot. The story as a whole is strong and is filled with double meanings and huge amounts of symbolism that really forces you to take part in the film, but without ruining anything I will say that the ending is quite disappoint as it leaves too much open and is the one major flaw of this film that drags it down a little. But in a way it testament to the great quality of the rest of the film that even with the lousy ending I can rate the film so highly.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film are great, with the camera work being spot on and the ballet's performed beautifully. Acting here is also very strong, Natalie Portman truly shows why she deserved the Oscar she won hear with a performance that shows both a like-able and innocent character, yet one that is slowly going insane and pushing herself too far. The supporting cast is strong too: Mila Kunis gives a career best performance as the other ballet dancer gunning for the role of Nina is after, Vincent Cassel plays the dance instructor well while his character becomes a bit more interesting and like-able as the film progresses, and Winona Ryder plays a small but memorable role as the old dancer of the part who has recently been fired.<br/><br/>I really have to give praise to director Darren Aronofsky, he creates a brilliant feeling of urgency throughout the film, and while dealing with big issues and a film that could have been boring he actually makes everything exciting and keeps you guessing. Yet Black Swan is not flawless, it's clearly a film that is not for everyone and its less a film about the story itself and more about what it is saying, after my first viewing I felt very annoyed at the ending and how it didn't seem to resolve anything but looking back now I see it's a film that really needs time to dwell over and think about.<br/><br/>As a whole Black Swan is a interestingly unique and well crafted film that goes well with Aronofsky's other film The Wrestler, and while I find the wrestler a much more fun and easy to watch movie, I find Black Swan a much more thoughtful and surprising movie. A flawed masterpiece."

Mila Kunis gives the best performance in the film; my favorite moment was when she asked ""Was I Good?"".<br/><br/>Despite the plodding pace, there really wasn't enough character development. If the movie could just have genuinely, and succinctly, made me appreciate the non-life Nina was living, and built more palpable tension into the relationship with Erica, it would have been far better. Of course, it still would have needed to deliver a more powerful finish to capitalize on that tension.<br/><br/>I wondered if ballet fans might have seen value I failed to, but some of the other reviews seem to indicate the reverse.<br/><br/>All that said, once I got to the half-way point, it had JUST enough of my interest for me to watch the rest.

"Jonny_Numb","8","1","5","10 January 2011"," Dark Beauty
","Darren Aronofsky has a thing for ambiguity. For those who like their films to leave some food for thought once the credits roll, he has a way of subverting our expectations, making us question all that happened before giving us a coda that inspires its own set of queries. What really happens after that final shot in ""The Wrestler""? What transpires the following day in the lives of the junkies who have hit bottom (but still remain alive) in ""Requiem for a Dream""? Just what the heck is ""The Fountain"" all about? For most of his career, Aronofsky has toyed with viewer expectation, and while his works up to this point have never approached the out-there, sexually provocative dreamscapes of David Lynch or the deeply distorted psychoses conveyed through the eyes of Roman Polanski's tortured protagonists, ""Black Swan"" comes pretty damn close to capturing a claustrophobic waking nightmare on film. Slim on character history or any sort of background detail, Aronofsky weaves the tale of Nina (Natalie Portman, in a role of equal parts beauty and visceral horror), a young ballerina who lives with her unhinged, washed-up mother (Barbara Hershey), and pines to take the lead in her troupe's production of ""Swan Lake."" When she snags the part (under the menacingly perverse and perfectionist eye of director Vincent Cassel), her waking life spirals into a hallucinatory madness that is at first subtle, but becomes increasingly otherworldly as the curtain nears. Things are compounded by Lily (Mila Kunis), the thrill-seeking Yin to Nina's naive Yang, who may have ulterior motives in befriending the newly minted lead. Aronofsky established his camera as an invasive stalker as he followed Mickey Rourke around (with sometimes uncomfortable physical closeness) in ""The Wrestler""; with ""Black Swan,"" he uses physical closeness to not only push us up against the fatigue and dissolution of his characters, but to immerse us in a unique sphere of activity (the last film I recall using ballet as a focal point is Dario Argento's ""Suspiria""); the result is a film that is always in a state of motion -- sometimes fluid, sometimes jerky; but always progressing toward something. True to its title, ""Black Swan"" is centered on the darkness of the soul, the dark motives of men, and what people do in the name of perfection; it is a troubling, stylistically assured masterpiece that would make a great (and near-equal) double feature with Polanski's ""Repulsion."""
"MoviePopcornCostsTooMuch","Null","1","5","1 January 2011"," Gratuitous Swan
","We all know that Natalie Portman is one of the best weepers and criers in film but Aronofsky sure lets her beat it to death in this one. Honestly, felt like it could have used a couple more rewrites. She's weepy and whiny and needy the entire film until she beats up ( or thinks she beats up ) her ballerina competitor.<br/><br/>The lesbian scene sure as hell seemed gratuitous when I was watching it and I tried to find a reason for it in the narrative of the film but didn't find a reason until the next day in an interview with Portman: ""We added it because otherwise men wouldn't want to come see a movie about the ballet"" At least she's honest about it. The masturbation scene seemed way over the top as well - note to men: search for the masturbation and lesbian scenes on the internet and avoid seeing the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Not sure how this can lay claim to being an 'art film' with such a shameless shilling of the actress in a lesbian scene to make a few extra bucks. I wouldn't mind any of the above if it was a good movie - but its too one-dimensional - she's weepy and needy and wimpy the entire movie and then when she finally does get to do her blessed 'black swan' but its only for 30 seconds.<br/><br/>I expected a lot more from Aronofsky after 'The Wrestler'. Granted, a ton of people and critics loved this film so who needs to hear from me? I would imagine Aronofsky is falling victim to his own success being surrounded by art critics, actors and producers slathering and slobbering all over him with awe and compliments thereby pushing his ego to new limits which allowed him to deliver a story thin on narrative. Who's going to edit him? Anybody who can sit before Mickey Rourke prior to The Wrestler and say ""I'm not going to do this unless you do exactly what I tell you to on set"" has got a pair of cajones on him, lets hope his cajones don't get so big that he loses his way like a Noah Baumbach.<br/><br/>Hopefully he does have some kind of mentor in his life that he will listen to. I'd like to see him take a step back first and stick with a grounded, real-life character movie than proceed straight to some Atom Egoyan-ish, Terrence Mallick-ish meandering dream scape devoid of any grounding in reality.<br/><br/>My guess is the latter. Too bad."
"jzappa","9","1","5","30 December 2010"," Ruthless Perfectionism
","Clint Mansell tries to root this film's score in Tchaikovsky's classic ballet Swan Lake, though with revolutionary conversions to it. The film itself does the same. Vivid, visually invigorating, reflective, strange, well-cast and mercilessly severe like all of his films, Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is a singular experience, told with fanatical power, superbly and enigmatically bizarre. It fixes on a performance by Natalie Portman that is out-and-out courageous, and epitomizes the clash of good and evil in Tchaikovsky's ballet. Ballet, opera, musical theater, most traditional performance affords itself overindulgence. Ballet is one of majestic motion, of the fantasy of conquest over reality and even the certainty of Newton's laws. But it requires from its performers years of arduous precision, the sort of bodily and psychological preparation that takes control over ordinary life. This clash between the superlative and the real is overwhelming Nina Sayers, Portman's character.<br/><br/>Her life has been bestowed to ballet. Was that completely her decision? Her mother was a dancer once, and now bestows her life to her daughter's dancing. They split a petite apartment that seems alternately like a sanctuary and a chamber. They giggle and prattle like siblings. Something seems off. Conversely, the thrilling physicality of dancing is captured in Matthew Libatique's 16mm cinematography, with the psychosomatically unsettling scenes and, especially, the dance scenes.<br/><br/>Nina dances in a company directed by the domineering Thomas Leroy. The scope of his self-image is indicated by his present season, which will re-imagine the masterpieces (as Aronofsky seems to be doing to the very same production). Having discarded his former lead dancer and lover, he's currently auditioning for a fresh lead. Swan Lake needs its lead to play contradictory roles. Nina is undoubtedly the finest dancer for the White Swan. However Thomas finds her too ""perfect"" for the Black Swan. She dances with skill, not emotion.<br/><br/>Thomas, the brute, is notorious for having trysts with his performers. Played with threatening overconfidence by Vincent Cassel, he evidently has ideas about the chaste Nina. This generates a predicament in her mind: How can she liberate herself from the procedural perfection and sexual suppression imposed by her mother, while keeping constant to their lewd domestic relationship? There are also rudiments of All About Eve and Dostoevsky's The Double in her relationship with Mila Kunis' polarized character.<br/><br/>As much a rousing night terror as it is a mature theater melodrama and a daring sexual initiation for its protagonist, this hypnotically fanatical film will be reminiscent to some of Aronofsky's predecessor, The Wrestler. Both illustrate determined showmanship in the name of a calling, initiating the obliteration of personal lives. I was prompted also of Aronofsky's virtuoso debut with Pi, about a man driven berserk by his pursuit of the complete mathematical expression. Ultimately, his The Fountain was about a man who seems to overcome the whole coordinate system of existence. Aronofsky's characters make no little plans.<br/><br/>The focal plot scaffolding of Black Swan are time-honored: backstage enmity, life imitating art, bottled-up rage and painfully submerged lust. Aronofsky floats dissonantly from those trustworthy procedures into the mind of Nina. She starts to confound existential borders. The film opens with a dream, and it becomes apparent that her dream life is adjoining with her conscious one. Aronofsky and Portman track this audaciously where it takes them, into a fever dream blurring the fine line between a performer playing a role and a psychotic succumbing to delusion. The ensuing psychosexual commotion about a single-minded ballerina could've effortlessly been ridiculous and overexcited, but Aronofsky is able to twist those prospects to his benefit, and seldom aside from the films of David Cronenberg have the physiological effects of psychosis and its delirium been so primordially, plainly and roughly described. Polanski's Repulsion also seems a major inspiration in its story of repression leading to madness in a virginal girl.<br/><br/>Portman has never played a character this possessed before, and never confronted a larger physical trial. Aronofsky has a way of drenching his stars in ice water, then crashing in for the most candid possible close-up, literally and figuratively. Someway she becomes exaggerated and nevertheless remains in character: Even in moments of excess, you don't spot her acting. The other actors are like dance partners keeping her in the air. Barbara Hershey gives a completely attuned performance as a mother whose love is genuine, whose faults are not intimated, whose own strictness has all been zeroed on the formation of her daughter.<br/><br/>The misfortune of Nina, and of countless young performers and athletes, is that flawlessness in one aspect of life has led to forfeit in most of the others. At a young age, everything becomes concentrated on satisfying someone, and come what may it gets clenched that that idol can never be satisfied. One becomes ideal in every aspect save life itself.<br/><br/>This sincerely exhaustive conquest has an exquisite climactic peak. All of the theses of the song and existence, all of the analogies of narrative and dance, all of the mystification of reality and trance rally in a striking elation of soaring fervor. There's indeed but one place this can take us, and it does. If I were you, I wouldn't consume too much time struggling to understand precisely what occurs in a matter-of-fact way. Just lose yourself in the moments of muted, temperamental lyricism that yield grandiloquent visuals, in-your-face emotions, and a time-honored soundtrack that gets turned to full volume."
"qaiserq","9","1","5","29 December 2010"," A masterpiece and an Oscar-Nominee Role
","I was much anticipating this one from Darren Aronofsky, and when this came and hit the big screen, wow, the movie is a master-piece. The movie revolves around Nina (Natalie Portman, who has performed a perfect role, as she says in the end, ""I did Perfect!""), Nina is a ballerina in NY ballet company and she is trying her level best to achieve the perfection in becoming Black Swan. She possess the capability to perform White Swan in the new ballet directed by Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), but her dark-twin the Black Swan is not coming out. This movie is a special treat for Perfectionists, who live their lives in achieving perfection in whatever field they are, yes, and they are serious about their work, in fact mad about it. The supporting cast Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey (Nina's Mother) has performed well to groom the main character, but i still think Cassel did not give his level-best in this one (like he performed in Eastern Promises, Brotherhood of the Wolf, etc). But you must watch this one to see Oscar-Nominee performance by Natalie Portman. Chao!"
"jfgibson73","6","1","5","28 December 2010"," I have to include spoilers to talk about this movie
","Watching the first hour of this movie, I was very much drawn into this story and couldn't wait to see how it resolved. Natalie Portman was fun to watch as a delicate young girl working herself to death to be a perfect ballerina. The conflict came from the director of her company, who pushed her to play a dual role that required her to take on a dark, seductive mindset. We see that her character, Nina, still lives with her mother, who has coddled and protect her, not allowing her to be exposed to aspects of life that would give her any experience at being dark or messy. Then, we meet Lily, Nina's polar opposite: impulsive, liberated, sexual. She is as uninhibited as Nina is controlled. The story teases that Lily will help Nina open up, and starts to move that way. Where I became frustrated was in the second half of the movie. Nina has more and more things happen to her that we think will finally allow her to dance the black swan as her director wants: as a sexual, seductive temptress. But after each event--flirtations from the director, a night on the town with Lily, standing up to her mom--she remains cold and mousy. In the final moments of the nearly two hour film, we finally get the climactic release we deserve, as Nina fully becomes the black swan and goes to a new place through her dance. However, by this point she has descended almost completely into madness, having so many hallucinations and dream sequences, that the audience can't be sure that any of what they have seen has been real.<br/><br/>My opinion of this movie is that I would have enjoyed it more without the mental illness. It didn't really interest me to see Nina go crazy and destroy herself as a result of the pressure to perform. I am not a fan of stories that have characters lose their minds to take the story where it has to go. If it had been written so that she somehow became a victim of her own ambition, I would have found it more interesting. When a movie does what this one did and fills its running time with dream sequences and hallucinations, it feels to me like a cheat. I'm watching things that aren't real in the world of the characters I am trying to place myself in.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have suggested that parts of this movie are open to interpretation, but I think the final scene in which Nina sees the stage lights become a single bright haze must surely mean that she passed on, presumably from self-injury during one of her spells. I compare this to the ending of the horror movie May, which did roughly the same thing, but made more sense to me. The lead character injured herself severely enough to bleed to death, but didn't start hallucinating until she was beginning to fade. It made her characters choices more valid, because she was acting on her own motivations until that point, and not responding to imaginary occurrences.<br/><br/>I did enjoy those final moments when Nina danced the black swan and seemed to really go off the deep end. It was the thrilling climax I had been waiting for, but didn't give me as much satisfaction as I felt it would. As I said, I felt the movie got a little off track--it build up my expectations, and when I thought I was ready for the climax, it kind of deflated my interest a bit, causing me to not be as emotionally invested as I might have had the story been a little tighter. Overall, I thought most aspects of the movie were done very well, and it was certainly an exciting piece of flimmaking, but for me, not the classic it might have been."

","It is a great movie. Not perfect but worthy seeing. After you watch it, you might still think about it over and over sometime. The actress did a stunning job. And it is surprising to see the end which I did not expect that ending.<br/><br/>After finishing this movie, I still had some parts that puzzled me. I guess that's the success of this movie. I feel sorry for the ballerina. It is not that scary, but it is full of weird scene. You need to figure out what is real life and what is illusion on your own. That was challenging.<br/><br/>Overall, you should go to see this movie if you like Shutter Island (Leonardo DiCaprio)."
"nholder93","7","1","5","25 December 2010"," As Flawed As It Is Beautiful
","Darren Aronofsky's latest film is either a masterpiece or an awful mess. Or maybe both. Black Swan tells the story of a ballerina dancer named Nina, played by Natalie Portman, who is cast as the Swan Queen in Swan Lake. She believes her role is threatened by another dancer named Lily, played by Mila Kunis. Nina's perfectionism starts getting the better of her as she slowly loses grip on reality. Her situation is made even more complicated by her overbearing mother who was once a ballerina but gave it up to raise Nina. Aronofsky's take-no-prisoners film-making style is at the forefront of the picture. He leaves very little to the imagination which is what has caused such polarizing view of his film. His shaky camera is always right behind Portman's head and it does get a little annoying after a while but it also builds tension nicely. That being said Aronofsky's no Hitchcock. The way he builds tension is always ruined by his heavy-handed symbolism. In almost every scene there's a mirror of some sort. I suppose this is to help unintelligent people figure out that Nina's losing it or maybe Natalie Portman just likes to look at herself. Also, Aronofsky tries to have the story mirror the plot of the ballet, similar to The Red Shoes. After learning the ballet's plot at the beginning of the film, the entire audience will know how the movie ends. Therefore, the Black Swan's ""twist ending"" is rendered useless. There is a twist ending but unfortunately it's not quite worth what it puts us through. Despite its flaws, the film is technically beautiful. The makeup and costume design perfectly complements the film's dark tone. Portman's performance is nothing special, but I may be biased since I'm not a fan of her work. It may also be that I'm tired of Portman being portrayed as an innocent damsel in distress. No,the best performance in the film is that of Mila Kunis. She has to act both what she is in reality and as the threat she represents to Nina. Surprisingly, she pulls off both rather well. Also in the cast is Winona Ryder playing a former prima-ballerina that has fallen from grace. It's a good film that's definitely worth seeing but don't get your hopes too high."
"PopcornJury","7","1","5","22 December 2010"," Quite possibly my most anticipated of the year, Black Swan let me down with it's dark, difficult, and absurd downward spiral. Am I impressed? Yes. Am I enthralled? No.
","Black Swan is not the movie most people think it is. Whenever the film is brought up in casual conversation, it's often referred to as the movie about ballet or the new Natalie Portman movie about a ballerina. While ballet provides the backdrop for the film, this is not a film about ballet. This is a film about the infinite pursuit of perfection, the intense desire to succeed, and the extremely dark places our mind can go when something becomes an obsession.<br/><br/>Black Swan stars Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers, a ballerina in a New York City ballet company. The company is getting ready to stage a new revival of Swan Lake, a contemporary classic in which a girl is turned into a swan by an evil sorcerers curse. Where in the original, the girl is broken from the spell when she finds a prince who will set her free, in this revival, the prince falls in love with the wrong swan, the black swan, ultimately leading to the death of the white. The twist? In this revival, the dancer selected as the Swan Queen needs to play both the white swan and the black swan, a role that on one hand requires purity and perfection, while the other requires sexuality and a sense of intense passion. Does Nina Sayers have both? That's the central theme to this story as the rest of the film progresses.<br/><br/>In his review for Black Swan, Roger Ebert writes, ""Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is a full-bore melodrama, told with passionate intensity, gloriously and darkly absurd."" With this statement, I couldn't agree more. This film is all out warfare on its central character of Nina Sayers. It is extremely dark, and often at times, as Ebert States, completely absurd. There were moments when I knew what was coming next and still had to look away. There were moments when I wanted to scream at the screen and say ""Why is this happeningplease pull yourself together!"" I don't know whether to praise the film for being so ""out there"" or to criticize it for going too far. It's an intriguing film, but I didn't once enjoy it. It's beautiful but completely uncomfortable, and it couldn't be further from what I think every average, everyday film-goer is expecting.<br/><br/>If there's one reason to see this film, other than to simply witness the insanity, it's for the performance of Natalie Portman. In this role, she's less of an actress and more of a true performer. She's featured in every scene of the film, every shot. She trained for 10-months to prepare for her role in this film and it shows as she is not simply a stand in in any of the ballet scenes, she is a literal ballerina. She weighs what appears to be under 90 lbs. exhibits the purest of pure and the darkest of dark. She literally transforms from white to black, sane to insane, shining to stark. It is my most sincere prediction that she will win an Oscar for this performance, and regardless of the film itself, I would consider it well deserved.<br/><br/>Black Swan is an evil movie, more disturbing than most films I've seen recently. It's a horror film and a thriller, hidden beautifully under the disguise of a contemporary ballet. Is it worthy of the critical acclaim it's garnering nationwide since it's initial limited release? As an art form, I'd say yes. As a source quality entertainment, I'd say no. Black Swan is the equivalent of watching a straight A student turn into a down and out junkie. Just because the film is award-winning, doesn't mean it's enjoyable. Quite possibly my most anticipated of the year, Black Swan let me down with it's dark, difficult, and absurd downward spiral. Am I impressed? Yes. Am I enthralled? No.<br/><br/>Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com"

","Darren Aronofsky hits another home run!! Loved Requiem For A Dream, The Wrestler, The Fountain and now this. This is a psychological thriller that place a young and very ambitious ballet dancer named Nina (Natalie Portman) who lives with her over controlling ex ballet dancer mother (Barbara Hershey) When given the chance of a lifetime to replace the star in an upcoming ballet ""Swan Lake"" although the producer of the show says its a new take on the over done ballet. Nina will have to take on the duo rolls of the white swan and the evil twin the black swan. She has heavy competition for this role in the form of Lily (Mila Kunis). Incredible amounts of pressure and an influential dark side from lily, may make Nina the star of the show or a real life black swan herself. Don't think cause this film revolves around the ballet it is going to suck, cause it definitely doesn't. Its a good movie about how pressures can make you spiral into the darkness of insanity!"

"ruthandjan","7","1","5","20 December 2010"," Powerful but lacking
","First the stuff I liked. Beautifully designed, photographed and acted. The movie is stylish and full of powerful images and intense emotions. Worth it just for that.<br/><br/>Stuff I was disappointed with. Easy stuff first. The sex was way too explicit. It was embarrassing and threw me out of the movie. I was aware of sitting in a theatre with a bunch of other people watching this stuff instead of staying with the story.<br/><br/>My main criticism is that a movie like this needs to be centred around the lead character's relationship with the people around her, but her relationship was mainly to the character in the ballet. What was her fear about? Why was she so afraid of exposing her inner self? What demons lived there? You never find out.<br/><br/>Her relationship with her mother should have been the bedrock of what troubled her, but their relationship was never exposed. What was the problem? Was it her mother's oppressive love, her mother's too high expectations? Could she only see herself through her mother's eyes? The movie does not explore their relationship at all.<br/><br/>The first scene where we see them together was completely wrong. Instead of a couple who have lived together for thirty years with a relationship set in stone, they seem to be flirting with each other like they are just getting to know each other. As a parent of older children myself, it all seemed false.<br/><br/>Her relationship with the ballet director, the man driving her out of her comfort zone was also way too lightly sketched out. He was driving her to the point of insanity yet you never got any idea of the level of emotion, whether love or hate, that could possible cause that. And his suggestion that she needed to experience an orgasm was just silly. Any 30 year old woman will have had one. He needed to draw her into a darker place in her psyche and show her that that place was a part of her too. He needed to be a lot more depraved.<br/><br/>This movie is good and worth seeing, but it could have been truly great, and it wasn't."
"room102","7","1","5","20 December 2010"," Black Swan
","Just watched it. I have some mixed feelings, but overall I'm quite impressed.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman: I believe this is the first movie I saw Natalie Portman actually acting. Of course I enjoyed seeing her in previous films, mainly because she's so damn cute/hot, but I was never really impressed by her acting. This movie is a new level for her. I'm not surprised to see her nominated for a Golden Globe.<br/><br/>Barbara Hershey: The Mother was really tailored for Ellen Burstyn. I actually imagined Burstyn playing this part while watching some of the scenes. Darren could have changed the mother into a grandmother and put Burstyn there - she would have been perfect. That's not saying that Hershey wasn't good - she was.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis: I'm not familiar with her work, so it's hard for me to judge. I can't say I was impressed by her acting. I think it was average, nothing more.<br/><br/>Vincent Cassel: He gives an excellent performance.<br/><br/>Cinematography: I love Matthew Libatique's work. He's a genius. In this movie I have some mixed feelings. The dancing parts were really special. It felt like the camera is dancing with the dancers - and I believe that's what Libatique was aiming for. As for shooting the entire movie with a hand-held camera - well, I'm not too crazy about this concept in general and this movie is no exception. I think it's distracting. I prefer clean cinematography. Having said that, the hand-held shooting makes more sense on the second part of the movie. Oh, and BTW, the extended use of hand-held camera and especially the shooting behind the back reminded me of ""The Wrestler"". I read that some people suggest that the two movies are two halves of the same film. I partially agree on that, as I also noticed the similarities between the two movies while watching Black Swan.<br/><br/>Music: Clint Mansell does it again. I don't think I've ever actually heard the entire Swan Lake, so I really can't tell how much of the score is original. In any case, it works. The music on the second part of the film (and especially towards the end) is bombastic - and it works!<br/><br/>Effects: I really liked the body modifications. Too bad there wasn't more of it. The body change in front of the mirror immediately felt like the work of David Cronenberg.I really expected to see a long and extended full body modification - and I got some of it at the end of the movie during the dance. They did quite an amazing work there with the visual effects while she dances. Again, too bad it wasn't longer.<br/><br/>Direction: Darren Aronofsky's direction is solid as always. The first part is a bit slow, but never boring. And yes, it's not easy to make Ballet look cool. The second part (or last third) is where the movie's momentum really is. Again, I really liked the body modifications and I really wish they were more elaborated and that there were more of them.<br/><br/>Mirrors: While watching the movie it was obvious to me that Darren aimed to have a mirror in every scene. Nice concept, but a was a bit distracting at times - especially during the dancing, when my attention was more about watching Darren's use of doubles in order to achieve the camera not reflecting in the mirror (an old trick that is always impressive on film).<br/><br/>I'm not sure I got all the meanings Darren wanted to give - and I guess that's partially the reason I didn't completely identified with the movie. I guess I'll have to rewatch it.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good film. Much better than the other Drek we see lately (=in recent years). No, I don't think it deserves to be in IMDb's top 250 and I don't think it's Darren's best, but I liked it more than ""The Wrestler"" and overall it's a very good film.<br/><br/>6.5/10 That's my first impression. I should watch it again."

","Erica (Barbara Hershey): What happened to my sweet girl? Nina (Natalie Portman): She's gone!<br/><br/>In auteur Darron Aronofsky's Black Swan, the Swan Queen (Portman) is ""gone"" even before she's pegged for the lead in Swan Lake. In the best Method Acting spirit, she becomes like the Black Swan because the White Swan is too easy.<br/><br/>This is the most melodramatic film of 2010. This is the best actress (Portman) of 2010. This is the best director of 2010. But this may not be the best film of 2010 because of the ease with which it depresses with the over-the-top dramatic conflict between the two poles of innocence and experience, good and evil. It doesn't have the wit and relative subtlety of All about Eve, a film also about female ambition, nor does it have the relative grace of The Red Shoes (1948), a ballet film to which this must be compared.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's camera twirls like a ballerina and tracks the star with back shots that become too obvious not to notice. The close-ups of Nina are as constant as in any film with Angelina Jolie, and after a while, enough already. Yet the director catches the frenetic pace of rehearsal with that movement; he also captures the doppelganger of Nina's duality by framing multiple shots through mirrors and reflecting water. After awhile, enough already.<br/><br/>There can never be enough of good acting, and this film has a surfeit. Besides Portman's Oscar-worthy performance, Vincent Cassell plays artistic director Thomas Leroy with a genial malevolence that takes the classic impresario in Red Shoes, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), to a new level of Machiavelli, or Pygmalion, if you will. Barbara Hershey as Nina's creepily smothering, former ballerina mother effectively keeps Freud at the forefront. Mila Kunis as Nina's rival has an earthiness that contrasts vividly with the other uptight ballerinas.<br/><br/>Black Swan can also be easily seen as a metaphor for the obsession necessary for any great performer. Nina's descent into madness can be nothing less than the natural outcome of greatness achieved at the sacrifice of one's personal freedom and sanity. Despite the flourishes of this hyper drama, Aronofsky has achieved the greatness also in his film: It's not the rude world of his Wrestler with Mickey Rourke also picking at his flesh, but the close up and personal view of an achieving, troubled performer is the same.<br/><br/>Nina: ""I had the craziest dream last night about a girl who has turned into a swan, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself.'"

While I enjoyed the complex portrayal of Nina Sayers (N.Portman), I was somewhat underwhelmed with the remaining aspects of the movie. Wizard who is responsible for bringing us the ultimate drug addiction tale ""Requiem for a dream"", Darren Arnofsky, significantly underachieved and got swallowed up by the worst kind of a monster- mediocrity. While Portman dances skillfully amidst issues such as being over-controlled, inhibited and somewhat destructive the rest of characters don't really bring anything to the table.

If it is an old story, it is craftily reinvented and very well illustrated.

","""Black Swan"" is macabre indulgent crap. Although exquisitely crafted, it's ultimately a waste of 2 hours. Director Darren Aronofsky's touch is so heavy handed and blunt in his tale of spiraling meltdown. Natalie Portman is powerful as Nina, and will win an Oscar. ""Black Swan"" is classic tragedy, but lacks eloquence and resonance. Paradoxically, Aronofsky's sledgehammer like narrative overwhelms the elusive grace and refinement of ballet. I admired Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"", also a tale of deceptive physicality and discipline. However, something is amok here. Even as literal metaphor of ""Swan Lake"", ""Black Swan"" morphs as a very unpleasant experience. Portman's Nina hauntingly says, ""I just want to be perfect."" This echoes throughout as tortured obsession. Aside from the magnificent prowess of dance, the screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin is unrelenting waves of corporeal rage and suffering. <br/><br/>The hand held camera shots in ""Black Swan"" give it a gritty and austere feel. Natalie Portman trained nearly 2 years to prepare for the role of Nina Sayers. Her protruding ribs in her breast are scary authenticity. Her gaunt persona captures the rigid and wounded spirited Nina, who is an impeccable technician, but fearful of risking the freedom of her art. As the story unfolds, perhaps her instincts were warranted. Portman is riveting and nuanced. She enrolls us into Nina's life despite Aronofsky's opaque narrative strokes. Nina suffers blistering nerve rashes and mangled toes. Nina is the dedicated ballerina, who is finally called to audition for the role of the Swan Queen in ""Swan Lake"". <br/><br/>Director Thomas (darkly charming Vincent Cassel) knows that Nina can embody the White Swan, but questions whether she can summon the dark fire of the Black Swan. Thomas replaces his aging lover-- prima ballerina Beth (used and tragic Winona Ryder), in his envisioning of ""Swan Lake"". Nina is aware that she may be auditioning for more than just the lead. Her obsessive stage Mom Erica (dramatically taut Barbara Hershey), also fears the inevitable. Erica is eerily controlling, and as a former dancer proxies her life for her daughter Nina. Here Aronofsky brilliantly exposes Nina as one who forsakes greatness for perfection. However, I think he forfeits this thread in the catharsis. Enter Mila Kunis's Lily, the Black Swan of the tale. Lily is the talented untamed dancer, willing to risk all in life and in dance. Lily lacks the precision of Nina, but possesses unbridled passion and sensuality. <br/><br/>Lily and Nina are logical rivals, and lyrical Yin and Yang of the same person. If you are a fan of YouTube, you are aware of their erotic Sapphic tryst. It is captivating; however, like much of ""Black Swan"" this occurs as manipulation on the part of the director. The concluding arc of ""Black Swan"" lost me. Half way through, we get that Nina is battling for her own sanity. To that end, Portman is amazing and displays poignant suffering and muted joy. The performances are grand. Cassel is creepy duplicity. Kunis is awesome as the maverick dancer living on the edge. <br/><br/>I think ""Black Swan"" fails despite great effort in exposing the perfection myth. Yes, perfection is manifested in youth, beauty, and talent. There is perfection in icons like James Dean and Bruce Lee. The tragedy of these icons was that the possibility of greatness was forsaken too soon. ""Black Swan"" celebrates the pursuit of perfection, not the legacy of greatnessâ€”of altering and inspiring the world. Perfection is misguided and fleeting pursuit. Greatness is the game worth playing and living. ""Black Swan"" seems to miss this distinction, and that is a little sad."

","From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler), I saw the review of the film just an hour before seeing it on Film 2011 with Claudia Winkleman, it certainly looked the part. Basically ballet artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) announces that the New York ballet company he helps run is going to do the production of Swan Lake for the new season, and with the retirement of original ballet star Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) means there will be auditions for a replacement lead. The role requires the female performer to play both the part of the innocent White Swan and the deceptive Black Swan, and beautiful twenty-something Nina Sayers (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Natalie Portman) is initially the first choice, certainly for the White Swan. Struggling to convince Leroy that she can play both parts, he has his eye on her competition, beautiful twenty-something new dancer Lily (Family Guy's Golden Globe nominated Mila Kunis) who nails the Black Swan perfectly. Initially Nina and Lily start off as good friends, hanging out together and of course rehearsing for the big production, with Nina as the White Swan and Lily as the Black Swan, Nina even has a fantasy about her in a dream. Slowly though Nina may be losing her mind, as she struggles to perfect get anywhere with Leroy, Lily steals her thunder, and her former ballerina mother Erica (BAFTA nominated Barbara Hershey) suffocatingly controls her. Her distinction between nightmarish fantasy and reality is rapidly disappearing as her skin develops strange bloody marks and scratches, her sky and innocent attitude turns into fiery anger, and she may be turning into the Black Swan she should for the production. Nina may have established herself as the new star for the show, but her darker side has really broadened, and it causes real problems when it eventually comes to the production to go on stage. Nina pulls off being the White Swan in the first act, but one flaw causes her to retreat to her dressing room, where Lily comes in, they fight, and she supposedly stabs her to death with a piece of broken mirror glass, and hides the body. Returning to the stage, this time as the Black Swan, her dark side finally breaks out to the point where she turns into the Black Swan she has ""become"", in her mind anyway, and she gets a standing ovation from the audience. Before the finale she is shocked to Nina come to her dressing room and congratulate her, she had another hallucination, and it was in fact herself she stabbed, being the White Swan of her, but covers it up and carry on. The last scene of the production sees Nina, as the White Swan, kill herself by throwing herself off a cliff, i.e. off a high stand onto a mat, ending with huge applause, and that is when everyone sees the blood, and she lies dying smiling that she was ""perfect"". Also starring Benjamin Millepied as David, Ksenia Solo as Veronica, Kristina Anapau as Galina and Mark Margolis as Mr. Fithian. Portman I have often found a mixed actress, with naff films like the Star Wars prequels, not bad films like V for Vendetta, and good films like Closer in her repertoire, I was hoping she would one day do something great, and hear she certainly does. Portman is mesmerising as the extremely troubled ballerina, and she deifnately deserved all the awards, Kunis is really good as her slightly toxic friend, and Hershey is terrific as the dominating mother, and Aronofsky brings back the disturbing he has before. The story is one of the most inventive in the world of ballet, an art form that normally doesn't interest me much, I could say the lesbian moment is great, but seriously, the film is filled with extraordinarily hypnotic moments, most actually quite terrifying and sinister, a must see psychological thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound, and was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"

","1. Color and clothing
The metaphor of color is the most common and obvious.
White, pink: white swan, Nina. Black: Black Swan, Mother, Lily, Beth. Grey: The only actor-Thomas, the artistic director of the dance company.
White: Nina 's pillows are black and white patterned, and in multiple dreaming overhead shots, her head is just resting on the center of the entangled black vine pattern; her snow-white scarf is fluffy and is a white swan feather The symbol of Ling is like a fledgling fledgling young bird. (This fluffy dress symbolizes purity, and I have seen it in ""Single Man"" not long ago: Kenny, who represents the Angel of Redemption, played by Nicholas Holt, is wearing such a soft white sweater.)
Pink: Almost all of Nina 's rooms are decorated in pink; on the first morning, the breakfast served by her mother was cut in half. Nina murmured like a little girl: ""Pink, how beautiful!""
Nina's mobile phone appeared many times, and you can see the word ""MOM"" appearing on her mobile phone screen, the background color is pink.
When Nina curled up alone in the corridor to practice her arm movements, the scarf was pale pink.
After she was chosen as the ""Queen of Swan"", the fluffy scarf disappeared, a symbol of the fluff of chicks.
--However, when Nina was seduced by Thomas and was thrown, she sat in front of the mirror and wept. At that time, the fluffy scarf appeared again, it should be a metaphor for her to wander at this time, and returned to the state of shrinking chicks.
Gray: After she had frequent hallucinations, the top she wore when she was dancing changed from white to gray; her home clothes also became gray-grey penetrated Nina 's pink world.
In the bar, Lily gave Nina a black sexy vest. Nina put it outside the white dress. One night after taking the hallucinogenic drugs, Nina's sweater turned completely dark gray.
In Nina's ""white period"", her shoes were blunt, non-aggressive and ambitious gray cotton snow boots. In contrast to her were ""black swan"" Lily's gorgeous black leather boots.<br/><br/>2. Swan
The swan is a complex and strange image, which can represent purity, but it can also be a carnal incarnation: the god Zeus, the god of the gods of Sparta, was dumped by the beauty of Lida, the wife of Tingdarius of Sparta, and became a swan and his wild union. The swan's white carcass, soft long neck, soft feathers, and full-bodied body can also be regarded as the ultimate combination of female sexuality.
Another symbolism of the swan is the artist's poetic and beautiful incarnation. Sheng Sang's ""Swan's Death"" and the proverb ""Swan Song"" all use this meaning.
The image of the swan in this film is ubiquitous. Throughout the ""Swan Lake"" music, the whole film is like a musical. In addition, there are Nina's cell phone ringtones, and the music box with the swan lake rhythm and ballet villain.<br/><br/>
In the last leap, Nina, who was completely white, finally returned to the pure white world (white sponge cushion) with the wound of the black swan.
""Perfect. I got perfect.""
After experiencing the double suffering of spirit and flesh, the black swan and the white swan are united in the entanglement, creating a perfect situation and enjoying peace."

","How this movie is critically acclaimed is beyond me. Maybe it's not my genre, maybe I'm not the target audience, but I don't see anything in this movie worth watching it for. Except, like, Winona Ryder, and she was barely in it.<br/><br/>This film is boring, and long, and devoid of anything to interest you, so you just have to sit there and wait for it to end. The shots are pretty for the first five minutes, I guess, and then you get tired of the ~symbolism~ and the monotone colours and realise the plot is basically nothing except mental illness and sex and stuff. I'm not sure who thought 'hey, I have a great idea for a movie' and pitched this pile of garbage, but I don't think we'd get along. I don't see the entertainment in watching Natalie Portman suffer and hallucinate. Who wants that?<br/><br/>The only reason this movie got 2/10 instead of 1 is Winona Ryder. I think her acting is captivating no matter what role she's in, and I honestly wish this movie focused more on Beth, as her story is at a point I personally find more interesting - a bitter ballerina, formerly a big star, coming to the end of her career. While she acts as a warning of what is to come for Nina, and shows the toll that ballet can have on a dancer, I'd rather see her struggle than what actually goes down in this snoozefest."

Some imagery was meant to be Nina's subconscious concocting demons of it's own, I am not sure which of them were 'real' vs. her imagineering. I dug the film and it's uniqueness. It gives you a look into a very exclusive ""club"" of NYC dancers and supermodels, these girls do exist and they're very screwy little prima donna's! Kunis.... SH|T.... her character gave me WOOD. That's the kinda chick all us guys always wanna hang with but can also be bitten by due to their streetwise attitude. I met a girl like that 2 summers ago: Labia piercings and a Nymphomaniac, I wanted to adopt her! When Cassel asks Nina if she's still a virgin.... YEAH, she did come off as such in her demure feminine persona. The plot of the story is all about Nina coming out of her shell, growing up and exploring her own sexuality... to the great dismay of mommy. Now I can relate to all of this because mine wanted me to stay a virgin forever and live at home, I ended that at age 22.<br/><br/>My MAIN question about this film is this: I get that she actually stabbed herself rather than Kunis, but... is that ALSO concocted in her mind or did it actually happen within the story? Because for Nina to finish the rest of the opera, it's not possible to be stabbed in the stomach, flung in the air as a ballerina without losing blood and do two more acts... only to be laying on a mattress drenched in your own blood! What was fantasy vs. reality? Is it left to us to decide maybe? Ciao, bella!"

","You would never focus on the fact that these costumes were made by Kate M. And L.M. from Rodarte but these were displayed by MOCA in LA and the attention to detail from the director as well as what the actresses had to go through to wear it, really brought the fairy tale, the dark story, the dark romance through to the audience. It is easy to get caught up in his tales, in his worlds. The film is a phenomenal art piece from a director who is really open about the amount of work that consistently goes into his practical effects through his body of work. His personal touch is always present. His love of beauty, of the beautiful, of the exquisite, is a clearly life long, heart felt nature. Ballet is not for the weak. It is about perfection."

","I understand this film may turn some people off, but the two things propelling this film to the heights people built it up onto, are director Darren Aronofsky's technical mastery alongside Natalie Portman's faultless performance. The film centers around Nina, a ballerina devoted to ballet perfecting her art as a new and young ballerina comes in. The film is great is showing how character relationships bring out a characters humanity. Nina's relationship with her mother brings out her perfectionist side, while her relationship with Lily played by Mila Kunis, brings out a confident and loose Nina, while Thomas, Nina's dance teacher brings out the tension that's building in her mind. This is a smart, trippy, melodramatic film that explores character to the point, and I enjoyed it very much."

Long story short, I think there is something in it that attracts people(or at least me).<br/><br/>The movie depicts very human, palpable emotions that everyone can feel with great details. The elements and references are not too complex to the point of making you want to quit watching it, and are well appreciated and digested.

I think the soul of art impresses the audience more when it the vision is from a specific view, such as in ""movies"" of course special effects and frame-cuts have strong effect too. As I love other films about branches of fine arts, Black Swan is at top of them so far. Such good choices of actors and actresses, combined by the story of Swan Lake Ballet it becomes almost alive."

","I had to sit on this movie for a while before I could put into words my feelings on it. This film is terrifying and provoking in many many ways. <br/><br/>I think the best thing the movie has to offer is the editing and the way colors are used to describe literally everything but still stay ambiguous. The clash of white/black shows the many ways characters are behaving or what their intentions are and it all fits somewhat inside of the story of the Swan Lake.<br/><br/>The pacing of the story is also great. It never feels like it's slowing down and even the parts that are the slowest still feel important and add to the story. Never loses it focus and it is enjoyable the entire time.<br/><br/>Another thing is the acting. Portman delivers the best performance of her career and shows us a girl who goes from mostly innocent to twisted and insane. It's so great and is complemented by a solid set of supporting characters. Kunis does a great job owning whatever scene she's in and is fun to watch. Cassel plays a twisted instructor with inappropriate intentions and he's creepy throughout but in a good way.<br/><br/>Overall it's a great film following the insanity of the lead in a way I haven't seen before. So many things in the movie add to the entire picture and watching it multiple times will have you noticing even more things than the first time."

","Black Swan attacks on all the senses in a vicious and visceral manner. A great performance from Portman as well as the minimal, but strong, use of costume and make up make this the haunting dance that it is.<br/><br/>Similar to one of Aronofsky's previous films, Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan is a difficult one to stomach. Littered throughout is unforgettable imagery, dark themes all woven together with a loud and menacing score. <br/><br/>Black Swan is a great film, not one I think I'd watch again but it does what it seeks out to do. A few minor things are irksome like a couple jump scares that while successful seemed forced at one point. <br/><br/>I'd recommend it without saying anything of the plot but, well, don't expect to just watch it for the dancing because there's far more here than that."
"galfonsin","9","0","2","2 August 2016"," Great movie
","It's a great movie with spectacular special effects; for example when Nina is in the presentation of the ballet and she goes to the bathroom because she has blood on one of her fingers, or when she is in her bedroom and she starts to scratch and you can see the skin peeling of her back. Another moment that I love happens when Nina is in the dressing room and she thinks that Lily is there, believing that her opponent wants to replace her, Nina tries to kill Lily. In my opinion this scene is incredible, not for the violence only, but because this is a part of her paranoia and we can't know this because there is nothing that makes us think that this is only her mind thinking and not the real world. <br/><br/>Another thing that I like about this film is the end because it is different from the most of the films and when we think that the film is going to have a great end something happens in the last few seconds that change everything. Moreover, the actresses are really good especially Natalie Portman who also won the Oscar for her role in it. <br/><br/>To finish with, I have to say that this is a film that after seeing, you are going to love it or hate it but you aren't going to say that it is in the middle."

","I feel like the sexual overtones were probably gratuitous. It's become popular to make movies like this where they want to balance erotic and horrific tones. I really don't understand it. That being said, I probably didn't completely understand this movie. I think maybe a lot of it went over my head. Looking at the cast list for this movie, I feel like maybe it was supposed to mirror Swan Lake as well. I haven't seen Swan Lake in any fashion, so I couldn't really say how they did with that, but it is tricky to do something like that because not only are they trying to mirror Swan Lake, but they use Swan Lake as a tool in the story. So if you're looking at it as the story of Swan Lake, I can imagine that might get confusing. At times It's hard to understand what it is that is actually happening in the story, as opposed to what the protagonist is imagining, which is definitely intended. However, towards the end of the movie it becomes close to irritating with how confusing it becomes, because I can't tell what it is I'm supposed to understand is going on and what it is I'm just supposed to appreciate as it happens. That might just be me, though. By the end of the film it didn't really bother me as much. I think I enjoyed it, but it's hard to tell because this movie really went all over the place for me. That's not to say this movie was all over the place, but in terms of whether I liked it or not, that was all over the place. It's definitely interesting to watch, though. That's why I scored it at a 7.5. I think I'd recommend it. Heck, watch it with your whole family! I'm sure Grandma would enjoy it. It's fun for all ages!"

There are many movies and books on this subject. Black Swan is one of them. Pushing yourself to the extreme ""only"" to surpass both your competition and yourself; is the longterm aftermath and consequences worth it? Is it brave and impressive to struggle, practice and breathe just and only one thing in life to keep up and satisfy the trainer and the mentor? Can there be a sane life after being completely lost in a profession? All these answers is subject to discussions and debate. Black Swan is closing up to these matters of life.... and in a frightening way twisting them into a dark saga.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a grasping drama motion picture that contemplates an important topic in a intimate way... and throws in sudden moments of thriller on the edge to horror. The entire production team has done a splendid work in taking the ""usual sudden horror jump-out-of-the- chair-moments"" plus emotions and brought them new life through a drama kind of way; instead of ""horrifying monsters sudden impact"", there is same emotions within the moments lived through the main characters experiences. Innovative and... fearsome...<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is doing one of her absolutely perfected characters in this one. The splendid spectra of emotions and thoughts goes right through the screen. Ans she has the top-notch class to even give the character that little forced persona that often high performing show artists, dancers and so forth have. Just a little glimpse of that conscious ""over acting"" within the role of the character. Wonderful and marvellous of Natalie Portman! Academy Award for that one.<br/><br/>Point of views that becomes interesting for me: - A mothers sorrow of a lost career. - A disturbing relation between a daughter and a mother - Is sanity the insane... or is the insane sanity? - Society has extreme demands on culture and entertainment.. is it right to give the audience exactly what they want?<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Reconnoitre of the ballet business and behind the scenes of the same is done very well. The focus on one thing and one thing only, to drive the motion picture into the supposed direction. Sound, picture, acting, costumes, make-up, lightning... achieved, yes! The soundtrack has the same theatrical sense as real ballet; touché! - The actors : Oh....my.... this production team has really casted this one for real. Astonishing! The director squeezes the facets out of each actor. This is true art. - The story : Ballet takes on the well-known ""how-far-are-you- willing-to-push-and-give-to-get-the-success"" story. And that so in a dark and competent way. - Entertainment : Enjoying the acting and the tensions between characters. Academy Award winner, and I close my case. - Age : 15.<br/><br/>7,9 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)"

","Nina is a professional ballerina, who lives in the shadow of her mother and isn't happy. She wants at all costs to hold mother's ambition: see his daughter as ""prima ballerina"". But things go wrong when a rival, out of nowhere, threatens to steal it. Fortunately for both, ""The Swan Lake"" is a piece that requires two protagonists: the White Swan, sweet and gentle, and the Black Swan, malicious and seductive. While Nina is perfect for the White Swan, she will have to prepare herself for the other part, and goes in search of her own malice. Directed by Darren Aronofsky, it has screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John J. McLaughlin, and features Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey and Vincent Cassel in the lead roles.<br/><br/>We are facing an interesting film, which deals with the intense rivalries of the ballet world and the psychological consequences that they can cause. In fact, the script isn't bad but, at a certain point, becomes a bit predictable. The plot is silent with regard to mental and psychological health of Nina, but imply them traumas and repressions of her past. The end of the film is excellent, but the public never gets to see clearly where the reality ends and begins the imagination. The cast worked well and most of the actors did a good performance, yet not too surprising. Natalie Portman is the exception: she got an exceptional performance and gave her character a huge and very rich psychological depth. I also liked the characterization and costumes, that sparkled in some scenes. And Tchaikovsky's music is always good in any soundtrack.<br/><br/>This film is quite good, despite some minor flaws and predictability. It works, entertains, thrills and sometimes shocks. Could be better? Yes, but it's not bad the way it is."

","Black swan for me was an outstanding film. It was about a young ballet dancer who takes the leading role of black and white swan. Only that what happens in the scenery seemed to become true affecting Bella's life.<br/><br/>So the title says before you see this movie I recommend you to be alone ( without your parents I mean ) because some scenes are very weird and might thrill you. Also you must attend this movie not for the artistic side of ballet because you might get bored but from the social angle. This movie shows the reactions of people when they get a leading role and how anxious they are because they fear the replacement. Nina feels like that , she is very introvert and she creates with her mind situations that herself would like to be just like the love scene with her friend which Bella thinks that she tries to take the leading role of black swan using unfairly means.<br/><br/>Nina is feeling all this pressure from her mother and her teacher. I believe that her mother is envying her when she takes the leading role. On the other hand when Nina had taken all the previous supportive roles she stands up her. So I conclude that her mother is an hypocrite ,arrogant person who in the whole movie pretends an old star of ballet when at the same time she had never taken a leading role instead of her daughter.<br/><br/>For the end I just want to say that Nina hasn't conscious of her actions. '' She felt it and it was perfect''. The combination of applauding and these words it was a really success just like the general sense that black swan creates you."

","Black Swan is as much as an experience as the play that was interpreted within the film. From the very beginning, the lighting was one of the strongest I've seen from a film, it being a large supporter of the film's overall tone. In fact, each element of the movie seems be reincorporated to support the tone; as it's soundtrack drives the scenes, and it's use of dance is used in contrast of the very character's mental standing.<br/><br/>The viewing of the mental standing of the main character, Nina, is shown in moderation. Giving and showing more and more throughout the film, within it's symbolism and character contrast. All until the final act of the movie, where all is revealed. This being a masterful display and character study of one's own madness. In only one instance, I do feel as if practicality was sparred for the sake of tone, but it didn't take away from the film's overall quality (the subway scene). In some instances, the movie is brilliant and thrilling by balancing emotional scenes in the surreal, while the directing and acting are constantly great throughout.

"leontheprofessional2015","9","0","2","26 December 2015"," Movie Story
","Everything about classical ballet lends itself to excess. The art form is one of grand gesture, of the illusion of triumph over reality and even the force of gravity. Yet it demands from its performers years of rigorous perfectionism, the kind of physical and mental training that takes ascendancy over normal life. This conflict between the ideal and the reality is consuming Nina Sayers, Portman's character.<br/><br/>Her life has been devoted to ballet. Was that entirely her choice? Her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), was a dancer once, and now dedicates her life to her daughter's career. They share a small apartment that feels sometimes like a refuge, sometimes like a cell. They hug and chatter like sisters. Something feels wrong.<br/><br/>Nina dances in a company at New York's Lincoln Center, ruled by the autocratic Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel). The reach of his ego is suggested by his current season, which will ""reimage"" the classics.<br/><br/>Having cast off his former Priam ballerina and lover, Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), he is now auditioning for a new lead. ""Swan Lake"" requires the lead to play opposite roles. Nina is clearly the best dancer for the White Swan. But Thomas finds her too ""perfect"" for the Black Swan. She dances with technique, not feeling.<br/><br/>The film seems to be unfolding along lines that can be anticipated: There's tension between Nina and Thomas, and then Lily (Mila Kunis), a new dancer, arrives from the West Coast. She is all Nina is not: bold, loose, confident. She fascinates Nina, not only as a rival but even as a role model. Lily is, among other things, a clearly sexual being, and we suspect Nina may never have been on a date, let alone slept with a man. For her, Lily presents a professional challenge and a personal rebuke.<br/><br/>Thomas, the beast, is well known for having affairs with his dancers. Played with intimidating arrogance by Cassel, he clearly has plans for the virginal Nina. This creates a crisis in her mind: How can she free herself from the technical perfection and sexual repression enforced by her mother, while remaining loyal to their incestuous psychological relationship?<br/><br/>No backstage ballet story can be seen without ""The Red Shoes"" (1948) coming into mind. If you've never seen it of course eventually you will. In the character of Thomas, Aronofsky and Cassel evoke Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), the impresario in that film, whose autocratic manner masks a deep possessiveness. And in Nina, there is a version of Moira Shearer's ingénue, so driven to please.<br/><br/>""Black Swan"" will remind some viewers of Aronofsky's previous film, ""The Wrestler."" Both show single-minded professionalism in the pursuit of a career, leading to the destruction of personal lives. I was reminded also of Aronofsky's brilliant debut with ""Pi"" (1998), about a man driven mad by his quest for the universal mathematical language. For that matter, his ""The Fountain"" (2007) was about a man who seems to conquer time and space. Aronofsky's characters make no little plans.<br/><br/>The main story supports of ""Black Swan"" are traditional: backstage rivalry, artistic jealousy, a great work of art mirrored in the lives of those performing it. Aronofsky drifts eerily from those reliable guidelines into the mind of Nina. She begins to confuse boundaries. The film opens with a dream, and it becomes clear that her dream life is contiguous with her waking one. Aronofsky and Portman follow this fearlessly where it takes them.<br/><br/>Portman's performance is a revelation from this actress who was a 13-year-old charmer in ""Beautiful Girls"" (1996). She has never played a character this obsessed before, and never faced a greater physical challenge (she prepared by training for 10 months). Somehow she goes over the top and yet stays in character: Even at the extremes, you don't catch her acting. The other actors are like dance partners holding her aloft. Barbara Hershey provides a perfectly calibrated performance as a mother whose love is real, whose shortcomings are not signaled, whose own perfectionism has all been focused on the creation of her daughter.<br/><br/>The tragedy of Nina, and of many young performers and athletes, is that perfection in one area of life has led to sacrifices in many of the others. At a young age, everything becomes focused on pleasing someone (a parent, a coach, a partner), and somehow it gets wired in that the person can never be pleased. One becomes perfect in every area except for life itself.<br/><br/>It's traditional in many ballet-based dramas for a summing-up to take place in a bravura third act. ""Black Swan"" has a beauty. All of the themes of the music and life, all of the parallels of story and ballet, all of the confusion of reality and dream come together in a grand exhilaration of towering passion. There is really only one place this can take us, and it does. If I were you, I wouldn't spend too much time trying to figure out exactly what happens in practical terms. Lots of people had doubts about the end of ""The Red Shoes,"" too. They were wrong, but they did. source http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/black-swan-2010"

","To quickly encapsulate the plot before I forget, Black Swan tells the story of a dancer, Nina, whose strive to lose herself in her role as both The Swan Queen and, more so, The Black Swan, causes her to truly lose who she is, and her mind, in her obsession over the role. If a film is able to immerse you in from start to finish, that is excellent. If it is a horror film, or even a psychological thriller like this, especially a more recent one, that is truly special. Enwrapping myself in a horror film, or any film for that matter, is an amazing experience, because I can feel like I am experiencing what is actually happening. This makes it all the more scary and effecting. The other films that I was able to do this with, in the horror genre, are Rosemary's Baby (1968), that being my favorite horror film, Alien, The Sixth Sense, Halloween (1978) yes I really did, and more recently, The Babadook. And of course now, this. <br/><br/>I wasn't expecting to fall in love with this film like I did, I had heard incredible things about it, had been very excited for it and last night, I was finally able to watch it, even if I had only rented it in ITunes. I was truly astonished at just how good it was. Darren Aronofsky direction was nearly pitch perfect, he really did a great job and seemed very passionate with this project. A film like this, should be well written, lest it make sense in the end. And as you think about it after the credits roll, Nina's (Natalie Portman) crazy psyche episode does. That is a HUGE compliment to this film's writing.<br/><br/>Portman's role as Nina was perfectly cast and incredibly performed, not surprising seeing her Best Actress win for the role. As was everyone else greatly cast, Mila Kunis did a great job of being pretty much the polar opposite of Portman's character as Lily. This movie also certainly looks fantastic, I loved the cinematography and how almost every shot felt like an artistic capture.<br/><br/>For the psychological thriller aspect, it was amazingly done and very intense. I felt like I was holding my breath for quite a bit of the film and the deteriorating psyche of our main character, as mentioned before, is to some absurd and confusing, to me, real, effecting, emotional and beautiful.<br/><br/>This is overall an honest masterpiece of a film that I am so glad that I finally got to see it. I very much recommend it. It is an incredible and amazing experience that I wanna have again and want you all to have. Unless you are younger cause it will be hard for you to follow and it is also disturbing and there are a couple pretty inappropriate scenes. But it is an amazing experience and is rising the ranks of my favorites (my 19th currently). Wow this film. Black Swan is incredible. Please go see it now!"

","There are not enough words in the English language to describe the praise Darren Aronofsky deserves for Black Swan.Black Swan is an enthralling and visceral experience from beginning to end. While you may have read suggestions that Black Swan and The Wrestler are two halves of the same film, make no mistake at looking at it any further beyond the comparison of being about two people toiling within two very different forms of art The visuals and editing are the drive of what helps make the film so well done. Aronofsky also deserves recognition for the film's lean running time. Portman, who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer, delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina.The supporting cast only helps to further complement Portman's extraordinary performance.Black Swan is an incredible film from beginning to end, and will not easily leave you.

","Although I can see why Natalie Portman won an Oscar for her role in this, I still do not agree that the hype, stating that this movie is beyond amazing, is correct.<br/><br/>The movie is created in a seemingly unique style that makes its home safely in both genres of thriller and drama. There was no obvious holes in the storyline and the movie seemed to flow well. But it is hard sometimes to determine the differentiation between her hallucinations and reality, leaving confused time-lines. The stereotypes used in this moves made the storyline too predictable. The only character that surprised me was the mother. She did not indulge in the common dancer-mother-dictator stereotype overused in most films, which provided me with some relief. Her acting was also one of the highlights. The amalgamation of a determined control freak mother and a caring worried mother. To prove my point, if she was to portray the overused stereotype then she would have forced her daughter to go to the opening night. Probably the biggest moment for her daughter, but she chose her care over her pride and kept her in bed, calling her daughter in sick. Finally the aspect of sexual promiscuity was definitely not needed. It added a sickening feel to this film that made me very eerie. <br/><br/>Even though this movie left me feeling rather ill, I acknowledge that their was a dramatic creativity and powerful character movement throughout the storyline. Evident through the bipolar transformation of Portmans character."

Then comes the decay of personality, with psychotic episodes, and you sense the heroine is not meant for this world.<br/><br/>The lead actress exudes anxiety from her poor little face, and even her desperate breathing is conveyed in the rehearsal scenes. Then she makes those mad eyes to camera as the black swan, and you find out later what she's done to earn it. The lead actor adds good authority, and all round the cast plays it well.<br/><br/>The music does what you'd expect, with great scenes where the camera circles the dancers, but it's too dramatic during the violent scenes, contrasting with the horror vibe from earlier on.<br/><br/>The story feels like a tightrope act by the director, between melodrama and horror, and it comes down on one side. There is a sub-genre in horror of Hollywood wannabe descending into Hell, but this one doesn't fit in. And as a portrait of mental illness it's not quite as good as, say, Magic Magic - maybe because the heroine has the tidy and not so disturbing aim of making a beautiful corpse.<br/><br/>Overall, impressive but doesn't hit the spot."

","I'm not a fan of ballet at all so I was at first turned away from watching Black Swan but when I finally got round to watching it, two words: Blown away. This is an absolute masterpiece, unlike anything I've ever seen. It's wildly unpredictable, searingly intimate, shocking and terrifying and one of my all time favourite movies. Black Swan focuses on a dancer called Nina, whose psyche becomes corrupt as she undertakes the role of the black swan which takes over her life, taking her on an intense descent to a dark side that threatens to consume her. Natalie Portman's dedication to the role shows, her innocence is shattered as the Swan Lake show comes closer, and the way she changes from sweet girl to a frighteningly perfect incarnation of the Black Swan is incredible to watch. Barbara Hershey is amazing as Nina's over protective and zealous mother, Hershey is overbearing in such a pitch perfect way that she's actually terrifying, and Mila Kunis is a revelation as Nina's competition Lily. Surprisingly scary, intelligent and constantly atmospheric, Black Swan is one intense film with perfect scores in every department."

","I always found the story of the Swan Lake a bit boring. It's a typical princess story with a sad ending. I even remember watching an animated version of this story and couldn't care less. It didn't enjoy the popularity of the other princess stories like Little Mermaid or Mulan.<br/><br/>However, when I saw this movie as portrayed by Natalie Portman, I was blown away. Never before had I seen such a gritty, scandalous version. This isn't your little girl fairytale anymore. But that's what made it real and yes, possible. You don't get the watered down version anymore. There was such a beauty to the madness of Portman's character's transformation from obedient little girl to daring woman. It coincided perfectly with the transformation of her stage character, the Swan Queen. I cringed at her blind obedience and constant apologetic state. And this made me anticipate the type of person she would become. It gave me chills watching her performance as the Black Swan. It's my favorite part in the entire film. The audience waits so long for her to finally let go. All that madness must result in no less than perfection.<br/><br/>I attribute the success of this film to many factors, the haunting cinematography for its mostly dark and drab tones, the music for its surprisingly non-boring influence on the movie, and most of all the actors, who all showed that everyone, even nice people have a dark side.<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing this movie again. 5 years later, I'm left amazed."

","For some reason I had been expecting Darren Aronofsky's Oscar-winning Black Swan to be an overly complex psychological horror/thriller, a real head-scratcher that would leave me thoroughly perplexed; instead, I was surprised at the simplicity of the basic premise: an obsessive ballerina spirals into madness whilst preparing for the lead role in Swan Lake. What makes the film so impressive is not so much the story—the descent into insanity has been tackled many times before—but rather the complexity and skillfulness of Aranofsky's direction, and the sheer power of Natalie Portman's tour-de-force performance as Nina, the frigid dancer who struggles to let go of her inhibitions to perfect the part of the Black Swan.<br/><br/>Aranofsky's visuals are absolutely stunning, each meticulously choreographed scene executed with style and precision, the dizzying camera-work putting the viewer on the stage amidst the twirling dancers. Portman has never been better, utterly convincing as a fragile artist whose quest for perfection takes a terrible toll on her sanity. Her dancing is absolutely breath-taking, while her sexier moments—a sneaky spot of masturbation and an oral sex scene with fellow ballet star Lily (Mila Kunis) reveal an actress willing to take considerable risks to nail her role (while giving her straight male/gay female fans something to fantasise about for years to come)."

","I have seen this film a number of times now and it will never get old. Firstly Natalie Portman makes this film, she acts this role PERFECTLY, and this is not an easy role, in fact one of the hardest to get right. I would honestly say of every film I have so far seen the part is played so well I would give her best actress, not just for the year (which she deservedly won), but rather for the last decade.<br/><br/>Along with Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis plays her role surprisingly well, I feel she is not the best actress however the role in this film suited her perfectly and I felt she stepped up her game massively, Also a huge credit to Vincent Cassel who I feel again played his part perfectly as a twisted sort of teacher.<br/><br/>Although the stars of this film performed brilliantly I cannot forget the director, Darren Aronofsky, who did everything right. The film is quite dark and intense and strange and creepy in places but the balance is just right.<br/><br/>The film is about a ballet 'swan lake' Nina (Natalie Portman) is chosen as lead, perfect to play the 'white swan' but having to learn how to be the 'black swan', the film shows the regression from her perfect self (the white swan) to her dark side. (the black swan)<br/><br/>The one thing I do love about the film is the ending, the final scene and the final line, I feel the film honestly could not have finished in a better way and I would struggle to see how the film could be made better.

","Not the type of movie I would normally go for. It felt so predictable - pretty ballet star sleeps with director to further her career. Even with great performances by Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel (and they are great performances), I was ready for this film to slowly and uninterestingly meander down a familiar path.<br/><br/>Well, I have to say it surprised me.<br/><br/>First there's the deftly managed subplot of Portman's relationship with her mother, who is a suffocating presence, jealous of her daughter and possessive in the extreme. It sets an uneasy backdrop for what follows.<br/><br/>And then there's the imagery. At least it starts as imagery - the dichotomy between the white swan and the black swan, innocence and experience. But then it comes to take over the movie, which becomes a partly allegorical and partly psychological metaphor.<br/><br/>Portman actually becomes the black swan embodied. It's incredibly and painfully realistic and yet so obviously absurd.

"skepticskeptical","7","0","2","3 October 2014"," Psychological Thriller--not film noir
","I was very intrigued to see that Black Swan was included in the 2014 Film Noir encyclopedia (published by Taschen). Maybe I don't understand what film noir is, but it seems that some people (the editors of that volume) were laboring under the ill-conceived notion that the word 'black' in the title ""Black Swan"" was a sufficient qualifying noir element. I respectfully disagree.<br/><br/>There is no crime in this movie at all. There is no mystery. There is the psychological and emotional breakdown of a ballerina under intense pressure by her mother and herself to be perfect. There is a sexist dance director who preys on his star ballerinas until they grow too old, at which point he kicks his ""little princess"" to the curb to make room for the next lay in line.<br/><br/>That all may sound pretty negative, so why did I give this movie a '7'? Because it really is the film equivalent to a page turner. There is lots of forward momentum, which keeps the story from ever becoming boring-- though I see that many of the ""hate it"" reviewers found the whole thing tedious. One detractor suggested that time would be better spent watching paint dry. <br/><br/>I do agree with the naysayers that the rival ballerina character, played by Mila Kunis (who had a huge full-back tattoo--hello? In a professional ballet troupe????) was not very believable. She seemed more like a frat girl looking to rack up as many one-night stands as possible in the shortest amount of time. I also dislike this director's general tendency toward hyperbole and histrionics, often verging on hysteria. (See: Requiem for a Dream for much, much more on that...). There is a heavy-handed but arguably incoherent Freudian undercurrent throughout this film. (If the Freudian line were right, then a less- frigid Nina would simply abandon ballet...)<br/><br/>Which reminds me of the fundamental problem with Black Swan: each short scene is brim with energy and seeming significance, but then nothing ever really ties it all together in a coherent way. The ending turns out to have nothing really to do with anything that preceded it--aside from the fact that Nina has had a major mental breakdown. Perhaps the harsh detractors from this film were displeased that the action depicted throughout the film oscillated wildly between objective and subjective reality. Lots of hallucinations are included through the use of special effects in scenes which seem initially to be about the world of the film, not the skewed world of the main character's mind.<br/><br/>Nina, the Natalie Portman character, is exceptionally neurotic and annoying, to be perfectly frank. She constantly scratches herself, to the point of causing rashes and bleeding down her back. I was not convinced that such a woman/girl could really make it to the big league of ballet, for which the competition is no doubt incredibly intense. Nina is so fragile and devoid of self-esteem that Portman's performance struck me as more consistent with an introverted outcast devoid of any friends. For that role, I'd say her acting was good. Think: Ally Sheedy in The Breakfast Club. For this one? I was not convinced.<br/><br/>I was happy to see the star of La Haine (Vincent Cassel) in the male lead role, though it was somewhat annoyingly stereotypical. All powerful French men are sexual predators--ce n'est pas vrai? Despite its many flaws and its massive melodrama and endless clichés and stereotypes, I still found Black Swan worth watching. Would I watch it a second time? Probably not. So, to me, this is no masterpiece (a necessary criterion for which is the desire and even compulsion to view the film over and over again). But I do believe that Black Swan is worth watching once."

","It has been so long since we've had a decent ""monster"" movie, or at least the idea of a psychological breakdown. That's what the initial trailers and marketing expertly depicted and I ended up seeing it twice. It was a film I had been waiting weeks to see and it didn't come out until the 21st January in the UK. However Cineworld theatres were showing it on 18th Jan as a special preview, and out of a 231 seat theatre it was more than 3/4's full. Making me extremely happy that so many people turned up as interested as I was, and awkwardly justifying to my father why I saw a film about Ballet. A week later I went to see it again with 6 local friends, and I certainly began to see the extra little things within certain frames. The film overall is great, beautiful and even poetic.<br/><br/>Throughout the first 10 minutes I was worried because it had the typical bitching girls that we saw in ""Showgirls"" (1995). But the film does a terrific job of mixing concerns with the Ballet's production, as well as Nina's (Natalie Portman) insecurities, sanity and the overall effects it has on her mind. As the film goes on, it intensifies and build so much towards the final act that should leave you more than satisfied. For those who want ballet, the choreography and swift movement I can't recommend enough. Even if you know little about camera movements, Darren Aronofsky's shots are fantastically switching back and fourth between long range shots to uncomfortably close, all to great effect.<br/><br/>The main character Nina is very well acted. No, PERFECTED by Natalie Portman. Displaying the beautiful grace and dedication, but also the insecurities of having to deal with an overbearing mother (The wonderful Barbara Hershey). All this while trying to portray the seductiveness of her ""alter-ego"". Mila Kunis as Lily was very good as playing the exact opposite of Nina, to again great effectiveness and a level of likability and un-likability.<br/><br/>Finally the psychological part. At some scenes it can get very graphic in terms of the blood and body morphing, but nothing that I think people would complain about. And the sex I was fine with, as well as surprised that the movie managed to keep its 15 age rating. But all in all, it's not gratuitous and all works to the films advantages. It's not there just to be there, it really does make you think whether or not it's actually happening. If I was to recommend anyone to this film, I personally encourage as many people as possible to see it. If your a surrealist, dancing, or psychological fan, I couldn't recommend this more.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: A triumph of work like ""Swan Lake"" itself, I think this movie could appeal to just about anyone. 9/10."

And that's why I respect Darren Aronofosky more than many contemporary directors. One must have a gut to show the pain as it is being shown, also must have the balance not to make it satirical coz it's genuine pain. Darren Aronofosky achieved that in his endeavors thus far and hope so he does that in future.<br/><br/>See my review of WRESTLER HERE <br/><br/>http://braddugg.blogspot.in/2011/12/wrestler-2008-english.html<br/><br/>So that was my appreciation of Darren Aronofosky and his work, now let me talk specifically about this film that's about a Ballad Dancer performer. BLACK SWAN is wicked twin of the WHITE SWAN in the Ballad of SWAN LAKE of the 18th century and the tradition has been continuing since. <br/><br/>Now, over and above the form of art, it's the way the art is pursued with enormous passion. It's the passion of an artist and when one is too very engrossed in art, he may have delusions of grandeur and that's what happiness with Nina (Natalie Portman). She starts to see her other side, as she tries to transform herself to a Black Swan and the transformation is in itself so very insightful. There can be symbolism drawn between the the state of mind of the artist and so many things that we have learn thus far. Be it a Fyodor Doestovosky's THE DOUBLE or Roman Polanski's ROSEMARY's BABY or TENANT or David Cronenberg's THE FLY. It's the psyche that delves into delusions and makes her physically tiring and even gruesome as there is blood coming out.That's a really interesting take as she keeps seeing herself in such forms as they as she is too passionate about the transformation. <br/><br/>Coming to performances, Natalie Portman as Nina, the white swan and the black swan has given a performance of her lifetime and she certainly deserved to win so many accolades. Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis have complemented Nina well and have given us something that's arty and yet so real.<br/><br/>The best part, apart from the subject, the direction, the acting of Portman is the background music by CLint Mansell. It haunts us even after the film is done log ago, though it doesn't have a great longevity as Clint Mansell's other work, Requiem For a Dream, it surely has an impact that can be felt for sometime even after the film.<br/><br/>I am going with 4/5 for a movie that resonates the pain of an artist, rather a passionate artist and what one has to go through to accomplish their dream."

","How cinema really makes an impact in life! <br/><br/>Some story may give you some messages or some may be the real life implications. Some touch your mind and make u realize some fact.

It's a real psychological thriller horror film directed by Darren Aronofsky. This film is about a struggling dancer who dedicates her life to dance. She works hard for d role of swan queen in the starting play of the season And she gets it quite easily. But the real problem begins after getting the lead role. She gets sick because of her continuous practice. The story tells about how the pressure of the role affects her mental and physical health. She feels the feathers of black swan growing on her own body. Before the stage show she cut herself and presents the dance very gracefully.

","After seeing Black Swan, I feel comfortable stating that I recognized the style and touch of director Darren Aronofsky. It's driven as if the drive itself of successful Manhattanites has been cast. I felt this in the Brooklyn based ""Requiem For A Dream"". If you are not gripped from the beginning camera views and tension created, then stop the DVD and check your pulse. I found the cringe-worthy moments very Aronosky-esque and my inability to turn away even more. This is very smart and brought to life by good girl ballerina Natalie Portman. Her ability to bring us into the dance halls within the Metropolitan Opera and have us feel her emotional baggage of fears of failure and disappointment to others was tremendous. As a man, I found myself immediately in touch with her burden, Barbara Hershey was great as the mother now living through her daughter and Mila Kunis was so believable as a relaxed chorus dancer with a seduction that was clear to all. It is this expression that evades our lead and which overtakes her thoughts as her transformation is underway. What an experience. A smart thriller that places ""Swan Lake"" in another dimension. In its' own way, it is both beautiful and perfect."

","The movie Black Swan created in the year 2010 by the director Darren Aronofsky, visualizes a film based on the popular ""Swan Lake"". Black Swan was written by MARK Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin. This film features a ballet dancer named Nina Sayers, played by Natalie Portman, and shows her strength to become the lead in this classical dance. From good to bad and right from wrong, Nina Sayers has to trouble herself and transform to become a stronger person in order to play the part of the Swan Queen. This part not only is courageous and beautiful, but Nina has to factor in being diverse and create something raw and plain into an amazing task. Nina Sayers and her partner Lily, who is the Black Swan in this film, play hand and hand. Mila Kunis in this film plays that special character of the Black Swan and in many ways gives Nina that extra edge to being who she truly needs to be. Not only is her relationship with Lily is negative and exciting at the same time, this character Lily seems to be a vivid imagination of sorts.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie Black Swan has a lot to do with conflict involving a lot of discriminating self-esteem issues women face in a daily life. The need to be perfect and the desire to look and feel like they are perfect is all in this movie. Nina Sayers is determined to find her inner-strength in order to become the dark and deceptive character that the Russian folklore created. Not only is Nina becoming a new and more confident person, she ends up also finding a more sexual side that is mentoring her ability to become the part of the Swan Queen. The theme of this movie also surrounds many internal and external conflicts on the overall life of being a woman. The daily struggles living with a controlling mother who wants her child to live her dream, and a daily struggle of just living in general. A movie that may be comparable to the theme of what woman deal with in regards to self-esteem issues would be Juno. This movie is comparable because of the fact that the main character deals with becoming a stronger woman and someone that she is currently not. Juno gives a viewer the inside scoop on how life may be if you are a teen-aged girl in life and being pregnant at the same time. Even though the plots of these two films are totally different, the overall ending of how happy these characters are with the changes they have endured is heart warming and beautiful. Everything is motivating Nina into becoming one of the greatest parts of the popular dance ""Swan Lake"". Two techniques that the director uses in Black Swan are the great use of lighting and angle. The reason why I think that the technique of the lighting in this movie is great is because it helps show emphasis on the white and dark characters in the film. Nina Sayers in the beginning of the film is a bright and pretty lady but heading more towards the end of the film, the lighting at many points becomes darker and more defined. I would imagine this to be because of her transformation into a new character and becoming something even more great! The technique of using angle in this movie is also very exquisitely done because in ballet, the art of dancing and movement needs to be fluent. The way that the camera would move with the dancers feet and movements is just amazing and really brings the audience to the feeling of reality and being there in the stands watching the performance! There is nothing better than a young lady finding her true self in life. As the true womanhood of Nina grows, the only feeling felt in the end of Black Swan is empowerment!"

","Black Swan is the biggest case of life imitating art in the history of cinema. Natalie Portman gives a haunting performance as a ballerina that is literally uncomfortable in her own body to the point where she claws and scratches at her own skin. <br/><br/>Portman plays Nina Sayers, a ballerina going out for the pivotal role in the play Swan Lake. The director, played by Vincent Cassel, is convinced that she can play White Swan perfectly. He's just not convinced she can play White Swan's evil twin, Black Swan. <br/><br/>In order to find the Black Swan in herself, she must become a different person. She must let go of her safe life and unlock a darker, more uninhibited side of her personality. This seems like an impossible task considering Nina lives with her mother (Barbara Hershey) in a small New York apartment. Her child-like demeanor and naiveté is evidenced by her bedroom, with the butterfly wallpaper and polka-dot bed sheets. In order to get even a second of privacy, Nina barricades herself in the bathroom and her bedroom. <br/><br/>When the films starts, Nina is already a very fragile person. What makes things worse is that everybody in her life helps push her to the edge of madness. Her ballet-obsessed mother, who gives new meaning to the overbearing stage mom; her director, who seems to be attracted to her, but whether it's genuine or some sick game to get her to unleash her inner Black Swan is unclear; and hen there's Lilly, played by Mila Kunis in a career-defining performance. <br/><br/>Kunis plays Lilly, a fellow member of the dance company, who may or may not be out to sabotage Nina and her dream of being the perfect White and Black Swan. Nina's quest for perfection sends her into a tailspin of paranoid delusions and psychotic hallucinations. Lilly is the main reason for Nina's paranoia. She is almost the spitting image of Nina, except she is everything Nina needs to be in order to nail the part of Black Swan. She's laid back, free spirited and, most of all, she exudes sexuality. <br/><br/>Black Swan boasts one of the better musical scores you will find in a film all year. The heart pounding orchestral numbers will have you on the edge of your seat - especially in the last 30 minutes of the film. <br/><br/>With Black Swan, Darren Aronofsky has woven a taut, psychological thriller like nothing I've ever seen. It deals with the physical and emotional tolls that being a professional dancer can have on a person. It also shows how a person can literally destroy themselves in the quest for perfection."

","Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a young dancer at a New York City ballet company, and she also lives with her mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), a former dancer herself. As the film begins, Nina dreamt that she is the Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake'. It would be the same ballet that Nina had dreamt about which would come to form the new season at the ballet company she is part of.<br/><br/>The ballet company director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) wants a new approach to 'Swan Lake', wanting someone to play both the White Swan and the Black Swan for the production. But he wants a new face for the new season, which meant that Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) was forced to retire. Beth's anger at the news would lead to near-fatal consequences: Getting drunk at a banquet and hitting out at Thomas and Nina, before being seriously injured in a car accident which Thomas suspected was done deliberately.<br/><br/>Before what Beth did which landed her in hospital, Nina auditioned to be both the White and Black Swan. While she performed well as the White Swan, she could not quite do it as the Black Swan which led her to persuade Thomas to reconsider. Thomas would forcibly kiss her before Nina bites him back in a sudden change of character. Nina would eventually get what she wanted, becoming the Swan Queen.<br/><br/>But after being awarded the lead role as the Swan Queen, Nina started to witness strange happenings at the ballet company, and this is not including the tense working relationship she shares with the new addition at the company in Lily (Mila Kunis), and at home battling against her mother on the insistence of taking part in the production. As the film progresses, Nina began to understand how Beth must have felt to be forced to retire.<br/><br/>There are times watching the film, one cannot but wonder at times what Natalie Portman's character was going through after being awarded the lead role was real or just of her own hallucinations, as it look very real each time. The production of 'Swan Lake' in the film may have being served as a backdrop, but it does make one stop and wonder whether questing for total perfection in anything is the appropriate thing to do.<br/><br/>Regardless of how one views the ballet scenes in terms of how the likes of Portman or Mila Kunis's respective character dance to the music, ballet is never easy to begin with. But it is for certain that searching for total perfection can has its consequences."

","Aronofsky is proving himself to be one of the best directors working on film these days. Black Swan is very similar to the Wrestler in tone and execution, since both are films about a main character who works in an undervalued art form (ballet and wrestling) and both suffer from deep psychological problems (and in this case, from deep psychiatric problems). This one, however, has better production values, better cinematography and uses special effects extensively.<br/><br/>It also features one of the best lesbian sex scenes in recent cinema. Perhaps better than the one on Mulholland Drive, since here the girls are even hotter."

Detractors could argue that his work is too derivative - but so is Tarantino's. I was re- assured with Black Swan, a tour-de-force set in a dream like, claustrophobic and dark New York City. In spite of the darkness, Black Swan is also incredibly beautiful. Portman's performance lives up to the hype and is nothing short of incredible.

"Schnayblay","10","0","2","11 July 2012"," An Incredibly Beautiful and Epic Tale That Is Perfect in Every Sense of the Word
","""Black Swan"" was a film I had on my must see list for a long time. Natalie Portman was enough to draw me in, but I had heard nothing but good things about this. Add the fact that Natalie Portman finally got the recognition I always knew she deserved by getting an Oscar for this, and you have my interest. And after finally seeing it, I understand why everyone loves this movie. And I agree with them.<br/><br/>So the story of ""Black Swan"" is about Nina, a very fragile but lovable ballerina who is given the role of her life when she is cast as the Swan Queen in her ballet studio's production of Swan Lake. But the catch is that she has to play both the Swan Queen and the Black Swan, who is the evil and polar opposite twin sister of the Swan Queen. Everyone knows that Nina is perfect for the Swan Queen, but she has to really push herself to become the Black Swan which totally goes against her nature. Meanwhile she also is having a mental breakdown so there's a lot of freaky stuff going on in her mind. The cool thing that you realize at one point is that the story of the film is a real life parallel to the story of Swan Lake. All the characters, situations, and plot points reflect the ballet but it doesn't feel cheesy. It feels brilliant and beautiful.<br/><br/>Now the acting in this movie is terrific. Did Natalie Portman deserve her Oscar? Absolutely without a doubt. I'm gonna be honest, ever since I was six and saw her in ""Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", I knew Natalie Portman was destined to be an incredible actress. That and I have an insane celebrity crush on her, but that's beside the point. She is perfectly natural, believable, and lovable as Nina and you instantly fall in love with her character. While she's having her mental breakdown though you are really worried what's going to happen. Nina is so sweet and innocent you don't want to see a shred of harm come to this girl. That is true character connection and it was done amazingly in ""Black Swan"".<br/><br/>Mila Kunis plays Lily, who is basically the real life equivalent of the Black Swan. She's the exact opposite of Nina. She's fun, secure, she goes out and parties. She is basically every 20 something year old hot chick on ""Jersey Shore"". But she has this very evil sense about her and you're always thinking in the back of your mind ""She could just flip and kill Nina at any time"". There's this one scene where Nina and Lily go to a bar and you can really see how opposite they become. But you also see how Lily slowly corrupts Nina and it's just a genius character dynamic. That is good writing and equally strong acting right there.<br/><br/>There is only one more performance I think I need to mention and that's Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother. Nina's mom is just like Mrs. White from ""Carrie"". She is obsessive, controlling, psychotic, and just evil. You really hate her and it takes you a while to realize it but eventually you have an epiphany where you go ""Oh my god, Nina is like a hostage in her own home"". She's 27 but she still lives with her mother because her mom is so insane. Nina's mom puts off the same evil sense as Lily in that you feel she could snap and murder Nina in like a second if she was pushed even a little bit. It's a very scary character and Barbara Hershey portrayed it perfectly.<br/><br/>I do want to mention that anytime the ""Swan Lake"" music played, I could not help but think of ""Dracula"". I don't know if you know this, but the original 1931 'Dracula' movie with Bela Lugosi used the ""Swan Lake"" song for its opening credits. And so anytime I heard that music, I got tingles. The music in this movie, especially in the finally is tense and exciting and does exactly what a good soundtrack should do. It gets you really anxious and nervous and I'm not lying when I say I felt my heartbeat while the climax of this movie happened and it was racing. There is so much emotional weight at the end ""Black Swan"", I could not believe I was so invested in a film about ballet.<br/><br/>This movie is perfect, and I have zero complaints. The acting was terrific, the pacing was perfect. The emotional weight and the themes were handled with exquisite and expert care. I do not think I can stress how beautiful this film is. It's rare that I call a movie beautiful but it is the only word I can think of that describes this movie. It is perfect."

","At last ""The Red Shoes"" has some competition. An imaginatively daring movie with ballet as its main theme, with Natalie Portman cast in the title role as the shy but ambitious ingénue who unexpectedly wins the prize part of lead dancer in a new production of ""Swan Lake"" and then finds herself pressurised into exploring the suppressed darker side if her on character to meet the demands of the part. The director really piles on the agony for her with almost clichéd characters of her pushy mother, handsome but exploitative director and jealously competitive rivals in the troop, but by constantly changing perspective, the viewer is never sure just what is going on. The camera is almost always in Portman's face or over her shoulder, conveying her growing paranoia and while her nightmare could on one level be easily attributed to a bad drug trip, she clearly had problems beforehand. I wasn't completely comfortable with some of the modernising aspects of the story, like the lesbian love scene, drug-taking and even the suggestion of incest, but there's no denying the dark momentum as her torment with some genuinely thrilling if disturbing moments on the way to her final apotheosis in the title part, especially the scene where she literally metamorphoses into the Black Swan character as she triumphantly overcomes a fall in her performance. The acting is a mixture of the stylised and naturalistic, contrasting the everyday with the other-worldly. There are no doubt deeper psychological interpretations open about Portman's Nina character with her awakening sexuality and mother complex prominent amongst them but I preferred to just watch the film as an oddly old-fashioned backstage melodrama and be swept along like the great ballet and of course wonderfully florid music it takes as its starting point. In this day and age of SFX comic-hero blockbusters, I was glad to engage with an old- fashioned if over-the-top psychological thriller which certainly kept me on my toes (sorry!) throughout."

","The film Black Swan shows that the mind has a special aptitude for greatness; however, once pushed to the limit, it can also become vulnerable and pose countless problems. Everyone is exposed to instability, especially if our environment or our life experiences becomes a factor. Our minds are beautiful but complex. Natalie Portman behaves as an unstable young girl, 'Nina Sayers', who is longing for acceptance by her aggressive artistic director 'Thomas Leroy', played by Vincent Cassel; in this twisted story of determination and fate. <br/><br/>Nina's surprising transformation and boldness immediately captures a once uncertain Thomas' attention; and she lands the main role as the white and black swan. Trying to manage the two personalities proved to be a difficult situation, as she plunged into character. Nina quickly spindled out of control in a challenge that was evidently too much for her to control. The Black Swan is strikingly similar to 'A beautiful mind' in many ways. John Nash a very talented and brilliant mathematician played by Russell Crow, shows how the mind can and will shift if strained and overworked. Both movies show the artistry in humans; however, it also shows the vulnerability of the human mind.<br/><br/>The environment choice used was contributive in setting the mood of this movie. The lighting in the movie was always dark and the rooms always felt small. Viewers felt a feeling of entrapment in the small apartment, and routed for Nina's freedom. There are several motifs that contribute to the theme of this film, particularly visual motifs. In the film Nina hallucinates quite frequently. This allowed the viewers to understand what she felt. One motif in particular, is when Nina imagined that she had sex with her team mate Lilly, who she almost lost her role to. She confronted Lilly in a rage, wondering why she left without waking her. At that time she recognized that she had imagined the entire scene.<br/><br/>Another visual motif was when she hallucinated about stabbing Lilly to death, and then hiding her body. In reality she had stabbed her self. Nina died as a result.<br/><br/>No one in direct connection with Nina was prepared for her untimely death. Although her mother knew that she was not feeling well. This came as a big surprise for everyone. This film shows that at any given time the human mind can become clouded, no matter the person's persons intelligence or perseverance."

","Black Swan is just as much about a woman dancing in Swan Lake as it is a modern retelling of the story. Nina Sayers starts off as the perfect Swan Queen, pure, innocent and sweet. The film sees Nina (Natalie Portman) preparing for the performance of Swan Lake, as she takes on the role of the White Swan she seems to be becoming more and more like her evil twin, the Black Swan. This film encapsulates the essence of Tchaikovsky's original ballet, playing with the lines between good and evil and displaying the conflict and delusions of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Nina begins as a young ballerina who is hoping to receive a larger role in this season of the New York City Ballet as she is a perfectionist who couldn't work harder at her art form. She lives at home with her over-protective mother, a former dancer herself who invades into Nina's life. Thomas Leroy, the head of the dance company, is hesitant to select Nina as the Swan Queen in the company's new production of Swan Lake. This is because Thomas does not believe that Nina has the passion and emotion to portray both the White and the Black Swans.<br/><br/>Then another dancer from San Francisco joins the company, Lily (Mila Kunis). She seems to be everything Nina is not, outgoing, bold and open about herself. Lily's presence puts pressure on Nina, as well as the pressure of the role itself, of her mother and of the other dancers who wanted to be the Swan Queen and claim Nina slept with Thomas to get the part. Nina begins to hallucinate and slowly loses her mind with all of the emotional and physical stress she has on her.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman powers the film with an incredible performance. The character of Nina is acted amazingly as she descends into madness. Portman drives the spirit of the movie, a seemingly fragile girl who becomes passionate and aggressive through her own creation. The supporting cast is great as well. This is by far the greatest performance we have yet seen out of both Portman and Kunis.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler) directs the film with an absurd quality that makes it great. Black Swan is incredibly tense, with emotion being explored deeply. Aronofsky also explores the themes of sexuality and violence in a way that disorients the audience and almost makes people question their own sanity. Overall, Black Swan is a terrific film which delves deeper than most thrillers, exploring the psychological cause and effects of actions, as well as displaying the art of ballet and the stress associated with a role with almost perfection."

","Black Swan is a very good film, but not nearly as great as most people made it out to be. Barely a surprise though, since it was already a very good film 45 years ago when Roman Polanski shot it and called it ""Repulsion"". Personally, I though it reminded way too much of this (and a few other) Polanski film(s). Lonely, kind of obsessive, superbly beautiful girl that's reluctant, almost afraid, of relationships, descends into madness And Aronovsky is very good, but he is no Polanski, at least when it comes to the psychological thriller part. After a point, everything is, or could be, a delusion, which is kind of irritating because you are only left with assumptions of what actually happens. You know what you see is Nina's paranoid view of things, but it's so overwhelming that you're left wondering about almost every scene, which is a bit too much.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is, in the end, on par with some of the best films of its kind, but that's mostly thanks to Natalie Portman's (even more) fabulous (than usual) presence...and a lesbian scene between her and the also wonderful Mila Kunis.<br/><br/>Just those two actresses alone is worth the price of the DVD."

(The Social Network, of course, is a Zeitgeist movie, and a good one). Specifically, BS is rendered almost exclusively from Nina's point of view, and she is basically living in a pressure cooker. That said, I think viewers often think films with artistic pretensions have to be taken seriously at all times. Not really. Often, art films are 'saved' by flashes of humor. And BS is a fairly rare hybrid of an art film that is highly commercial as well. Few films since the late 60s are as on point in the art/commercial sense as BS. Many are the films that have tried for the Rosemary's Baby thing. Finally, the Polanski award goes to ... Aronofsky."

Camera work is simply superb giving the viewer no chance to close his camera eyes.Natalie Portman is at perfection in the acting giving no scope for others to replace her with.<br/><br/>The Director Mr.Darren tries to convey the message of ""Anything which is true to heart within the bounds of civilization of culture directed in the path of righteousness is the essence of life"" which he achieves in the movie. Culturing the mind in such a path is difficult but important for the well being of the society. In order to feel such a essence there are a lot of intrusions, preventions which has to be overcome for better understanding of life. One such obstacle is dual mind set which is evidently shown in the movie. when Nina steels some of the things of the person whose behaviors does not meet the standard well being and then starts using it, the consequences seems to change. Her mind seems to see only the evil existence in the society and the good remains unrecognized. The movies shoots the duality of the mind in the way the white swan turns into black. She does not understand that she is killing herself in that force of down mentality. She does not even accepts the suggestions of her mom who symbolizes the essence and experience of life. Nina wins the heart of millions of audience but fails to understand her own heart and soul. The final gravity of the story faints to that the ""Love is perfect"" and is equalized to ""Death is certain""."

Black Swan is exactly that, a dark and twisted picture that is elevated to a beautiful status, even if that is just because all those around it pale in comparison. Portman gives a tremendous performance, with excellent back-up from Kunis, Cassel and Ryder. Each character takes their toll on the protagonist, before it becomes obvious that she is infecting those around her. This film has the ability to become a classic horror film, as the terrifying moments gradually build, and are hidden away amongst the drama of the characters."

","Black Swan was a highly anticipated film in 2010, and it definitely does not disappoint. After my initial viewing, in conclusion it was everything that i didn't expect but in a good way. For those of you who think this is a film all about dance, then you are particularly wrong.<br/><br/>Nina Sayers is ballet dancer in New York whose life is consumed by dance and is always pushing herself. Director Thomas Leroy forces the company lead into retirement, and makes the decision to put on a new rendition of the classic Swan Lake, and Nina is soon selected to lead in the new ballet. With severe competition from new dancer Lily and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica, Nina soon begins a journey into a deep, dark, dangerous territory.<br/><br/>The film examines a physically demanding and unappreciated art. Although dance is an element within the film, it is not by far the main one. Obsession appears to be one of the main themes throughout and you witness the main protagonist become more and more obsessed with not only her performance, but also being perfect physically.<br/><br/>The main drive behind this film is in fact the visuals and the editing techniques used. The contrasting colours between black and white, give the obvious indication between good and evil, innocence and darkness. There are changes to colour in every scene depending upon what the main protagonist may or may not be doing. The scenery and set design used in black and white,makes the audience think twice about the true motivations and intentions of both character and creator.<br/><br/>The director uses an element of reflection, mainly represented through that of mirrors. Nina portrays feelings of both ambiguity and confusion through the use of mirrors. This consistently makes an audience question what is going on.<br/><br/>The musical score throughout is astoundingly brilliant and not only adds to the overall narrative, but heightens the most intense moments in the film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives an outstanding performance as Nina, both intense and beautiful in their own right. At the start you see her as an innocent, sexually repressed girl who just wants to please her mother. Clearly she is unwell at the beginning of the film and as it progresses Portman does a wonderful portrayal of a character whose personality completely reverses. It is apparent at the beginning that Nina is perfect for the role as the delicate White Swan, but incoherently loses her mind as she becomes more like the Black Swan. You can almost feel how the character is living a dream and a nightmare at the same time. At some points in the film her performance is terrifying, and she certainly has proved her worth as an actress in this film.<br/><br/>Black Swan is captivating from beginning to end and a movie not to be missed."

","Darren Aronofsky is a fantastic story teller to be sure. Black Swan just falls a little short. The schizophrenia it discovers is awesome but brooding. It's too much in your face. Easily figured out.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is a dancer with a disturbing childhood and an insane mother. It's all about her genesis into madness to play the Black Swan. The director her ballet company knows she's damaged and masterfully uses her fears or so it seems. After you watch it, does he?<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is the ""old"" dancer the director used up for a performance. Or, did he? Everything Portman's character experiences is from her world. She's fragile with a damaged psyche. Her mother lives vicariously through her daughter's life and is a control freak.<br/><br/>Ballet is no evil as portrayed. It's a character study of one becoming the Black Swan and not knowing the difference or never knowing much of anything in the first place.<br/><br/>Portman is brilliant. Her range of emotions is stunning. Mila Kunis is a dancer the director brought in to challenge Portman's psyche, or did he? Was Portman's mum evil? Is the director one who moves his stars into madness? Lot more to figure out.<br/><br/>My only problem was the ending. No closure. It's dark, which I love. I wanted to see a good Swan to the evil Swan. Such juxtaposition would have given the movie perfection and still would've challenged my psyche.<br/><br/>Portman deserves the Oscar. But, Chris Nolan would've made this film perfect."
"ilia_davidovich","9","0","1","28 October 2011"," Great movie and improvement for Aronofsky
","I follow Aronofsky since when he was an obscure young director making Pi a memorable feature about paranoia, personality split and obsession. I'm very glad he did another movie about that. As with any of his movies, he is factually never perfect. Pi, Requiem, Wrestler, those movies are not depicting the Math, Wrestling or Drug Abuse the way it really is. But Aronofsky is not teaching Math, he's showing emotions, vulnerability, obsessions and personality disorders. Anyone whining how ballet companies are not as depicted, stop bitching and go watch something else, don't waste your time, you should know by now that it's impossible to predict stock market prices and people don't go nuts from diet pills. Look at those subjects as means to communicate the emotional state of the protagonist. The fight within human mind, vulnerability of human psyche.<br/><br/>Now about the movie itself. It is great. It's claustrophobic, it's intense, it's raw and unpleasant, it's what Aronofsky does so well. The whole movie is so tight in the head of Nina, it's really impressive people are now open enough to such movies, the movie doesn't deserve all the hype, it's clear that many people will not understand it, and many negative reviews proving my assertion. Repulsion and especially The Tenant come to mind when comparing the intensity and anxiety of the action. It's not important if actually anything happens for real, because it's not the point. The point is to show how sensitive people are vulnerable and unfit to live in our society, how life may become unbearable when the person is tense and obsessed.<br/><br/>So - if you want stories about ballet, dance or life of primas - look somewhere else. If you want psychological thriller with some shock and horror attached, look past factual discrepancies, and enjoy solid movie by talented director. I'm very glad I watched the movie which I can compare to The Tenant. I never thought I would. Polanski should be proud his legacy goes on."
"Jerominator","4","0","1","22 October 2011"," What makes a good film?
","After watching so very many films I'd like to think I can identify a good or a bad movie. After watching this I just don't know any more. I can tell you I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I can also recognise that parts of it were filmed very nicely, the roles were well cast, the main actors put in good performances, and it dealt with some interesting ideas around paranoia, competition and control. It certainly told a story - a ballerina, who's clearly been pushed by her overbearing mother, desperate to realise her dream of getting the lead in Swan Lake. Despite a healthy amount of doubt and a poor audition, she lands the lead. Then she has to deal with the pressure of preparing for the role and embracing its uncomfortable darker side, all in the face of mounting pressure and colleagues trying to undermine her. As the enmity, anguish and paranoia build, we're left asking ""will she pull it off?"". Fair story if you ask me. So we have a nice looking film, good actors, interesting story, etc etc etc. So why the hell didn't I enjoy it? Well for starters I'm not big into ballet though I've seen a couple - maybe if I understood ballet better then I'd dig the themes it deals with. Maybe if I was female I'd understand the interplay between the 2 main dancers better. Maybe if I'd had a similar experience in my life I'd empathise with the main character's journey. If any of these were the case then surely I'd rate it more highly? This is why I asked what makes a good film. It's so very subjective that the act of reviewing and rating a film suddenly seems pretty pointless, except to yourself, as it depends entirely on who you are, what your experience is, what your view on life is, and how you're feeling when you watch it. As such, I can understand the reasons for the good and bad reviews on here. If nothing else this movie made me think about that! Stepping aside from that philosophical quagmire, in the back of my mind I suspect this is a good, but flawed film; flawed for reasons other reviewers have mentioned - clichés, shallow characters, obvious themes, no real closure on what has or hasn't happened, but hey - maybe that's exactly what the director wanted, maybe that's genius?. I'm amazed if the dancing is as bad as people have said on here - I thought it looked amazing, especially from a couple of actors. All I can say is I didn't enjoy it much - so if you're me, don't watch it."

","This is a very interesting film. I really like how the whole movie went together. Now the one thing that some viewers might not like about the movie is how sexual the film is. It does play a part in the story. Like the more gritty dirtier version of Swan Lake. The cast is excellent. Natalie Portman is pretty intense and so strict in her life. While you have Mila Kunis who is more bubbly and willing to do anything. Winona Ryder is in the film but seems like she was dying. Couldn't tell if it was her or the character. Vincent Cassel is also pretty good as he pushes Portman's character to be the best. The film really has a dark feel to it showing how the mind can warp reality and take control. If you are not a fan of the theater, when you here Swan Lake, you think boring. But even though this seems like a different movie, it actually has the presence of Swan Lake in the background and it makes it very more interesting to think about."
"OutsideHollywoodLand","Null","0","1","28 September 2011"," Rediscovering Natalie Portman
","The world of ballet is usually low on the shelf when Hollywood producers are looking for a script to bring to life. Perhaps it's all those frilly tutus and tights or maybe it's the anorexic females and effeminate males prancing about on their toes. How can one craft a drama about a world that lends itself more to an effete form of entertainment that only a 250,000 k intellectual can love? The only two ballet-themed movies that are worth remembering are ""The Red Shoes"", with Moria Shearer, made in 1948 and ""The Turning Point"", in 1977, featuring Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft. Both stories dealt with the difficulty women have trying to balance their dancing career with a satisfying private life. See? Today's modern sensibilities make it impossible to drum up an ounce of interest in a woman having a career crisis on pointe shoes.<br/><br/>Well, screen writers Andres Heinz, Mark Heyman, and John J. McLaughlin have discovered how to mine the ballet drama for all it's worth, bringing the ballet world out of mothballs and into the mainstream audience's attention. After all, if sex sells and thrillers pack the house, then why not blend the two into an award-winning film? Billed as a ""psychosexual thriller"", Black Swan, starring Natalie Portman in the title role, is a claustrophobic study of a young woman's descent into paranoia and madness. Nina Sayers, a professional ballerina, struggles through a life that is narrowly defined by the demands of her craft with endless hours of practice, daily rehearsals, scant meals, egoistical instructors, and dreaming of the coveted lead role as prima ballerina in Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Nina's world stifles her at every turn as she pours all of her tamed emotions into her dancing. The driving passion for Nina is perfecting her already pitch-perfect moves. While the other dancers maintain outside interests and friendships, Nina prefers to isolate herself with her self-induced rigid schedule. Even during her few hours of rest, she chooses stuffed animals - relics from her childhood – to sooth her nerves, as she falls asleep to her ballerina music box, that of course, dances to the refrain from Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Nina lives with her over-protective mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina who chose family over her career, and never let's an opportunity – or a discussion – go by without bringing it up.<br/><br/>Erica: Has he tried anything with you? He has a reputation. I have a right to be concerned, Nina. You've been staying late so many nights rehearsing. I hope he isn't taking advantage.<br/><br/>Nina: He's not.<br/><br/>Erica: Good. I just don't want you to make the same mistake I did.<br/><br/>Nina: Thanks.<br/><br/>Erica: Not like that. I just mean as far as my career was concerned.<br/><br/>Nina: What career? Erica: The one I gave up to have you.<br/><br/>Nina: You were 28 and only in—(stops) Erica: Only what? Nina: Nothing.<br/><br/>Erica: What! Nina: Nothing.<br/><br/>Mother and daughter both obsess over the upcoming Swan Lake audition, commandeered by Thomas (Vincent Cassel), the head instructor. Thomas clearly enjoys playing everyone in his dance troupe against one another, tapping half of the auditioning class on their shoulders and then announcing to the remaining dejected applicants (including Nina), that they are in fact the ones who made the casting cut. When Nina gets the lead role, Thomas begins feeding her a steady diet of his sexually-charged ridicule, goading her into shedding her inhibitions for a superior performance – and into his bed.<br/><br/>Thomas: I got a little homework assignment for you. Go home and touch yourself. Live a little.<br/><br/>As her mother frets, Nina grimly tries to ignore Lily (Mila Kunis), an ambition dancer who's nipping at her heels for the chance to step into Nina's tired shoes.<br/><br/>Thomas: What's going on? Nina: (crying) Lily! You made her my alternate? Thomas: Well there's always an alternate. Lily is the best choice.<br/><br/>Nina: No, but she wants my role.<br/><br/>Thomas: Every dancer in the world wants your role.<br/><br/>Nina: No, this is different. She's after me. She's trying to replace me! Thomas: Nobody's after you.<br/><br/>Nina: (crying harder) No, please believe me! The twin elements of violence and sexuality in ""Black Swan"" aren't gratuitous by any means, but organically grow as Nina is forced to confront her fears and desires as an adult woman. Natalie Portman skillfully balances between a demanding array of emotional shifts all the way until her final curtain call. Ms. Portman's outstanding performance proves she deserved to dance away with our boy Oscar. Bravo!"

","Darren Aronofsky brings a new psychological ballet thriller, starring Natalie Portman, who just wants to be perfect. ""Black Swan"" starts off nice and honest where Nina, portrayed by Portman in the film, uses her determination to get the part as both the White and Black Swans in the new ""Swan Lake"" production, but ends up getting only the White Swan part, but still works hard for the Black Swan part, battling against another ballerina named Lily, portrayed by Mila Kunis. Then, the movie starts to enter into a thrilling horror fashion of the story, where Nina encounters uncontrollable, confusing, and freaky hallucinations, and trying to get the role of the Black Swan almost ruins her life. Director Darren Aronofsky's marvelous directing job helped bring a lot of thrills, chills, and suspense to the film, and it was one of the best directing jobs I have seen in years. Natalie Portman's electrifying and breathtaking performance as Nina, really stole the show with her unique style and sense, and is one of the best performances I have seen this year. The rest of the casting ensemble is unique and brilliantly challenging. Mila Kunis is sexy and thrilling, Vincent Cassel is perfectly clever, Barbara Hershey is powerful and spectacular, and Winona Ryder is super challenging. The script of the story felt like each moment of the film was similar to the 'Swan Lake' story. This kind of makes the movie more special in similarity, and uniqueness. Also, the movie has provided so much thrills and chills that have almost freaked me out most of the time. Many of these moments involve not understanding what happened, when did it happen, why did it happen, or how did it happen. It's pretty much confusing, but it's really fun and exciting. The ballet scenes are magnificent, the cinematography is gorgeous, the film editing is perfect, the costumes are beautiful and dazzling, the directing and acting was spectacular, and the finale is one of the most shocking endings I have ever seen in a movie. ""Black Swan"" is an amazing, thrilling, beautiful, and exhilarating movie and it's one of the most perfect movies of the year. ""Black Swan"", in my review, ""a beautiful, and mind-bending thriller""."

","Just watched this movie on a Netflix disc. It features Natalie Portman in her Oscar-winning performance as a ballerina who seems to be lost in her role as the Black Swan. Mila Kunis plays her rival...or is she? Barbara Hershey is her mother, Winona Ryder an aged ballerina who resents being cast aside, and Vincent Cassel as the teacher who can be pretty controlling but still inspirational. Director Darren Aronofsky provides such haunting images concerning the transformation of the Portman character that you wonder if she's truly mad before coming to a definite conclusion. I'd say this was quite a beautifully realized dream-like drama that holds on to you till the very end. So on that note, Black Swan comes highly recommended."

","In the mid 60's I saw Roman Polanski's memorable film Repulsion, starring Catherine Deneuve as a sexually repressed Belgian girl living with her worldly sister in London, who slowly went mad as she suffered sexual fantasies. Black Swan has the same theme, but the action takes place in the hothouse atmosphere of a ballet company. We have seen it all before, and better, in The Red Shoes and Turning Point: the rigorous training for a brief career - dancers are washed up by their mid 30's, the bleeding feet, the injuries, the bullying artistic directors who demand total subjection to their art.<br/><br/>If watching ballet is your thing, Black Swan is a disappointment as it mostly takes place in the rehearsal rooms. If thrillers are more to your taste, I can think of many far better.

","Since I had heard many things about this movie before viewing it, I wasn't sure about how I would react to some aspects of the movie. <br/><br/>First of all, I really enjoyed the story, regardless of how disturbing it could be. I relate to it well because I'm in the performing arts myself (music and theatre), and I understand the desire and obsession with being perfect at what you do.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's performance was brilliant--she showed a great example of what some actors, performers, etc. go through--the work that goes into a ""finished product"" and how so much of you can be consumed in it. One particular thing I saw improvement in was her facial expressions: in other movies of her that I had seen such as ""Anywhere But Here"", I usually found her face to be very dead. I saw a lot more variety in her emotional expression in this role, and it really contributed to her transformation.<br/><br/>Although I was saddened by how disturbing and mentally destructive Nina, the ballerina, became, I was not surprised after discovering that Darren Aronofsky had directed the film. He tends to make movies that center around a person being so consumed with their passion or art that it causes great problems or ultimately their own destruction. <br/><br/>Another performance that particularly stuck out to me was Barbara Hershey's, who played Nina's mother, Erica. After seeing her during the first part of the movie and then seeing how hers and Nina's relationship is, you are able to tell that mentally, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. However, it's such a brilliant usage of the idea of parents trying to live their once hopes and dreams through their children. She was truly disturbing and smothering--it's very strange and awkward to see her treat her twenty-something daughter like she's eight and have almost complete control over her schedule, eating habits, etc. You almost want to cheer after seeing her assert her independence more, even if she was too drastic about it. <br/><br/>Even if a little over the top at times, this film is a shining example of great directing and great performances by Portman and all of the other cast members."

","A while ago, one of my coaches made a cruel joke about one of our best foot ball players who chose to become a ballet dancer. It was funny to me then, but now I see that it is probably more painful the process to acquire the necessary straight and technique the dancers have.<br/><br/>The Black Swan does honor to his name, not only on the Tchaikovsky role Nina Seyers (Portman) tries so hardly to improve, but also in Nina by itself. She is a ""sweat girl"": fragile, pretty, a dreamer, insecure. She is the White Swan. But, oh surprise, she doesn't have a Black Swan. She fakes it and, in a ballet, that's probably something that can be easily detected. The audience wants to see real feelings and Nina can't provide them. Her predecessor, Beth (Rider), surely has his good and personal version of it. Her ballet mate (or competence?), Lily (Kunis), should have not any White Swan at all, cause she is entirely a Black Swan, nothing more and nothing less. She's hot and vigorous. She's brave and confident. She has a two-black-wings-tattoo on her back, like to prove it. She's inaccurate but natural (""She's not faking"" Thomas said). At one level, she's just what Nina needs to be to reach the so desired perfection. But, how can it be? That's what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>Anronofsky successfully trapped Portman's twisted metamorphosis into the Black Swan everyone wants to see, in one of the most beautiful performances of the year. A frigid, spoilt and fearful girl, big enough to take care of herself, but weak enough to tell her mother she can take off her clothes on her own. Frighten by the freedom, but more by the conflict inside, reflected in so many surrealistic takes that the movie basically could have told the story without audio. In those brilliant (and even scaring) takes, Nina is being forced by the specter of her evil twin, who seems to wish the freedom Nina is rejecting, to be a real woman. In consequence, Nina scratches her back, rips her skin, breaks her fingernails, etc. She even prints herself in the only similar being around, who happens to be Lily, the Black Swan who can take her place in the stage in a blink of an eye, and Beth, the only being around who reached perfection and drop off. Nina's mother, Erika (Hershey), is most likely the antagonist of this story, for she is the one suppressing her potential with merely love. Inspires her to be conformist and consenting her, instead of letting her go or at least, giving her a little personal space in the bathroom. Hershey should be a good mother, thought.<br/><br/>The most relevant character, after the end, is Beth Macintyre, who happened to be famous and could have given Nina all the answers. But she was too ""IN"" with her own demons to lead with another person's. When she finds that she's being dumped out of the company, she falls in a depression driven by alcohol and rage that ended showing up a small amount of damage of what a Black Swan can do with a dancer. If Nina would have forgotten about the performance and concerned more about the trap Beth's pride placed on her way, she could have avoid a trap from her own mind. She ends devastated in the hospital (probably crazy, probably killed: you won't hear it from me), but she didn't leave the stage without a warning to Nina, that couldn't be taken seriously because of the ballet maestro and Nina's owner, Thomas Leroy (Cassel): ""Make the most of it, Nina! Yup"".<br/><br/>Nothing stopped her from her mind deliriums and the unstoppable search of perfection until it was too late, and even then: her dreams turned into wishes, her wishes turned into fantasies, her fantasies turned into nightmares, her nightmares turned into hallucinations, her hallucinations turned into deliriums, and the deliriums drove her mad.<br/><br/>Aronofsky used visual effects lightly, but one of them is in my favorite take from the entire year (even more that the rolling chamber in ""Inception""). Luckily, the story doesn't need all the CGI in the world, cause as I said before, the movie talks by its own. You'll see a good thriller, without exhilarating sound effects and with an exhilarating good screenplay. And yet, it would be one of the craziest, sexiest movies you'll see in a while. You'll found a relivable shiver (or a truly terrifying relieve) at the end, when the White Swan flags and the Black Swan break his cage, just to prove the perfection has a high cost and that thrillers like this are a real mind feast on a time when movies like ""Final Destination"" sell tickets.<br/><br/>So astonishing that I found that the last Oscar season wasn't about The King Speech and Inception, as I thought, but was about the Social Network and Black Swan. And, obviously, it is so strong that I needed to comment about it even half a year after the premier."
"spacechick2003","8","0","1","25 June 2011"," Black Swan, the most puzzling movie I've watched this year so far.
","I am going to attempt to make this short (and I hope, sweet) to help you make up your mind whether to watch this movie. Or if you are like me and only read reviews after watching a movie, just putting in my tuppence worth. Not sure what that is in other currencies. Not even sure what it is in decimal coinage.<br/><br/>At time of writing there are over 800 reviews, so it's unlikely that anyone is going to want to trawl through all the other reviews! I know I didn't.<br/><br/>So read mine instead, it is much less complicated than the other 800 odd reviews!<br/><br/>To the movie:<br/><br/>TIGHT BUNS: There are are a lot of TIGHT BUNS in this movie. Now I personally like to think that the plethora of shots of TIGHT BUNS represents the suppressed sexuality of some of the characters. Others, with less time on their hands to dwell on such matters, may just think that the TIGHT BUNS are to keep a dancer's hair out of our face. Now I am not sure if our American cousins know what a bun is, but it is the type of 'up-do' we see the dancers hair in.<br/><br/>CAMERA ANGLES: If like me, you are a media studies student/film-maker or indeed, a nerd,you might be interested in the use of different camera angles. There are plenty of shots from behind the lead character, showing you the protagonists perspective. Lots of different camera angles, combined with the use of lots of mirrors added to the whose crazy ambiance of the movie. Personally, it gave me lots of ideas for my next project. (Not saying I'd use the same ones, just gave me ideas).<br/><br/>NATALIE PORTMAN: She has certainly done her homework on this one. I'm thinking she should have maybe ate her homework too! She clearly didn't eat for quite some time. She is SO skinny and looks like a ballet dancer, all cheeks and rib-cage. A perfect choice for the lead. Did she deserve an Oscar? Looks like a pretty intense project to be involved in. I know she done a fair bit of the dancing herself, although just how much is hotly debated. However, not by me and not here.<br/><br/>DRUGS: There are scenes of drug-taking in this, but if they're buying E that only lasts 4 hours they are getting ripped off big-time. <br/><br/>THROWING UP: Multiple shots of Nina throwing up, no explanation given. Guess we are to assume that all ballet dancers are anorexic. <br/><br/>EARRING FIDDLING: There are a lot of scenes in which Natalie and other characters in the movie fiddle about with their earrings. I've no idea what this signifies or it may be something akin to the aforementioned TIGHT BUNS.<br/><br/>MAKE-UP AND COSTUME: Two points here. The make-up and costuming in the movie and indeed the general 'feel' of the movie is quite sumptuous. However, do ballet dancers do all their own make-up and costuming? Seems unlikely. How do they get the back of the corset type things tied on their own. Just a thought.<br/><br/>CGI: Some nice CGI effects to show the extent of Nina's mental breakdown are really quite cool.<br/><br/>PLOT: First thought when movie ended was, ""there was a plot?"" Of course there is a plot, but it is dense and probably best not to think about it or you too will end up obsessed and crazy. In essence, you too will have a breakdown like Nina.<br/><br/>This movie was confusing, creepy, sexy, crazy, wild and the ballet details fascinating. It is a closed world to us outside it. Was Nina crazy from the outset? Was Lily (Mila Kunis) her rival in the movie, even real? I have read all kinds of theories about this movie, but really you can put your own interpretation on almost every aspect of this film or even the whole movie, if you so wish. <br/><br/>Was this a review? Not in the traditional sense, more my musings, also why try and compete with over 800 reviews? If you like your movies to leave you thinking, watch Black Swan. It was (almost) perfect. Yes, you should watch it and make up your own mind. Oh and yes, that is paraphrased from the last line of Black Swan."
"patrickwigington","10","0","2","12 June 2011"," Hitchcock On Acid
","Black Swan opens with a deranged and unsettling dream from the main character. She wakes up, but the movie never loses the grotesque and slightly sickening feeling of a nightmare. Darren Aronofsky creates a schizophrenic world full of demons lurking in the shadows, in the corner of the eye, and in the never ending depths of the mirror. But what makes this dark film so great is that it never forgets the Hitchcockian golden rule: Keep the audience entertained. And boy is it good at that.<br/><br/>Nina is a young adult who works at the ballet studio. This particular season is looking good for her, especially when she lands the lead role in the ballet Swan Lake. But there is something slightly off about Nina, and it is hard to place. She is in her early 20's and hasn't moved out of her mother's house yet. But more importantly, she seems to have never grown up. Nina sees the world through the eyes of a young girl wishing to be a princess, she is over emotional, and sexually frigid. Her pink room filled with stuffed animals and music boxes is hauntingly reminiscent of Norman Bates' bedroom.<br/><br/>When a new dancer joins the group, and seems to dance much more gracefully than Nina, things start to fall apart. Nina look-a-likes start to pass her by in dark alley ways, her troubled and disturbing relationship with her mother gets even worse, and demons creep on the edge of sight, being present enough to haunt the audience, but remain hidden and unknown. While many movies go for the cheap thrill and show their computer animated beasts, the monsters of Black Swan are more enduring and terrifying—because what we can't see is far worse than what we can.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is gives her most demanding—and possibly best— performance as the tormented and child-like Nina. She handles the character with a mixture of frailty and darkness. Nina's fairytale view of the world is constantly being overruled by the harsh reality of the real world, but as she tries to get her head out of the clouds, the world starts falling apart around her. Although Mila Kunis is basically the poor-man's Emma Stone, she does a great job as the sexually promiscuous and free rival dancer. Barbara Hershey is fantastic as Nina's overbearing, and possibly psychotic mother, and her presence is made all the more unsettling because we don't know her (or any characters') history. She too tends to lurk in the shadows, at the edge of sight, like Nina's demons.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is a master filmmaker. His camera flows through the film, capturing every emotion that runs through Nina's veins. Aronofsky easily creates a sense of terror mixed with beauty. Showing us the cruel and mean world of ballet dancers, how perfection and success can taunt a person, and—thrusting the audience into a winter terror-land—Aronofsky offers little warmth to this thriller. When he does give it, however, he engulfs us majestically. The film itself captures the essence of a ballet; beautiful from afar, but complete chaos and noise on stage. Eerily photographed by Mathew Libatique, Aronofsky's intriguing and erotic thriller is a masterpiece of cinema.<br/><br/>The great and sometimes ironic score by Clint Mansell really completes this movie. Taking elements from the score of Swan Lake, Mansell seamlessly transfers from beauty to terror. A score that is sometimes music, sometimes noises, he takes the horrors of the movie and implants them into his music, helping to further send the audience down that dark road where Nina lives.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's wonderfully frightening and disturbed look at the world of a ballerina is a stunning, harsh, and beautiful film that takes the imagination to new heights. With great acting and fantastic imagery, this movie is not only one of the best this year, but the best in a long time.<br/><br/>http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"

","I have the feeling that I am one of a few who disliked this film. I was expecting something better than what I saw. To begin with, the dancing is just mediocre. Non dancers and boring choreography. Turning Point is an example of brilliant dancing and choreography. This one is not. So, that was my first disappointment. Second were the performances of all the leads without exception. Certainly Natalie Portman was not in my mind worthy of Oscar nomination. Whatever Happened to Baby Jane had better acting for a horror film. This was my next disappointment, that it was simply another horror film among the many. Missing was Boris Karloff and Bela Legosi. I did like Barbara Hershey somewhat. With such a great history of roles behind her, it was good to see her again even though she was given silly lines and moments in the movie. Kunis was just awful as I expected her to be. Still with those bug eyes, looks like a beetle, she never disappoints me in doing lousy acting. There was no one in this that stood out to me, including the writing and directing. Even the dance portions could have used a bit more originality. I give this a 1 point for the presence of Miss Hershey."
"cnitinb","8","0","1","22 May 2011"," I felt it...it was perfect
","Black Swan directed by Darren Aronofsky is on surface a horror , at another level deeper it is a psychological thriller and at the core level it is an insightful tale about the ultimate question, are we embodiments of both evil and good? <br/><br/>Nina Saywers(Natalie Portman) is a ballet dancer who wins the role of the ""Swan Queen"" in the 'Swan lake' staging. Her role requires her to don the role of both the pure virgin-white swan and her evil counterpart the Black swan. Her tutor Thomas Leyroy(cassel) points out that she is perfect for the White swan but fails to connect with the evil role. Nina makes a conscious attempt to accept and 'feel' the Black swan, but soon she realizes that it's not just a role anymore and the dark side of her begins to appear in real life. Mila kunis plays the role of colleague- Lily in whom Nina sees the 'Black Swan' and begins to get insecure. Kunis excellently portrays her role and keeps you guessing about her actual intentions. Cassel portrays a character with shades of gray and shines through. Barbara Hershey as Nina's overbearing mother is convincing. <br/><br/>But the show stealer is of course the protagonist Portaman, who's powerful and enigmatic performance will grip the viewer from the beginning of the film and only leaves your mind long after the ending. The plot as mentioned before has many layers to it,but what makes this movie work is that no matter at what level you perceive the film, it is still hugely entertaining and satisfying. At times the film feels chaotic and crazy but the jewel in the crown is the ending that is both convincing yet open for an interpretation. <br/><br/>Black swan definitely is a classic and if not for anything else , it will be remembered for Portman's preeminent performance."
"tenebrisis","5","0","2","21 May 2011"," Black Swan AKA ""Let's rip off from a better film...""
","Here's the problem; it's the most predictable, routine film imaginable. Every smash cut, every horrifying vision in a mirror...it's so damn cliché, so easy to spot. ""Black Swan"" raises an awful lot of tension, but nowadays, that's so easy. All it uses are the same quick cuts, focus changes, and scary images of any two-bit, throwaway horror film. <br/><br/>The whole time I was watching the cliché fest, I was remembering a movie called ""Perfect Blue"". It has virtually the exact same premise, and it's a cheap animated movie from the late 90s, not a star-studded Hollywood $13 million picture with a score by Clint Mansell. <br/><br/>But everything that ""Black Swan"" failed at, ""Perfect Blue"" succeeded in. Just do yourself a favor and watch the latter from start to finish. <br/><br/>And you know what? It turns out that Darren Aronofsky had bought the US rights to ""Perfect Blue"" to avoid getting sued for ""Black Swan"". My intuition was right. But of course, not even a word of thanks was given to Satoshi Kon, who died tragically in 2010 of cancer at the age of just 46. <br/><br/>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156887/ (perfect blue)"
"Shell66","9","0","3","19 May 2011"," Extraordinary movie!
","Yes, it's all true. The movie is a real masterpiece, which comes as no surprise, knowing that Aronofsky directed it. I haven't had a doubt in my mind that this was going to be a great film. The visual effects were great, the plot, the script. Everything. Except Natalie Portman. Wow. This girl is a real looker, but is a perfect example of ""beauty before talent"" rule in Hollywood. Portman is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. And in ""Black Swan"", she proves it once again. There wasn't a single moment in this film where I didn't think that Jennifer Connelly would have been a much, much better choice for Nina. Yes, Connelly is a bit old for the part, but she could, without a doubt, wipe the floor with Portman's wooden acting. After Portman won the Oscar for this role, I finally admitted to myself that the Oscar's really are all about commercializing. But, in the end, even Natalie's lack of talent didn't spoil this little gem. A perfect movie experience with less than perfect leading actress."
"ailenshubby","5","0","1","8 May 2011"," a bit disappointing.
","Black Swan is about a ballet dancer that wins the lead role in ""Swan Lake"" for being perfect one half of the performance. In trying to achieve perfection for the complete performance, she loses her mind while trying to embrace the darker side of her ballet character.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Black Swan was very disappointing. If there is a proper film industry name for ""over directing"" I would apply it to this film. There was such an effort to create an odd style to the movie, they neglected to properly tell the story. I never cared about the lead character Nina Sayers, nor did I appreciate the eventual success in the end. I never cared about her relationship between her and her mother, nor did I care about the other supporting characters in her life. Why? Because, the filmmaker didn't take his time to deeply develop the any of them. Nina, was perfect as the white swan, but the audience had to accept that because her ballet director Thomas Leroy said so. She not perfect for the Black swan because the director Said so. The dance performances were often done in angles where we the audience couldn't really see or understand. <br/><br/>Secondly, the movie was more focused on style than story. Excessive shaky camera movements, erotic scenes that were over the top, and paranormal scenes that really seemed out of place for this movie, seemed to be the main focus of the director. Yes, the final dance performance in the end when film allowed the audience see her how she visioned herself was superb, but I enjoyed the scene without caring much about her achievement. In the end, I felt like: ""so what"" ""Is this a movie worthy of so much buzz?"" Certainly not, in my opinion."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","1","6 May 2011"," Grim, perturbing and morbidly fascinating goings-on at a ballet school, as the battle for a role in a prestigious play reach new levels of impoverishment.
","Black Swan begins its tumultuous, turbulent, rampageous descent into all things maddening and unravelling with some mischievous, border-line evil, cackling behind the quaint and elegant sounds of a ballet score which overlies the opening credits. That idea that something rather nasty, even devious or underhand, to a greater extent lurks behind the entire medium made up of magnificence or grace is alluded to as the piece opens; the film going on to depict a chapter in a person's life fraught with madness, hallucination and a brand of professionalism which forces them to alienate themselves from their surroundings. Director Aronofsky's Black Swan is this film; a stupendous thriller covering the getting under of the subject material at hand and the demythifying the norm whilst filtering a very beautiful surface world through a human's paranoid and sexually repressed subconscious.<br/><br/>That human is Natalie Portman's Nina Sayers, a young New York based woman whom works with a ballet group and lives with her mother. As an expansive and adventurous dance number comes to a crashing, crescendo-ridden close post-credits, she wakes up; the seeing of herself in a dream executing an extravagant dance sequence with another performer in full-on garb rounded off with a deep sigh in the here-and-now, a heavy sigh carrying with it an air of regret, as if it were a number she wishes she could envisage herself doing in reality. Nina lives with her mother in an apartment, her designated room carrying with it airs of innocence; of a child-like mentality imbued with pink wallpaper and numerous stuffed toys dotted around, the relationship with her mother Erica, played by Barbara Hershey, very much suggesting one of an infantile nature which has not been allowed to naturally progress and has been reigned in – a somewhat revealing scene in which she suggests she should cut her nails for her suggesting as such.<br/><br/>At her ballet school, the announcement of the performing of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake acts as the catalyst for severe changes to undergo; an effective and workmanlike dancer on in her own right, Nina's part in the play is without question but the specific role she's to play remains mysterious. This decision lies with Vincent Cassel's slimy, egotistical, lecherous dance manager Thomas Leroy; a man whom when we first see him towers over all in an auditorium, an entire practise session pausing for his presence and his reason for being there as he lays out specifics for the upcoming show: a man with an mysteriously sordid back-story to do with an ex-pupil of his looming over his character's proceedings.<br/><br/>Nina's ability sees her one of the shoe-ins for the role of the white swan, but the true chalice lies in the form of the role of the titular black swan; the role within the piece that sees the character therein transform, indeed mutate, from one extreme to another – with it, arriving a more aggressive, more combative and more outlandish array of characteristics that demands dancing skills of similar ilk. Nina eventually undertakes the quest to land said role, but Leroy outlines the changes she needs to undergo; her principal threat to loosing that black swan role in the form of Mila Kunis' Lily, a girl of binary opposition to Nina; a performer whom turns up late for practise in comparison to Nina's diligence to get there early; a person whose carefree attitude is in stark comparison to Nina's precise and measured approach to her dancing and an individual whose answering back and general extroverted philosophy goes against Nina's softly spoken demeanour.<br/><br/>The film is a bleak but stylish and wholly nourishing descent into the rather twisted world of ballet and performance; the ugliness lurking behind that facade of exhibition and beauty and elegance dutifully explored in a thoroughly engaging fashion. Aronofsky litters his films with mirrors; has his characters gaze into mirrors; has them peer at themselves and, on occasion, has their reflections react before peering straight back. Amidst the dance halls lined with glass and the washrooms featuring smaller versions situated above sinks, it is the mirror occupying the entrance hallway to Nina and mother's apartment which gives the greatest clue as to Aronofsky's attempt at getting under the skins of these people though reflective material: said mirror appearing cracked or distorted in its style without having been physically broken; its presence symptomatic of Nina and Lily's arrival there fresh from a night out whose aim for some it was, quite literally, to try and smash Nina's persona so that she may change for the role.<br/><br/>What Aronofsky etches out of his cast, predominantly of the two female leads, is nothing short of rather extraordinary. In regards to Kunis, we observe her part in 2008's Max Payne and that she was out horribly miscast in a role which demanded presence and conviction; a role that required her to exist in a simmering situation with little in the way of remorse to most around her but not shy at attempting to befriend one of those caught up in it if it meant personal gain. Her performance was somewhat nearing the ranks of terrible; here, and granted the short gap between films, what Aronofsky does is have her play near enough a similar role to that of the temptress, albeit filtered through the subconscious of someone else, but having her do so with far more conviction leading one into suspecting it was the fault of the man in charge of her in the debacle that was Max Payne when we observe what she pulls off here. Portman's Oscar win essentially arriving off the back of a role which is all about the ability to fall into a specific character or act; the part of Nina very much about performance and the desire to get into character and wholly infused with that field of performance and bringing to life a complexion - the end result being a rather taut and quite frightening experience worthy of its praise."

","I have to sort of agree with valkyria4. Although Portman certainly was excellent, and I believe deserved the awards she got, the movie itself was a disappointment for me, but Portman's performance was why I even gave it a 2 instead of a 1. It started out okay, and then got just plain silly. I mean really silly. I cannot see why this movie got such rave reviews. Yes, the ballet scenes were wonderful to see, and the acting was superb, but the story disintegrated into a ""psycho gobbledygook"" reminiscent of a cheap horror movie by Roger Corman. It's my opinion that those who rave about it were sucked in by the hype provided by the studio, and loved by the same people who buy modern, abstract art...it became simply a prestigious thing to hawk above us stupid masses who just don't get it."

","Nina (Natalie Portman) is a troubled, young ballerina who lives her life in an endless and hopeless pursuit of perfection. When the company's lecherous director gives her the star role of the Swan Queen, he expects her to put out and be more like the sensuous Black Swan character and less like the demure White Swan. Her deeply conflicted psyche creates a world of illusion, chaos, and terror as she gives in to her dark side.<br/><br/>We know early on that Nina has a loose grip on reality and that nothing we see is real. Given the dark storyline, one would expect an exciting movie, but I actually found it predictable. Portman gives a one-note performance, always frightened and helpless but never showing a range of emotions until the very end. There are several violent and sexual scenes intended to show her fragile state of mind, but they are often over-the-top and downright gross. While rail-thin Portman does convince us she's a ballerina and the dance sequences are lovely, the other characters are unlikable and rather stereotypical. Barbara Hershey is repellant as Nina's disturbed mother and sassy Mila Kunis, as Nina's rival, is also fairly loathsome.<br/><br/>This psychological thriller is more off-putting than entertaining and frankly, I was glad when it was over."

","Black Swan is a drama movie, set basically in a ballet school and theater. It's written by Andres Heinz and directed by Darren Aronofsky. The movie tells the story of a ballet dancer called Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). The story begins with a test to chose the Swan Queen, the main character of a ballet presentation. The plot focuses on Nina's training for the first presentation of the season as the Swan Queen. It becomes more and more dramatic until the great day, because of Nina's difficulty to play the Black Swan, the dark side of her character. With some sexual appeal, including a lesbian scene, the movie shows that you have to lose your innocence even to play a bad character as good as it can be. The cast is excellent, maybe the best Natalie Portman's performance. The film is very interesting and dramatic, and a little unusual too, and it has a tragic and surprising end. Black Swan is a great film for adults, and maybe for some teenagers. It's Oscar Winner (best actress - Natalie Portman), and a well recommended movie."

She has followed in the footsteps of her mother in search for the perfect star role as a ballerina. Set in New York City, she engorges into dance with no other interests to life with her mother as a primary advocate and supporter. A suspenseful thriller along with drama, it leaves you on the edge of your seat as you await the next. Tomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) plays as the director of this dance company with the main focus of finding the next Swan Queen for their new and upcoming season of ""Swan Lake."" He challenges Nina all the while, breaking her free from the perfection that she so long desires, setting barriers to break if the final outcome is desired. The dancers become more challenged to strive for the star role as scenes are played out. The road takes Nina to places of darkness in a fast paced world that she is not accustomed to. Erica, Nina's mother that is played by Barbara Hershey, sets the stage of a young innocent young lady, primed and propped for the world of ballet as she horns deep feelings of her own life as a young ballerina. When Beth, the ""princess,"" who is played by Winona Ryder, is replaced by Nina, her life becomes a whirlwind of changes; this leads Nina to the performance where she must be the white, innocent and graceful and the black, dark and near evil, swan in one. Lily (Mila Kunis) is the sole dancer who appears to be challenging Nina into this long awaited role of the Swan Queen.

When at the culmination of a performance the ballet audience applaud in wonderment I felt like applauding too<br/><br/> but I was doing so out of sarcasm.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 4.5 / 10. My One-Third rule applies here: if more than 1/3 of any film sucks the entire film sucks by association."
"funnybuisness94","9","0","1","23 April 2011"," My interpretation of Black Swan. ***Spoilers inside***
","This contains major spoilers to the plot, you have been warned.<br/><br/>So first let me clarify that I know I'm late to party on this one but I for whatever reason didn't manage to see this one while it was in theatres, besides that I pretty much love anything and everything Darren aeronofsky does with thee exception of The fountain because I haven't been able to see it yet. But I know that Darren usually goes for a very shocking and disturbing out look on things or at least focuses very hard on emotion so I did not read any reviews on this movie and still have not until I am done with this (My verdict is a 8.5/10 btw) because I didn't want to risk anything getting spoiled even remotely, I had watched the trailer twice once on the computer and once in the theatre but after that I would shut out anything to do with black swan.<br/><br/>So let me delve into my interpretation of this excellent film!<br/><br/>Basically the movie is a modernized re-telling of black swan but centred around people trying to perform the ballet. (In a nutt-shell)<br/><br/>So first and for most I want to establish that Nina (Natalie Portmans character) is both the white and black swan i.e she is psychophrenic. This is hinted at when Thomas Leory (Vinncent Cassel's character) states he wants to change the form in Swan Lake and by doing this he would have both the white and black swan played by the same person (Nina). He tells her that she is great as the white swan but to be the black swan she has to ""let go"" The story is about her coming to terms with her darker half who is through-out most of the film projected as Lily (Mila Kunis) I believe this is because when Nina is first auditioning for the part of white/black swan Lily comes in, in the middle of the black swan performance and slams the door interrupting Nina's audition. Thomas than says that she is done and can leave so obviously assuming that she wont get the part now she has feelings of anger and distrust towards Lily's character which starts to escalade as her hallucinations of her darker side (black swan/Lily) progress. I believe that when Nina goes out for drinks with Lily and she slips her a drug and they end up having intercourse later on, was part of Nina accepting the black swan and letting her transformation into the black swan begin (""let go""). Throughout the movie the strange things that happen to her body are a part of that transformation as she literally is in her eyes transforming into a swan. Now remember that when she was in the bar she says to one of the guys they meet that at the end of swan lake the white swan kills herself because she cannot have love with the prince due to the black swan seducing and tricking him? Well when she stabs the aparation of Lily with the shard of glass she really stabbed herself because she realizes the only way to stop the black swan is for her to kill it. When she is out on stage and literally grows black wings the transformation is complete, she has finally ""let go"" and become the black swan and gives the best performance of her life. When she goes over and kisses Thomas Leory she is seducing him like the black swan in the story does resulting in the suicide of the white one. Thomas Leory is the prince in this story and if you remember he seduced her in a practise run and said ""I seduced you, you are supposed to seduce me"" and she does as the black swan. Finally she comes back out as the white swan again still slowly dieing from the shard of glass stuck in her as she finds out Lily really isn't dead and was never even in her dressing room to begin with supporting that it was just her mental projection, her black swan side. She goes back out and finishes the performance and dies there on stage with the shard of glass in her stomach and tells Thomas she was perfect like she said to him before that she always wanted to be perfect. And the film ends just as the story Swan Lake does.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoyed my interpretation of the film and I hope you enjoyed this great film as well, thank you for reading and feel free to share your thoughts and ideas.<br/><br/>-Connor"

","I hesitated watching this movie because of information in other reviews. Also I had seen one of Darren Aronofsky's other movies, ""Pi"". This movie was the same style as that movie.<br/><br/>I felt the gut-wrenching madness and tension all the way to the bitter end. I had to look away so many times I almost stopped watching it. It made me sick to my stomach and I got the serious feeling of what it was like to go into a major schizophrenic episode during the entire movie.<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant on Natalie Portman's behalf and if wasn't for this I would have stopped the movie more than a dozen times. I felt little pleasure, no escapism from this literal descent into madness. I hated this movie! I rarely hate any movies except mad slasher type horror. I hope to see much more of Natalie Portman in another movie with another director. As I said, she was brilliant and deserved her Oscar for this movie! <br/><br/>It is not for the tender of heart, the nervous, those who get nauseated easily or those who cannot take shear psychic tension building in an inescapable manner which was what occurred without break through the entire length of a movie. This is madness at it's most graphic. If that appeals to you and you wish to immerse yourself in this world hallucinations and all you will love this! I am an avid lifelong movie watcher and connoisseur and I promise I will giving anyone I know the heads up on this one. It was macabre and horrible as a bad nightmare I wanted to wake up from.<br/><br/>The only scene I thought that was particularly brilliant (and I give kudos to that scene) is the Final dance in the program of ""Swan Lake"" at the very end of the movie, but I won't spoil it for those who wish to watch this movie by telling you what will happen.<br/><br/>Good luck toughing this movie out! If you liked ""Pi"" you will love this movie even more!"
"trnjamesbond","4","0","2","8 April 2011"," Black Swan, clichéd, and too long
","Hello film fanatics,<br/><br/>I must start by saying, this film had great camera work, excellent acting, by Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and especially Barbara Hershey, for playing a controlling psychotic mother.<br/><br/>With this being said the reason for my low rating is because it kind of drags on and on, yes I understand that Portman's character obviously has some issues with her marbles upstairs, mainly because of her controlling mother. And this is why this film didn't work for me. This kind of story has been done to death, from films such as Hitchcock's Psycho with the whole mother/Norman personality, David Lynch's Mullholland Dr. having the fake reality and also lesbian scenes (Which was filmed more elegant by Lynch than the director of this film.) Texas Chainsaw Massacre with the whole crazy family thing going on, and Raising Cain with John Lithgow which is another Psycho style film in itself.<br/><br/>Why I'm mentioning these films,well it's because films like these they all have one thing in common,and that's the whole parental conditioning, also like Mullholland Dr.,the whole fake world kind of thing, through some kind of everyday environmental pressures coming from society. <br/><br/>In this film I found it had little hints from films like that. I understand that taking great ideas from another film that you love, is a normal thing, and kind of hat's off to all the wonderful films from the past, but like I've said I'm just so bored of this kind of story, that's all. I really don't want to see another psychological crazy mental breakdown film again, we have enough already. And that's why I rated this film the way I did.<br/><br/>Also the whole lesbian fantasy between Portman and Kunis, well that is really nothing shocking and nothing I haven't seen before, it just seemed like they were trying to play the shock value card, and by having an innocent actress such as Portman, that's really what makes the film pop! Or so they think. Let me ask you this, if they had an actress like Sharon Stone who was famous for showing her muffin, in Basic Instinct, would it have been so shocking, and that's my point, instead they showed Portman doing this. I really think that this scene is all this film is going to be remembered for, after time passes us by.<br/><br/>I really just think this film was just two hours of ballet, with a little bit of paranoid psychosis, alternate personality syndrome mixed in with it. With this film I find also it's like being on a roller coaster with just one big hill and no little twist's and turns before the end. You stand in the big line up, waiting and anticipating for it to move forward, but nothing does, then after an hour waiting in the boring line up you finally get to go on the ride. Then it's like at the beginning of the ride your going up the hill, getting all intrigued by the character's then you get closer to the top, getting a little bit confused, then you finally reach the top, and then boom! Your flying down the hill, letting all the secrets of the film fly past you. Then the ride stops and it's over. No little twists and turns on the way to the end of the ride.<br/><br/>To some it all up this film basically goes like this. A girl is under pressure from her mother and the ballet company, then she get's horny and wants to have sex with a woman but doesn't have the nerve to step outside of her little box of the ballet world and her controlling mother, then she goes nuts thinks she's some form of human/swan creature, and dies due to her mental issues, The End. <br/><br/>So I'm just basically saying great acting, great camera work. But just bad writing with no original thought, just the same old ""mental problems"" film, with hints of being lesbian. And besides no reputable ballet company would even hire a girl that has such low self confidence, also in the final act where she falls off of the guy who is holding her up, then crashes to the stage, I think the director of the ballet would have her replaced. She seemed to of hit that stage pretty damn hard, and then to go back out and finish the piece in total perfection, come on people, I think if I hit my knee that hard I would be limping around at least slightly, let alone doing ballet. We as an audience don't miss details like this. <br/><br/>If you like that sort of thing then it's the film for you, but if you don't then don't watch it. And if you want to watch a decent ballet film then watch Dario Argento's ""Susperia"". It's not the greatest film but in my opinion just a nice well balanced story with great colour, good acting, excellent film work and imagination for it's time.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading."
"three_am","Null","0","1","7 April 2011"," Classis and riveting; engrossing storytelling
","The Black Swan was one of those movies that was riveting from beginning to end. From the musical score, the directing, the camera work and to the characterizations brought forth from the excellent acting, the movie was engaging as it was insightful. I've enjoyed Aronofsky films before and have praised his work with the meaningful messages he puts through them, namely The Fountain. The message I took away from the Black Swan was mainly one of transformation. Nina's character was definitely under some psychosis with the situation she was in (mother trying to live vicariously through daughter, a rival's competition and simultaneous attraction, a demanding instructor, etc.) and the movie's graphical meat came through with the literal transforming of white swan into black swan. This works when the character Nina is also dealing with hallucinations which invokes symptoms of a mental illness which is convenient when a director is trying to portray literal transforming into the black swan. As an audience member you understand the whole cg effect during the last performance.<br/><br/>It seems the classic tale of Swan Lake was given a twist and modern version and I never would have known it since it seems ballet is an acquired type of performance for the masses. Kudos to all involved with film they brought the beauty of storytelling through ballet to life."

"on_the_rainbow_5","10","0","2","2 April 2011"," Truth of humanity and a remarkable understanding of perfection
","Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman)is an outstanding ballet dancer who has been achieved the significant character white swan in ""Swan Lake"" and the new character in the performance black swan at the same time. The strong desire of hers of having to get both of these roles contains a carrying of Nina's mothers high expectation in Nina,and meanwhile, this expectation also has stressed Nina out at a level. In Nina's real life, she is a perfect good girl to her mother, at a deeper level, she is perfect in her real life under the moral level of society. In the show, when she is asked to play black swan, she finds herself has nothing in common with this character. However, the desire of playing it making her in a position that she has to push herself to get the character. When she is struggling with these contradictions, another character in the movie Lily caught her attention. Her couch told Nina that Lily is a natural black swan. Ever since Lily appears in her life, her normal and ""perfect"" life hits a crossroad, and this brings her inner contradiction to the maximum level.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's acting in this movie is too brilliant to be described by words. During the movie I feel my every single nerve and my entire motion goes up and down alone her expressions. <br/><br/>""Perfection is not only about control, it is also about letting it go.""The coach told Nina. Morally, most of people would consider Nina as a perfectly good girl and Lily is a bad girl in dark side. As Nina's mother said:""Where is my good girl?"" Nina's mother is almost a control freak that she even willing to control Nina's desire of eating. In the movie, the mother got really angry when Nina refuse to eat the cake right way when she asks her to. When Nina tries to get the character black swan, her mother shows a lot of disappointment about her trying of ""letting go"". However, on the other side, Nina is trying to make her mother happy and proud by achieving both white swan and black swan. In order to play both of the characters, Nina has to be not so moral as she used to be and she mentally divide herself into two extremely opposite personalities switching between these two roles. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie and the show ""Swan Lake"", at the backstage, Nina sees herself as Lily in the mirror, and she tried to kill Lily in order to keep her role to play black swan. It ended up that it's all her hallucination when she saw herself bleeding. At the ending of ""Swan Lake"", the white swan dies, at the same time, Nina is dying. But all she is thinking about is perfection at the last moment.The only thing she said last is ""It's perfect. It's perfect."" The pure morally perfection is not even a perfection in this movie."
"dee.reid","10","0","1","29 March 2011"," Nina, the Crazy-Crazy Ballerina, in ""Black Swan""
","This is certainly one of the better films I've seen of an actor who becomes a character who becomes another character. (Whoa.) This is the case with Nina Sayers (Academy Award-Winner Natalie Portman), a perfectionist New York ballet dancer who is cast in a stage production of ""Swan Lake"" as the lead Odette, the pure, delicate, innocent ""White Swan."" The overbearing creep of a theater director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), who is the one behind the production, thinks that Nina has the White Swan part of her character down perfectly, but the greater part of the seductive, evil Odile, ""Black Swan"" is causing her great difficulty because she is not ""losing herself"" in the part. Greater difficulty comes from Nina's overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), who is a failed dancer now an amateur artist. Pretty soon, Nina begins to display a number of frighteningly psychotic symptoms, representing itself in a number of disturbing hallucinations and paranoia, the latter brought on by her belief that a fellow cast-mate who has just flown in from San Francisco, Lily (Mila Kunis), is out to steal her part away from her. ""Black Swan"" is one of the better films I've seen in which an actor (or actress, in this case), really comes to transform themselves into someone (or something) else entirely, in which by the end they are totally unrecognizable from the person that they were before; that is one of the most significant things actors and actresses can do in their film roles, and Natalie Portman's Oscar-winning performance here is one recent, pristine example of this. She starts out as pure and simple and innocent - like her White Swan ""Swan Lake"" character Odette - but soon she finds herself treading deeper, darker waters as Odile, and the film tracks her gradual descent into madness and despair. The film makes no attempt to cover up the physically demanding arena of the ballet world; just look at some of the injuries Portman's character endures in her quest to become the best. Darren Aronofsky directed the film, which is a dark meditation on perfectionism and psychosis in the ballet world - since many people may have a hard time associating mental illness with the art. Aronofsky isn't one of my favorite filmmakers, but he did direct ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000), which is one of my favorite movies of all time and one of the best anti-drug pictures ever made. Because ""Black Swan"" deals somewhat with the notion of doppelgangers and being haunted by an evil double, I make a brief nod to the Japanese animation (Anime') film ""Perfect Blue"" (1998), a psychological thriller that Aronofsky paid homage to in a famous scene in ""Requiem for a Dream"" with actress Jennifer Connelly. Just something to think about if you get the time to see either film.<br/><br/>10/10"

"dave54t","3","0","1","24 March 2011"," terrible story teller
","Black Swan is the story of a young ballet dancer promoted to the role of the ballerina and the way she and her companions deal with her move from being a member of the group to the prime role. To perform her role, she needs to have the kind of passion that apparently, she doesn't have, or at least not enough. The story is hence a story of transformation: how a fragile, restrained naive girl turns into a passionate beast. The team that carries the movie on its shoulders is remarkable. From Natalie Portman to the sexy and provocative Mila Kunis, and the surprising up- to-now action actor, Vincent Cassel, who is doing great job. what prevents this film from becoming a good film is the story. the short version: the story sucks. the long version: first, it is boring. really. simply boring. second, and not unrelated, it takes talent to convince your audience that what they see is actually something completely different. The sixth sense is like that. While the story line here is completely different, still, things happen here and then - surprise- it is not like that! the scriptwriter did not even try to pretend. you see something and then ha-ha- no, it is something different! why? how? who? never mind! really shame."
"mia-manns","Null","0","1","22 March 2011"," Aronofsky's Black Swan (2010) review
","Another visually intense film from Darren Aronofsky, the director of Requiem for a Dream. I made the mistake of assuming this film would be more mainstream and therefore less horrifying than Requiem, but this film definitely goes just as far to push you to your limits. Before seeing it, a friend described it to me as ""hypersexual"", and I have to agree with that. It left me a little bit afraid to be alone with myself, to be honest. An excellent psychological thriller to follow my Fight Club review. This is another film that I will pretend is anywhere close to science fiction because the psychological is manifested in reality in a stunning, yet fantastic way.<br/><br/>To address a concern many of the fellows might have, I dragged my boyfriend to see this film with promises that it would be as incredible as Requiem, and he agrees with me that about halfway in it doesn't matter that it's a movie about ballet. Just in case you were worried. The music and dance really added visually to a great story, and I probably don't have to mention the parallels to the ballet of the swan queen or the black and white imagery. The ballet allows Aronofsky to continue to plague his films with stark and artistic images. He pulled it off beautifully.<br/><br/>I won't give a plot synopsis because there are excellent ones all over the internet. What I will say is that while you know the basic story, you will be shocked at where it takes you. From the trailer, I thought I knew where this was going, but felt it would still be worth the ride. It turns out I was wrong, and without spoilers, let me just say that to enjoy this film thoroughly, forget everything you saw in the trailer and go at it anew. Watch Nina closely for the effect each subtle event has on her, and forget what the reviews have told you is going to happen.<br/><br/>This is a movie about what can happen to a sweet girl in a viscous, competitive world, and I don't just mean the ballet. Nina is unnaturally innocent for her age, to the point of being emotionally immature, and the controlling forces in her life cause her to break free in a dark way that goes beyond what is expected for rebellious little girls. She becomes the Black Swan because it is expected of her to shed her innocence as she comes of age, but at the same time, her mother exerts a suffocated control over her, expecting her to be a child forever, and even Thomas, the artistic director of the show, is controlling while he pretends to free her. He has control over her sexuality as he forces her into an unhealthy relationship of the strong dominating over the weak.<br/><br/>A great story of the mind, with excellent art direction and a very imaginative manifestation of the psyche. It's been a long time since a movie has glued me to the screen to the extent that I can forget my own existence for the entire third act."

So I'd recommend seeing it for her just if you'd like to see her almost naked a few times... Vincent Cassel on the other hand was really great.

","I do not want to say that I was disappointed by this movie completely but I have awaited a whole lot more of it after all the hype it received. I think it is attributable to the whole state of business in Hollywood during the last few years, that a mediocre title like the Black Swan can rise up to such heights.<br/><br/>What really struck me was the cliché-ness (I am sorry if that is not a word) of the plot and its characters. I have awaited a story about a developing character, however what I've got was a series of predictable scenes, which did not tell anything out of ordinary or spectacular. The character of Nina does not seem deep to me at all, instead she is simply depicted as a person haunted by horror-like visions and suffering from some roughly defined cliché disorders. In fact, the horror scenes could not be more overused. Doppelganger, shifting mirror reflections, creepy shadows, this movie has all.<br/><br/>Just as the effects, so is the ""turning to the black swan"" very obvious and predictable. The side characters are not even worth mentioning. The rival ballerina literally has black wings on her back, the mother explains it in plain words that she gave up her career for Nina, the choreographer goes directly after Nina's sexuality. Sexuality seems to be the key to everything in this movie. The scene where Nina gets drunk does not seem appropriate if it's purpose is to explain me that Nina is going through some kind of personal development...<br/><br/>Anyway. To cut things short. I don't think this will be a movie to remember, because it's just simply quoting whatever comes into your mind when you see the first 20 minutes of it.<br/><br/>What deserves recognition is certainly the crafting of the movie and the performance of Natalie Portman who makes this underdeveloped storyline still worth a watch."
"nightmare_lady","5","0","1","12 March 2011"," Not as impressive as it was advertised to be
","I am a huge ballet aficionada and therefore I am very familiar of the story of Odette and Ziegfried (and I have no idea why she is called the Swan Queen in this rendition... most of my friends who are in ballet companies just simply call her Odette). First off, the crucial part of the story, Odile, is portrayed in a very different manner from what is generally accepted to be Tchaikovsky's premise (after all, he decided upon the story). She does not ""become"" a bird (in fact, Odile is never portrayed as a bird), so I found the transformation jarring.<br/><br/>As a performer myself, I have suffered a very similar predicament to what Nina has suffered; however, from what I have gathered about myself AND my fellow performers, the suffering is MUCH more agonising, more earthly, and extremely dirty even. We all have our fortes and our weaknesses; I cannot deliver Mendelssohn worth a pile of beans, while my Sibelius is relatively well delivered. There are times, however, when I must perform Mendelssohn, when I need to shape my psyche into that which fits the repertoire. Everyone has a different method; I read, my friend meditates, others go to the bar. But the suffering is internalised, not externalised, and therefore it rarely shows upon our faces. We carry on with our daily regimen, we practice, we practice, and we practice more.<br/><br/>The path to art is nothing like which is depicted here. It is a solitary confinement within yourself, and hardly nothing is externalised; when you externalise (by crying, for instance), you release the emotion and then it is gone. We pent it up until we are about to burst, and then we channel it through our performances.<br/><br/>This is a good entertainment for the general population, but it does not depict the sufferance of the artists well enough in my opinion.<br/><br/>A very good performance of Odette by Gillian Murphy of the American Ballet Company is available on DVD. I had hoped for a little higher-quality ballet performance."

Having said that it takes nothing away from the quality of this movie, great story line well acted even the parts about the ballet and dancing that does not interest me in the slightest was made interesting to watch. The bad points are the horror/suspense bits could have been better, they never really had me scared or even a little edgy but perhaps that wasn't Aronofsky's intention. Overall this is one of the better films I've seen this year and well worth a watch 8/10"

","Great scenario. Overall a very good movie.<br/><br/>Disturbing was the lesbian scene and a few other self-gratification places. Scary spots were very compelling, but made generally huge excitement.<br/><br/>Also, I really liked the cast great job. Natalie Portman played role was deffently worth its Oscar . He played a character which touched viewers and made very engaging feelings .<br/><br/>Film director Darren Aronofsky deserves a huge thank, because the content was very good and of course excellent film-work.<br/><br/>I recommended this movie to everyone and you are not going to get bored during the movie."
"bbSouthstreet","7","0","1","1 March 2011"," The Dark Side of Ballet.
","Mila Kunis once said in an interview that ballet, for her, was just dressing up in a tutu and being pretty. Darren Aronofsky shows us, through his film, ""Black Swan"" how dressing up in a tutu and being pretty are far from what being a dancer is all about. He even dares to show us what a lot of ballet dancers and films fail to show us, the dark side of ballet.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's ""Black Swan,"" is a demented drama about what happens when we crave for perfection. This is shown in young Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a young innocent girl who gets the lead part in a New York City ballet company's newest production of ""Swan Lake."" Her director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassal), casts her after seeing Nina has a dark side, a dark side she denies having. But through the help of a new found friend, Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina discovers her dark side, but in a way she'd never imagine. Through her obsession and self- discovery, Nina will find there's a very heavy fee in pursuing perfection.<br/><br/>""Black Swan,"" discusses many topics. Self-discovery, self-doubt, good and evil and cravings for perfection. Things other films and books have discussed before, but not in such a way as Aronofsky's. Through a disturbing and macabre camera lens, we, the audience, are given a beautifully crafted story with top notch actors and brilliant artistic directing."
"DominicTaylor","10","0","2","1 March 2011"," I absolutely loved Black Swan, one of the best, twisted, nightmarish films i have ever seen! Darren Aronofsky & Natalie Portman have done an amazing job.
","I saw a screening of Black Swan on Sunday, and i have to say that i loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>The story is about a young ballet dancer called Nina (Portman) living in New York who has a lot of pressure on her by her mom, dance teacher (Cassel) and co-dancers. She is chosen to play the White Swan a pure innocent creature in the production Swan Lake, but must also play the dark, evil and sadistic sister the Black Swan. In real life Nina is sweet, quiet and innocent therefore the perfect role for the White Swan, so her dance teacher tells her to get in touch with her evil side so she can feel the Black Swan and make the performance much more realistic or she shall be replaced by co-dancer Lily (Kunis). But things turn very dark for Nina as she starts to suffer from hallucinations, paranoia and schizophrenia and becomes obsessed with 'perfection', and everyone around her and starts to go into a dark, mystical, seductive and evil place.<br/><br/>When i read the story and saw the trailer to this film it just looked so twisted and awesome, not to mention all the awards it had one and i made it my top priority. So i went to the movies with high expectations and came out thinking ""what the hell have i just seen"". the reason i loved it so much was because it was innocent and bright at times and then all of a sudden turns dark and sadistic and goes back and forth. I have to say Darren Aronofsky has done a fantastic job and Natalie Portman was amazing.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of weird and twisted movies and this just blew me away honestly i cannot wait till this comes out on DVD, one of my new favourite films ever."

","Saw this film tonight, and was impressed. This story of a woman (Portman) who is overtaken by the evil black swan as she prepares for her first performance as a principal dancer was quite frightening at times.<br/><br/>Barbara Hershey (botox and all) did a great job as the stage mother in this film. <br/><br/>Although this is by no means a Oscar level film (I was very surprised to see it nominated) Portman does give an Oscar winning performance in the lead. <br/><br/>A little above a popcorn movie I highly recommend this film to all lovers of dance.<br/><br/>In many ways it captures the behind the scenes look and feel of what I saw with women who trained with the hopes of a professional dancing career with the twist of a woman who has gone beyond the normal stressors of someone under this type of pressure."

","I give this movie an 8. It was awesome and had me focused on the movie the entire time. I give it an 8 because the movie was somewhat confusing if you don't realize half of everything is based on what she is thinking. I watched it twice and I am going to watch it again. Great acting and great picture quality. The movie is not as predictable as one would imagine, and I am very good at predicting the outcome of movies. My only regret is that I wish I had went to the theater to see it, I would definitely pay the 9.25 they charge to watch this movie on the big screen with the surround sound! I would recommend it to someone looking for a suspenseful movie."
"borkoboardo","8","0","1","27 February 2011"," Aronofsky is evolving ..... without losing his roots! Wow!
","Nina is an aspiring ballet dancer. All she strives for is the role of the swan in swan lake. Playing the white swan doesn't seem to be the problem, rather the black swan develops into an obstacle. After the director of her school tells her to be the next swan Nina falls into a twisted daydream battling yet welcoming her dark side.<br/><br/>The story is as simple as it is complex at the same time. But the joker of this film is definitely Aronofsky's typical pace-play, cut, camera and most of all: sound design! Especially the sound makes this film exceptional - while on one hand it is filled with beautiful classical music performed mostly minimally (piano) and on the other with dark distorted spheres, back-hair-raising-sound effects and very creative transitions to support the cut pace. Aronofsky quotes himself without forgetting to show development and exactly those ""once missing elements"" make this film very mature and yes, indeed a worthy Academy Award contestant. <br/><br/>In my opinion the film sometimes had scenes stretched a little too long while it could have celebrated others to a larger extent. Overall it was very impressive to see a film that can't really be compared to anything I have ever seen. Sure, the story is not the most original but in this case it's more about how it is told. <br/><br/>The triangle Portman-Cassel-Kunis works just perfectly - carrying this film with all its beauty and horror. <br/><br/>If you trace back the history of Darren Aronofsky's films this one definitely marks a milestone. It is the combination of elements he was experimenting with in the past - and now put together to a wonderful intermezzo! I'm impressed!"
"kos-27","7","0","2","27 February 2011"," Solid but predictable expressionistic ballet thriller
","I must say I am not convinced this movie has really earned such an outstanding rating. It is not more than a solid thriller. Here are my reasons: <br/><br/>An outstanding movie must have something unique and original about it - either the plot or the way of execution or the message behind it. This movie has none of the above. The subject (plot) is familiar and seen many times before: obsession and exaggerated ambition combined with a weak personality lead to a tragic outcome. In this version the setting of the movie is embedded in the world of ballet. I liked the ballet scenes and I was especially impressed by the expressionistic dynamics of the beginning (the dream sequence) and the end (the metamorphosis into the black swan). The rest was not more than a thriller with a predictable outcome (no twist, no surprises) smoothly executed and with good acting (as are all American movies). <br/><br/>But...the movie didn't move me. It didn't linger for a long time in my mind...except for Natalie Portman's performance -it was impressive how she turned into a ballet dancer."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","2","27 February 2011"," Tchaikovsky's household-famed ballet music will never be the same
","Establishing scene rarely come with such efficient briskness. The movie opens with a dream sequence upon which the entire movie is pivoted: Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) dancing the lead role in Swan Lake. Waking up, she stretches herself and flexes her toes that spell strength and endurance, the foundation of the exquisite elegance of all the rest of her body above. Ballet this must be.<br/><br/>Like most movies these days, you'll see in Black Swan shadows of other movies (and this is not a criticism). One is ""All about Eve"" (1950), the recurring rivalry for spotlight and centre stage, the young pushing out the old. In the Margo-Eve-Phoebe cycle in ""All about Eve"", the newcomer Phoebe is in the future tense, just a cameo appearance at the conclusion. In ""Black swan"", however, in the Beth-Nina-Lily cycle, newcomer Lily plays a vital role, in more ways than one. In addition to being a real rival, Lily (Mila Kunis) is also Nina's alter-ego, and here we come into ""Fight Club"" (1999) territory. About this I'll say no more, other than this element is key in the devastating conclusion.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, the suspense of whose most likely Oscar crowning will end in less than 24 hours of this writing, portrays Nina in two parallel struggles – the artist's quest for perfection and the sexually repressed girl's psychological turmoil. Here, I use the word parallel not in the mathematical sense they they will never meet. Quite on the contrary, they are closely linked. Nina's technical perfection renders her claim to the role of the White Swan unchallenged. But this is a duo role that must be danced by the same dancer, the other being the evil, seducing Black Swan, for which technique comes only second. The ability to ""loose yourself"" and seduce the entire audience comes before everything, barks artistic director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) in no uncertain terms. He asks Nina ""Are you still a virgin"" and seems slightly relieved when the answer is negative. Yet that is far from being enough. For a starter, he instructs Nina to prepare for the role by ""touching herself"" i.e. masturbation at home. Nina is launched on a path of no return.<br/><br/>I like minimalism in movies which ""Black swan"" certainly is not. I could go to the extreme of describing it as a gory psychological thriller but that would be unfairly demeaning. Nina's psychological journey is certainly nothing less than fiery and it's up to the audience to decide if they like director Darren Aronofsky's style.<br/><br/>In the acting department, there should be little disagreement. Enough has been said about Portman. The casting of Cassel as the arrogant, charismatic artistic director is brilliant. Less talked about but fully deserving recognition is Kunis who perfectly nails the role of the scheming, outgoing new-comer. Winona Ryder's appearance as over-the-hill (tragically still so young) Beth is no more than a cameo but still poignant to watch, not the least because how it reflects the actress's real life. Barbara Hershey also deserves credit for giving life to a usually stereotype role of the possessive mother.<br/><br/>At the time of this writing, ""Black Swan"" has just won the Independent Spirit's cinematography award, and well deserves it. In all other areas, ""Black Swan"" is also a work of distinguished achievement. The culminating climax is befitting and after watching it, Tchaikovsky's household-famed ballet music will never be the same."

"jonathanruano","10","0","2","21 February 2011"," Black Swan (2010) - Review
","Director Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" is easily one of the most intelligent, over the top, uncompromising, riskiest, no hold's bar films made in 2010. This is the kind of film that forces the audience to think about what it sees up front and also about is subtly conveyed in the smaller scenes that infer a much bigger and disturbing picture. The most interesting thing about ""Black Swan"" is ballerina Nina's (who is played brilliant here by Natalie Portman) sudden and rapid transformation as a person (which has been delayed for more than a decade). As she comes closer to owning her own life, she hastens her own terrible destruction. It is incredible to watch. I do not know of any film deals with its same subject quite in the same way as ""Black Swan"" and conveys it with such raw uncompromising power."
"LinJason","9","0","2","20 February 2011"," Stunning piece of art that strives for perfection
","A grand masterpiece of film art by Darren Aronofsky that is highly empowered by visuals and sounds in synergy with a remarkable performance by Natalie Portman as the ballerina who seeks nothing but perfection in her pursuit of performance art. Likely to be disturbing in the second half with relentless boundary crossings between reality and illusions, it is nevertheless one of the best films of 2010.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a more of a fine piece of art rather than film. After all its subject of interest is of ballet and how a ballerina undergoes a dark venture in seek of perfection through severely distorted visuals of reality and illusions. ""Black Swan"" begins with a dream sequence and isn't afraid to continue dreaming for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Aronofsky bravely pursued his dreams as an artistic filmmaker.<br/><br/>Dreams are supposed to be bright and positive, but not in here. ""Black Swan"" starts off with a highly-disciplined Nina who appears to be shiny and pristine and determined to be the Swan Queen, the leading protagonist of the new production Swan Lake. Never did Nina realise how demanding that role will be of her as it requires her to sport double contrasting identities as both the White and Black Swan.<br/><br/>Never will we expect anybody to achieve excellence in two or more fields, it applies here as well. Nina is trying for the almost impossible task of embodying both the Angel and Devil. The only way is to lose her own self and enter darkness.<br/><br/>Perhaps unknowingly, Natalie Portman does similar as Nina in this film and renders a near perfect performance as she has successfully entered the skins of the ballerina. Adding on to the element of conviction, Portman has been reportedly practicing ballet for 10 months prior to the film production in order to improve the feel of grace and competency in the performing art.<br/><br/>Such dedication attracts much admiration.<br/><br/>Darkness ensues in the form of nightmarish sequences that are pieced together by artful visuals captured by Matthew Libatique and dramatic score by Clint Mansell. Aronofsky threatens the audience's emotions by instilling unrest via effectively alternating between reality and illusions through the perspective of Nina as well as the amazing editing by Andrew Weisblum. Together, these grips you tightly without letting go and only to be compensated by the graceful ballet moves.<br/><br/>At some point, you're almost inside Nina's realm.<br/><br/>The question comes pouring to you upon the end of the credit roll: Is Nina's pursuit of perfection justified by her own passion or just a mere empty destination that she is coerced by those around her into reaching? You might like to take a step back and relate this to the current capitalist society of elitism, where everyone strives to be atop of others. Corporate ladders, Dean's lists, Power struggle, these are some of the tragedies that witness several resorting to everything in order to continue their ascend.<br/><br/>This is further probed by the egoistic Thomas who never cease to push his ballerinas to extremes in order to attain results, where his ego seems to have outweighed his passion for ballet (if any). He could very well just be building a platform to sleep with them, as suggested briefly in the film. Likewise, Lily is possibly an innocent nemesis that is self-generated by Nina's heightened fear of losing at her game.<br/><br/>The higher you climb, the more edgy you become of others in paranoia.<br/><br/>No matter how you see it, it is undeniable that Aronofsky is one of the greatest filmmaking artist in the industry and has produced yet another stunning piece of art that has pushed fellow cast and crew into striving for perfection. (The Singapore big screen release version is passed with cuts, a move that deems to dilute the film's endeavour of perfection pursuit.) As remarkably flawless it may appear to be, it is nevertheless a tad bit short of perfection.<br/><br/>For future improvement can only be possible with imperfection."
"firemetalrat","7","0","2","19 February 2011"," Interestng psycho-sexual vignette
","Natalie Portman is a beautiful actress playing her diva ballerina part sufficiently enough to keep me interested in her role. The film revolves around her character and she is more than adequate to carry this dark portrait of a striving artist who seems to finally achieve the the perfect orgasm.<br/><br/>Because I am about the 626 person to write a ""review"" of the movie on IMDb, and because this film has a plot that exists as a contrivance to study a character, there is no point in describing the plot. In fact, the plot itself is the ballet Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Swan Lake is a young woman's fantasy and fear of passing from innocence to womanhood. Black Swan applies these themes to stardom, whether that stardom is the New York ballet or Hollywood, that results in to the Black Swan of diva-hood. So this could be seen as a coming of age movie in the limelight. Natalie Portman must know what that is like. This movie could be about her.<br/><br/>The character is raised by a mother who is a failed Ballerina and is the typical parent who is attempting to relieve her life through her daughter and is slightly resentful about it. There is no father to be seen or heard from, so the character is alone and stressed and sexually repressed. There are questions as to whether she is a virgin or not. The lesbian scene suggests that she is because she demonstrates sexual confusion. Basically, she has not had many dates. She is now turning towards mild forms of masochism because she is sexually frustrated. Most notable are the scratches on the back of her right shoulder, that may be the result of her clawing at herself as she masturbates to heighten her orgasm. So the movie, to be simplistic, is about the difference between a white swan and a black swan; the black swan knows where to find her g-spot.<br/><br/>Overall, the film moved along through quick surrealistic scenes that barely grazed deeper themes that could be explored more in future films. I would by no means call it a masterpiece. There was simply no exploration of broader themes. I like Degas and Natalie Portman, so the film carried me through to its logical conclusion. I did not think it suspenseful or horrifying or all that dark."
"polos_are_minty","8","0","2","18 February 2011"," Career Best Performance from Portman
","A lot has been made of Natalie Portmans performance in Black Swan and rightly so. To put it simply, she is spectacular. Having seen her in many other films and thought her average in those, I was surprised at how well she performs in this. The amazing thing is that this is the same person who played Queen Amidala in Star Wars. She is completely unrecognisable.<br/><br/>I think a lot has to be said for the Director, he has clearly managed to connect with Portman on a level which George Lucas was never able to. Aronofsky masterfully uses intrusive shots and clever camera work which seem to go hand in hand with Portman's delicate portrayal of Nina. <br/><br/>The premise is simple, young female Ballet Dancer lands role of Swan Queen in a production of Swan Lake. As soon as we reach the scene where Nina confronts the choreographer and asks him for the lead role, we know where the story is going. The film can only end one way from this point onwards but I don't think that damages it. The fact that it is a typical Psycho Drama in which the lead descends into insanity is not what is great about this film, as anyone could tell a story as simple as that. What's great about Black Swan is how the story is told. <br/><br/>Performance wise and Direction wise I think the film has everything. I especially enjoyed the way the dancing scenes where shot, with the Camera moving with Portman as she danced. I also adored the scenes showing Nina getting ready to dance. There is something very compelling about watching preparation on screen and the scenes with Nina's Ballet shoes are no exception.<br/><br/>All in all a High class, adrenaline filled thriller, with some magnificent performances and brilliant direction.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Well what can I say, this movie is in my top ten favorites of all time. This movie had it all, from a set of good actors, good music, good visual effects and a good soundtrack. This movie is like no other, not many movies can you watch and actually feel what the protagonist is feeling. The sexual/horror aspect of the movie left me astonished and when i was watching the movie one thought ran trough my mind, ""I can not believe what these actors have to do to make their roles much more believable."" From what I have heard some of the actresses (Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis) were injured during the making of this film and even with the injuries they continued with their roles instead of giving up.Especially with many of the scenes, some of the actors had to break away from their comfort zone to be able to follow trough some of the more intense scenes.To summarize everything this is a movie that deserves much of the awards which it has been nominated for not only for the talent but because it is not a movie that follows the same plot as many other movies. It is not just another movie with a repetitive plot but a film with a unique storyline. That is why I believe this movie is great to watch."

Also, kudos to Darren Aronofsky for his wonderful direction which apparently led the movie to such a big height! <br/><br/>Nina, (Natalie Portman) plays a ballet dancer who is highly obsessed by the play Swan Lake. She is counted perfect for the role of White Swan - Princess Odette in the story however she faces a competition from Lily, (Mila Kunis) another Ballet dancer who was perfect for the role of Black swan.<br/><br/>Leroy (Vincent Cassel) is the director of the play Swan Lake who chooses Nina for the lead although he's unconvinced with her Black swan Dance. He sets his eyes on Lily for the same which worries Nina as she was desperate for the lead.<br/><br/>Nina's mother on the other hand keeps on pestering her and holds a strange control over her every activity. She is smothered at home however she can't do anything about it. Nina is so desperate for the role that, in an attempt to grab the role she starts impersonating her dark side the Black swan and becomes obsessed with the character.<br/><br/>The flick is no doubt an Oscar material and a perfect watch for those who are sane enough to understand the intricacies of a human brain. I'd recommend people to go for it. Natalie deserves an academy for this one."

Overall i feel the film was great and hoping for a sequel that has a less racist title e.g. Mixed colour swan as i thought the directors went a bit OTT on the title, a must watch for all Portman lovers and a decent storyline though complicated. The film is similar to 'holy grail' series and if you like that then watch this film. Wouldn't recommend it to people who have had Swan traumas, but a GREAT film."
"locovel","8","0","1","15 February 2011"," The use of the word cliché is becoming a cliché
","This is more of a review of the reviews I have read about Black Swan on IMDb. <br/><br/>A cliché is often a vivid depiction of an abstraction that relies upon analogy or exaggeration for effect. One could simply say this whole movie was based on this and then say this about any exaggerated or simple story. Black Swan was a cliché: a very pretty and disturbing one.<br/><br/>I've read a lot of comments that have compared this movie to pornography. There were no scenes of genitalia, erections, penetration or vulgar dialogue and delivery boys. The sex scene between Portman and Kunis was about a minute and was gratuitous (is gratuity a negative thing??) and could have been longer which would have even more gratified my unnecessary and clichéd sense of entertainment. It wasn't unnecessary. Nina's lack of sexual experience and fragile idealism is contradicted by the sexual aggressiveness and perceived debauchery of her mentors and peers and as a result she tries to expand her experiences as much as she can handle. This, in combination with her own ideals and destructive tendencies, leads to her deterioration.<br/><br/>Tchaikovsky wasn't downplayed in this movie. He's dead so anyone that would spend the time to arrange his music, by definition, elevates him or more specifically, his music. I'm educated in music, not in dance but I'll assume the same comment regarding this movie degrading ballet. If you want to uphold the integrity of classical music and ballet then support your local classical and dance ensembles. This isn't a documentary so it is absolutely ridiculous for people to have disdain because the movie didn't show respect towards other forms of entertainment.<br/><br/>I now wish she would have actually turned into a Black Swan at the end and really upset viewers who already hated this movie."
"paudie","8","0","2","14 February 2011"," A front row seat for a descent into madness
","Darren Aronofsky uses the story of an emotionally fragile ballerina who is chosen to play the lead in ""Swan Lake"" to take us on a gut-wrenching journey through a mind losing touch with reality.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Nina, a talented but shy ballerina. She lives at home with her slightly creepy mother (Barbara Hershey), who treats her like a child. The ballet director chooses Nina to play the lead in the ""Swan Lake"". He says she is perfect for the virginal ""White Swan"" character but pushes her to convince him that she can play the wicked ""Black Swan"", a part always played by the same ballerina. We see Nina struggling with her inner demons as she is forced to confront the sensual elements of her characters. she is playing and herself. It is clear that she is uncomfortable with her own sexuality.<br/><br/>As the film goes on the images become more intense and shocking, until the final act, which leaves the viewers head spinning. No surprise there, given Aronofsky's previous movies then! Along the way he teases us with plenty of hints as to possible reasons for Nina's emotional immaturity.<br/><br/>Overall I was slightly disappointed in the film. I felt that the director's main aim was to shock us and the narrative suffered slightly as a result. However Natalie Portman is outstanding as the fragile Nina. She is on screen practically all the time (sometimes more than once at the same time!) and brilliantly conveys the conflict between Nina's desire to be the best ballerina possible and the baggage of her upbringing"
"harishprakashhp","8","0","2","13 February 2011"," Why Natalie Portman might win the Oscar
","Have you heard of the 'Black Swan Theory'?! Coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, it refers to any unexpected or unpredictable event. Why so?! Everyone thought swans were supposed to be white until they saw the black one. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is a true 'black swan' and Natalie Portman as Nina is his 'perfect' swan. <br/><br/>Nina, a dedicated ballerina, gets the role she always dreamed for. She gets selected to play the title cast of the twins in 'Swan Lake' much to the dismay of the one she replaces. She essays the role of the 'White Swan' twin character with ease, but the 'Black Swan' character pushes her beyond limits. <br/><br/>Leroy, the director of the ballet, is doubtful about Nina's portrayal of the evil swan that robs away the white swan's prince and causes its death in the end. ""The truth is when I look at you all I see is the white swan. Yes you're beautiful, fearful, and fragile. Ideal casting. But the black swan? It's a hard f******* job to dance both,"" he says to her. Roy has a soft spot for Nina, which is why we see him both passionately seducing her like a 'Prince' and sternly pushing her towards the brinks to get the best out of her. <br/><br/>In the midst of the preparation for the role, we see Nina undergo many transformations. Aronofsky ensures the audience journey across her myriad emotions of guilt, pleasure and pain. So much so, the forced vicariousness feels both horrific and pleasurable at the same time. The role takes a toll of her thoughts too. She suspects Lily (her colleague) wanting to replace her. Lily's talent and carefree nature becomes quite a bother. She mirrors what Nina deepest desire carves. She reflects her weakness- her inability to transform into the 'black swan'. Symbolically, she always wears 'Black', in contract to Nina's white attire. Lily being declared Nina alternative to the roles just before the opening of 'Swan Lake' breaks her down. <br/><br/>The numerous bleeding motifs seem to signify Nina's transformation. She seems to have a bleeding on her back caused by repeated scratching. This causes her mother (also a yesteryear ballet dancer) to worry about her. Nina finds her attention unwarranted. She feels it is about time her mother let go of her. <br/><br/>Strangely, Nina's life starts mirroring the life of the 'Swans'-their joys, their desires and the pain. The pain and the guilt motivate her translation. Her performance on the opening night as both the betraying 'Black Swan'and the suffering 'White Swan' is simply magical and a fitting finale. <br/><br/>The protagonist is a caricature of both our nicety and the shades of grey humanness epitomizes. She strives for perfection, but perfection isn't enough. Acquaintance with her darker side and desires inspires her to perform at costs unimaginable. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman is strikingly beautiful. She is the perfect 'sweet girl'. Her ballet talent is absolutely fabulous and so well utilized by Aronofsky. She is a true intellectual artiste. What probably might have helped her prepare for this difficult role must be the Psychologist degree from Harvard. <br/><br/>Mila Kunis as Lily and Vincent Cassel as Roy are 'Idea casting'. So is Babara Hershey, who plays Nina's mother. The music is so in sync with the moods of the characters making the whole movie appear like a sort of ballet. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has one more master piece to his credit. His signature shaking and wobbling camera has its desired disastrous effects. The movie is very similar to 'The Wrestler' but in a very artistic way. Both showcase the performing artiste's stark lives. I sincerely hoped, Mickey Rourke in the title role as 'The Wrestler' should have won the Oscar for the Best Actor in 2008. He didn't. I sure hope Natalie Portman gets it for the Best Actress. She deserves it. Amen. PS. Annette Bening (The Kid's are all right) and Nicole Kidman (Rabbit Hole) are close Oscar competitors, but well, Natalie as Nina will see them through."

","""He picked me, mommy. I am the new swan queen!"". With these childish words, Nina (Natalie Portman) announces to her mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) that she got the main part of Swan Lake and was chosen the new prima ballerina of the company after star Beth (Winona Ryder) is forced to retire, giving space for fresh talent.<br/><br/>After Pi (1998), Requiem for a Dream (2000) and the Wrestler (2008), Darren Aronofsky's undeniably talent is shown again in Black Swan (2010). The incorporation of music in unexpected moments (courtesy of Clint Mansell), the sound of dance steps that the audience doesn't really hear, the anxious camera and Nina's heavy breathing set the tone for her journey into despair. But the plot sometimes disappoints the viewer.<br/><br/>In 4 years of dancing, as we learn, Nina was always too pristine and goody two-shoes in her ballet practice and relationship with her mother. She whispers instead of talking, lives in a pink room full of stuffed animals and wears girlish light coloured clothes and small earrings taken off by her mother before she goes to bed. She is insecure and carries herself with a self-conscious, sad image and is always leaky eyed, somehow like Lea Michelle playing Rachel in Glee. She is too unconvincing to play Odile, the Black Swan. Somebody like that, perfect only for the part of Princess Odette, the White Swan, would never win the lead for Swan Lake in a high powered NYC ballet troupe.<br/><br/>Lily (Mila Kunis), on the other hand is the mysterious girl that wears black, has a gigantic tattoo, wears her hair down, smokes, drinks, takes drugs, doesn't show up on time for the rehearsals and does need to warm up. Really? That is not what ballet demands. And she is still chosen as Nina's alternate? Was she really such a rebel or was Nina imagining her behaviour as something she wanted to have: a loose, sensual side. Either way, forget the Mila Kunis that played That 70's Show and dubs Meg on the controversial cartoon Family Guy. She is pretty convincing as the two-faced girl that is trying to backstab Nina.<br/><br/>That obviously is nothing like the clash between Bette Davis and Anne Baxter we watched in the classic movie All About Eve (1950). Still, Natalie performs with such agony that you just know something bad is gonna happen to that poor girl. Nina's desperation for perfection makes her paranoid. In the subway, she sees herself in the reflection of the door and her face is as dark as her soul. Her fight is against the fact that everyone still thinks of her as an immature, ""frigid"" little girl. The scene everyone was talking about, when she transforms into the black Swan, has more merit from Portman than CGI. Her body language changes completely and her eyes get a deep and intense look. It is the death of innocence.<br/><br/>But Nina doesn't exactly transforms during the story. She is already anguished, broken and disturbed. Nina is bulimic, sexually repressed, hurts herself and we discover that she has a little bit of a kleptomaniac inside of her, when she steals Beth's belongings. By the way, it was very amusing to watch a shocked Winona Ryder, quite a few years after she got caught shoplifting, saying ""you stole my things?"".<br/><br/>Even thought Portman could carry the character very well, who steals the scenes are Vicent Cassel and Barbara Hershey. The movie is definitely worth its supporting roles. He plays the womanizer director Thomas Leroy and the scene when he seduces Nina on stage reminded me of John Malkovich as the charming Sébastien in Dangerous Liaisons (1988). Barbara Hershey reminded me a little bit of Margaret White the disturbed mother of Carrie (1976) with her controlling and suffocating behavior.<br/><br/>All in all, it is very entertaining to watch Nina's struggle for perfection against a tormented nature trapped in an infantile mind. The movie is a trip into the uneasy world of jealousy and pressure that goes on in the backstage of a theater and the fact that some of us are not fit for that. It is about the death of a sweet girl that obsesses in the passion of her work. The dark atmosphere is impeccably constructed. Thumbs up.<br/><br/>http://whatsupwithtat.wordpress.com/"

","Director Darren Aronofsky follows up his previous hit The Wrestler (2008) with another portrait of a troubled individual consumed by their taxing vocation – in this case ballet – that has also stirred and bedazzled the movie going public upon and well after its release, though of course Black Swan should be thought of as an entirely separate creation. It tells the story of sweet young Nina, a fiercely dedicated dancer who is determined to attain and successfully execute the lead part in her company's production of the well-known Swan Lake. It is a dual role, involving the characters of both the pure, kind-hearted White Swan as well as her vindictive, seductive twin the Black Swan. The former is for her a perfect fit, her being perfectly apt to do the steps correctly and having a natural innocence to give the right feeling to her dancing, but in attempts to embody the story's mischievous antagonists she always comes across as rigid. After quite a messy kafuffle, the eccentric lead choreographer ends up giving her the part despite her difficulty with the latter aspect, as he is convinced that some way may be found to awaken her darker side.<br/><br/>The plot, and indeed the general premise of ballet, do suggest that the film is a simple low-key drama appealing to a mostly female audience, but it is of course more prominently a fearlessly brutal psychological thriller, the intensity and enthrallment of which must be experienced to be believed. However, its aspects horror are, in summary, the details of Nina's turbulent transformation into the Black Swan character. This subject is, while of course very confronting, still quite strictly for the purposes of the show, and depicted always from her point of view, and only to the very closed-minded and hypersensitive will it seem distant and foreign as they are watching it unfold. This feat of Aranofsky's is remarkable, and made all the more effective by a wondrous performance from Natalie Portman in the main role. Her acting achievements are equalled by her beautiful co-star Mila Kunis, who is most spine-chilling and compelling as the fellow ballerina that Nina subconsciously transforms mentally into a neat little embodiment of whatever she needs to acquire or conquer to obtain her goal. Recognition is also deserved of the three other most important members of the cast: Vincent Cassel who does a fine job as Thomas Leroy,the choreographer; Barbara Hershey who plays Nina's mother, a typical matriarch who shares a Principal-Skinner-like relationship with her daughter; and finally Winona Ryder with her very raunchy turn as a miserable retired ballerina past her heyday, who used to be Leroy's ""little princess"".<br/><br/>I implore readers to ignore the overreacting cowards who say this film is artlessly disgusting, and rush to enjoy this extraordinary convergence of horror and character drama."

","In just a few short films Darren Aronofsky has risen to the top of his game as a director to watch. After 'Pi' he woke everyone up with the amazingly twisted 'Requiem for a Dream', minor blipped with the ambitious but mental 'Fountain' and returned to form with 'The Wrestler' garnering praise and awards for its star Rourke and the director himself. Now he returns with the companion piece to this in the form of 'Black Swan' a film set in the cutthroat world of professional ballet and like its predecessor it is sure to gain even more praise for Aronofsky and lead Portman. This film is simply stunning, from the attention to detail to the acting, the choreography to the claustrophobic camera work the film grabs you and pulls you into the world that's been created around this performance of 'Swan Lake'. I am not a ballet fan but I found myself on the edge of my seat as the passion, rivalry and madness fuel the ever decreasing spiral to the films conclusion. Every performance adds to the tense, uneasy feel that is superbly juxtaposed with the grace and grandeur of the ballet pieces, from Kunis as Portman's rival dancer to Barbara Hershey as her overbearing and slightly disturbing mother, each fractured piece adds up to make the beautiful whole. But this being Aronofsky you know you don't get off lightly and every deep dark aspect of this world is explored in all its g(l)ory. I don't want to give too much away but if you like gritty realism, gripping drama and stunning cinematography then you should see this film, definitely one of my films of next year already, a masterstroke in filmmaking."

","I viewed Black Swan with women only, all of whom did not like it. They found it offensive, disturbing and not as good as they had hoped. Many critics on IMDb have already found the flaws in the film so I shall not repeat. Portman is a little one dimensional. She is so uptight as the actress never mind her character. I found Nina Sayers irritating and could not sympathize with her. Winona Ryder should have had more screen time as the role of Beth was perfect for her. There is so much which is implausible about the film that the good bits such as art direction, music and atmosphere are somewhat lost. I really wanted to like this film as from the trailers I inferred that it would be top notch - not so. Rather disappointing as I felt something was truly missing and it never jumped out at me. The bad script did not help, it was more than bad it was appalling. Was it horror? Was it thriller? Was it just the story of a repressed girl who was totally unsuitable to be a ballerina? Come the Oscars, I think Jennifer Lawrence from Winter's Bone would be a worthier winner. Portman is a fine actress but was unable to quite deliver in the role; simply put she was too uptight. Judging by so many other negative reviews the film has not lived up to its hyperbole."

In all of its creepy crazy goodness I found myself pleasantly lost in this movie, gripping my girlfriend's hand like a little teenage girl grips that of her boyfriend's during a cheesy Saw movie.<br/><br/>To say this movie was anything short of phenomenal is a gross understatement. There is a reason it is nominated with 13 Oscars, and I guarantee it will win at least half that for a reason.

I'll probably never watch it again because it took so much out of me, and is not much of a re watchable movie unless you're really sick in the head, but everyone has to watch this movie once.

"ocacia","6","0","3","4 February 2011"," Beware of Ballet
","I will not be sending my daughter to ballet lessons anytime soon, that is for sure. Anyone watching this film as promotion of ballet will be shocked. I was in the cinema with a bunch of upcoming ballerinas. The lesbian scene had a mother and her daughter heading for the door. I do think the scene was excessive and un-artful and thus only there for sensationalism and controversy (an no serious film lover respects cheap tricks). Was It a good film depends on if we judge it by its period. Now after hunger for something to feed my desire for quality Hollywood cinema this film at least hits some marks. I struggled with ""the American"" (it tried and didn't hit the mark as it should have). A good comment was made which said ""As for Portman, she will win the Oscar for ""Black Swan,"" however, she should have won it for ""Closer."" it saves time to just quote the better reviewers. The other user says and I agree: Most of the film she played Nina as the Naive, frustrated woman the role required. However, where was the redemptive aggression of the Black Swan? That would have been an action challenge! It was reduced to a few scenes at the end. Wasn't that the whole point of the film? It felt like, ""OK, we're almost out of money so let's wrap this up."" And don't try to label the movie sophisticated or artsy. Please!!!! "" No it isn't an art house film, it is a Hollywood film with an art house marketing dress. <br/><br/>Now I didn't like the DP work, I guess I expected stunning stable cinematography which was mirror the delicate world of ballet. I didn't expect gritty and shaky. Without that expectation maybe it would have worked. <br/><br/>Now here is the main flaw. As stated above there was a failure to make the case for the Black Swan dual personality. It seemed to show up at the end in a rush. It is subjective but I think there was a failure on the part of the director. I honestly think someone else could have done a much better job with the screenplay. Something is missing in his tool box. I saw the same missing element in Requiem. (a good concept with poor application making it unpleasant to watch as a film, or maybe it was just very bad editing)or maybe it was suppose to be a music video.<br/><br/>It is not fair to say but I found Ms Portmans weight distracting (personal opinion) she was so skinny it drew my focus. Her voice has never been a winner, you just don't associate those kind of voices with A-rate actors. Rese being another one along with Melanie Griffith . I think the only Funny voice actress who holds it down and is taken serious is Holly Hunter.<br/><br/>The real reason I enjoyed it is because the world of modern cinema is so predictable and boring that this film gives a little joy. So not a perfect execution but a good attempt. I would buy the DVD as it is a valid contribution for any collection. And you will not have to put it in backwards to hide the title from your friends out of shame."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","2","4 February 2011"," Career best for Portman
","""Swan Lake"" has been my favourite ballet since I saw the famed Margot Fonteyn perform the lead role in my first visit to this art form. Natalie Portman has been a favourite actress since her precocious performance as a 12 year old in ""Leon"" led on - via ""Star Wars"" - to such accomplished work as ""Closer"" and ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". I can't say that Darren Aronofsky is a favourite director since, while he is genuinely talented and I admired ""The Wrestler"", I found ""Requiem For A Dream"" really disturbing and ""The Fountain"" unwatchable.<br/><br/>So I approached ""Black Swan"" with both real excitement and some trepidation. This psycho-drama, which is reminiscent of both ""Repulsion"" and ""The Red Shoes"" and has many parallels with the body-punishing depiction of ""The Wrestler"", will not appeal to everyone and some will regard it as over the top, but I admired it enormously. Aronofsky ensures that the camera is never still and every scene is claustrophobic physically and/or psychologically.<br/><br/>But it is 29 year old Portman who is simply outstanding in her best performance to date as ballet dancer Nina Sayers who has to conquer the demanding twin roles of the White Swan/Odette and the Black Swan/Odile. The role seems made for Portman who is hardly ever off the screen, since she was a dancer as a child and has a degree in psychology. She prepared physically for a year and the choreographer is now her partner Benjamin Millepied.<br/><br/>Supporting roles come from Barbara Hershey as Nina's overbearing mother and Vincent Cassel as the intimidating ballet director and from Mila Kunis and Winona Ryder as up-and-coming and past-her-best ballet dancers respectively - all of whom appear to represent threats to the increasingly paranoid Nina. In the final segment as the eponymous dark bird, Portman looks terrific and her acting achieves new heights, while - as in ""The Wrestler"" - Aranofsky ends the film on exactly the right shot"

"Likes_Ninjas90","8","0","1","31 January 2011"," The performances, along with Aronofsky's artistic merits, inspire a cleverly told thriller that is equally smart and sensual
","A ballet company is preparing to perform a new version of the opera Swan Lake. It is to be headed by a younger cast as one of the more experienced dancers, Beth (Winona Ryder), has been forced to retire. Auditioning for the role as both the black and the white swan is timid dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). Her notorious instructor Thomas (Vincent Cassel) doesn't feel she is right for both parts of the swan though. He believes she is fine as the white swan but stresses that she must lose herself in the darker alter ego. Adding to Nina's pressure is the arrival of her understudy Lily (Mila Kunis), who she fears is trying to take both her role and the affection of Thomas too. She is also distraught by the controlling nature of overbearing mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), who used to be a dancer herself. As her mind slips into paranoia, Nina's behaviour and sexuality becomes increasingly erratic and she starts to believe that the black swan, whoever it is, could be real. <br/><br/>Working largely as an independent auteur, Darren Aronofsky has been able to show his interest in the physical deterioration of both the mind and body. With his most restrained effort The Wrestler, he visualised this breakdown with a gritty and realistic surface. Black Swan, a horror appropriation of the opera Swan Lake, finds an appropriate middle ground between gritty realism and more absurdist cinema. After a dazzling opening dream sequence there's a rather cold feeling to the film though. Its damp, grey colour palette, claustrophobic corridors and coy protagonist are initially distancing forces. But as Aronofsky's metanarrative become more visible, the film draws us deeper into a mesmerising and suspenseful labyrinth. The feeling of dread is almost unwatchable and the film climaxes with an ironic ending of Shakespearean proportions. <br/><br/>For the ending to achieve this dramatic power, Aronofsky has the difficult task of drawing the audience into the headspace of Nina. He accomplishes this most skilfully through the film's subtle art design. Much of the film is beautifully painted with black and white shades to visualise the consuming power of Nina's work. The hauntingly muted visuals are contrasted with the brighter tones of Nina's bedroom, like her pink walls and stuffed animals, suggesting a gradually fading innocence. Selective tracking shots of the back of Nina's also suggest the film's deliberate subjectivity. Aronofsky limits scenes strictly to Nina's perspective so that the audience shares her paranoia. The morning after a wild night provides a deeply affecting scene that disorientates our sense of time and manipulates our presumptions. Tension is further built through the specificity of images, like the trimming of Nina's nails or the reoccurring rash on her back. Only Aronofsky's scarce reliance on more jumpy horror scares feel more conventional than the rest of the picture. <br/><br/>To further develop the notions of paranoia and control, Aronofsky draws career best performances from his ensemble cast. Portman is the dominant centrepiece here, working to subvert her usually sweet image as the physically and emotionally damaged Nina. She spent an entire year training and controlling her weight to transform herself into a highly credible ballerina. She allows Nina to move exhaustingly between a child-like innocence and into deep feelings of internal and external repression. It's an emotionally intense and challenging performance, set to be a defining step in her career. Contrasting the hysteria is the edgy but calm Kunis who amidst the chaos manages to be effortlessly cool. Her normality really adds to the film's irony and I suspect that on a second viewing the subtly of her performance would be even more apparent. This is a huge improvement from her work in Max Payne a few years ago. Hershey is wonderfully creepy as the fallen star too, another powerful force that looks to control Nina's life. These performances, along with Aronofsky's artistic merits, inspire a cleverly told thriller that is equally smart and sensual."
"eatfirst","9","0","2","31 January 2011"," An intense, exhausting, brilliant, full-on, operatic, psychological horror
","Black Swan is not really a ballet movie.<br/><br/>Nina (Natalie Portman) is a young dancer in a prestigious ballet company, obsessed, as artists often are, with the perfection of her craft, and seemingly also driven by that age-old dramatic staple, the overbearing and overprotective mother. When she is promoted to Prima and has to take on the dual role of darkness and innocence at the heart of Swan Lake, she is pushed by the egotistical and possibly predatory director (played by Vincent Cassel) into exploring a darker, more sexual, more aggressive side of her nature.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has made films about brilliant obsessive types, reaching for perfection and being driven to the point of madness in the past. His latest shares a lot in common with his stunning low-budget debut ""Pi"". Black Swan may have the big money and a star at its centre, but Aronofsky has lost not a jot of his obsessive intensity.<br/><br/>No movie about ballet, with a melodramatic plot centred around a fragile girl pushed to her limits can avoid comparisons with the legendary ne plus ultra of this micro sub-species, ""The Red Shoes"". However, while they share a common subject, stylistically this is a very different and altogether scarier proposition. Channelling the arch Gothic thrill of Brian DePalma's Carrie, and a whole bunch of Dario Argento 1970s giallo chillers, along with the reality blurring bodily distortions of Cronenberg movies such as The Fly and Dead Ringers, Black Swan gradually builds to a fevered dream of madness and terror and doesn't let up till the credits roll.<br/><br/>So far, so unexpectedly, but entertainingly genre. But unlike many of its forbears, Aronofsky's picture is executed with exceptional art and precision. Close-up hand-held shooting keeping the frame tight in on every player, stripping away the artifice and closing in on the bone- crunching physical intensity of the ballet performances, or prowling the grimy backstage corridors, seeking out every darkened corner or artfully fractured mirror. There are fine performances from Cassel and particularly Barbara Hershey, as Nina's failed dancer mother, in a role that could easily have been grating and false. But at the heart of it all, and the making of the whole enterprise, is a heroically controlled performance from Natalie Portman, easily a career best. She runs the gamut of emotional states in a role which requires pushing them all to the extremes and yet she never hits a false note. Raw, honest, and totally empathetic, it's a miraculous achievement.<br/><br/>An intense, exhausting, brilliant, full-on, operatic, psychological horror. Black Swan is all these things; it's just not really a ballet movie."

"joachimokeefe","7","0","1","30 January 2011"," Intense, frothy melodrama saved from pretension by tight direction
","My hat goes off to Natalie Portman for what was the most convincing and obviously committed portrayal of a professional ballerina and her inner life I've seen. Not that I know any professional ballerinas, but the best thing about Black Swan is that in spite of straying very close to the line where tortured artists look ridiculous on screen, it doesn't let up the cinematic feast for a minute, and so your disbelief is maintained. Reminiscent in a way of the Vincent van Gogh biopic Lust for Life, which on paper is as corny as heck, but still manages to convey his tragedy and inform everybody's (who's not an art historian) perception of that painter. Black Swan will inform everybody's perception of prima ballerinas for a long time. The Red Shoes trod similar ground (play on words intended), but far less accessibly than this. Black Swan works as a melodrama - meaning a drama where the characters are unexamined and stereotypical - because it is constantly exciting to look at, and the Steadicam work is reasonably restrained so those of us used to Jean Renoir films don't get nauseous. Nina's story seems to be an allegory of a woman discovering her own physical sexuality (I don't know if IMDb accepts the V word), and this aspect of the film is mercifully not overplayed, because then it would certainly be pretentious. Black Swan's sheer style manages to keep it enjoyable as a cinematic spectacle; it will not transfer well to DVD because the characters and story are pretty much out of the 'Fame' script vault.<br/><br/>Let me pick at it now: everyone in the cinema laughed when Nina dragged the body across the floor - I think it was the tutu that did it. <br/><br/>'My new production of Swan Lake', says Thomas. I know the film wasn't about the production itself, but Thomas' production looked pretty goldarned pedestrian to me. <br/><br/>The mother's teeth? Those will haunt me longer than Natalie Portman's arm-waving, I have to say. Don't take it too seriously, don't laugh out loud and let your girl/gayfriend wallow in what might have been. I just wish French and Saunders, the UK comedy duo, were still around to give us their take."

","This is a berserk combo of Polanski's Repulsion and The Red Shoes, with a dash of All About Eve thrown in. Aronofski is one of the greatest available hacks working today in movies. Having once seen his feature-length fortune cookie, the New Aged The Fountain, one entertains the certainty that this director will never give a truly heartfelt film, but will twist everything into false spirituality, unless one buys such spiritual obfuscation. <br/><br/>The camera work is superlative. It's the best thing in the film, surpassing even Nathalie Portman who is excellent and dubious, given such a defaming concoction concerning ballerinas. And I say that because once the instructor of the company appears early in the film, this has a jarring effect on matters of true class and virtuoso muddle; or later, another teacher who shows her how to make her hands fluctuate displays a magnificent back (we do not see her face), but the director opts for the grim choice of making it rhyme with Portman's itching back. These two appearances are the only anchoring moments for the script's absurd choices, at least as long as the action takes place in a corps and is not just a pretext of a frame. <br/><br/>I will pass the lesbian scene which levels wildly things down and exposes the mix and match approach.<br/><br/>Even the black and white design after a while passed from grim to tiresome to finally naive."
"neil-476","7","0","2","27 January 2011"," Well made and acted, but unsympathetic
","I try to avoid preconceptions when I go into movies, but this was difficult with Black Swan as it started with three strikes against it. One, it is set in the world of ballet which is, conspicuously, not one of my areas of interest (and not from a position of ignorance either: perhaps I would like it better if there were more explosions or spaceships). Two, notwithstanding her undoubted talent, Natalie Portman's presence in a film doesn't particularly attract me to that film. And three, my experience of Darren Arnofsky comprises The Wrestler (good acting but squalid and dispiriting) and The Fountain (pretentious and incomprehensible drivel).<br/><br/>On the other hand, reviews appear to be universally strongly positive and, if I must see a ballet-based movie, Swan Lake has to be favourites because ole Pete came up with some top notch tunes for it (less frivolously, it has one of the most intensely emotional scores ever written for anything).<br/><br/>To be frank, Black Swan wasn't really my sort of movie. There is an awful lot of ballet in it, even though it isn't actually about ballet. It is just set in the world of ballet, but it is actually about the obsession, repression and eventual breakdown of central character Nina (Portman). As well as the lengthy dance sequences (beautifully photographed, throughout the film, and clear evidence that Portman is a talented dancer), there is also a bullying choreographer / director (Vincent Cassel), an ambiguous and sexy would-be friend (Mila Kunis), and a showbiz Mom (played in a kind of fluffy grand guignol way by Barbara Hershey).<br/><br/>On the plus side, the dancing is well presented, the film is always gripping, and Portman's performance (including the dancing) is extremely good.<br/><br/>Less positively, it isn't aways easy to understand what has (or hasn't) happened, especially towards the end (which may be deliberate, and it may not matter), and I found Nina such an unsympathetic character that I didn't really care what happened to her. So, although the film is undoubtedly well crafted and extremely well acted, I didn't actually enjoy it that much, and I shan't be rushing out to join the queue for Aronofsky's next movie."

I have always found Natalie Portman to be a fine actress and her (wooden) performances in the Star Wars trilogy can only be down to George Lucas' direction. She is in fine form in the Black Swan and plays a starlet who is seeking the lead part in Swan Lake. Whilst she has no problems playing the white swan the black swan poses more of a problem.<br/><br/>It seems Portman is a shoe in for the Best Actress award at the Oscars. She is well supported by the cast which includes Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey. The film isn't for the feint hearted and is very challenging. The first hour of the film is OK, but the last 30 minutes are brilliant!"
"aamirshafiq","2","0","2","25 January 2011"," Lacks tension, grit, emotionless and well... just too pat.
","I am so glad other people agree that this film, no, movie was so poor. Awful empty emotions, where was the dramatic tension?? The grit that this movie required. I saw the images but where were the emotions that were supposed to go with with them. All looks and no substance. Take away the superficial bloody scenes finger skin ripping, stabbing in the face etc, its rather clumsy and crammed to be horror, psychological thriller, drive-ambition, neurotic. All of a sudden her legs break in to a swan shape and she actually starts to become a swan. The movie becomes a farce. <br/><br/>The character doesn't have time to breath. To mentally break down slowly. A little by little. This really could have been a great film but...it's just pretty.<br/><br/>The ending wasn't satisfying, yeah she transformed, yeah she danced the black swan really well, yeah she kissed the guy..OK and. I didn't feel it, I didn't believe it. I wasn't transformed in to her world, I didn't care about her, I wasn't engaged. <br/><br/>Mila Kunis stole the film. She was so watchable.<br/><br/>Oh yeah..hey kids you wanna BE GREAT...then self abuse, use drugs and murder. (As if you guys didn't know that).<br/><br/>Oscar Nomination!! Oh my God how poor the standard in Hollywood is now. Truly satisfying Films are now found in the foreign Oscar nominations section (and have done for some time) these are the ones that stay with you, days weeks after. <br/><br/>Oh mighty Hollywood what has happened to you? Why has TV(Soprano's, Mad Men,The Wire. For the ladies Desperate House Wives, The Good Wife, etc) become the new you? Oh Hollywood when shall I see you rise again? For when you shine, you truly shine, so bright one can't look in to your eyes. They hurt ever so sweetly that they bring tears. The Little Miss Sunshine's and Sideways are all too few."

","What are the lengths one will go to strive for that ultimate goal, that one milestone that may set the course for their future, that one journey into greatness at the cost of their sanity. That is the question that lingers in ""Black Swan"". A hauntingly beautiful fairytale of one's desire for perfection while succumbing to a side of herself that she never thought existed. Dark, disturbing, and at times unsettling, with so much raw emotion that echoes the sentiment that echoes society. There is a light at the end of the tunnel; however uncertain and precarious, but if one is to reach it, it must not towards the unattainable of perfection, but rather to succeed at the best of one's ability and be all the more adorned and perhaps, loved by it all in the end. Black Swan may be a dark and disturbing journey, but it's a journey with heart and soul that beckons with haunting beauty and surreal imagery."
"Cinema_Fan","8","0","3","21 January 2011"," The swansong never stops playing.
","Black Swan not only centres on the concept of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's (1840 - 1893) ballet Swan Lake, but it too revolves around the work and life of its lead ballerina Nina Sayers and the commitment that she has to endure to bring this production to life. Such is the extreme physical and mental preparations for this role that the lead role, as both Odette and Odile, has to convince both audience and herself that she is literally, in all respects, the part, this magical mystical creature, inevitably metamorphosing into a realm of fantasy and horror.<br/><br/>The insurmountable pressure here can only have adverse effects on those not strong willed enough to withstand its all-consuming glory. Black Swan is not just a film about an Old Russian folk's tale nor is it only about the role of its leading lady; this film measures the true understanding and meaning of what is to be the lead in the most prestigious ballet; Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky (The Fountain-2006, The Wrestler-2008) has given us an insight into the mind that is tormented between the two roles of both white and black queens and her struggle to fully understand the line between reality and illusion. It is a parallel of these dual roles and the division of her mind, which must be controlled, as to shine and to remain sane, remain one.<br/><br/>This world of tension and paranoia is beautifully shot and timed to a tee, the claustrophobic, imploding mind's journey here is, too, bittersweet, what with the charming and seductive cinematography it leads itself to a tone and fashion liken to J-horror with a Hitchcock bent, all adding to the flavour of both beauty and bestiality. It is also the films major gift, the stupendous acting of its leading lady Natalie Portman, magnificently delicate and brittle, which personifies her declining into plight and anguish. We see her every contorted expression that feeds her insecurities, fears and anxieties, such a tender fragile spirit on the spiral into the abyss of pure perfection. With perfection, too, comes rejection, and we see a paradox in terms of Ms. Sayers and her inauguration into this highly demanding role and the now retired Swan Queen Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) who shows a mental instability on a different path that leads to her self harming. With or without the role of Swan Queen, she still claims her victims; the swansong is sung and there is no more. It is a perpetual cycle of love and hate, have and have not, life and death, black or white.<br/><br/>This is the major theme of Black Swan, finding ones new inner self and transcending this inner being and the consequences that can lend itself to, it is a topic of, together, self-doubt and self discovery and using the dual roles that is Swan Lake's Queen's is a fitting metaphor for Nina Sayers conflicting personality.<br/><br/>It is a schism that runs although this film, suffering for its art. It is not a pleasant experience to have to witness this transformation, it is a fitting example of a world of dedication, such as the training and sacrifice in which this world of ballerinas' must partake, to become more than the best, more than excellent, to be pure perfection."

","Very good movie. I went to go watch it with my mom and we really enjoyed it. I would say that this movie is a Dark Drama/Thriller, because there were moments that made me cringe and freaked me out. The storyline and acting was great. This movie has to take an award. I don't think, however, this movie is for everyone. A lot of people at the theater box were surprisingly young and walked out saying things like, ""What the hell was that?"" The movie is very serious, so if you're looking for a chick flick or a comedy, don't bother. One needs to appreciate and understand the beauty behind the story being told in the movie. Even though I myself am young, I don't think that other people my age could really handle it. You have to be open minded and expect the unexpected: the twists in a movie that at first make you say ""huh?"" and ""what?"" and at the end ""Ohhhhh!!!!!!!!!!"" or ""Wow!!!"" Because this movie is so dark and depressing, I probably can't watch it more than one or two times. Nonetheless, it's excellent and deserves to win at least a few Oscars! This is the story of how wanting to be the best could actually bring out the worst. But can it be that one who brings out the worst can actually end up being the best?"

","This movie offers a spectrum of different emotions: on the one hand there's a really creepy nightmareish tension building up and on the other hand there's the beautiful fairytale like world of ballet and of course the oppressed sexuality unraveling from Nina. Whilst it does include a lot of horror movie clichés, such as the doppelganger, the mutation, and the changing reflection in the mirror it does feature a lot of very original stuff. The movie is captivating and keeps you trapped in a slightly surreal undertow. Natalie Portmans performance is simply amazing. All in all maybe not revolutionary, but definitely entertaining and touching."

I was wrong, the movie was amazing, so dark, so interesting. Natalie Portman is a fantastic actress. Mila Kunis was also a spectacular, supporting actress. Every scene was shocking. I may say a few parts of this movie disturbed me. When Natalie was in her room and her legs broke back in the opposite position made me cringe. also when an the women chased after her with her bloody face. it was very good. i went to see it three times. No movie will ever be like this for a very long time i can tell you that much."
"blackledgec","10","0","3","21 January 2011"," Big Wow
","Watched this film last night after a bit of a debate with myself about the ballet aspect of the film, as I'm not a big fan of ballet. However I have to say, that aspect of the film is actually a very nice backdrop to this story. I guess ballet in the real world would require a lot of mental energy, so straight away the film has a believable quality about it. Top that with incredible acting, you're cooking up a great film already. <br/><br/>The obvious stand out star of this film is Portman. I think her dedication to this role is unprecedented. She looks unhealthily thin and looks like a typical ballerina from New York (I guess). Then there's the dancing itself, which also (as a non-expert) looks very believable. I can only imagine the amount of hours she put into training for this role.<br/><br/>However the stand out stuff for me was her evil stuff. The stuff she sees in the mirror is pretty scary. She pulls it off and it contrasts her timid white swan side brilliantly. I can see movie directors wanting her to play bad girls at a future date. This is her best acting recorded so far. <br/><br/>The actual film itself to me at least, reminded me of a few other films such as Eyes Wide Shut and Vanilla Sky. Eyes Wide Shut for the arrangement and Vanilla Sky for it's twisted movements. Doesn't sound too logical but like I say, it's what sprung to my mind personally after watching it.<br/><br/>I think if Cubrick could've directed this, I don't think it would have been that different. So that is my compliment to the director. An outstanding piece of cinematography."

","Black swan is an intense psycho sexual thriller! One of the most beautiful movies ever made. Yes its about ballet but you don't have to like ballet to think this movie is awesome. The main plot is about a girl who is competing to become the best dancer so she can be swan queen in the upcoming production; that alone sounds extremely boring. What makes this movie intense and capturing is the subplot! It will Blow your mind! The viewer is never told much about the main character or her mental state but i feel that is one of the beauties of this movie. Director Darren Aronofsky always finds a way of implying the story with what happens in the film itself instead of explaining it in the film with words. This is great and shows extreme skill in the art of directing.<br/><br/>The music... classical, vibrant, linked to the visuals perfectly in every instance. Without it the emotion and glory of the insanity that the orchestra was unfolding, the movie would be lost. Composer Clint Mansell outdid himself because without his mastery black swan would not be the brilliant success that it has become.<br/><br/>The movies theme was about perfection and becoming imperfect to achieve this perfection. Complex yes, but totally understood at the end. There is extreme sexual tension between all the characters! This grabs the audience instantly because everyone anywhere can relate to it.<br/><br/>Light, Darkness, Good and Evil combine and become important to the films outlook. Every time a character was doing something impure everything became more attractive but more evil, filling the screen with different ranges of dark composition. Truly beautiful! If you think Ballet is boring now you won't after seeing this. Watch this movie! It will make you think! If you like art this movie is full of it; between all the movements of the dance physically between the lights and darks of the other characters. This movie is a masterpiece!"

","This extraordinary masterpiece had me captivated from the first minute right through to the end of the film. Now for all of you just expecting to see a light hearted ballerina flick then you are very wrong. I hav'nt seen Natalie Portman act as good as this ever, although she was brilliant in Leon and V For Vendetta. Mila Kunis has also shown first rate acting and Vincent Cassell was brilliant too as the strict ballerina teacher. Darren Aronofsky is becoming one of my favourite directors of all time, he hasn't made a bad film yet.<br/><br/>Maybe people might of heard that this film starts off really slow but trust me its not. The film is just setting itself up and introducing characters and mood. Expect to be shocked by startling scenes with extreme originality and surreal undertones. Certain parts of this film even gave me sweaty palms, its that intense. This film will leave traces of itself in my mind for many years to come and would consider it to be one of the greatest films of the past 10 years.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman deserves every award thats coming to her and the film should definitely have a run in for best film and best director.

","She Literally Becomes the Black Swan, in the Mental Sense<br/><br/>The movie The Black Swan is about a woman who would probably be admitted to a pysc – ward with round the clock watch, with a sign on the door that reads – ""Clinically Insane/ with hint of excessive obsession behaviour"". She is a ballerina, mentally fragile to begin with, and then receives the lead in Swan Lake and becomes completely crazy.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Natalie Portman's character Nina, and her declining mental state. She has always been devoted to ballet but this becomes an obsession that affects her health, as she strives to follow her director's advice and dance with abandon and life.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is absolutely amazing in her role as Nina and plays a really good CG (Crazy Girl)<br/><br/>She is happy/sad/up/down/high/innocent/drunk/prudish/beautiful/menacing in her role; it is clear and obvious why she is nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>The cinematography portion of this movie is exceptional, from every close cut camera angle to the same dance routine thirty times and especially to the gritty rave scene. There the music pounds louder and louder, as Nina tries to free herself by matching the free-spirit nature of the new dancer Lily. The rest of the time however when not the club scene or the music of the Swan Lake, the score made the movie closer to a horror movie. The second that deep violin music started playing you knew s**t was going to go down.<br/><br/>The movie for acting, directing, and cinematic view was amazing and near perfect but where the movie started to lack was the screenplay. It lacked in the caring department; there were no stakes or reasons for us to care about the character. Sure she was a dancer who got a good role, and had a weird mother – but that doesn't affect me or the world. CG can be crazy for all I care.<br/><br/>The movie also at some points had pretty strong connections to soft-core P***. Not saying it shouldn't have been included but some things can be implied.<br/><br/>Overall though, The Black Swan is a great film without a good story and really is a whole lot of nothing by the end.<br/><br/>See More at www.sabretoothmovies.blogspot.com"

","I saw Black Swan in an advance screening on Tuesday at the Cineworld in West India Quay.<br/><br/>I must say that when the credits were rolling, a lot of people in the cinema (myself included) had the same expression on our faces that said the same thing: ""What just happened""? I watched Requiem For a Dream a couple of years back and I very clearly remember how disturbed and visibly shaken I was when it finished. I must say this at the very beginning, I wasn't as perturbed by Black Swan as I was with Requiem For a Dream. I thought the movie was very well directed. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is extremely adept at making the audience gasp and flinch in all of the graphic scenes in the movie. The audience feels the pain of the ballerina. A very exhausting watch. Not a movie you should go to for a relaxing watch after a hard day's work. I planned on going for this movie again when it released with a couple of friends but I don't think I'd be able to put myself through it again. Maybe in a couple of months time when the DVD is out I will watch it again."
"kaliyuag8","8","0","2","17 January 2011"," Just a simple character analysis
","1. Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers: Well, let's be honest, she's crazy. It may be due to her almost crazier mother who controls every aspect of her life, but I don't think anybody can be blamed for that much craziness except the person who is actually that crazy. Also, however, she is a magnificent ballerina. I'm no movie critic or dance professional, but I'm pretty sure that as Thomas says, she is brilliantly technical, even if she lacks the drive to get lost in her role. After discussing her with a friend I have to agree with my friend and say that the hallucinations and explicit and graphic delusions of grandeur point to a severe case of Dissociative Identity Disorder. I'm not an expert in anything I've said about Nina Sayers, but then again, I don't think anybody has to be to make this type of guess. A simple Psychology class that most of us take in high school. I think I'm only writing this much about Natalie Portman's character because the girl is talented. This role can't have been an easy one.<br/><br/>2. Mila Kunis as Lily: As an English major, I have to point something out after looking up character names: Mila Kunis' character does not have a last name. Some may see this as completely insignificant. After all, plenty of characters go through movies without their last name being mentioned. But think about it; are those characters important in their respective movies? Let's think to ""The Social Network"" and its characters. So many characters are mentioned by both first name and last, including the twins who are referred to through most of the movie by only their last names. But then there's the CFO's girlfriend. ""Christy"" Uumm...Christy ______. Exactly, because she doesn't make an important contribution to the movie. Yes, she has a decent amount of screen time, but honestly, no last name means you are either fictional or insignificant. However, Mila Kunis' character is anything but insignificant. If anything she's clearly the most significant character after Natalie Portman's. Almost every action of her's incurs an equal, if not distorted, reaction from Portman. There's a whole lot to say about 'Lily,' and I just wasted a lot of your time trying to call attention to some non-character related details. I'll end this real quick with this: Is Lily real or Nina Sayers' Tyler Durden?<br/><br/>3. Barbara Hershey as Erica Sayers: Overprotective is an understatement. So is overbearing, over-caring, over-everything really. Erica Sayers makes me glad that my mom used to give me a curfew. As I write this I'm trying not to think of how much I dislike this character. She's weak and yet controlling, but at the same time, devoted to her daughter's success. It's a bit over the top though. She's the mom that's putting the pressures of her own failures onto her daughter. Just the overlying question: WHY? That's really all I have to say about this character. I'm trying to not be biased here, but honestly, there's not much to say about a character that I see as simple. Sure, she's developed pretty well in the story, but it's a simple development. She's angry, controlling, and an overall failure.<br/><br/>4. Winona Ryder as Beth MacIntyr: Ryder didn't get herself a lot of screen time in this film, but she still had a huge enough impact to get herself a last name, unlike Mila Kunis. Every moment Winona Ryder is on screen is significant. When we first see her, she's aspiring to reprise her role in the ballet only to have it stolen by a suddenly aggressive Nina (that bitch). Beth becomes more and more interesting though. The drunken rage at the announcement party, the crippling car accident (which, while never said has ended her ballet career), the hospital encounter with Nina, and the ""appearance"" in Nina's bathroom. There are so many things about to say about Beth. I don't even know where to start. She's just really quite amazing. I don't know Ryder's acting history, but I'm guessing that this role is reminiscent of her best days. Her character is quickly developed, almost rushed, but I feel that I understand her a lot more than I understand the obsessiveness of Hershey's character. Ryder begins the movie in a moment of complete failure. She deals with it horribly. She goes on to haunt the ballerina that took her role. It's brilliant. Unintentional, but absolutely brilliant. I really want to write more about Ryder's character, but I don't feel like words can express how excellently she portrayed a completely damaged character.<br/><br/>5. Vincent Cassel as Thomas Leroy: This is a character that stumped me for a bit. Genius? Absolutely. Douche? Also, absolutely. Why is this guy in charge of these women? Oh, that's right: Genius. He's straight, manipulative, and again: Genius. You must be tired of that word already, but let's be honest, Thomas Leroy is Genius. At some points he needs to stop being so Genius, but then he keeps on being Genius. I think this might be another character I have a bias for. I'm not sure if it's a positive or negative bias, but he's definitely interesting. I was on Natalie Portman's side for the movie, so of course him so strongly criticizing her 'technically' perfect dances seemed like an outrageous person to be in charge. But I started switching sides when he seduced her. This straight, male ballet instructor - no, master - seduced a straight, female ballerina who is seemingly the epitome of innocence. That stuff takes some Genius. Oh, but also, what's with the ""Little Princess"" stuff? He's a fickle, manipulative, Genius. <br/><br/>The rest of the speaking characters have no last names. Not only that, but when looking up the information, I found out that I couldn't even confirm all of their names because they were not audibly mentioned in the film."

","If you are interested in seeing the underworld of ballet theater, Black Swan is the picture for you! It shows the raw exposed guts of ballet dancers who are determined to be the top dog in their world. The story is simple and very sad. Nina, the ballerina has made ballet her life's work. She lives and breathes ballet everyday by practicing endless hours to capture the golden ring of being the company's top ballerina. All the girls within the Ballet company compete with each other for the attention of the director though impressionistic dance and yes...sexual favors, but Nina believes that only hard work and determination can only get her what she wants. <br/><br/>Suddenly to her delight, she is picked to be the lead ballerina in Swan Lake. But darker roads are ahead. Nina does not foresee the challenge of playing a duel role as a good/bad girl. She is so much a perfectionist and a girl of high morals, it adds pressure. More and more pressure added are the endless demands of pleasing her director. and Nina'a over bearing mother, who always drives the nail of guilt that she had to give up her career to raise Nina. We never see Nina's father so we can assume he left the family. Then, we meet Lily, a new dancer who like the Black Swan is a highly erotic character who charms everyone with her free spirit. Nina, who has been in the pressure cooker trying to a perfect dancer always feels threatened to the point of paranoia gets pushed over the edge.<br/><br/>What impressed me about Black Swan is that it is a sad movie. I felt sorry for Nina because she was always driven to be perfect because I felt she was starving for acceptance. Her mother never gave it to her because her mother resented her for giving up her career. The Director of the company, whom Nina seem to have some repressed sexual feelings always asked more and more of her talent but treated her like she was a disgusting outcast when she couldn't live up to his demands. <br/><br/>Natilie Portman finely impressed me with her acting ability. In the past Natalie played a lot of ""comic book"" roles like V for Vendetta and Padma from Star Wars. The only past role that she played well under was Anne Bolelyn from ""The Other Bolelyn Girl"". Here, the character of Nina is a very meaty acting role that she handled with expertise of a acting diva. Good Luck with the Oscars, Ms Portman you got a TERRIFIC running to snatch the Best Actress!<br/><br/>I highly recommend the Black Swan to see. The downsized is that you must be prepared for some shocking skin peeling/transformation/ and graphic sexual scenes. Not for the faint hearted"
"santanu-sinha","10","0","2","15 January 2011"," A masterpiece
","A perfectionist ballerina Nina Sayers (played by the delicate Natalie Portman) gets the role all ballerinas crave all their lives, the lead role in Swan Lake. We follow her into her coming of age, to break the repressive boundaries, that she has been confined in all her life, to transcend herself to another plane.<br/><br/>Just like ""The Wrestler"" (another masterpiece by the great Darren Aronofsky) this is an emotional roller-coaster ride. Framed as a sort of dark psychological thriller, the movie, like it's lead, transcends the boundaries of genres towards the end to become the best movie I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is Nina Sayers. I mean, she ""is"" Nina Sayers. She is the alpha and the omega of the movie. Remember Mickey Rourke from The Wrestler? This movie is about Natalie Portman. She gives, what can only be described as, the acting performance of the year. However, make no mistake, the supporting cast are very good and make convincing cases for the roles they play.<br/><br/>I could not but save a separate line to mention the background score. Mostly derived from the Swan Lake, the music really gets you into the mood. The movie would not be what it is but for the haunting music.<br/><br/>On the technical side, cinematography is very good, and in tone with the dark theme of the movie.<br/><br/>In short, go get a ticket and see the movie in a theater. This is Hollywood at it's best."
"samlane86","8","0","2","15 January 2011"," The Black Swan
","The uninitiated might find it odd for ""ballet"" and ""psychological thriller"" to describe the same film. I did when I first heard of The Black Swan, though the idea intrigued me. Much of the intrigue was due to the film's director, Darren Aronofsky director of Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, and The Wrestler. With a basic knowledge of the competitive nature of ballet, these descriptors make more sense. After watching The Red Shoes recently, I was even more interested in seeing The Black Swan. I wanted to see how the two films compare.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a dancer hoping to be awarded the lead role in a new production of Swan Lake. The director of the production, Thomas Leroy (played by Vincent Cassel), knows she has the precision needed to portray the white swan, but he unsure if she can let go and lose herself in the sensuality required for the evil twin, the black swan. Mila Kunis plays Lily, a new dancer in the company, who possesses all the qualities needed for the black swan. As the film progresses, the pressure on Nina increasingly builds. She is obsessed with dancing both parts perfectly and fears being replaced.<br/><br/>Lily is everything Nina isn't: free spirited and sexual. She is the only dancer not obsessed with perfection and procuring all the lead roles. When Thomas comments on how effortlessly she dances, one can sense Nina's envy. She has practiced for years striving to perfect every step, every move.<br/><br/>Thomas never holds back his criticism, even when it brings his dancers to tears. He plays them against each other. He will stop at nothing to get the performance he wants. He even uses sexual advances to get them in to the state of mind he feels is needed.<br/><br/>Nina still lives with her mother. She sleeps in the same room she likely slept in as a child. It is still decorated with pink, frilled blankets and stuffed animals. Her relationship with her mother, Erica (played by Barbara Hershey), would make even Oedipus worry. Erica is both overly familiar and controlling. She was once a dancer herself and is set on fulfilling her dreams through her daughter.<br/><br/>Ballet is an art that can be life consuming, physically taxing, and, in Nina's case, mentally detrimental. The more obsessed she gets with dancing perfectly as the black swan, the more she loses her mind. She get's paranoid. She has nightmares and hallucinations and can't differentiate between these and reality. No matter what happens, she is never satisfied. When she thinks she didn't get the lead role, she cries at the rejection. When she wins the role, she still cries because of the pressure. She is insecure, always hiding her nervous habits of biting her nails and scratching.<br/><br/>I admire Aronofsky mainly for his reputation. Of his films, all I've seen is The Black Swan and The Fountain. I have yet to watch Pi and Requiem for a Dream, his supposed best work. But, he has impressed me so far. His subject matter is always interesting and unique and he directed The Black Swan expertly. The story parallels aspects of Swan Lake wonderfully. It was skillfully photographed and its effects, especially those involving hallucinations, are quite stunning. And as Nina's mental state deteriorates, he causes the audience to feel just as confused as she is. Was this real? Was that a hallucination? Aronofsky doesn't let on until the very end.<br/><br/>The Black Swan's performances are all top notch. Portman handles the difficulties of her role extremely well including doing most of her own dancing. Kunis is an actress I've enjoyed since first seeing her in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (That's right. I've never seen That70s Show). It's nice she is getting more substantial, dramatic roles.<br/><br/>I don't think comparisons to The Red Shoes are entirely fair. While they are similarly themed films, they take much different approaches. The Black Swan revels in the darkness that The Red Shoes only hinted at comparatively. However, since I've watched both films so recently, comparisons were inevitable. Had I not seen The Red Shoes, I'm not sure I would have appreciated the dancing in The Black Swan. At the same time it left me expecting more. I suspect I'll gain a greater appreciation for The Black Swan when I watch it again and separate it from my thoughts of The Red Shoes."

","BLACK SWAN Nina is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company who lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother. The company will begin it's new season with Swan Lake, a ballet which requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan which represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily, her competition is the personification of the Black Swan. As Nina attempts to fill both roles she begins to get more in touch with her dark side and assume the persona of each.<br/><br/>The film keeps you thinking throughout. The harsh reality of the extreme physical nature of professional dancing is well presented and Black Swan dips into the emotional nightmare it can become. Despite this aspect of the film it never begs sympathy of the audience but the dancers merely go about their business of pushing the body to it's limits. Whilst this is not specifically a dance film, and is not an adaptation of Swan Lake, there are enough truly graceful scenes to be enjoyed by those who appreciate the artform.<br/><br/>The cast are for the most part faultless, Natalie Portman is vulnerable when she is required to be and demonic when called upon, Barbara Hershey is quite brilliant as the overbearing and rather quite scary mother whilst Mila Kunis is pleasantly surprising in her role. So well did she fit into the role of Lila that at no point in the film did i think of Meg Griffin. There are some brief moments which could be considered of the horror/genre but the film never really edges into that arena. Instead the first half of the film is spent on character and plot development, we are drawn quite far into the film before things begin to take a turn. This i felt showed patience on the part of the director and a trust that the audience would stay with it. Despite such a long build up the film does not drag for a combination of plot, events and dance keep you interested and involved.<br/><br/>Black Swan is a compelling film, it needs thought and attention, unsurprisingly it is not for everyone. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Art. Perhaps the sole thing that keeps society rational.<br/><br/>Every day, usually without us realizing, creativity plays a consequential role in our existence. From formulating mathematics to preparing dinner, we must craft different forms of art in order to live. For many, however, art is taken a step further; used to mask insecurity. People devote themselves to their craft, striving to fill a hollow void in their hearts with the insurmountable satisfaction of perfection. These people – Painters, Writers, Architects – Suffer from progressively abraded heartbreak that has been concocted through personal trauma. Subsequently, these tortured souls try to alleviate the pain with artistic fulfillment. Like the typical craftsperson, they won't settle for the orthodox means achievement in their chosen discipline - Stopping at nothing until crossing into the utter and unadulterated realm of perfection. Throughout this journey, bones, bias and bonds are crushed, until the soul is peeled down to its most primitive state, vulnerable to the ghastly poison which lies deep within all of us, only striking when we are at our most weak; madness. Alas, only when this foul sensation grasps us tight in its ineluctable palm of torment and derangement, do we realize that our obsession was the thing that prevented us from reaching perfection in the first place; since, in reality, we were already perfect.<br/><br/>In Darren Aronofsky's slick and seductive melodrama, 'Black Swan', Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) experiences this exact crisis. Clouded by the overprotectiveness of her Mother (Babara Hershey) and the pressures of being a professional ballerina, Nina crumbles as she is thrust into an existential odyssey of sex, murder and art when she takes on the lead role in Swan Lake and finds herself literally caught between the delicate White Swan, and her diabolical sister, the Black Swan, obsessing over artistic perfection under the wing of both. Along for ride is the enigmatic ballet director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), and Nina's promiscuous understudy, Lily (Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>This is a brazen film; a sheerly theatrical spectacle of gorgeous visuals, delightfully outlandish performances and the occasional stint of psychedelia, with a beautiful allegory which delves deep into the abstruse and at times horrifying depths of artistry and passion that elevates it to the ranks of masterful. Although, a spellbinding performance from Natalie Portman is what beats at the heart of this story – A mere glint of aberration in her eyes was enough to light up the screen, let alone the raw emotion of some of her more dramatic scenes like the astounding confrontations between her and the also impressive Babara Hershey, her ecstasy fuelled sexual voyage with the ridiculously seductive Mila Kunis, and the breathtaking finale in which Nina's epiphany crests in one of the most powerful sequences of the year.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I'm delighted with Aronofsky's development as a filmmaker. He has officially cemented himself as one of the best contemporary auteurs with his unprecedented ability to interpret, mold, and above all, understand characters. He lets Nina's journey unfold in the most delicate of ways, letting the pictorial devices of the scenery and the ambiance of the brilliant score tell her story on an aesthetic scale, which ultimately works in impeccable harmony with Portman's personification. He, too, utilizes his natural cognition of art and its perplexity to give the narrative a decisively intimate feel from deep in his own complex, maybe also confound creative heart. As the final frames glitter upon screen, and Nina takes her climatic leap of faith, landing on the mattress with the sore realization that she was, in fact, perfect before she was consumed by the pursuit of immaculence – Through the haunting line ""I was perfect"" – The filmmaking makes you almost feel the tears of emotion streaming down Aronofsky's face as he, himself, beholds his character complete her final arc.<br/><br/>In short, it's all incredibly good cinema.<br/><br/>~~"

","Black Swan is the hilarious movie, there is something you should not expected from watching this movie. Before I watched it, I get news from a friend that one of best composer in Indonesia had watched this movie and appreciate it especially from music composing perspective. I agree with him.<br/><br/>I wonder will this movie be a candidate in Academy Award 2011? I hope so, because Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis is played well here (especially the scene when Natalie act masturbation ^_^).<br/><br/>When you see this movie you would not expect that is under your expectation."

","This film is about a ballerina who takes on a role in Swan Lake. She transform from an innocent and perfectionist woman to an evil and self destructive woman.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's films are usually not easy to digest, so I find ""Black Swan"" surprisingly easy to understand. It details Nina's path of transformation as she prepares for her role that requires her to perform out of her character. The imagery and paranoia are very well done; it may be weird and disturbing at times, but compared to Aronofsky's previous work, it is already very mainstream. It successfully portraying Nina's mind as fragile and unstable. The film is captivating, engrossing and manages to keep me interested throughout. Natalie Portman's Oscar buzz is well deserved, and the performance of Mila Kunis is also worth mentioning. In short, ""Black Swan"" is an exotic look at unintentional self transformation. You either get it and like it, or you don't."

","Go to www.thewildbore.com for this and more reviews<br/><br/>Probably like many of you out there, I walked into this film not really knowing if I was going to like it. I love Aronofsky, even The Fountain which a lot of people hated I still hold in high esteem. His brave filmmaking defies convention, pushes boundaries and he always gets top performances from his cast. However, the trailer is somewhat misleading. Is it a thriller? A drama? Even a horror? But then, all these genres have filled his works in the past (apart from The Wrestler), it's hard to label it, which is all part of the magic. Even the Russian-inspired posters look amazing and will grace many a wall in the future of young trendies I'm sure. But the main point of issue however was really the fact it was about ballet and to be matter-of-fact about it, I know sweet FA about ballet. Fortunately, it doesn't matter and I have never been so enthralled by a film of this nature.<br/><br/>To put it simply, the story focuses on young Natalie Portman as Nina, a ballet dancer who is trying her hardest to win the Swan Queen part in a new vision of Swan Lake but she just cannot exhibit the passion of the Black Swan. Her slow, torturous journey into the dark realms of her psyche uncover more than just passion and soon we start to question reality as we travel alongside her.<br/><br/>Aronofsky does his typical European 70's 'amateur' 16mm style film- making that uses a lot of handicam, jump cuts, shaky, 'realistic' shots that make us feel like we are part of the action, that we are part of Portman's character, an extension of her consciousness. She is so innocent, so child-like that the idea that she has to play a dark, seductive monster through movement of her body alone seems unrealistic but Vincent Cassel as Thomas believes in her, he sees something, a darkness she keeps hidden. Like pretty much all of Aronofsky's work, the human body is an important factor in his films, whether it's sexual, violent, or through expression - everything counts, and in Black Swan, it's here in spades.<br/><br/>Portman plays rather an understated, muted yet remarkable performance as Nina gets to grip with her role. There's so much going on here, said in so little, that it's hard to express unless you've seen it. We all know that ballet dancers are known for having eating disorders, putting their body through unbearable pain, often resulting in a child-like appearance and Portman, at her thinnest and youngest, is going through all this to be perfect. She's an obsessive compulsive which doesn't help either and her child-like appearance is often reflected in her demeanour. She doesn't like talking about sex, she has an overbearing mother, no friends, works too hard and has a melancholiness that is hard to relate through words. We know she has a history of self-abuse and that her mother (who is creepy to say the least) is living her dancing dream through her daughter, that the other girls don't really like her but what is truly frightening is that by opening the pandora's box of restrained emotions, it's making her go insane. This isn't really a drama, it's a psychological horror that I think will make a lot of cinema-goers uncomfortable and shock them, but in a positive way.<br/><br/>Nina is taking over from Winona Ryder in the main Swan Lake part, but it's a position Ryder's character is somewhat reluctant to leave. As a result of this, Cassell tells us that by being self-destructive, by being that passionate, is what perfection is about, it is what makes Ryder's character such a joy to watch, and he constantly drives the point home in that she must lose control to really give a great performance, that you can spend all your time learning the moves but without that soul, it's meaningless. However, she is trying her best to stay in control of losing control because her world is crumbling around her, she is literally being corrupted in front of our very eyes.<br/><br/>Throughout all this, she feels pressure that Mila Kunis' character Lily is ready to jump into her shoes at any minute. She knows that Lily's care-free, easy, passionate attitude is something Cassell wants in the Black Swan performance, and in fact Lily soon becomes a representation of the dark side of Nina, and it's this dark side that is so tempting ...<br/><br/>More on www.thewildbore.com"
"m_filice87","10","0","3","29 December 2010"," If filmmakers know what they're doing, they understand that SUBTLETY is everything
","If the audience is observant enough, and if the filmmaker masters every moment available in front of the camera (mis en scene, dialogue, etc.) then the cinematic experience will be far more than enjoyable. This review is more like an analysis; more like tips on how you might interpret viewing this film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's role as Nina is flawless if she set out to convey an innocent, naive, yet spiritually distraught female who puts her work before her well-being. But more than her work is her love for her mother: like a defeated puppy who upsets the master, Nina squints every time she feels an urge to be herself. If this is what Aronofsky wanted of Portman, then hand her the Oscar. We see a broken woman in front of a mirror, reflected in different angles, portraying a divided human being. The camera follows Nina behind her, viewing nothing but the back of her head and maybe a foot or two beside her, and far into the distance in front of her in a blur. What does this mean? That we are following a woman who wishes to see nothing around her (why? I took it as because she was fearful of her surrounding). She sees her own face on the bodies of other women, fearing that her own worst enemy is staring her down, waiting for her to fail. This leads to paranoia, and inevitably insanity. Like I said before, if all of this was meant as such, then Portman and Aronofsky did a beautiful job. So when the end came it is no wonder one is drowned in a flood of emotions. Sympathy turns to compassion, turns to despair, turns to relief.<br/><br/>Since the story is told especially through Nina's eyes, all the characters in the film merely reflect her psyche. They do not have their own personal lives because however they come into the film is just a reflection of how Nina feels about them, and therefore herself. I have nothing to complain about the performances. I even have to congratulate them for being exactly what the film needed them to be. Especially the mother, who (as it seemed to me anyway) hid beneath her a painful interior of regret seeking redemption, but doing it in all the wrong ways through suppressing her daughter's potential not as a dancer, but as a woman, and thus a human being. <br/><br/>The score leads the audience into the territory where the film wants you in. In one instant you will be enjoying the beauty of ballet, and the next will be concerned whether what you just heard was real, and therefore are experiencing exactly what Nina is. For me, music is a guide, a leader to follow. The better hold music has on you, the more deeper into its atmosphere you'll find yourself in-- whether pleasurable or terrifying. Clint Mansell accomplishes both.<br/><br/>All in all, one needs to ask, What does a movie need to do for it to accomplish 10/10? Pessimists will say that nothing deserves a perfect score; so in their view their favourite viewing experiences deserve 9/10. So what about that tenth star? Does it exist merely as the impossible carrot to chase? No, that tenth is there to congratulate the whole film cast for making such a cinematic experience that it doesn't set itself as a great movie, but it reflects the necessity of which is in everyone-- that being, Let go and Give in to your darker nature."

","black swan to me, out of every single movie i have seen this year, is the best movie of 2010. i was very impressed with Mila Kunis and her acting since she went from ""thats 70's show"", and ""family guy"" to a beautiful nightmare called ""black swan"". i have not seen Darren Aronofsky's other works, but now i am very interested in seeing all of his works since this movie really got me into his directing. i'd have to say, out of all the movies i have seen, the makeup and wardrobe was brilliant and beautiful, the scene when Natalie Portman was dancing the black swan and her big, beautiful black wings began to grow. this scene was breathtaking. the end was great, when it was the climax of the swan lake production, and she realized that she stabbed herself, and then the movie ended. the disturbing content and sexuality in this movie is intense. and without those two key elements, black swan would be nothing. this is a great movie, go see it when you have the chance. i'll be looking for out next year on blu-ray & DVD."
"thesar-2","8","0","4","24 December 2010"," All About Ms. Swan
","Yep, everyone's talking all about Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers in 2010's Black Swan. For that, I will put three of my two cents in: <br/><br/>1. She was, in fact, very good and will be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. 2. But, as good as she was, one of my votes goes to Kunis as Lily. 3. And my other vote goes to Annette Bening for The Kids Are All Right. Sorry, little miss Princess Padmé.<br/><br/>But, what about the movie? Did you like the Bette Davis classic All About Eve?<br/><br/>Okay, it's not exactly like that, or I might be spoiling too much, but it fits the same lines. In this case, we have ballerinas who prove it's NOT easy being black. (Uh, that's a reference to the Swanin case you were thinking of calling me a racist.)<br/><br/>We have two aging dancers, the disturbed mom, Erica (Hershey), of Nina and the recipient of the Drama Queen award: Beth (Ryder). And we have two dueling and somewhat ""friendly"" up'n'comers Lily and Nina. Fine, Lily's not so up'n'coming, but she's certainly coming at times. Bad. Sorry. This is a SERIOUS review of a SERIOUS movie.<br/><br/>I digress. Nina wants the role-of-the-present, the Swan Queen, playing dual roles of the good white swan and her evil twin, the darkie. Oops. Sorry. Anyways, she has to fight tooth and nail – mostly teeth, which has bite – to get it. Is she really ready? Will director Thomas (Cassel) let her have it or will he prepare her to be perfect?<br/><br/>Nina has multiple issues on her own, SEE: not just disturbed but delusional mommy, but when Meg (Kunis) from Family Guy shows upall hell breaks down for Nina. No wonder no one likes Meg.<br/><br/>The question arises if Nina will make it to the final act and will her bloody aliments (or peers) stand in her way.<br/><br/>Overall, I did like the look and feel of the movie. The score's pretty good and the acting is near perfect. And it's gruesome at times – yeah, I had to look away, even though it wasn't the grossest scenes I've witnessed. But there are really only two reasons to see this: the magnificent performance by Kunis and the very good job from Portman, especially in the last third – that was Portman at her best.<br/><br/>Oh, okay, if you're a horny dude, you'll add a third reason: the sex scene between both those ladies. Blah, blah, did nothing for me, but if you into that sorta lesbo scene – it's really hot and heavy.for less than a minute."

"judywalker2","8","0","4","22 December 2010"," Beautiful, Mesmerizing but weak ending
","The Black Swan is a beautiful movie. Natalie Portman is Oscar worthy for her performance. She definitely looked and acted the part of a ballerina with great technical skills but no personal confidence. Barbra Hershey is also great as her overbearing mother. Mila Kunis is good as the supposed nemesis. The movie itself is mesmerizing. You can't take your eyes off the screen because you can't believe what's happening and you can't wait to see what's happening next. The movie only has one problem. You wait and you wait and then you see Natalie's great performance as the Black Swan. Then you get to the end and you're disappointed. For me the movie should have stopped with the Black Swan's performance, there was no need to go further. The movie is perfect up and through that point and then the bubble burst and you're left wondering what happened."
"Beginthebeguine","Null","0","3","22 December 2010"," Kafkaesque Swan menaces
","Something dark is lurking in the shadows and between the floor boards of Darren Aronofsky's physiological thriller the ""Black Swan"". We on one level watch a metamorphosis as Lily a young Ballet Dancer replaces Beth as the prima ballerina of an unnamed NYC Company at Lincoln Center. We are hinted to the madness of Beth as she smashes her dressing room (presumably after she is given the news of her replacement) and we must wonder if this action mirrors what we are about to witness our lead actress go through. Just what is real and what is in Lily's mind is hard to fathom because on another level the film is haunted by doppelgängers. The ending is inconclusive, and rightfully so, you will have to decide just where this film has taken you. A great conversation film.<br/><br/>The real praise goes out to the director, Mr. Aronofsky, whose choices are the real strength of the picture. An uncanny representation of light and color--even in the drab wastelands of the NYC Subway system--frame this work and give credence to its themes. Natalie Portman(Nina), Mila Kunis (Lily), Barbara Hershey (Erica) and Winona Ryder (Beth ) all give fine performances and stretch their acting chops to the limits. It is Portman's film though and she returns to the darker matter that started her career. Is it Oscar worthy ? I suppose that will depend of how much money the producres are willing to spend for it. Regardless of the Oscar or any of the 26 or so awards it has already received-- it is a film to see. Other kudos go to Set design, Lighting and Music. Let us not forget the producers and writers who took the long road that brought this film to a rather drab dramatic time in film history. Kudos--kudos-kudos all around."
"collinbentley","7","0","3","21 December 2010"," Perfect execution of a less-than-perfect script
","I'll use bullet points for those of you who (like me) want to cut to the chase:<br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/>-Great casting and acting by everyone involved (specifically Ms. Portman); <br/><br/>-Excellent cinematography; <br/><br/>-Great score that really matched the mood of what was happening on screen; <br/><br/>-Good CG where applicable;<br/><br/>-Two attractive women ""getting it on.""<br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/>-The story. <br/><br/>In my opinion the story was a poor knockoff of Fight Club geared toward females and without the insightful character narrative. I am by no means an exceptionally perceptive gent so if I figure out within the first 15 minutes of the movie that it's all in her head - something is wrong. <br/><br/>Even being from NYC I had no interest in the ""ballet world"" or any of it's nuances depicted in the movie; it was all just very boring. It worked in fight club because what they were doing was interesting and new."
